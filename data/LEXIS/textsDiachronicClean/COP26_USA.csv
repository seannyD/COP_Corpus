"COP26","USA","COP26_USA1","COP26 - IMPACT ON JUSTICE SYSTEM: SUMMARY REPORT","April 28, 2022 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Scottish Government:Overview The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow between 31 October and 12 November 2021.This short report investigates the result that the conference had on Scotland's justice system as a whole.COP26 resulted in[1]:over 40,000 visitors to the city128 world leaders25-day policing operationover 10,000 police officers deployed on some daysCOP26 on the Scottish justice systemIn addition to the unprecetended scale of the policing operation, there was significant planning across other areas of the justice system to deal with the extra business that an event of this scale could potentially produce.Across Scotland, summary trials in the Sheriff and Justice of the Peace courts did not take place from 25 October to 12 November, as a result of police officers not being available for witness duty. In addition, Sheriff and Jury trials did not take place for a two-week period from 1 November to 12 November. High court trials continued as usual but business was temporarily moved from Glasgow to other locations in Scotland.In anticipation of additional need:extra custody courts were provided across the country, including weekend courts in key locationsthe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) provided extra resources for the marking of casesIn total there were 97 COP26 related arrests made by the police over the course of the conference[2].As of 22 March 2022, 46 of those arrested had been reported to COPFS, twelve of those were reported from custody[3].Of the 46 people reported to COPFS[4]:28 had no further action taken2 were issued with a fiscal fine6 were marked for summary proceedings2 are awaiting markingOf the 14 people who were to be proceeded against in court[5]:one was not convictedone was fined one was given a custodial sentencethe remaining 11 cases are ongoingConclusionAs shown above there were 97 arrests and 46 reports to COPFS resulting from COP26. This is much lower than might have been expected, given the potential for unrest an event of the scale and nature of COP26 presented. The potential for a substantial increase in business was recognised by justice organisations across Scotland and significant effort was made to prepare for and minimise the impact of COP26 across the justice system (and other sectors). It is likely that this level of preparedness and multi-agency working contributed, in no small part, to ensuring that disruption to the day-to-day running of justice organisations (downstream of Police Scotland) was minimal.[1] COP26[2] COP26[3] Source: COPFS Management Information[4] As of 22 March 2022[5] As of 22 March 2022\l"

Financing, both from private and governmental sources, is required to drive tech development and expand decarbonization efforts to all geographies, industries, and stakeholders. But financing in itself forms a significant part of the challenge. An estimated $100 billion per year in investment is required for financing climate related issues, a target that developed countries were aiming to achieve by 2020[3]. However, this target has largely been aspirational since global investments in the past 4 years have averaged around $75 billion[4] - a gap that highlights the need for active participation by the private sector. Bridging the Funding Gap at COP26: Governmental Pledges At COP26, an intergovernmental Green Climate Fund[5] was created to investigate the policies and criteria that would determine funding. Japan pledged $10 billion and Italy $7 billion over the next 5 years. The EU further pledged \â‚¬ 1 billion, along the l"

""Yes, it's going to get worse as the century rolls out, but it's killing people today.""According to Landrigan, the climate crisis has shown its impact across the globe through air pollution, natural disasters, drought, and famine, creating a new type of crisis-environmental refugees. ""One of the consequences of drought, of course, is famine,"" Landrigan said. ""When people starve, they start to try to go someplace where they can find food for their families and for themselves. They go through all of the horrors of migration.""The 2022 COP27 conference, which BC will send another delegation to, will be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.Kurt Straif, a visiting scholar and co-director of the Global Pollution Observatory, related the global climate crisis to BC, specifically the University's position on divestment.""I think divestment is most critical and central because really, money makes the world go-round, and you really need to put your finger on where the problems are created,"" Straif said. ""What we discuss is really global policy, but where the rubber hits the road is locally.""Andrea Vicini, S.J., Michael P. Walsh professor of bioethics and professor ordinarius, said the issue of climate change is a shared problem.""I think we experienced that we cannot focus only on ourselves,"" Vicini said. ""The problem of the other is my problem. What is happening to the other is what's happening to me. We are all in this together.

The team led the negotiations with the UN on the principal international agreement the Host Country Agreement as well as advising on numerous supporting mechanisms with the UN and other partners on the hosting of the COP during the pandemic.The conclusion of these complex arrangements delivered an inclusive, accessible and safe event and enabled tens of thousands of people from almost 200 nations, comprising party delegates and observers, and representatives from civil society, NGOs, business, and indigenous groups to attend COP26.COP26 our expert team of international climate change lawyers provided advice to the Presidency negotiations team on a large range of strategic and process-related preparatory matters. During the two-week conference the team were embedded in the Presidency team on the ground, and continued to provide support and guidance on a very wide range of climate negotiations issues, many culminating in decisions adopted by the Parties, notably the Glasgow Climate Pact, which should ultimately be translated into actions, policies and laws around the world. Some of the key issues concerned finance, completing the technical rules to operationalise the Paris Agreement, and ramping up ambition for countries to increase their carbon reduction ambitions by 2030 and beyond.Lawyers from the team continue to lead on important climate change matters alongside COP26, such as the net zero strategy, opening the next round of renewable energy auctions, and delivering international climate finance supporting developing countries around the globe.In an article published on the International Bar Association it states, 'there's a sense that the law and legal work can help translate words into action when it comes to addressing the climate crisis'. The article includes a comment from Claire who says, 'It's all very well and good to make the pledges, but how do you make these into translatable actions? The law can be a very powerful force in that.""The event was also a time to remember Clare Radcliffe who sadly passed away at the beginning of the year. Clare was dedicated to making a positive change, and was a leading figure in GLD's work for COP26. In tribute to Clare, her work and exceptional legacy, a plaque in the conference centre garden in Glasgow was unveiled at COP26.\l"

However, quantifiable progress was achieved on one major climate driver - methane - giving reason for optimism amid much uncertainty. Global emissions of this tiny molecule - made up of one carbon surrounded by four hydrogen atoms - are responsible for up to 30% of all global warming[5], with 60% of total emissions deriving from human sources[6]. Furthermore, methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in a 20-year timeframe, meaning that aggressive action to remove and mitigate methane emissions in the near-term can provide immediate benefits for the climate, and will be key to achieving Paris Climate Agreement targets. As regulators in Europe and North America edge ever closer to imposing Methane reporting requirements and emissions restrictions on companies, it is essential that business leaders are proactive in their response and acquire a firm understanding of why supply chain action is key to fulfilling the Global Methane Pledge.

As a part of its overall approach, India emphasized the foundational principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and called for climate justice in global climate action. It also highlighted that all countries should have equitable access to the global carbon budget, a finite global resource, for keeping temperature increase within the limits set by the Paris Agreement. All countries must stay within their fair share of this global carbon budget while using it responsibly. India alsocalled on the developed countries to undertake rapid reductions in emissions during the current decade so as to reach net-zero much earlier than their announced dates, as they have used more than their fair share of the depleting global carbon budget.India also highlighted that the transfer of climate finance and low-cost climate technologies have become more important for the implementation of climate actions by the developing countries. The ambition on climate finance on the part of developed countries cannot remain same as it was at the time of the Paris Agreement in 2015. It was also emphasized that just as the UNFCCC tracks the progress made in climate mitigation, it should also track climate finance.India also announced to intensify its climate action.The major decisions at COP26, as reflected in the Glasgow Climate Pact, pertain to mitigation, adaptation and finance required for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.All decisions at the annual Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC are arrived at by consensus and hence the question of India being directed to undertake any action by suchdecisions does not arise. India, for its part, abides by commitments to the UNFCCC in letter and spirit. India with more than 17% of the global population has contributed only about 4.37% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019. Even though we are not part of the problem, India is committed to being part of the solution and has done far more than its fair share. Indias commitment to emission intensity reduction of the economy isan economy-wide target and not specific to any sectors including transport and energy sectors.The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC),which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specificareas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs)consistent with the objectives of NAPCC.The Government stands committed to combating climate change through its several programmes and schemes.Many such efforts are underway and include, inter-alia, initiatives to accelerate the renewable energy transition, decarbonisation of transport and adoption of electric mobility,etc. The government has announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission with the goal to make India a global hub for Green Hydrogen production and export.The Government, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, notified production linked incentive scheme for manufacturing advanced chemistry cells and for automobiles andauto components. India has leapfrogged from Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) to Bharat Stage-VI (BSVI)emission norms by April 1, 2020, which was earlier to be adopted by 2024. Indiascurrent share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40%. Under UnnatJyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, a total of 36.79 croresLED bulbs have been distributed to enhance energy efficiency as on date. India has announced a voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles, which will help in encouraging fuel-efficient and environment-friendly vehicles. Indian Railways has taken a number of initiatives including setting up Dedicated Freight Corridors, further railway electrification, improving energy efficiency in traction, and increasing the share of renewable energy. Indian Railways has set a target of making itself net zero by 2030.This information was given by Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in Rajya Sabha today.\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA13","Post COP26: Developing and Funding Energy Transition Projects","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 27, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com With an attendance of more than 190 world leaders, the long-awaited twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties (COP26) concluded with agreement on the Glasglow Climate Pact and the Paris Rulebook. Amid mixed views of whether COP26 was a success, there was a particular focus on the international leadership's stance on the energy transition and how support for cleaner technologies can help limit the global average temperature rise to less than to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Energy transition is generally taken to refer to the global energy sector's shift to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen, while maintaining a parallel focus on ""greening"" existing energy sources such as hydrocarbons, including through the use of decarbonisation technology such as carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). This article highlights some of the key points discussed at our recent webinar titled 'COP26 - Energy transition's pivotal role in delivering climate change targets' featuring panelists Yasushi Hirai (Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)), Angela Yuen (JERA Co., Inc.), Lei Zhang (Socit Gnrale) and Tim Power (White & Case), as moderated by Paul Harrison (White & Case). In particular, we discuss how COP26 goals will affect the development and funding of energy projects and what opportunities and challenges of the decarbonisation journey lie ahead. Significant developments from COP26 Ever since COP26COP26 really plugged into the ESG zeitgeist that's going on at the moment, driven primarily by businesses and their shareholders and investors and by capital providers, to decarbonise businesses and to pursue sustainability objectives."" He added that COP26 has provided a forum for ""public attention and government commitment to decarbonising, right at a time where businesses and financiers especially are also very much focused on achievement on the ESG front."" Key energy transition developments from COP26 included the following: Breakthrough agenda: Over 40 countries committed to accelerate the development and deployment of clean technologies and sustainable solutions with the Breakthrough Agenda. Signatories including the UK, US, Japan, India and China set goals for 2030 in five key sectors - Power, Road Transport, Steel, Hydrogen, and Agriculture. For Hydrogen, the goal is to make affordable renewable and low carbon hydrogen globally available by 2030 and for Power, it is to make clean power the most affordable and reliable option to meet power needs by 2030. Pledge to quit coal: More than 40 countries committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally; and phasing down unabated coal power in the 2030s for major economics and the 2040s for poorer nations. Pledge to end fossil fuel financing abroad: At least 20 countries agreed to end new direct international public finance for unabated fossil fuels by the end of 2022, including funding for oil and gas projects. While the US, Canada, UK and New Zealand were signatories, Asian powerhouses, China, Japan or South Korea, did not sign up. Importantly, the focus is on international finance (the countries did not rule out domestic financing) and on unabated fossil fuels. On the pledge to quit coal, Tim noted that the final language agreed was controversial, particularly in Australia. ""While the initial commitment to phase out coal was toned down [to ""phase down""], it is still, to my mind, a pretty unambiguous message that coal fire power generation has a shelf life if the emissions are unabated. And that is a big qualifier, as that leaves open carbon capture and storage or other similar technologies."" Moving toward cleaner energy technologies: A sponsor's perspective Many traditional oil & gas entities are transitioning to become ""energy companies"" - rather than moving away entirely from their traditional core business, they are supplementing their business model with investments in renewables and cleaner technologies such as hydrogen, battery storage and carbon capture. As the largest power generator in Japan with power generation capacity equivalent to half of Japan's thermal power generation output, JERA is taking a similar approach. ""On the one hand, we really are in a position to lead the transition to the green economy but on the other hand we need to strike a balance with our responsibilities to maintain a stable supply of energy,"" Deputy General Counsel, Angela Yuen said. JERA has announced a 2050 zero emissions roadmap, with a focus on greener power generation and smart technology and has entered into a large number of investments, collaborations and initiatives, both in Japan and internationally, including in hydrogen development and co-firing of ammonia. However, the transition to renewables and clean energy is not without its challenges. For renewable projects, Angela explained that common roadblocks in Japan include, for example, ""grid infrastructure, port capacity limitations, lengthy environmental processes and land constraints for onshore wind and solar projects, and collaborations with fisheries for offshore wind projects."" She added ""So for Japan to really achieve the 2030 target of 36-38% renewables as a generation source, and for there to be a pipel"

The conclusions set out that the EU and its member states, in a joint Team Europe approach, will engage with partners around the world to address the challenges linked to such implementation, and will actively work on the various COP26 sectoral initiatives and calls.In its conclusions the Council recognises that the direct and indirect effects of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation represent risks to the realisation of human rights, human and state security, undermining global peace and stability and often accelerating or deepening existing vulnerabilities and instability. In this light, the Council welcomes the increased focus by the UN on the climate, peace and security nexus, but also reiterates the need for human rights to be integrated systematically into climate action and energy diplomacy.The Council also stresses that the lack of at-scale finance for resilient and just energy transitions in middle and low-income countries remains a barrier for green and sustainable development. Therefore, the EU will continue to provide a sustainable, green and positive offer to partners for the development of trusted climate resilient energy, transport and digital infrastructure.At the same time, the EU calls on other developed countries to meet the collective commitment to mobilise $100 billion per year in 2022, and on multilateral development banks and international finance institutions to play a catalytic role in mobilising the private sector and shifting the global financial flows towards sustainable and green investments.\l"

The conference has been held every year since its origin, pulling in more nations, businesses, and organizations over time, until the COVID-19 pandemic.Due to the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, COP26 was delayed until 2021, picking up the conversation from the previous council held in Madrid, Spain, COP25, with tens of thousands of participants attending.One of the other key past conferences with which COP26 engaged was COP21, which created the Paris Agreement.The official COP26COP26, having been pushed from its original 2020 date, acts as the first mark of return since this plan was created.Another significant aspect of the Paris Agreement that COP26 dealt with was the goal to keep global temperature increase to a maximum of 2?, with an ideal of 1.5?. Looking at the progress toward this objective was one of the foremost focuses of the conference.The conference cited four overarching goals to be achieved: 1) Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach 2) Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats 3) Mobilise finance 4) Work together to deliver.In order to achieve the first goal, countries discussed an acceleration of phasing out the use of coal, combat against deforestation, a faster switch to electric vehicles, and more investment in renewable energy. For the second, they pushed protection and restoration of ecosystems while also creating structures to protect communities from the unavoidable consequences of climate change. For the third, they aimed to get developed countries to mobilize at least $100 billion in climate finance per year to make the first two goals actionable. For the fourth, they aimed to finalize the Paris Rulebook and set a precedent for working collaboratively.After the negotiations that took place throughout the run of the conference, many of these goals were agreed upon and courses of action were laid out. The COP26 website summarized the outcomes under four categories: Mitigation; Adaptation, Loss and Damage, Finance; and Collaboration. These categories are meant to align with their initial objectives.In regard to Mitigation, the two main goals were the 1.5? cap and reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by 2030. Approximately 70% of the world's economy is committed to the 2030 goal, and there is still hope for the 1.5? aim.""We can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action,"" stated COP26 President Alok Sharma of Britain.The financial aspect of COP26 also included a goal for developed countries to raise $100 billion annually to support the climate change movement; the conference claims to have made significant progress toward this goal. It is now estimated that ""$500 billion will be mobilised over the period 2021-25.""COP26 delivered on the Adaptation, Loss and Damage front with finance packages related to the environment and land use. Additionally, in order to protect those who will inevitably be affected by climate change, ""80 countries are now covered by either Adaptation Communications or National Adaptation plans to increase preparedness to climate risks.""The Collaboration goal was met by the finalization of the Paris Rulebook, which offers ""the detailed rules and systems"" to make the Paris Agreement actionable.Overall, COP26 seems to have made progress towards achieving the goals it set out before the start of the conference, even if all have not yet reached ideal numbers, and they have maintained committed to transparency about the process and progress of the climate change initiatives.The next step will be seeing how actionable these ideas are and how well the commitments made hold up in an ever-shifting political landscape.\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA20","How did COP26 help business move towards a net-zero economy?","February 4, 2022 Friday","McKinsey & Company","HYPERLINK https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/future%20of%20asia/videos/how%20did%20cop26%20help%20business%20move%20towards%20a%20net%20zero%20economy/standard-india-sustainability-video.jpg Link to Image I thought I might kick off by sharing a few reflections on how far COP26 helped us move towards a net-zero economy, and what some of the implications to business are. These remarks are really formed by four different sets of insights.In the year running up to COP, we helped create the fact base on two of the major themes that were discussed in Glasgow: firstly, around mobilizing capital for the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero group; and secondly, we worked with high-level UN climate champions to really put a fact base together around resilience.Thirdly, in the run-up to COP, we created partnerships with people like the Mission Possible Partnership and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development to better understand some of the most difficult parts of the problem-those hard to abate sectors-and we tried to lay out what some of the pathways might look like there.Lastly, we convened a major program of events in Glasgow. More than 1,000 field leaders from around the world joined our program in person, more than 10,000 watched it and interacted with us live on McKinsey.com, and more than 100,000 engaged with the content on social media.We built all of those perspectives into the view that we have now. Over the two months since COP, I've spoken to around 1,500 leaders around the world sharing these perspectives; gathering their input and refining our points of view as we go.The net-zero transitionThe transition to a net-zero economy is certain to be complicated, messy, and hard. Anyone who looks at the outcomes of COP26 will see there is still a huge amount that needs to get done, but our overall view is that COP26 was a more important step forward than is visible in much of the media and activist response.That step forward sets a clear challenge for business, which is how to create strategic resilience in an era of certain volatility. I'd like to just pick into both of those assertions in a little bit more detail-firstly, on why we think COP26 was a more important step forward than many think.Much of the commentary around COP26 has focused on adding up the temperature implications of the many thousands of different commitments that were made there. You can see ranges of estimates from 1.8\'b0C to 2.1\'b0C, 2.4\'b0C, 2.7\'b0C temperatures.COP26 had.We think COP26 was an important milestone because really, the debate has now shifted from whether we need to make this transition, to how we need to do it. And capital is starting to form to press the pace. So, the capital markets are now integrated in a way that they weren't before COP.We think that is going to build momentum quickly from hereon in, and the clarity of that demand signal is what sets up this fundamental challenge for business. If I think about how to simplify the message from COP, rather than think about the thousands of different announcements, I'll point to five things we think really mattered.First is the breadth and comprehensiveness of net-zero pledges now: more than 90 percent of global emissions-with India and Nigeria being the two largest countries to step up during COP26-and more than 5,000 companies have now signed up to the race to net-zero. Secondly, the movement on coal. Of course, there's been plenty of debate about coal and what happened in the last few days of COP, with most people thinking that the watering down of the pledge around coal was a bad thing. I choose to see what was agreed on coal as a first and a clear step toward an eventual post-coal economy.Thirdly, the US-China bilateral was really important because it spoke to action this decade, recognizing the urgency with which we need to move, and because it identified technologies that the US and China would work on together to scale-things like carbon capture and storage.The fourth thing that we thought was important was that you will have seen a series of agreements that moved beyond carbon, tackling methane, deforestation, electric vehicle adoption, and so on, with groups of 50, 70, 100+ countries agreeing to work in these areas. This sets the foundation for the next generation of the agenda.Then the fifth thing we thought mattered was the extra prominence that resilience against climate hazards was given in the narrative. We think that has been overlooked in the past but is now starting to get the cut-through that is important. Even if global emissions stop tomorrow, we know, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last August, that the inertia in the earth's systems will mean that temperatures will continue to increase. So, resilience is an important issue that received more prominence in COP.All of those things were supported by the mobilization of capital in greater quantities than we've seen before. Now, there is a paradox around capital because, on the one hand, capital mobilization is likely to be inflationary. There is, in a way, too much capital for the amount of supply that is available.On the other hand, recently published McKinsey research has shown that the amount of capital that's been raised is less than is needed by quite a significant amount. We believe that around $9.2 trillion of capital every year will be needed over the next 30 years to deliver an orderly transition to a net-zero economy. So, there is a short- and long-term paradox about capital, but nevertheless, COP showed that we could really start to mobilize more than we have in the past.Net-zero is becoming an organizing principle for business. Now, organizations need to turn their pledges into plans and to demonstrate some form of credible traction against those plans. The need for this capital to find a home, we believe, will create an environment of certain volatility.Firstly, because demand for green materials will exceed our ability to supply. Secondly, because we live in a more fractious world and regrettably, the flash points in that fractious world also overlap with the parts of the world that are often exposed to climate hazards. So, we're going to see political and governmental pressure brought to bear.Thirdly, because customer habits and regulations are going to change in different ways, in different speeds around the world. So, it is certain to be a volatile mix.How companies can prepare for the transition to a net-zero economyWe think that gives four main things for business to be thinking about to thrive or to create strategic resilience in this era of certain volatility. The first is that as organizations seek to turn pledges into credible plans, the importance of a change narrative is greater than ever before. Companies will need to articulate a north star for their organizations that can sustain the confidence of investors and colleagues, even while there are bumps along the way.Secondly, we think there's an opportunity to reinvent finance. In a world of raw material volatility and supply chain fragility, we think finance is the place that can think about hedging of raw completed prices, futures contracts, and how companies can get supply of green materials when their competitors can't. Essentially, more sophisticated ways of thinking about scenario planning so you can allocate your capital in a thoughtful way. And finally, perhaps building greater circularity into business models to act as a buffer against raw material price exposure.The third thing we think is important for organizations is to think about how to use the sustainability imperative to complete the digitization of their organizations. If you don't know how to begin on a sustainability journey, one of the places to look is the adoption of digital techniques-analytics, automation, AI, the things that have been proven at scale, but not yet fully adopted-from the last decade.We also think the technology that will scale in the coming decade will allow us to account for carbon in supply chains, the scope three carbon emissions, and will give much greater transparency about supply chain performance. This will be the catalyst for the next era of supply chain productivity improvement.Finally, we think that organizations should think about how to build their physical resilience to climate hazards. When we were doing our work with the race to resilience, we were shocked at how few executives were able to articulate how fragile their assets and supply chains are to climate hazards, how that will change, and how that differs to their competition.So, that's a very quick view of our reflections on COP26; an important step forward because it sets the demand signal. But we're not naive-we recognize there's a huge amount that needs to be done, both to increase the pledges and to put substance behind the pledges that have been made. But the demand signal now sets an environment for business, and an environment that has a challenge, which is how to create strategic resilience in an era of certain volatility.About the authors HYPERLINK https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=55B774153DE147B88C860785113D8A51&_z=zHarry Bowcott is a senior partner in McKinsey's London office.\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA23","COP26: Hydrogen in the spotlight","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 01, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com Hydrogen featured heavily at COP26, providing cause for optimism for the transition toward a low-carbon hydrogen economy. This alert highlights key hydrogen developments that emerged during COP26. The global push toward a hydrogen economy In recent years the global push toward a hydrogen economy has gained momentum as the focus on climate change has intensified. Hydrogen is poised to play a key role in the energy transition. The rapid deployment of large-scale renewables and the falling cost of electrolysers means that hydrogen could deliver reliable baseload power with a low carbon footprint. Further insight on the developing global hydrogen economy is provided in our Hydrogen Economy Series[1] and our Global Hydrogen Guide[2], which tracks and monitors hydrogen-related regulatory developments and incentives across the globe. Hydrogen took centre stage at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (""COP26""). Most national pavilions ran hydrogen-related events, and many used the conference to highlight their respective hydrogen strategies or plans. COP26 also served as the platform for some of the most significant global discussions to date on the use of hydrogen as an energy source. As a complement to the official COP26 conference programme, Climate Action (a global media and events platform) also held a Hydrogen Transition Summit at which key policy, investment, technology, regulator and government stakeholders discussed opportunities, initiatives and obstacles relating to the transition to a low-carbon hydrogen economy. Hydrogen developments at COP26 Several hydrogen-related commitments and initiatives were announced during COP26: Breakthrough Agenda A key outcome of COP26 was the Breakthrough Agenda - a commitment endorsed by 42 countries to work together in the 2020s to accelerate actions needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals (which include keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius). The Breakthrough Agenda launched four separate goals known as the Glasgow Breakthroughs which ""aim to make clean technologies and sustainable solutions the most affordable, accessible and attractive option in each emitting sector globally before 2030."" The Glasgow Breakthroughs include a 'hydrogen breakthrough' goal which is to ensure affordable low-carbon hydrogen is globally available by 2030. As the global hydrogen market remains nascent, a key tool in the push for a globalised hydrogen economy is market research. To this end, COP26 delegates sought to co-opt global bodies such as the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency (""IRENA"") to lead an assessment of progress toward the achievement of the hydrogen breakthrough, including by providing detailed evidence of hydrogen production costs, volumes and affordability. Based on this collection of evidence, it was surmised, a robust and market-tested framework for hydrogen project development could be assembled. Green Hydrogen Toolbox The World Economic Forum and IRENA launched a jointly-developed suite of policy recommendations titled 'Enabling Measures Roadmaps for Green Hydrogen'. Nicknamed the 'Green Hydrogen Toolbox', the roadmaps aim to empower policymakers to prioritise policies for green hydrogen and accelerate its deployment at the international level in pursuit of a net zero energy system. National commitments and international partnerships The United Arab Emirates and Germany signed a declaration of intent to expand their cooperation on green hydrogen. The UAE separately announced its 'Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap' and is targeting a 25% global market share of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030. Japan announced a US$100 million investment for the conversion of fossil-fired plants into ammonia- and hydrogen-based plants. The European Commission announced a partnership between the European Investment Bank and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, which will mobilise up to \â‚¬ 820 million (US$1 billion) between 2022-2026 to accelerate the deployment of technologies to deliver on the European Green Deal's ambitions and the EU's 2030 climate targets. Industry announcements A range of industry players also seized the opportunity presented by to announce notable hydrogen initiatives and projects. Key themes in the hydrogen transition The Hydrogen Transition Summit which was held alongside COP26 featured a full day of events focussed on embracing hydrogen as a core component of the road to net zero. Key themes included: The market for low-carbon hydrogen While much of the current global discussion on hydrogen has focussed on the prospects for hydrogen production, as discussed on the hydrogen panel session White & Case recently hosted with ENGIE, BNP Paribas, Arup and InterContinental Energy[3], a hydrogen market can only function where there is adequate demand for the hydrogen produced. Demand and supply side initiatives need to be actively pursued in tandem to facilitate the success of a hydrogen economy. Removal of barriers for producers Promoting the hydrogen transition Carbon pricing - establish a market-based price on carbon in domestic markets (with the potential to develop international pricing); Carbon trading markets - work with industry to scale up carbon trading markets in order to unlock low-carbon hydrogen's value potential; Financial support - offer government support in the form of grants, subsidies, loans, R&D investments contracts for difference, and domestic and multinational public-private partnerships; Facilitate international trade - form bilateral and multilateral partnerships to facilitate international hydrogen trade; and Political vision - work with industry partners to establish a comprehensive hydrogen strategy to guide the design and implementation of measures aimed at supporting the transition to a low-carbon hydrogen-based economy. Hydrogen guarantee of origin certification The establishment of 'guarantee of origin' certification schemes to verify the source of low-carbon hydrogen is considered an important catalyst toward a hydrogen economy. Ideally, this would tie into existing and prospective carbon trading frameworks in order to unlock a key financial incentive for transitioning to low-carbon hydrogen. The role of transition fuels 'Grey' hydrogen (produced via methane steam reformation, with carbon emissions) and 'blue' hydrogen (grey, combined with carbon capture and storage) were discussed as transition fuels on the path to more widespread use of green hydrogen. The productive capacity for grey and blue hydrogen already exists, and scaling up these systems may be easier than starting from scratch with green hydrogen. Additionally, grey and blue hydrogen are currently cheaper than green hydrogen, and embracing lower-cost hydrogen now could help create a broader market for hydrogen, which could in time transition to green hydrogen. Outlook COP26COP26 has given the industry momentum to drive the policy reform, innovation and partnerships necessary for the realisation of a hydrogen economy. COP26 has provided governments with a key reference point for the development of domestic hydrogen markets, and has reinforced the truly global nature of this industry. If the momentum is seized, COP26 may well be remembered as the conference that finally catalysed international cooperation toward the development of a low-carbon hydrogen-based economy.

Climate Summits -- conferences that bring together leaders of governments and corporations around the world to discuss solutions to climate change.\~These conferences are often referred to as ""COPs"", or Conference of the Parties. During Catanoso's first conferences - COP20 and COP21 - the U.N. formed and signed the Paris Agreement, which set limitations on each country's environmental impact in an effort to reduce their contributions to climate change. Catanoso left that conference believing there was immense hope for progress.\~""There was this amazing hope that we would continue to make this level of progress year after year,"" he said.\~However, Catanoso expressed worldwide concern for the environment after the 2016 election, as former President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.\~""The climate movement, if there was one, essentially ground to a halt,"" he said.\~According to Catanoso, with the absence of the U.S. at COP25 in 2019, the leaders that held the most power at the following conference were those whose interests lie in the destruction of the environment: Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia. After that conference, Catanoso's hope for future change began to fade.\~\~""This was the opposite direction that we needed to be going, and any of the hope that came out of Paris had dissipated,"" Catanoso said.\~He began to describe how this lack of international cooperation spurred climate change. Following these conferences, climate scientists were shocked by the rate of impact from global warming, which was accelerating much quicker than anticipated.\~COP26 in 2021 seemed to be the last hope to slow down global warming. With the United States back in the movement, the hope of progress was imminent. More people participated in COP26 than ever before, and tremendous progress resulted.\~\~""However, the progress came six years too late,"" Catanoso said. ""If this meeting had come a year or two after Paris, it would have been deemed a qualified success. But six years later, the consensus was that it was a failure.""To combat this disappearing sense of hope, Catanoso emphasized that there is still time to act - if we aggressively fight to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. He declared that there were two promising solutions resulting from COP26: returning land rights to Indigenous communities and removing methane from the atmosphere.He also said that the tropical rainforest biome is an asset to the fight against climate change. This biome sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, generates oxygen and maintains biodiversity, among other functions.\~He described how over the decades, deforestation has demolished the tropical rainforests at a rapid rate. To secure the land against threats of logging and deforestation, he suggests that land rights - to as much of the rainforest as possible - be returned to the Indigenous communities that reside within the rainforests.\~During COP26Catanoso argues that ""words must be matched by money"" to successfully implement change. For example, at COP26, philanthropists pledged $1.7 billion to promote this legislation.\~In terms of greenhouse gasses, Catanoso advocates that world leaders should turn their attention to methane gas. While this compound is not as abundant as carbon dioxide and dissipates faster, it is 85% more heat-trapping than carbon dioxide.\~COP26 introduced innovations that would remove methane from the atmosphere, a technique known as global cooling.""Removing methane already in the atmosphere is the quickest pathway to mitigating the effect of greenhouse gasses,"" Catanoso said.To do so, scientists would release a compound of iron chloride to oxidize methane gas, essentially breaking it down into CO2, which is far less heat-trapping,"" Catanoso said. This would dramatically ""speed up the natural processes that are already happening"".If accomplished, removing methane could reduce global temperatures by 0.4% or more in 20 years, putting the planet back on track by accomplishing the temperature target set by the Paris Agreement.\~ However, much like returning land tenure rights to the Indigenous, this can only be accomplished if matched by large amounts of funds for research and testing - and it must be done as fast as possible.\~""We've lost so much time already, and there simply is none left,"" Catanoso said.\~Speaking directly to Wake Forest students, Catanoso urges students to use their knowledge of climate change to get involved.\~""The most important thing college students can do is vote for candidates who will make this climate action happen,"" he said.\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA28","COP26: Success or Failure?","December 1, 2021","Voice of America News","December 11, 2021 2:51 AMA month after the U.N. climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, known as COP26, politicians, analysts and climate action advocates are taking stock of what was agreed to. And the consensus is that while substantial progress was made in a number of areas, there wasn't enough.The world still remains off track to avert a climate crisis and is falling short of limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a goal set at previous talks in Paris in 2015. And it remains off track despite deals to cut carbon and methane emissions, end deforestation, reduce the use of coal, and a renewed pledge of financing for poorer countries most vulnerable to extreme weather.Britain's own Climate Change Committee, an independent, statutory body established to advise the UK government on emission targets, says COP26 ""marked a step forward in global efforts to address climate change.""It says there was an increase in ambitions to reduce emissions across the world and it lists as achievements the ""finalization of rules on reporting emissions and international carbon trading, and the launch of a range of new initiatives and sector deals.""However, the committee added, ""How far this can be considered a success will depend on follow-up actions over the coming year and beyond.""Activists unimpressedFor many climate activists, the two-week summit was just more noise. Teenage activist Greta Thunberg dubbed COP26 ""a global north greenwash festival.""But some serious analysts also agree the summit should be marked a failure, because it didn't reach the goals it set itself.""Was COP26 a failure? If we evaluate this using the summit's original stated goals, the answer is yes, it fell short. Two big ticket items weren't realized: renewing targets for 2030 that align with limiting warming to 1.5?, and an agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal,"" Robert Hales and Brendan Mackey, academics from Australia's Griffith University, concluded in a commentary for The Conversation website.Because of a last-minute intervention by India, an agreement to accelerate the phasing-out of coal was watered down in the final communique to the much vaguer ""phasing-down"" of coal.But Hales and Mackey also say at ""there were important decisions and notable bright spots."" They say COP26 may well be seen later as the moment the world took ""an unambiguous turn away from fossil fuel as a source of energy,"" and they highlight COP26's emphasis on the importance of mitigating damage to nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity.In a side deal at Glasgow, 124 other countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030.Other analysts praise the final pact urging countries to deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver $100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage to help them with adaptation and to develop resilient infrastructure. Many developing nations are already seeing dwindling crop yields and are experiencing devastating storms.Rob Stavins, professor of Energy and Economic Development at Harvard University, remains cautiously optimistic and says assessing 's success and failure is ""both simplistic and obscures much of the purpose and function of these annual negotiations.""""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told the Harvard Gazette. ""To continue that metaphor: It's a relay race and the fundamental thing about an individual Conference of the Parties in any given year is that you don't drop the baton when you pass it off to the next one. And this was a reasonable pass off to the next Conference of the Parties."" The next global climate talks are scheduled next year in Egypt.Stavins says before the 2015 Paris talks, the world was heading for 3.7 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of this century. After COP21, the trajectory was reduced to 2.7 degrees of warming. The updated emission reduction targets agreed to at Glasgow cut the trajectory further to 2.4 degrees Celsius.""And then, if you add in all of the statements from countries about net zero emissions by the year 2050, as well as private industry statements, we could be at about 1.8 degrees centigrade,"" he says.That keeps the 1.5 Celsius goal within reach, the chairman of COP26, Alok Sharma, said in his concluding remarks in Glasgow, although he noted, its ""pulse remains weak.""Who will pay?Weak or not, some worry that governments, especially Western ones, may be going too fast with decarbonizing and risk losing the support of their own populations by failing to take into account the economic impact of the monumental shifts envisaged.Opinion polls suggest that across the globe, overwhelming majorities of people see climate change as an emergency requiring radical action. But some polls in recent weeks have also suggested that when people are told what the costs to them may be to curb global warming, they are reluctant to shoulder the financial burden.COP26 saw plenty of discussions about how to fund the transition away from fossil fuel dependency to renewable, sustainable energy and how to finance projects to make countries more resilient to extreme weather. But there was little clarity about how the costs should be shared among governments (via taxation), consumers, households and the private sector.At Glasgow, major banks, investors and insurers pledged trillions in green funding in a coordinated commitment to incorporate carbon emissions into their investment and lending decisions. The commitment was made by more than 450 financial institutions across 45 countries managing assets valued at $130 trillion.""These seemingly arcane but essential changes to the plumbing of finance can move and are moving climate changes from the fringes to the forefront and transforming the financial system in the process,"" Mark Carney, a former head of the central banks of England and Canada, said when announcing the pledge. ""The architecture of the global financial system has been transformed to deliver net zero,"" he added.But some industry analysts and economists cautioned the private sector plans are far from concrete, and that significant problems remain on how to measure the carbon footprint of investment portfolios and align those measurements across international financial markets. Of particular concern is how to verify the accuracy of what banks and investors report.Others worry that financial firms are there to maximize profits for clients and shareholders and that they risk losing customers or breaching their fiduciary obligations if they fail to maintain good returns. It remains unclear at this stage how profitable green investments will be.\l"

In this context, we agreed that the United Kingdom and Egypt would strengthen bilateral cooperation to fight climate change and to maintain and build on the current momentum for global climate action.We will work together in 2022 and beyond to drive ambitious implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and to deliver on the outcomes of the Glasgow Climate Pact to keep 1.5 degrees in reach and support developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering ambitious outcomes at COP27, including ensuring that it delivers for those most vulnerable to climate change.We emphasize the urgency of action required to address the gaps in ambition across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance, and the importance of responding to the best available science in this respect. We recognize that significant progress was made at COP26, but there is much more to be done - particularly to implement commitments made. We aim to pursue a lasting legacy that ensures the UNFCCC process continues to drive ambitious action to address climate change and its impacts.Through our partnership, we will drive and support key processes, activities, and initiatives to increase ambition and implementation to achieve the goals of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. We will work together to encourage all Parties to meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and finance; requesting that by the end of 2022 parties revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions target to align with Paris temperature goals, including enhancing NDCs long term strategies and stepping up ambition therein, ensuring accelerated delivery of the $100bn and to make progress towards doubling of adaptation finance on 2019 levels, as envisaged in the Glasgow Climate Pact.We also recognize the importance of our own domestic climate action, to demonstrate leadership globally. We further recognize the opportunity our partnership offers to enhance our shared prosperity through green trade and investment opportunities.To achieve our aims, we will share experience and expertise and work closely with key partners, including the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies. We will pursue inclusive leadership and engagement that leaves no issue and no one behind, and enables the voices of all Parties, civil society, and vulnerable groups, including youth and indigenous peoples, to be heard.To this end, we agree to continue close consultations in the months ahead, both on the ministerial and technical levels.\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA31","The Results of COP26","National Law Review","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 29, 2021( National Law Review: HYPERLINK https://www.natlawreview.comhttps://www.natlawreview.com Article By Erin Grisby[1] Shannon S. Broome[2] Clare Ellis[3] Samuel L. Brown[4] Charles H. Knauss[5] Hunton Andrews Kurth[6] The Nickel Report[7] After over two weeks of conferencing, the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (COP26) concluded with the finalization of theGlasgow Climate Pact[8](the 'Glasgow Pact') listing the accomplishments of the summit. The Glasgow Pact reaffirms the long-term global goals (including those in the Paris Agreement) to hold the increase in the global average temperature to 'well below 2C' above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. It also states that limiting global warming to 1.5C requires 'rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in other greenhouse gases.' Despite agreement on overarching goals, country-specific commitments and actions will be key to achieving the stated objectives of the Glasgow Pact. A February 2021 United NationsSynthesis Report[9]on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) concluded that the Party commitments to the Paris Agreement are not on track to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Although the Glasgow Pact and the Paris Agreement are not enforceable, they are meaningful in that they guide domestic actions when the country representatives return home. The release of the Glasgow Pact comes at a time of rapidly increasing energy prices throughout Europe and the US, threatening the speed of economic recovery in many countries. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) nowestimates[10]that domestic coal use in electricity generation will rise for the first time since 2014 by 18 percent and that U.S. coal exports will also increase by 29 percent in 2021 to meet a rising global demand. China is also leaning more heavily on coal,reportedly[11]expanding mines to produce 220 million metric tons more of coal per year, a 6-percent increase from last year. Questions over the transitory nature of these energy market fluctuations could significantly affect the ability of countries to meet their emissions reduction commitments that rely upon phasing down the use of coal. In the Glasgow Pact, signatories commit to accelerating and scaling up the transition to clean energy and adverting the impacts of climate change through adaptation and the financing thereof. Its terms encourage submission of enhanced national adaptation plans and invite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the next annual COP27 in November 2022. One of the final provisions agreed upon commits to Â£ccelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.' National Determined Contributions. With the 2021 COP26 marking the five-year anniversary of that 2016 Paris Agreement, updatedNDCs[12]were largely anticipated. NDCs are the foundation of the Paris Agreement and reflect efforts by each country to reduce national GHG emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. NDCs are supposed to be submitted every five years and, over time, successive NDCs are expected to increase the goals for GHG emission reductions. Countries can submit NDCs at any time. Since 2016, 194 counties have submitted NDCs overall, and 13 of those countries have submitted second NDCs. Months before COP26, in April 2021, President Bidenannounced[13]the U.S.'s updated NDC, which puts the country on a more urgent schedule to cut GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 50 percent by 2030 almost double the U.S.'s prior commitment, prompting curiosity as to whether other nations would follow suit. The U.S. is one of the top five emitters of CO2globally, along with the EU, China, India, and Russia, and the UK, according to a 2021report[14]. The EU, the U.S., and the UK all share the goal to be net zero by 2050, and the UK and the EU had already updated their NDCs in 2020 before the U.S.'s 2021 pronouncement. Coming out of COP26, the UK has maintained its 2020 NDC pledge of reducing its emissions by at least 68 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The EU has also stood by its 2020 commitment to at least a 55-percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. For net zero goals, China's NDC commits to carbon neutrality by 2060, whereas India and Russia have reportedly announced goals for carbon neutrality in 2060 and 2070, respectively. India also set a goal of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. Other aspects of COP26 are aimed at practical implementation measures to ensure that pronounced NDCs become reality. Carbon Markets. Progress has been made on setting standards, incentives, and rules for carbon markets. Carbon markets are tools - regulatory and voluntary - that aim to cost-effectively reduce the emission of CO2and other GHGs. Rules for such markets are intended to give confidence and otherwise help guide investments in new technologies.As we previously wrote[15], COP26 would focus on a framework or 'Paris Rulebook' pursuant to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in order to answer some key questions associated with carbon market operations, such as whether Kyoto-based credits could be relied on to meet Paris-based NDCs (i.e., double counting rules). TheArticle 6 deal[16]struck at COP26 is said to help avoid double counting of emissions reductions. Specifically, the deal allows for the use of clean development mechanisms (or CDMs) from the Kyoto Protocol that were registered on or after January 1, 2013, yet it limits both (1) the amount of such credits that can be carried over into the Paris credit system and (2) the use of such credits to the first (or first updated) cycle of NDCs, to avoid an overwhelming market supply. The deal also restricts claims of emissions reductions to those backed by 'corresponding adjustments' made at the point of authorization of an offset. Corresponding adjustments are adjustments made by the host country to its own inventory to account for the credit transfers. Adaptation. The Paris Agreement included a goal to increase adaptation efforts (e.g., global resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate-related impacts). At COP26, over 100 organizations joined together to launch theAdaptation Research Alliance[17]aimed at effective adaption to reduce the risks posed by climate change, particularly for those most vulnerable. The conversation on adaptation often focuses on whatdevelopedcountries should be doing to assist with adaptation efforts indevelopingcountries. As a first step, the Alliance set out guidel"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA33","Buening: What You Need to Know About COP26","December 1, 2021 Wednesday","The Daily Utah Chronicle: University of Utah","In 1995, the first Conference of the Parties (COP) was held. Since then, world leaders have gathered to collaborate on solutions to the climate crisis. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), hosted in Glasgow, Scotland, ended in mid-November. COP26 stood apart from its predecessors because of this decade's unique urgency. Because human activity has already resulted in a 1.1 degree Celsius increase in global temperature, COP26 may have been our ""last chance"" at limiting warming to the 1.5 degree threshold established by The Paris Agreement during COP21.But COP26What Was Accomplished?Although vastly inadequate, COP26 resulted in some steps in the right direction. Collin Rees, the U.S. Program Manager for Oil Change International and eighth consecutive COP attendee noted that COP26 focused more on loss and damages than in previous years. Climate Reparations are a critical step in recognizing climate change as a present issue, not just a future inevitability.Shockingly, COP26COP26 achieved the bare minimum. However, notably, a public finance commitment pledged 40 countries and major development banks to ""end public finance for oil, gas and coal by the end of next year.""An alliance of countries also committed to stop exploring or permitting any new fossil fuel projects. The diplomatic initiative presented a remarkable example of the kind of tangible, near-term commitments we desperately need to reduce warming. Naturally, major polluters like the U.S. omitted the alliance. We did enter into the Glasgow Climate Pact, aimed at phasing down fossil fuel subsidies and increasing financial support for developing countries through a Climate Adaptation Fund. Developed countries pledged $356 million. Although these contributions surpassed records, they still don't reflect estimated climate needs or the disproportionate role of the first world in the creation of this problem.One of the most severe limitations of these accomplishments is that they aren't legally binding. Therefore, countries can fail to meet standards without repercussions. In the past, we've seen how this mistake aids climate inaction. For instance, the developed world pledged $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries back in 2009 - a promise that remains unfulfilled. Likewise, the Paris Agreement had ""few legal teeth,""\~despite being described as ""legally binding."" And, during the Trump administration, the U.S. easily withdrew from it.Most Exclusionary ConferenceCOVID-19 restrictions, unaffordable accommodations and virtual inaccessibility restricted participation from nearly one-third of the Global South. Rees stated that climate talks as a whole ""continue to be an extremely inequitable space."" In COP26, he said, we ended up with a ""COP that was more white, more Global North, more rich-country focused than ever before.""The most impacted people were excluded and polluters took center stage. More than 500 fossil fuel representatives attended in efforts to undermine aggressive action. Some of the worst polluters in the world drove negotiation blocs while civil society groups had to make their voices heard through demonstrations and powerful protests on the outside. Having fossil fuels participate in climate talks is like letting the tobacco industry run the World Health Organization's international negotiations. Wherever big oil executives go, greenwashing follows. Fittingly, climate activist Greta Thunberg described the event as a ""Global North greenwash festival.""The priorities of the conference blatantly reflected big oil interests. For instance, conversations boiled down to the phasing down of coal, which is used predominantly by developing nations. While we cannot allow for coal expansion, first-world influences used the issue to deflect from their own oil and gas divestments. Rees said ""the fact that we're focusing only on coal at the very end is a very clear sign of the influence of big oil and gas players."" India even ""repeatedly raised the motion"" to include phrasing about oil and gas, but it was ""struck down by the U.S. and U.K.""COP26 gave precedence to the same world leaders and fossil fuel corporations that have exacerbated the climate crisis for decades. The conference exemplified how environmental circles continue to fall victim to manipulative power dynamics, privilege and racism. Maintaining elitist climate negotiations will not adequately address the climate crisis. And indeed, COP26 achievements fell massively short of what's necessary.Wholly InadequateCOP26 Coalition spokesperson Asad Rehman described COP26 as the next in a chain of COPs littered with broken promises. The Biden administration dedicated 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling leases shortly after the summit ended. And as Rees said, the difference between 2.4 and 1.5 degrees of warming means ""life or death"" for many people. Remaining under the 1.5 threshold requires that the world halves its greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years. COP26 produced a far cry from those results. So, make no mistake, keeping 1.5 degrees alive requires an enormous revolution.Because final texts were hardly legally binding, it's up to us to ""hold Biden's feet to the fire,"" as Rees said. Our country can make empty commitments, but we need to demand that it upholds them. Passing the Build Back Better act is only part of the equation going forward. Even without Congress, there are about 23 new fossil fuel projects sitting on Biden's desk. ""If he stopped them,"" which he could tomorrow with the ""stroke of a pen if he wanted to,"" Rees said, ""it would be worth more than this entire congressional bill.""It's critical that we reduce global warming as much as possible, even if 1.5 degrees is only barely within reach. We must continue applying pressure to keep polluters out of climate negotiations, demand for the materialization of better climate finance and fight for urgent action from Biden's administration. Climate talks must continue to happen, but they need to do more to salvage our future.\l"

Following this submission, numerous experts are also voicing their opinions about how ineffective such meetings have become in recent times. Held in Scotland, the 2021's meeting offered more problems than solutions. According to some important statistics, around 400 private planes took businesspeople to the conference. Unfortunately, these planes released about 13,000 tons of CO2, which is quite larger than the amount of CO2 emitted by 1,600 Scottish residents every year. While commenting on the conference, Monica Lennon, a Scottish Parliament member, claimed that it is hypocritical to be traveling around with CO2-emitting private planes while supposedly trying to solve climate issues. The actions of these business attendants have shown that they don't care about the ongoing climate emergency. Basically, COP means Conference of the Parties[1] which is often held annually. The UN conference is usually attended by nations that signed a 1994 treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It should be noted that COP26 is the latest edition of this annual conference. Hosted in Glasgow, Scotland, the conference was meant to hold in 2020 but was postponed to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It finally took place from 1 to 12 November 2021. Various decisions were made at the conference, and many of them could affect the everyday lives of many individuals around the world. Although we have lots of new gadgets today, there has not been any significant development in science in the last 50 years. The majority of the scientific developments available today were developed several decades ago. However, we have only been upgrading, improving, and correcting them to better our lives. However, we tend to be dealing with the illusion of tackling the challenge. Lots of conferences, seminars, research, protests, expert discussions, etc. are going on, but none has been able to proffer reliable solutions. Nowadays, we only discuss the problems and their causes without doing much to solve them. Therefore, there is a need for us to develop new, effective solutions. Greener energy must be provided to take care of our energy needs without exposing us to toxic emissions. Roberto Hroval is a trusted expert who is popular for using special approaches and solutions to provide green technologies. As he launched Project Phoenix8, this European entrepreneur might have found a solution to our green energy challenges. With the aid of this project, there is a solution to the issues associated with waste. Project Phoenix8 does not rely on weather sources nor uses any potentially toxic nuclear energy. After a while, Roberto Hroval took the solution to another level by launching the Themis Ecosystem[2], which is a US$22 billion project. Through the Themis Ecosystem, you can reduce or eliminate harmful CO2 emissions in your personal life or family without having to make any significant lifestyle changes. It encourages people to adopt green life and nature preservation to spend less, drive electric cars, and do other things that will reduce CO2 emissions around the world. While enjoying the benefits of this project, you can also make tons of money to improve the quality of your life. Themis Ecosystem features a wide range of elements, and the Onl"

Deliberations dragged on[1] a day later than scheduled, and the final deal that was struck the Glasgow Climate Pact[2] was weakened by stubborn, last-minute compromises, such as one inserted by India that gives coal a second lease on life. So what came out of Glasgow, really? Scientists and many policymakers stress that action on climate change now is urgently needed, especially as the dire impacts of warming have thrown entire countries into disarray. Just this summer, heavy flooding[3] ravaged central China, killing more than 300 people; across the western United States, a searing heat wave strained power grids[4] and the water supply. In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reviews climate science under the auspices of the U.N., warned that the world was experiencing unprecedented levels of warming[5] that could produce irreversible damage not just heat waves, floods, and shrinking glaciers but sea level rise that will continue for centuries regardless of what policymakers decide in the next few decades. This is a 'defining decade,' said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

'If we don't have large success this decade in bending the carbon curve we will be producing an earth that looks very different in a few decades from now.' As with previous climate confabs, the reviews of COP26's achievements are mixed. While U.S. climate envoy John Kerry declared that the world was now the closest it had ever been to Â£voiding climate chaos,' others have been less optimistic, with activist Greta Thunberg criticizing its promises as 'blah, blah, blah[11].' Foreign Policy looked into where progress was made and where negotiations fell short. More action is needed to keep temperatures from rising much further. Experts have long agreed that it's crucial for levels of warming to stay below the pivotal threshold[12] of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a key objective of the 2015 Paris Agreement[13] and the point at which the risk of deadly climate disasters surges. (The world is currently 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.) In Glasgow, some countries did make strides in this direction. More than 100 countries agreed to slash their methane emissions[14] by 30 percent, relative to output in 2020 and that matters because methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas. Another 100-plus nations holding more than 85 percent of the world's forests[15] pledged to halt deforestation and land degradation by 2030. And India, one of the biggest consumers of coal, pledged to reach net-zero emissions[16] by 2070, meaning that it will no longer add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by that point.

It also provided a strong collective voice on resilience for all those globally who are working to build a more resilient world. The Resilience Hub ran alongside COP26 from 31 October to 12 November 2021.Nigel Topping, High level Champion for Climate Action at COP26, said, ""We're delighted that the Resilience Hub has been a real success and we hope that it goes from strength to strength to draw more attention and direct more resources to resilience solutions."" The report synthesises the key overarching messages that emerged from the activities of the Resilience Hub.Five overarching messages:1. Locally Led Adaptation is essential for transformative and equitable adaptation and is ripe for scaling, subject to finance access.2. There is an urgent need to increase the overall availability of quality finance for adaptation and resilience, as well as diversify financial instruments through emphasising grant-based rather than loan-based models.3. Transformative adaptation and resilience require bridging the gaps between knowledge and implementation through knowledge brokering and advancing measurement and learning.4. Nature based Solutions are key to transforming risk into resilience through integrated urban, coastal, and rural climate actions.5. Pragmatic and equitable adaptation and resilience action requires women, youth, disabled, displaced, and Indigenous peoples to be at the heart of design, decision-making, and implementation. Besides summarising the key overarching messages, the synthesis report also presents findings and insights from the three pillars of Race to Resilience: rural, urban, and coastal. The pillars shaped the programming of the Resilience Hub activities. The report also includes findings and insights from the ten themes explored during the Hub. Lastly, it aims to help set the direction for future actions towards COP27.

This included demonstrating the positive impacts of the summit on local communities and leaving a positive legacyFrom:Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MPPublished18 November 2021COP26 has achieved independent international recognition for its approach to delivering a sustainable event, attaining the ISO20121 certificate.ISO20121 is an international standard which sets out the requirements to establish, maintain and continually improve an event sustainability management system. It requires event organisers to demonstrate consideration to all key financial, economic, social and environmental factors related to planning and operations.Organisations adopting ISO20121 are required to demonstrate that they are minimising potential negative impacts on the environment, communities and local economy - maximising the positive impacts and leaving a legacy to be proud of.COP26 President Alok Sharma said:""Sustainability was at the core of COP26 and I am proud that the UK has added yet another impressive standard of environmental compliance to the event with the ISO2021 certification.""To build on our work with ISO20121, COP26 will also be a carbon neutral event and become the first COP to have achieved PAS2060 validation on carbon neutrality. This will make good on our priority to reduce and avoid emissions at the highest level.""COP26 was able to illustrate, using the ISO20121 framework, its commitment to sustainability and that the event was managed in a sustainable way.To attain the certification, the UK Government appointed Arup and Crowberry as technical sustainability advisors. BSI, British Standards Institution, provided an independent audit for certification of compliance.COP26, through the adoption and integration of the COP26 seven Sustainability Governing Principles:Actively manage potential impacts on the environment and local community and identify opportunities to deliver environmental and social value Provide an accessible and inclusive setting for allEncourage healthy livingEnsure a safe and secure atmosphereEncourage more sustainable behaviourPromote the use of responsible sources and responsible use of resources throughout the supply chainLeave a positive legacyAdditionally, the COP26 Unit has worked collaboratively with HMG teams, delivery partners and other stakeholders to embed and demonstrate how they have robustly considered all dimensions of sustainability. This includes a detailed assessment within all the operational delivery areas of the event including the Blue Zone and Green Zone Venues, Transport, Security, Suppliers, Catering and Health and Safety.Notes for editorsMore information on the actions taken to deliver a more sustainable event under our seven principles is provided on the Sustainability website, these include:Prioritising low carbon alternative energy sources such as electric and low emission vehicles, solar energy for temporary traffic lights and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) in generators, instead of diesel.Prioritising sustainability by including explicit requirements in our supplier procurements and with partners.Encouraging delegates to use active travel such as walking and cycling or public transport where possible.Catering that prioritises locally sourced, healthy and in season food items to minimise mileage for transportation and supporting local business. You can find out more about catering in our press release here.COP26.Repurposing the furniture, which was provided by Ikea UK to furnish the conference, will involve working closely with Glasgow City Council to ensure the furniture is given a second life at charity organisations and local community projects across the city. Other legacy examples include distributing the conference carpets in the temporary structures to low-income families, sending MDF sheets and cotton roof panels from the Hydro installations to wood recycling and men's shed projects in the city and turning the hundreds of metres of black backed fabric graphics into bags, pencil cases, laptop bags, and boxes.Employing local people for specific event roles.\l"

The world's top business and political figures are gathered in Glasgow this week for COP26, which is aimed at forging an ambitious new climate agreement. But Mexico's leftist leader  also known as AMLO  dismissively compared the summit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, known for its eye-watering prices and elite chin-wagging. 'These summits resemble those in Davos,' said Lopez Obrador  among the heads of state who chose not to attend  describing WEF attendees as 'technocrats and neoliberals.' The world's most powerful countries 'increase their fuel production, at the same time that they hold summits for the protection of the environment,' he said. 'And then they arrive in private planes.' 'Enough hypocrisy and fad. We must fight the massive monstrous inequality that exists in the world, that's what I will tell the UN.' Lopez Obrador, who has made only a handful of foreign trips since taking office in 2018, will travel to New York next week as Mexico takes over the presidency of the UN Security Council. 'If we want to protect the environment, we must make decisions, act, and not just talk,' he said, hailing major oil producer Mexico's decision to invest $1.3 billion a year in reforestation. The program  known as 'Sowing Life'  aims to create 15,000 jobs planting a billion trees across Mexico's 32 states.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA43","Bond Investors Can Help Hold Companies Accountable Post COP26","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 25, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.comhttp://3blmedia.com The United Nations Glasgow Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, concluded in November with 200 nations signing the Glasgow Climate Pact (GCP), an agreement that could accelerate climate action and drive big carbon cuts. COP26 First, the good news: nations' sense of urgency, unity and commitment has increased with every COP summit. As a result, the GCP represents the most ambitious climate policy declaration to date. COP26 In addition, COP26 launched several key initiatives to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accelerate the energy transition. This could translate in 2022 into stronger Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that take the world a step closer to the 1.5C target. On the emissions front, more than 100 countries joined a coalition led by the US and the European Union (EU) to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. This initiative aligns with the recommendations of the IPCC published in its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) as a path to effectively reducing GHG emissions in the near-term. According to the IPCC, methane accounts for about half of the 1.0C rise in global average temperature since the pre-industrial age. Additional highlights include: A new focus on reducing the use of coal, albeit weakened by emphasis on phasing down rather than phasing out coal power. Coal contributes 46% of global carbon dioxide emissions and accounts for nearly three-fourths of GHG emissions from electricity production. A deal to establish a new carbon market and trading scheme for offsets, comprising a bilateral system in which countries can trade credits to meet decarbonization targets, and a centralized system for offsets, with 5% of the proceeds going toward a climate adaptation fund for developing countries. A renewed pledge for developed countries to contribute at least US$100 billion annually to developing nations for transition financing. Notably, this goal has never been met since initially agreed to in 2009 at COP15. Launch of a Breakthrough Agenda, a 10-year plan to make clean technologies and solutions for power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture more affordable by 2030. Endorsement of the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use by 120 countries spanning more than 90% of the world's forests. This declaration targets stopping and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030. A pledge by more than 100 governments, regional authorities and businesses to sell only zero-emissions cars in leading markets by 2035 and globally by 2040. The agreement lacks support from many of the largest car markets, however, including China, Germany, France and most of the US. Four of the largest carmakers did not sign. Pledges Aren't Enough While the agreements and pledges arising from COP26 are laudable, they aren't enough. For one, countries' pledges for reducing carbon emissions by 2030 fall far short of the levels needed to reach the 1.5C global warming target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Instead, these 2030 targets are equivalent to 2.3C, leaving the global climate at risk, particularly for fast-rising sea levels and extreme weather events. According to the World Resources Institute, 'global emissions must drop by half by 2030 to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.' Further, huge gaps persist between countries' more ambitious climate pledges and the tangible policy steps needed to achieve them. For instance, governments have provided little clarity abouthow they'll reach their net-zero carbon targets[1], mostly set for 2050 to 2060, that promise to take global warming projections nearer to 1.8C. So how do governments plan to close the distance between their weak 2030 commitments and their net-zero ambitions? It's hard to say. This unknown has created asignificant credibility gap[2]that requiresradical collaboration among many actors[3]to narrow. Big Polluters Must Lead the Transition Away from Fossil Fuels Much of the responsibility for closing this gap lies with some of the heaviest polluters: the transportation, utility and energy sectors. But the l"

In addition, ArtScience Museum will also project the distinctive blue/green globe of the COP26 logo on its facade, reflecting the call for a greener, bluer world.Gardens by the Bay has come to epitomise sustainable technology and innovation not just across Southeast Asia but world over. In support of COP26, the world-famous 18 giant Supertrees will light up in official COP26 colours from 31 Oct to 4 Nov 2021, daily from 7pm till 12am. Details are available on the Gardens by the Bay website.The COP26Said Her Excellency Kara Owen, British High Commissioner to Singapore:As the IPPC report laid it out so starkly, our world is dangerously close to running out of time to stop a climate catastrophe. The Summit taking place in Glasgow is our chance to come together for our planet, ensuring the transition to a cleaner future is fair and inclusive. I'm delighted that Singapore landmarks such as the Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay are joining us in urging world leaders to make the right decisions, for our planet and all humanity.Gardens by the Bay Chief Operations Officer, Thomas Seow said:As a garden founded on the principles of sustainability, we are happy to support this environmental initiative by the British High Commission in Singapore.

But it was the peatlands that perhaps captured their attention the most, not only for their iconic beauty but for the role they can play in combatting climate change.While peatlands take up only around 3 per cent of global land area, they store over 33 per cent of the world's soil carbon, more than the carbon stored in all other vegetation combined.Peatlands, which are found in almost every country, are wetlands also known as bogs, fens, bofedales and swamp forests. They are home to a diverse amount of wildlife, flora and fauna and provide natural flood mitigation and water storage and filtration.For example, in the UK and Ireland alone, peatlands supply 85 per cent of all drinking water.AT , the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) coordinated the Peatland Pavilion, where technology, best practice and experiences were shared. Peatlands were featured prominently as a Nature-based Solution, with close to 50 events live-streamed on the virtual platform.The Peatland Pavilion was important, as recent decades have seen peatlands damaged and degraded by drainage, agricultural conversion, burning and mining for fuel, the result of undervaluation of its ecosystem and economic contributions.""If we are going to keep on track with the Paris Agreement goals, peatlands need to be protected and restored globally,"" said Dianna Kopansky, UNEP Global Peatlands Coordinator.""The Peatland Pavilion at COP26 was a good start, but urgent action needs to be taken now to invest in peatlands protection and restoration so that peatlands become a tool to fight climate change, rather than a contributor to it.""When peatlands are degraded they become a contributor to emissions. Protecting and restoring peatlands can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 800 million metric tonnes per year equivalent to Germany's annual emissions according to the new report Economics of Peatlands Conservation, Restoration, and Sustainable Management"", released at COP26 by UNEP and the Global Peatlands Initiative (GPI).Restoring peatlands can be complex and challenging, however: ""We are facing a capacity challenge,"" said Professor Andrew Millar, the Scottish Government's Chief Scientific Adviser for Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture. ""That applies to the entire system, to the science, to the training of drivers who need to drive the diggers that will go into the peat to start restoring it. There's also the challenge of finding out which peatlands are emitting the most and figuring out the emissions reductions you get from each type of peat.""\l"

The delegates also fanned out throughout the exhibits to attend events and panel sessions, ask questions, and engage in conversations about nuclear power.""I firmly believe that having a booth at COP26 solely for nuclear was a game-changer,"" said Paris Ortiz-Wines, one of ANS's two American delegates. ""Many people were curious, excited to see us represented, and wanted to know more about why we are not included in the debate.""Ortiz-Wines described an encounter that she and her fellow American delegate, Mark Nelson, had with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). ""In our brief interaction, Mark and I explained that as millennials, we were excited about her work and that we were here representing the American Nuclear Society, to which she responded, 'That's great!'""Nuclear for Climate and the ANS delegates were determined to draw attention to the benefits of nuclear energy. Their bright blue garb and the selfie-ready inflatable gummy bear mascot nicknamed ""Bella the Bear"" ensured success, as did a flash mob dancing to a pronuclear parody of a 1980s song in the center of Glasgow. Public buses drove down the streets of Glasgow bearing ""Net Zero Needs Nuclear"" advertisements as part of a Nuclear for Climate billboard campaign in Glasgow and nearby Edinburgh.Volunteers were quick to explain to the curious that a typical nuclear fuel pellet is about the size of a gummy bear, but a volume of uranium equal to the volume of the giant inflatable gummy bear could power Glasgow for 16 months, while it would take 40 soccer fields filled with coal to the height of a two-story building to generate the same amount of electricity.Princess ""Princy"" Mthombeni, who attended COP26 as an ANS-sponsored delegate, works in communications in South Africa's Department of Energy and is founder of Africa4Nuclear.

This will culminate in a meeting between Egypt, UAE and UK in Abu Dhabi, the first of a series of engagements between the countries ahead of COP27 and COP28.Whilst in Cairo, Mr Sharma met a wide range of Government Ministers, including Prime Minister Madbouly and Egypt's COP President-Designate, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Together they issued a UK-Egypt Joint Statement which affirms their joint commitment to accelerating the fight against climate change during this critical decade.They also agreed to continue building a partnership in 2022 that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals, in Sharm el Sheikh at COP27. This means ensuring all parties meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance.The COP President also announced the expansion of the UK Government's 'Climate Finance Accelerator' Programme to Egypt. Already successfully operating in six countries, the initiative will provide capacity-building support to promising climate projects in Egypt so that they become more bankable and appealing to investors, and can secure funding more readily.On his final day in Egypt, Mr Sharma discussed the role of the private sector in building on COP26 to achieve success at COP27, meeting with business leaders pursuing green initiatives in Egypt.COP President Alok Sharma said: was a historic, collective achievement. We kept the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees in reach and made progress on finance for climate action, adaptation and loss and damage, which will benefit countries across both Africa and the MENA region.I look forward to working with Egypt and UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively on the climate agenda. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering an ambitious COP this November which ensures urgently delivering for those most vulnerable to climate change.We all need to make further progress in 2022 and especially on delivering the $100 billion of finance and addressing investment needs in the most climate vulnerable countries. This will build on the Glasgow Climate Pact and secure a better future for us all.An important focus for COP27 and COP28 will be the completion of the first Global Stocktake. This will be a key part of assessing progress made by nations in implementing the Paris Agreement and setting out a clear roadmap towards achieving it. This formally began at COP26 and will conclude at COP28The UK is keen to share experiences of hosting a large international summit with Egypt and the UAE and the COP President has highlighted the COVID-19 testing procedures for providing a safe experience for all delegates at the recent COP26 gathering and collaboration with civil society.The COP President will now travel to the United Arab Emirates to see preparations for COP28 that will be staged in 2023 and will meet key government ministers, including the recently appointed Minister of Climate Change and Environment, HE Mariam Al Mheiri and UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change HE Dr. Sultan Al Jaber.Mr Sharma has been invited to take part in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, which gets underway tomorrow (Monday 17 January). The COP President will be involved in helping the UAE to illustrate its intentions for hosting COP28 and delivering on their climate commitments made over the last 12 months.Hosting the next two COPs in the Middle East and North Africa will enable the region to showcase to the world their innovative and profitable solutions which include renewable and low carbon energy, zero emissions transport, the role of nature based solutions and the role of smart agriculture.For example, the UAE continues to break records by reducing the costs of solar energy year after year and is delivering energy security through nuclear energy, all of which makes clean energy a more affordable option than fossil fuels.British Ambassador to Egypt, Gareth Bayley said:COP26. The strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Egypt will help sustain global momentum on climate change. I am particularly pleased that Mr Sharma launched our 'Climate Finance Accelerator' programme, which I hope will generate a series of inspiring low carbon investment opportunities in Egypt. It is this combination of public and private sector action which will help us avert a climate disaster.Local delivery is central to the CFA approach and the Embassy team is looking forward to working with the local delivery partners once they have been appointed.British Ambassador to the UAE, Patrick Moody said:The visit of COP26Together, we are already delivering solutions to achieve 'net zero' through bilateral trade and investment in clean growth and technology.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA51","COP26 Goes Into Overtime","November 12, 2021 Friday","International Oil Daily","Originally scheduled to end on Friday evening, the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow have gone into overtime, with negotiators still wrangling over a new draft agreement text that was released Friday morning. A final agreement now might not come until the early hours of Saturday or later. The last \'e2\â‚¬  conference of the parties,\'e2\â‚¬ held in Madrid in 2019, dragged on until the Sunday afternoon after the event officially ended. Fossil Fuel Row Proposals to include language in the COP26 \'e2\â‚¬  cover text\'e2\â‚¬ on phasing out coal and ending fossil fuel subsidies are among the big remaining areas of disagreement. Saudi Arabia and Australia are two of the largest countries opposing those measures. If the proposals survive to the final agreement text, it would be the first time a COP decision document directly refers to the phasing out of a fossil fuel. Those proposals had already been partly watered down in the latest negotiating text, with an earlier reference to phasing out coal changed to phasing out \'e2\â‚¬  unabated\'e2\â‚¬ coal. This leaves the door open to carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology related to coal. Similarly, a proposal to end fossil fuel subsidies was changed to ending ""inefficient\'e2\â‚¬ fossil fuel subsidies. This change was criticized by climate campaigners, who argue that any country could simply say its subsides are efficient. However, others note that for some countries ending existing discounts on fuel for poorer consumers could lead to social unrest. Keeping these two measures in the final text is a high priority for the UK, which, as COP26 host, said that consigning coal to history would be a key test of success for the climate talks. Scaling Up Ambition One other major remaining area of contention is a proposal to ask countries to come back next year with new, more ambitious climate goals to keep alive hopes of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. China is among those resisting this move, arguing that this amounts to a reopening of the Paris Agreement, which sets 2025 as the next time that countries need to update their nationally determined contributions. Another big sticking point is climate finance for poorer countries to help them transition to green energy while still growing their economies and to adapt to a changing climate and compensate for the loss and damage this causes. There has been some progress on that front, however, with observers suggesting the latest negotiating text was more balanced with stronger focus on adaptation, finance and loss and damage. This could be further built on next year at COP27 in Egypt, where finance for developing countries is likely to be one of the main items on the agenda. Carbon Markets Separate to these negotiations on the COP26 cover text are ongoing talks on Article 6, which covers carbon market. New texts on Article 6, released Friday, seem to have come closer to an agreement than ever before on several areas of contention, such as accounting rules, how proceeds from carbon trading are shared and the carryover of old Kyoto-era credits into a new global trading system. However, environmental campaigners are concerned that this could introduce loopholes that would undermine climate efforts. High drama like this is the norm rather than the exception at the end of UN climate talks, and negotiators usually reach a compromise in the end, even if the talks drag on long after their scheduled end. The final text that\'e2\â‚¬  s agreed by the COP isn\'e2\â‚¬  t the only measure of success either. Progress has also been made outside of the official talks, with groups of countries and the private sector launching several new initiatives at COP26 that could help bend the emissions curve and boost energy transition momentum.Ronan Kavanagh\l"

That's because the sanctimonious social engineers[1] who arrived by private jet to decide how to lower our standard of living[2] to demonstrate their reverence for the climate set a record with their gargantuan carbon footprint, doubling last year's output. The 2-week moonbatfest was estimated to emit about 102,500 tons of CO2[3]: [T]hat's the equivalent of total average annual emissions for more than 8,000 U.K. residents. Most of the emissions came from the jets our liberal rulers enjoy zipping around on. For once our moonbat ruling class has made a positive contribution. Carbon dioxide helps crops to grow.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA53","COP26: Key Takeaways and Action Items on Climate Change (Part I)","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 05, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com In recent weeks, there has been a lot written about the COP26 United Nations Annual Climate Change Conference, which was held in Glasgow, Scotland between October 31 and November 13, 2021. The central goal of the COP26 climate summit was to enable and encourage the parties (193 parties, including Canada, the U.S., China, and the European Union) to align on actionable steps that will put the world on a pathway towards global net zero emissions by mid-century and keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming within reach. There were many promises made at the COP26 climate summit, from countries and private-sector actors alike, but upon conclusion of the conference it remains clear that fundamentally keeping that target (1.5 degrees Celsius of warming) alive remains an uphill battle and doing so requires countries and private-sector actors to urgently put forth ambitious new climate programs and policies, including technological advances. In light of the foregoing, our expectation is that it will be critical for many players - including investors, those seeking capital, and those seeking to consummate transactions - to have strong climate change initiatives in place to seek to ensure long term sustainable growth and to seek to achieve the ambitious climate change goals set out at the COP26 climate summit. It will become increasingly imperative that business in particular take the climate change challenge to heart. As such, we will highlight, over the next series of posts, some of the key takeaways from the COP26 climate summit, including some of the significant global and multi-participant action items and frameworks that have been developing as part of the push for global alignment on climate change. Global Goals The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change. It was adopted at the COP 21 climate summit in Paris on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016. Currently, there are 193 parties to the Paris Agreement (including Canada, which ratified the Paris Agreement on October 5, 2016). Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels (the 'Global Goal'). Global Targets To achieve the Global Goal, the consensus is that global emissions must fall by 50% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and we must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 (the 'Global Targets'). Businesses from all sectors are encouraged to commit to aligning their business plans with the Global Targets. Initiatives such as the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') help drive ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set and achieve science-based emissions reduction targets in l"

A statement, issued here by the ministry, said COP26 was held in a successful manner with due recognition to Pakistan, during which useful meetings of the special assistant and the state minister with various heads of delegations, heads of international organisations, with UN bodies were held as per official schedule of meetings. During the meetings, Pakistan's green agenda was appreciated and Pakistan's pavilion was one of the busiest pavilions lauded by the several heads of delegations and international organisations, the statement said. While representing Pakistan both of them individually and jointly attended various events and highlighted the prominent initiatives of the government including Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme, Glacial Lake Outburst Flood , Climate Smart Agriculture, Protected Areas Initiatives, Clean Green Pakistan, etc., held during COP26. They maintained that they highlighted Pakistan as one of the top climate action champion countries of the world. 'The officials of MoCC attending COP26 worked day and night and were able to make COP26 a successful event for Pakistan,' said the statement. 'The success of Pakistan in COP26 can be gauged from the facts that the British government had regarded Pakistan as one of the four countries ranked as nature champions out of 196 countries in the world. Also, the UN system has declared Pakistan as one of the top three countries ranked as Forestry Leaders, among 196 countries across the Globe,' Malik Amin Aslam said while talking to Dawn. 'MNA Riaz Fityana was not part of Pakistan's official delegation and was representing a non-governmental organization without any invitation of MoCC,' said Malik Amin Aslam.

It is a conference that will likely determine what type of world we pass on to future generations.Success will ensure our children and grandchildren can prosper. Failure could spell disaster for life as we know it. Known as COP-26 for short, the United Nations Climate Conference is one of the last opportunities countries will have to come together and solve mankind's greatest challenge a challenge for its very survival.Six years ago the world saw the birth of the Paris Agreement, which was a milestone in global efforts to address climate change. It resulted in a binding agreement, uniting all nations to a common cause.But it was just the beginning. And yesterday the world began to converge on the great city of Glasgow for the COP26 the next and very crucial step on the path to preventing irreversible and catastrophic climate change.Extreme weather can be seen across the world. This summer we have seen devastating floods in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America. A year ago, Honduras was hit by two ferocious hurricanes leaving significant economic and human damage.Honduras, as a vulnerable country, has a very important voice and its example can lead others to take important steps. Many climate-vulnerable countries are leading the way in reducing emissions. I congratulate Honduras for submitting early this year its updated NDC. Until 2030, Honduras is committed to carrying out adaptation and mitigation actions in the face of climate change. The country will aim to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 16%, restoring 1.3 million hectares of forests and reducing firewood consumption by 39%.Therefore, I congratulate the Honduran delegation, led by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is in Glasgow to join forces on all these issues. Honduras has shown important leadership in the fight against climate change and I encourage the country to work constructively with partners to achieve a successful COP26.\l"

COP26 was scheduled for 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Each year since 2015, the UConn Office of Sustainability has sent a delegation of 14 students to the conference to participate, according to its website. Through various events, climate activists from UConn are able to voice their concerns about international climate action on an international scale.The UConn delegation, which attended the second week of the two week conference, engaged in panels, fairs and other grassroots events, but were largely kept out of high-profile negotiations.Michio Agresta, a fifth semester natural resources major at UConn, spoke about performative events.

If followed, the commitments made to date, including those established through the GCP, the United Nations Paris Agreement's nationally determined contributions, and others, could limit the growth of atmospheric temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The GCP serves as reminder, however, that commitments alone do not deliver the change necessary to limit climate change; without the appropriate policies, investment, and technologies, any agreements are likely to fail to achieve their stated aims.Read the analysis: HYPERLINK https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/the-results-of-cop26/https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/the-results-of- HYPERLINK cop26 /[Category: ThinkTank]Copyright Targeted News Services\l"

While it is very positive that all now accept climate neutrality, it is a big problem that there is too little ambition until 2030. It also remains problematic that a country like China does not want to be CO2-neutral before 2060, which is clearly too late. We need to act faster so that our children and grandchildren still have a chance to control climate change.""During the COP26A press conference with delegation Vice-Chair, Peter Liese (EPP, DE), and Commission Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans took place on Thursday 11 November.

But as Australia's experience shows, due to the pressures of domestic politics there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambitions in 2022.""Phase down, not outIn the final days of COP26, India, a country that relies heavily on coal and is the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, supported by the world's largest emitter China, intervened to change the final wording of the Glasgow Pact to ""phase down"" coal rather than ""phase out"".""This was an unfortunate weakening of the agreement as it dampens the urgency to shift away from coal,"" Professor Mackey said.The US climate envoy John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further to trap and store emissions underground, a position aligned with the Australian Government.""The potential of carbon capture and storage was questionable,"" Dr Hales stated. ""Even if it did become cost-effective, the process could not extract carbon emissions at the scale required to meet the 1.5 degree Paris Agreement target, there will always be some that escapes, making the technology an unviable solution.""""Additionally, very few large-scale CCS underground storage locations exist around the world and with the expense of the technology and the fact that fossil fuels are already more expensive than solar PV and wind, I just can't see it being competitive with cheap renewable energy in the short term - which is the timeframe needed for action to reduce emissions.""Some positives in the washupDespite these shortcomings, there were some notable positives from .Dr Hales and Professor Mackey said on the upside the Glasgow Pact highlighted the importance of reducing the destruction of natural ecosystems and protecting forests and biodiversity, with Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030. It also urged countries to fully deliver outstanding promises of US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage.Professor Mackey pointed to the finalisation of rules around market and non-market mechanisms for carbon offsets between countries as another crucial outcome. These rules provide the framework for countries to build collaborative arrangements to offset some of their emissions.""We will need to follow closely how these rules are implemented to ensure they increase mitigation action and don't just legitimise business-as-usual fossil fuel emissions,"" Professor Mackey said. ""While the world is not on track for the 1.5 Degree C goal, the US and China climate agreement announced in the closing days of COP26 is cause for cautious optimism.""""The fact the pact directly addresses a reduction in coal use in the final text, shows that the changes needed are possible.""""Whether we can succeed in the small and closing window left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen.""Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7680006 MSTRUCK\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA68","COP26: Key Takeaways From the Glasgow Summit","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 24, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com The Glasgow conference was praised as a huge step forward in tackling climate change, but also drew criticism for not going far enough. Between 31 October and 12 November 2021, Glasgow hosted the 26th annual Conference of Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held under the presidency of the UK. Governments, corporations, academics, social groups, and other members of civil society converged with the aim of working together at the international level to tackle climate change. The discussions culminated in the signing of the 'Glasgow Climate Pact,' a combination of pledges, commitments, and decisions made by countries that are parties to the UNFCCC and the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The private sector, NGOs, and countries outside the context of the formal UN framework also contributed a considerable range of initiatives and pledges, in a show of commitment from actors around the globe to reduce global warming. Having been in Glasgow and attended COP26, as well as participating in a number of the side events in the 'green room', we found it interesting to note the similarities and differences of the event to previous COPs (including COP21 in Paris) that we have attended. This blog post examines our key takeaways from being on the ground at COP26, including those contained within the Glasgow Climate Pact and those outside that framework, and considers the possible impacts of several proposals. Glasgow Climate Pact Target Back on 1.5 Within the Glasgow Climate Pact, countries agreed to focus on the 1.5C target, recognising that limiting global warming to 1.5C requires rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in global emissions, including reducing global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 (relative to the 2010 level). Despite the UK's stated aim ahead of COP26 to 'keep 1.5C alive', the reference to 'well-below 2C' was retained in the final version of the Glasgow Climate Pact, in an example of the compromise needed to achieve a consensus amongst all of the parties. NDCs Upon signing the Glasgow Climate Pact, parties were encouraged to submit revised or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as soon as possible before COP27 (which will take place in Egypt in November 2022).

Each Party to the Agreement must increase its climate commitments every five years and submit a new nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC.

""They know the COP26 topics cold.""Since August, students have been researching key issues that might seem obscure to a general audience, such as Article 6 of the 2015 Paris climate agreement or specific national commitments to reduce climate change.Alana Becker '23 teamed with master's degree graduate student Homari Aoki and Isabella Kong '22 to research Action for Climate Empowerment, or ACE, which promotes climate change literacy, public outreach and awareness, to focus on uplifting world communities and the next generation of climate change leaders.For years, developed countries have been under pressure to give developing countries $100 billion annually in climate financing, said Arden Podpora '23.""Progress made at COP26 brought us closer to seeing this pledge become a reality,"" she said, but $1 trillion annually may be required. ""That level of financing is unlikely to materialize anytime soon.

They went to COP26 in order to observe the ongoing negotiations between countries on how to mitigate the climate crisis.Back in Spring 2021, students were allowed to apply to be a part of this trip. The selected students then took the UNFCCC COP and the International Climate Regime class taught by Professor Kaya to prepare for their time at .Swarthmore students are able to attend these yearly conferences because the college received non-governmental organization observer status for COP in 2013. They have since sent a delegation each year, except in 2020 when the conference was canceled due to COVID-19.This year, COP26COP26 was an incredible experience. In their reflections, the students kept emphasising how enlightening it was to see the ways in which countries negotiate with one another.""To see countries' [leaders] actually speaking and sharing their positions while you're sitting right there was absolutely crazy. It was amazing,"" said Stoetzer reflecting on her time in Scotland. It was a learning experience for students unlike any other. While the days were long and busy, students found it rewarding to see in real-time all the things they read about in their classes.""It was a mind-blowing experience,"" said Hall. ""There was nothing about that week that mimicked my life at home. Everything was a learning moment, and everything you saw made you question how the world is governed. The conversations we have here at Swat were just manifested there.""Since there were so many speakers to see, events to attend, and negotiations to watch, students were able to split up and decide themselves what they wanted to do at COP26 that catered to their own interests. This meant that the students had different experiences at COP26.COP26 was essentially divided into two main events for students to attend: side panels which were held by academics, activists, and organizations, and the actual negotiations among state leaders. While the panels were open to everyone, the students on this trip quickly learned that most negotiations happen behind closed doors that not even Swarthmore's status of NGO observer opened.Only the negotiation on climate finance was open to everyone, and Stoetzer, along with Professor Kaya, attended it. The negotiation involved debate over how much money countries would raise to deal with the climate crisis.""In 2009, developed countries said they would mobilize $100 billion in climate finance by 2020. And they haven't gotten to that. Everyone has a different definition of what counts towards that amount, so the US thinks we're like 99% there. Whereas I've seen other countries say we have $40 billion,"" Stoetzer explained.States debated over how private finance, loans, and grants factor into climate finance, and if climate finance should be monitored by a bottom-up approach, where countries would define climate finance themselves, or a top-down approach, where there would be one overarching set of criteria for all countries to define climate finance.After watching days of negotiations on climate finance, Stoezter reports that there are still a lot of questions up in the air.""The outcome was to table it. Or ask another institution to define it. That's kind of what we saw there. There was a lot of tabling until next year because people couldn't reach an agreement,"" she said.Instead of attending the climate finance negotiations, Hall was much more interested in the actual climate science. She attended panels held by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which were centered around states' efforts to meet the goal of only 1.5\'b0C of warming.""This was supposed to be the COP where we got our shit together. That's what the narrative was, like it is now or never if we're going to actually hit a 1.5 or even 2\'b0C target,"" said Hall.As of now, the world is on track to warm about 2.7\'b0C by the end of the century, but that prediction gets higher with each passing year.On Wednesday, November 10, draft texts of resolutions to meet that goal of 1.5\'b0C were passed out and by midmorning, states, NGO groups, and union and trade organizations were able to ask for parts of the draft to be changed and edited. The next morning, a new draft was released with the proposed edits and the groups met again to discuss what else they wanted changed.For Hall, this was an opportunity to see what really went into climate change negotiations.""It was really interesting to see the same countries saying similar things or similar things continuing to be a concern because they haven't been addressed because they're really not that fixable when there's not enough funding for all of this,"" she said.Hall and Stoezter spent a lot of time attending organized negotiations while other students who attended the COP26 trip spent their time meeting with activists and leaders representing other communities.Balauro, who attended the first week of COP26, was especially interested in exploring the power imbalances between different nations, so he dedicated much time to hearing perspectives that were off the main stage. He participated in sessions led by people like UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Victoria Tauli-Corpuz and Secretary of State Tony Blinken. On the last day he was at the conference, Balauro attended the Fridays for the Future protest led by Greta Thunberg that demanded leaders at COP26 do more to mitigate climate change.""I'm from American Samoa - a Pacific island deeply impacted by the climate crisis, and is also under the jurisdiction of one of the second largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said in an email to The Phoenix, ""I wanted to take this unique opportunity to not only learn more about the complexities of international climate regimes, but to connect with community leaders and activists from around the world.""White, too, found his time attending protests at COP26 to be an important experience for him.""I attended one protest in Glasgow that featured a myriad of indigenous folks from the Amazon to South Dakota to environmental justice communities in the Bay Area.

The science is clear we must try to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C or the consequences will be catastrophic for human beings and for all life on earth.Following the 2019 Humanists International Reykjavik Declaration on the Climate Change Crisis, humanists remain committed to supporting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement and the work of the scientific, engineering, and activist communities around the world in tackling this crisis.We support the Multi-Faith Declaration for COP26 (published September 2021) and believe that peoples of all religions and beliefs should come together to advocate for global climate justice. Climate and nature breakdown will affect peoples of all beliefs and will not respect national boundaries. It is therefore essential that we call for determined action from governments, particularly on the following:urgent action to prevent climate change and stay below a 1.5oC temperature rise;promoting climate justice including support and funding for countries in the Global South which are most affected by climate change and have done least to cause it;a swift transition to sustainable new ways of using resources and generating energy;facilitation and promotion of low-carbon lifestyles; andfollowing the best available scientific evidence and advice and challenging disinformation about the climate crisis.We support the stated aims of the COP26 Coalition and call for urgent progress to be made at COP26.Join Humanist Climate ActionHumanist Climate Action is a volunteer-led network of Humanists UK members and supporters committed to redefining lifestyles and campaigning for policies that promote low-carbon, ethical, and sustainable living in the light of the degeneration of the Earth's climate and biodiversity.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA82","COP26 Roundup: India's Pledge, Methane Observatory","November 1, 2021 Monday","International Oil Daily","Opening Statements World leaders staked their claim to climate leadership in a series of short addresses that opened the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The opening statements illustrated key divisions among nations, including those between fossil fuel producers and major consumers, and between developed and developing countries. Many of the short opening statements seemed more focused on domestic audiences as leaders sought to appeal to a global audience as well as constituents at home. US President Joe Biden characterized the fight against climate change as a moral and economic imperative as he tries to shepherd key climate and infrastructure legislation through the US Congress. There were several important no-shows. Russia's Vladimir Putin spoke at the G20 summit but did not attend the COP26 meeting in person, delivering a recorded video message instead. China's Xi Jinping delivered a written statement to the summit \'e2\â‚¬ the only major world leader to do so. Calamitous Temperature Rise During the COP26 opening ceremony UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world is on track for a ""calamitous"" 2.7\'c2\'b0C temperature rise. Calling for a price on carbon, an end to fossil subsidies and the phase-out of coal, Guterres also suggested that countries should revise their national climate plans every year, rather than every five years. Noting the importance of net-zero emissions pledges, the UN chief said there was often confusion about what those pledges actually mean. To help overcome this, Guterres said he would establish a new group of experts to propose clear standards to measure and analyze net-zero commitments from non-state actors. India Pledges Net Zero ... in 2070 India will meet a target of net-zero emissions by 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the COP26 summit. He said India will increase its non-fossil power generation capacity to 500 GW by 2030, by which time half of its energy will come from renewable resources versus 38% last year. India will reduce its projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tons between now and 2030 and reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45%, he said. Methane Observatory The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has launched a new International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) to drive action to reduce methane emissions. Beginning with the fossil fuel sector, the observatory will produce a global public dataset of verified methane emissions. UNEP said the observatory will provide the means to prioritize actions and monitor commitments made by state actors in the Global Methane Pledge \'e2\â‚¬ a US/EU-led effort by over 30 countries to slash methane emissions 30% by 2030. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, but its atmospheric lifespan is relatively short, making it a focus of attention at COP26 as a way to achieve significant near-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Majors' COP26 Wish List Ahead of the COP26 summit Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden called on governments to ""set change in motion"" essentially by agreeing on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Calling for robust carbon pricing and a way to trade carbon credits globally, he suggested governments must play a role in helping to shape fossil fuel demand as well as supply ""using mandates where needed."" The Shell boss also flagged the importance of more ambitious and effective policies to regulate the energy sector, including clear frameworks and timel"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA85","Hunger for Sustainable Food Systems Was Unstated at COP26, Despite Plant-Based Campaign","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 20, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.comhttp://3blmedia.com by Harco Leertouwer While 20,000 delegates at COP26 tucked into dishes from menus that contained 40 per cent plant-based dishes, one butcher was keeping a watchful eye. Founder of The Vegetarian Butcher[1], Jaap Korteweg, launched a campaign in the run-up to the Conference of Parties, in the hope of highlighting the environmental impact that animal meat consumption inflicts on the planet. The 'Elephant in the Room' campaign was designed to raise awareness and generate action from leaders and policymakers in a bid to encourage more consumers to choose a plant-based diet and reduce methane emissions. Animal agriculture plays a significant role in the fight against climate change, with the livestock industry contributing between 14.5 per cent and 18 per cent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide), according to the United Nations and University of Oxford. As a result, scientists and policy advisors worldwide have recommended that animal meat consumption is significantly reduced, although a firm policy in supporting this is limited. According to the campaign, the animal meat consumption issue is lacking in European policy and was notably absent from the COP26 agenda, despite sustainable food systems playing a vital role in lowering emissions. The Vegetarian Butcher brand was created to be as close to meat as the real thing. Jaap Korteweg was a meat lover and butcher but became disillusioned with the meat industry and has set about delivering vegetarian alternatives that focus on taste and texture to produce an innovative vegetarian meat product. He said: 'We think it is important that our products are an ode to animal meat. It is a misunderstanding that vegetarians don't like meat. If people didn't like meat that much, there would be a lot more vegetarians.' COP26, but the organisation has said it was disappointed that animal agriculture and meat consumption wasn't given the airtime it requires. Nick Palmer, Head of the UK CIWF office, said: 'Following pressure from us and other campaigning organisations, agriculture was given more prominence at COP26, particularly on Nature Day, but it wasn't enough."" 'Diets are a key piece of the puzzle in solving the climate catastrophe but were largely ignored in COP26 discussions."" 'We are extremely proud of the impact we were able to have at COP26, thanks to backing from our wonderful supporters. Our stand had a constant stream of delegates visiting each day, enabling us to drive home our message which was reinforced by our powerful new report. Our press ads were positively received, and our joint statement gained media traction across Europe and beyond. Whilst global leaders have failed to emphasise the need to reduce meat consumption and the huge impact animal agriculture plays in climate change, the media certainly haven't."" 'Over the coming months, we will continue our work to influence UN bodies to ensure animal agriculture is on the agenda at COP27, in Egypt, next year, and in other key UN processes such as the United Nations Environment Assembly and the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.' Harco Leertouwer, Managing Director of Acre's European business commented: 'To say that I'm discouraged by the absence of animal meat consumption from the COP26 agenda would be an understatement, but that's not to suggest that I'm not hopeful. By casting a spotlight on the vital role that sustainable food systems can play in lowering emissions, we're also continuing to acknowledge the fact that we don't need everyone to be perfectly sustainable."" ""As someone who has spent the better part of his life consciously opting into a more sustainable diet, I know first-hand how enriching plant-based options can be. It's a small change to the way I eat that makes an invaluable contribution to our climate - and that's the kind of thinking plant-based campaigns promote. That's the kind of thinking we need to capitalise on - whether it's on the COP agenda or not.'

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA87","A New Idea Emerges at COP26","December 3, 2021 Friday","American Institute For Economic Research","In November, 2021, 180 world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland for , the United Nations' annual climate summit. But once the wheels of their private jets had touched down on domestic tarmac, it was unclear what exactly this fortnight of doomsday lecturing had accomplished. Professional truant Greta Thunberg eloquently summarized the event as ""blah, blah, blah,"" and advised we ""shove [the] climate crisis"" in a place where the Sun won't be warming it. Though Thunberg's criticisms are neither principled nor practical - instead predicated on a catch-all blame game of ""colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression"" - her insults ring true. For sensible solutions to take the place of big state spending, a fair-trade, energy-independent focused conservatism must set the agenda for climate and national security conversations at COP27.Commitments from past conferences have been vague utopian visions of abolishing emissions, which avoid amounting to actual solutions, and are unilaterally enforced. The Paris Accords didn't penalize China for neglecting to meet targets, and weren't necessary for President Trump to make America simultaneously energy independent, and the leading nation in reducing emissions by 2019. COP26 was a chance to correct the record with binding resolutions which put market solutions to the forefront of international conservation efforts. One of these new approaches was the pledge to end global deforestation by 2030 which was signed by more than 100 countries. While the pledge itself is more a signalled intention than prescribed path, the recognition of the importance of forests as natural carbon sinks was significant. Trees sequester carbon when alive, but also release it when cut down; with deforestation accounting for 8 to 10 percent of carbon emissions globally.\~Unfortunately, deforestation is expediently profitable in the countries with the richest forests. Countries like Brazil don't have the enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with top-down mandates, so illegal logging runs rampant. And who can blame them? With the government short of a stick, farmers and loggers would refuse to comply with regulations that would rot the carrot of improved living conditions. Indonesia - which has one of the world's highest deforestation rates - backed out of this pledge just a few days after they signed it, citing its ""unfair[ness]."" At the Global Conservative Climate Summit, the Honorable Werani Chilenga, MP from Malawi, reiterated how infeasible forestry policies dictated to developing nations are, when energy infrastructure in Malawi isn't sufficient to get the population to move from charcoal to coal, let alone wind and solar. We can't expect the poor to sacrifice their lives and livelihoods for our politicians' sudden apocalyptic obsession.\~Markets are the solution to the impotence of centralised state edicts, specifically carbon markets. Significant progress was made at , where politicians ratified Article 6 of the Paris Accords and established a framework for a global carbon market. Governments and private entities can trade carbon globally by allocating ownership and property rights to carbon usage. This enables compensation to be made available for farmers for protecting carbon sinks like the Amazon Rainforest. If these markets remain free from eco-authoritarianism - like intentions to cap consumer choice according to an individual's carbon footprint - they will provide politicians and businesses new trade tools to lower our environmental footprint while raising economic output. As the Kuznets curve and every socialist state demonstrate, no nation got more eco-friendly by being poorer.Predictably, the presence of market solutions to conservation challenges wasn't well-received by environmental activists. Thunberg called the concept ""a dangerous climate lie"" that ""??give(s) polluters a free pass to keep polluting."" It's hard to take the Swedish schoolgirl seriously, though, when Rwanda's environmental minister called these markets ""economically vital"" to the future of developing nations. Paradoxically, Greta has lost faith in top-down climate action - releasing a video with the New York Times titled ""Greta Thunberg Has Given Up On Politicians."" Fortunately, the market solutions she baselessly hates will work in practice while she marches unproductively in the streets, and can give her an alternative cause to pin her hopes on.Chronic hostilities between climate activists and capitalism remain barriers to instituting actionable market solutions. Eco-socialism has dominated the debate for so long, conceptualising the Earth as one big worker, turning while man extracts profit from it until it is barren and burned. But if this conference was any indication, that might be coming to an end. Centre-right politicians and private innovators showed up to COP26 in an unprecedented way. A delegation of five Republican representatives attended the conference, building on the momentum of the creation of the Conservative Climate Caucus just a few months ago in the House of Representatives. Fringe events like the Youth Environment Summit and Global Conservative Climate Summit platformed market perspectives, despite being excluded from the UN's Glasgow ""Green Zone."" In the case of the latter, conservatives elected from five different continents gathered to discuss the future of climate policy. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero was also announced at COP26, gathering 150 global financial corporations to mobilize $130 trillion in investment for clean energy and climate projects.By reframing the debate as an imperative to empower state-level community-based conservation and to ensure energy independence during the gas and battery Cold War with China and Russia, there is enough market activity and political will on the right to ensure socialism isn't smuggled in under the guise of a climate crisis. Most Republicans recognize that the market always provides the best solutions to the challenges humans have faced. Pollution, deforestation, and moving from fossil fuels sold by America's enemies are no different. This is why it is so crucial that believers in the market confidently take a seat at the table to champion solutions rooted in economic freedom.\~The primary impediments to sensible climate action are political gridlock by ideological Democrats, and counterproductive activism from indoctrinated schoolkids. Conservatives showed up at COP26 to indicate that a constructive alternative to alarmist rhetoric exists. At COP27, it's time that we attended in full force, and told the UN to let the adults do the talking.\l"

""It's an amazing experience to sit up front at this critical global conference.""But Chatrchyan more than sits. She works to shape United Nations policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing carbon sequestration and adaptation through the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA), a U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) workstream formally established in Bonn, Germany, at COP23 in 2017.Chatrchyan was one of seven Cornell researchers and partners attending the conference this week; eight more faculty will go next week. is the annual U.N. conference striving to forge ambitious agreements to avert further climate change.At the KJWA sessions, part of COP26, delegates from every country that is party to the 2015 Paris Agreement are sharing information on how to scale up agricultural climate change mitigation and adaptation to protect food security. ""The work that I'm doing in the KJWA process on behalf of Armenia is to make sure that their needs related to soil carbon sequestration, livestock management, agroforestry, food security, and climate change adaptation are heard at the global level,"" said Chatrchyan, who gave a presentation at a KJWA workshop in December 2020 on key socioeconomic barriers that limit agricultural transformation. ""And these are issues about which Cornell can provide some of the best research in the world.""Chatrchyan's expertise with climate change and agriculture stems from her work at Cornell, where she leads the Cornell Climate Smart Farming ( HYPERLINK http://climatesmartfarming.org/For several years, Chatrchyan and Natalie Mahowald, the Irving Porter Church Professor in Engineering, have taught Global Climate Change Science and Policy (EAS 4443/5443), a capstone course for environmental sciences majors and graduate students.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA89","Priorities for Africa at COP26 and beyond","Africa Renewal"," ","Jean-Paul Adam, from Seychelles, is the director of Technology, Climate Change and Natural Resources Division at the UN Economic Commission for Africa. He spoke to Wanjohi Kabukuru for Africa Renewal about Africa's priorities at the global climate talks (COP26) taking place in Glasgow during 31 October to 12 November 2021:Africa Renewal: What are Africa's priorities at the COP26 and why?Jean-Paul Adam: Climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building are indeed the priorities that are being put forward to . The finance conversation is a big one because it is, in a sense, the prerequisite for many of the other things to happen, including technology transfer. The mobilisation of finance to tackle climate change, particularly for adaptation, is as urgent as ever.African advocacy to ensure that previous commitments are honoured will be critical. Ultimately, we cannot divorce the climate resilience agenda from the development agenda. We cannot have one without the other. However, the biggest missing piece in the puzzle is up-front financing.Developed countries pledged US$100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. Where are we on this?It is frankly absurd that we have trillions of dollars being mobilized in pandemic-related stimulus but the $100 billion is yet to be paid, and yet as a percentage of the $20 trillion mobilised by developed countries to tackle COVID-19 it is frankly negligible.The $100 billion is only a portion of what is needed to deal with climate change, and it should be reviewed urgently to match the extent of the financing gap. Even with more innovative financing models being undertaken, the new financing instruments should not replace the promised $100 billion per year.We must also use this moment in history to redefine how we look at development - where look beyond GDP per capita, and address the underlying factors that affect vulnerability of countries. This is particularly relevant for Small Island Developing States (SIDS).African countries are taking proactive stances and committing to move to renewable energy pathways and invest in their own resilience. Many countries are already net positive and absorb more emissions than they create. African countries are ambitious in terms of the low carbon development models they wish to adopt. What is missing is the investment to unlock this opportunity.One of the key elements of COP26 is that Africa remains excluded from a lot of the financing available under climate change. Private markets are insufficiently developed to channel much needed investment into African climate resilience projects, and this would be a key part of the solution.Given African countries' debt burden, what other options are there to boost financing?Debt issues are a challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic context where fiscal space for all African countries continues to be constrained, and countries are unable to service their debt with diminishing revenues.However, opportunities are emerging for innovative finance. There is a need to have private sector investments as part of the solution bringing in innovative financial mechanisms such as blended finance, green and blue bonds, and debt swaps, which can leverage limited public resources to mobilize huge investments needed for climate action. For instance, we welcome the recent comments from the World Bank indicating interest in developing frameworks for debt-for-climate adaptation swaps [debt relief in exchange for countries taking climate action].Africa's economy of the future must be resilient to risks of further climate change and ecological damage. By prioritizing nature-based solutions and advocating for a fair developmental price for carbon at COP26 in Glasgow, there is opportunity to mobilise further resources for Africa's green and blue economy.Can you speak more about the green and blue bonds?Green and blue bonds are opportunities that have been used in developed markets for many years but unfortunately, Africa today has less than 1% of the green and blue bond market globally. Properly tapping into this opportunity for market-based investments can turn billions into trillions.Some countries have successfully issued green and blue bonds. Egypt issued a bond in renewable energy in 2020 and Seychelles issued a blue bond in 2018. The idea is to provide financing at cheaper rates linked to investment in climate resilience.Blue bonds are associated with the blue economy and oceans. How are they linked to climate change action and sustainable development?Climate change has taught us great lessons about the oceans. We cannot just say 'let us take everything and exploit it'. Many countries have experienced coral bleaching which has immediate impact on fish stocks. A warming ocean affects the migration of key species such as tuna. The sea is not just a space for exploitation, it is a space for development. It is a space to connect countries, it is about trade routes, connectivity, environmental protection, tourism, natural resources, fisheries and the entire ocean view. This is the blue economy.The concepts of a green economy or a blue economy are precisely aimed at ensuring that the health of the natural eco-system is properly factored into the economic activities which generate wealth. For us, the blue economy is about creating a new economic paradigm for African countries - beyond extraction for export - and rather about sustainably building value chains that are grounded in astute management of the oceanic natural resources. There are many opportunities in the sea and the blue economy is a key part of sustainability. In a sense, the blue economy approach allows Africa to reclaim its oceans.The race to net-zero places emphasis on a 'just transition'. What does this mean and how it will affect Africa?The 'just transition' simply means that we have to recognize that Africa is starting from a lower base in terms of the move towards the low-carbon economy. Africa is not yet industrialised, meaning that the changes that are needed may actually see more disruptions in society. We should not make the most vulnerable people pay. We have to take an approach that is pro-development, pro-poor and which ultimately allows the maximum number of people to be able to exit poverty and have a good quality of life.The priority for Africa's industrialisation is access to electricity. The good news is that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy generation available and therefore it makes sense for Africa to invest in renewables. Nevertheless, we must recognize that in certain circumstances, improving base generation capacity may require additional investment in fossil fuels to allow increased renewables or be brought onl"

'The scale up must be enormous and supported by a variety of financial instruments in addition to grants. Moreover, it will be necessary to get very close to the USD 100 billion goal before COP27 to prevent a trust gap between the parties.'Glemarec pointed out the COP26 challenges: emission gap, adaptation gap, and finance gap. A fourth at risk of emerging was a credibility gap between developed and developing countries due to the USD 100 billion climate finance goal that is yet to be met. He also noted the risk of credibility gap towards the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process.Lord Nicholas Stern, Professor of Economics and Government and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE), remarked the status of scale regarding the climate agenda. He emphasised the deepening in its general understanding since the Paris Agreement in 2015 that has now led to net-zero commitments.'We see an enriched understanding that goes beyond emissions and takes into consideration biodiversity and protection of ecosystems - and that is directly linked with a breakthrough in technologies,' Stern noted. 'Moreover, the scale up of people was evident at COP26. It saw massive participation from the private sector and the presence of several prime ministers and heads of states, which was not always the case with previous COPs.'Amal-lee Amin, Director of Climate Change at CDC Group, stressed three dimensions gleaned from COP26The link between the climate agenda and scaling up climate finance was highlighted by Amar Bhattacharya, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute.

However, based on where it leaves us somewhere between 1.9C and 2.5C of warming it would be easy to conclude that COP26 was a failure. The agreement is undoubtedly an unsatisfactory compromise that reflects vested and short-term political interests. But does it give us a better chance of avoiding a climate catastrophe? Is limiting global heating below 2C now more possible, or was it just more ""blah, blah, blah?"" And given that the UNFCCC was established with the aim of ""stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations...at a level that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,"" has the UN process itself failed to deliver what's required?Before reflecting further, it's worth revisiting the context.The fact is global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have risen continuously since the industrial revolution, and continue to accumulate at about 50 billion tonnes of CO2e per year (despite a slight reduction as a result of the pandemic). This has already led to a global mean temperature rise of 1.1-1.2 degrees, which the IPCC estimates could pass 1.5C by the mid-2030s unless drastic action is taken. Crucially, the IPCC warned that exceeding 1.5 degrees would be much more dangerous than previously thought, and emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 to hit net zero by 2050.Yet despite this, the Paris pledges and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) were set to increase global emissions by 16% by 2030, according to the UNFCCC's recent synthesis report, equating to a temperature rise of 2.7C. Given the above, and the world's economic disparities and dependence on fossil fuels, it is questionable whether COP26 ever had any real chance of success.So how far did the COP get?The Glasgow Climate Pact reaffirmed the Paris goal of limiting global temperature rise to ""well below 2C and if possible, under 1.5C above pre-industrial levels,"" and made moves towards ""keeping 1.5 alive"" by stating that signatories would ""pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C,"" including ""reducing global carbon dioxide (only) emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century,"" as well as calling for ""deep reductions in other greenhouse gases.""Nevertheless, one of the key tasks for COP26 was to raise ambition by way of national targets, the UNFCCC Synthesis Report on NDCs having concluded in February that these were not on track to meet the Paris goal. It was disappointing then, that less than half of countries submitted five-year updates in time for the COP, only increasing to around three quarters by its end. On the plus side, signatories agreed to strengthen their 2030 targets in 2022 (instead of five years' time) and there is to be an annual ministerial round table on pre-2030 ambition from COP27 on, adding more urgency and giving room for optimism.Also positive, was finalising Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which clarifies the rules around carbon markets and should support international cooperation on NDCs, as well as helping drive investment in mitigation activity, including new technology.Much was made by the UK Government of COP26 securing ""the end of coal"", and whilst the Pact included action on coal for the first time, the wording of the agreement was watered down in the final stages from 'phasing out' to 'phasing down' unabated coal, and from phasing out fossil fuel subsidies to phasing out inefficient ones.There were commitments to significantly increase financial support from developed to developing countries, including via the Adaptation Fund, despite richer nations having thus far failed to channel the US$100 billion per year agreed at COP15 in Copenhagen. This is important because the world won't limit heating to less than 2C without these countries fully on board. COP26 also established a dialogue on so-called ""loss and damage"" from the current impacts of climate change, though funding was not forthcoming for this from the US or EU. The Pact also makes reference to the Climate Finance Delivery Plan led by Canada and Germany.There were also many initiatives alongside COP, including an agreement to cut methane emissions by 30%, which nearly 100 countries signed up to; a commitment by 130 countries to end and reverse deforestation by 2030; a cement and steel industry carbon emissions reduction agreement; a pledge to accelerate the adoption of green hydrogen; and the setting up of a new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), tasked with producing global reporting standards, with a focus on carbon.At the COP's Finance Day, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced plans for the UK to become the world's first net zero aligned financial centre and to set up a Transition Plan Taskforce to support the new requirement for net-zero transition plans, which all UK financial institutions and public listed companies will be required to publish. This follows the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy and a series of UK policy announcements made in the run-up to COP. There were also new commitments announced from coalitions such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which brought together around 450 institutions in 45 countries, aiming to align $130 trillion of financial assets with decarbonisation goals.At the same time, we're seeing market signals such as Shell's decision to pull out of the Cambo oil field development, based on the economic case no longer being strong enough, and Ford's stock price soaring on announcing its $30bn investment in EV. The number of businesses signing up to the Race to Zero Campaign and associated science-based targets commitments to near-term targets and Scope 3 emissions reporting, is also cause for optimism.So whilst the nations of the world collectively drag their feet, the institutional investment community would seem to be moving forward apace and has the potential to drive real change. In the words of Mark Carney, ""the architecture of the global financial system"" is being ""transformed to deliver net zero,"" so that ""every financial decision takes climate change into account."" Whether this, coupled with an era of greater business purpose and transparency, will result in emissions coming down fast enough, only time will tell.What are the implications for business?Despite COP's failings, the commitments made and the associated public and private sector initiatives, make the direction of travel crystal clear. Quite simply, those businesses not planning for net zero will find themselves under more pressure, become increasingly unsustainable and face challenges on multiple fronts, including legislative, investment, competition and in terms of social licence to operate.This will be partly driven by what some are calling a new era of transparency. As mentioned, UK listed companies will not only need to report emissions, but they will have to publish their plans for net zero. And as the emphasis moves to science-based, near-term targets, and reporting Scope 3 emissions, suppliers will come under greater pressure to report and reduce their emissions if they want to retain business. Companies will also find their ""carbon credentials"" coming under greater scrutiny when seeking finance or investment.Importantly, it is business and industry that will have to deliver the change that governments have agreed they need to happen, ultimately transforming investment into a net zero economy and society. The need to speed up this delivery between now and 2030 came through loud and clear in Glasgow and will be felt more acutely going forward. And whilst interventions in the economy will be needed to make this happen, delivery will increasingly become the focus.For businesses then, climate change is fast becoming the biggest risk and biggest commercial opportunity. COP26 is one key part of the jigsaw but the investment markets, and the companies they invest in, may turn out to be the most significant driver of change from here on out. For those businesses that haven't, now is the time to re-assess climate risk and invest and innovate to benefit from the inevitable transition that's coming whether in new products, new market opportunities or completely new business models.What to do nowDespite its painfully slow progress, COP26 should be seen as a watershed moment. And a justification, if another were needed, for step-change as opposed to incremental and immediate action as opposed to long term goals.My advice to businesses, post would be:Take a science-based approach. Establish short-term targets. Invest strategically to achieve them. Measure and communicate progress. Expect your carbon reduction commitments to be ahead of your current capacity to deliver them. Now is the time to catch up.Think about leadership and governance: the best-laid plans will fail if not incentivised from the top down and supported from the bottom up. C-suite leadership, carbon reduction integrated into the business strategy, incentivised delivery.Learn from, educate and collaborate. With staff, customers and suppliers. Engage in pre-competitive collaboration within your industry. The transition to net zero will take place across the value chain but it will be brought about by individuals playing their part within it.Grasp the opportunities. Think of your business as part of the emerging future economy. Act strategically to develop new market opportunities. Examine the potential for a more sustainable business model. Start investing in the transformation to a net zero business and embedding future value.Keep a watching brief. Change is happening and likely to speed up don't get left behind! Expect to see more announcements from the government and potentially on the international stage as the UK continues its COP presidency until November 2022.Seek help! Making a successful transition can be a steep learning curve for many businesses but there's no need to re-invent the wheel. And not all companies will have the right skills in-house. A focus on getting it right in terms of strategy, performance and communication is key. It's not all straight forward but with appropriate expert support, net zero is achievable.COP26 was a global 'staging post' and a gathering point for government, business and civil society. We must hope it will also be a historical turning point. The challenge for all of us is to keep up the momentum and transition to net zero as quickly and equitably as possible.\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA94","COP26 and the Global Race to Net Zero","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 05, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com World leaders and delegates are meeting in Glasgow for the next round of climate change negotiations at the twenty sixth Conference of the Parties (""COP26"") being held from 31 October to 12 November, following a year-long postponement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. COP26 serves as the vital next step in the process for the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (""UNFCCC"") to implement the legally binding international climate treaty - the Paris Agreement - which was adopted at COP21 in Paris on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016.1 Its goal is to limit global warming such that the global average temperature rises by no more than 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels or, failing that, by no more than 2C (3.6F),2 in order to prevent the catastrophic and irreversible anthropogenic climate change that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") projects will occur if this is not achieved.3 In July 2020, COP26 President Alok Sharma set out five key areas of focus in the run-up to COP26: the first was energy, followed by transport, nature-based solutions, adaptation and resilience and, tying it all together, finance.4 There is widespread consensus that an energy transition grounded in reliable sources and technologies is the only realistic way to meet the Paris Agreement goals. WEO-2021: The Guidebook for COP26 The International Energy Agency published its World Energy Outlook Report in October 2021,5 a month earlier than usual so as to be in circulation ahead of COP26 (the ""WEO-2021""); it self-proclaims to serve ""as an essential guidebook to COP26"". This COP, short for the ""Conference of the Parties"", the main decision-making body of the UNFCCC, is particularly significant. It falls five years after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and is arguably the first critical opportunity to test the readiness of countries to submit new and more ambitious carbon reduction commitments, by way of updates to their Nationally Determined Contributions, previously agreed to under the 2015 Paris Agreement. It is also an opportunity, as the WEO-2021 states, to provide an ""unmistakeable signal"" that accelerates investment in a sustainable future and the transition to clean energy worldwide. According to the WEO-2021, the energy sector accounts for three-quarters of the greenhouse gas emissions globally that have already caused global average temperatures to rise 1.1C higher than pre-industrial levels, with visible impacts on weather and climate extremes. The energy sector therefore has to be at the heart of the solution to tackling the climate crisis. It is widely recognised that a new global energy economy is emerging, but the transformation still has a long way to go. The baseload of energy in the early stages of the transition will be provided by gas, wind and nuclear, and the ultimate long-term objective is an efficient mix of energy sources that can provide secure and affordable renewable energy at scale. The WEO-2021 warns that the rapid but uneven economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession is putting major strains on parts of today's energy system, sparking sharp price rises in natural gas, coal and electricity markets and, for all the advances being made by renewables and electric mobility, 2021 is seeing a large rebound in coal and oil use. As a result, according to WEO-2021, 2021 has seen the second largest annual increase in CO2 emissions in history. In the run up to COP26, increasingly ambitious carbon emission reduction pledges have been made by some governments, municipalities, companies and financial institutions. The WEO-2021 suggests that countries pledging to reach net zero emissions now account for 60 - 70 per cent of today's global GDP and energy-related CO2 emissions, and around one-third of energy-related methane emissions; a promising step in the right direction on the journey to net zero. A Rapid, Just and Secure Energy Transition It is widely acknowledged that the pace of transition away from fossil fuel-powered assets to cleaner and renewable generation assets needs to accelerate. Predictions suggest a four-fold acceleration over the next decade is required if the Paris Agreement targets of reducing global temperature rises to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels and the shift to net zero are to be achieved. The barriers and challenges to the energy transition are no doubt different for developed countries and developing countries. Developing countries that have historically contributed a small proportion of global greenhouse emissions are in many cases trying to industrialise (often reliant on carbon intensive industries) so that, amongst other things, their citizens have universal energy access, and yet are being expected to transition at the same pace as developed countries, without the financial and technical resources needed to get there. For example, excluding South Africa, the remaining 1 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa are serviced by a power generating capacity of around 80 gigawatts and have contributed less than 1 per cent of cumulative CO2 emissions. This is roughly the same capacity consumed by a single European country such as Germany.6 It is widely accepted that a rapid and just transition to clean energy, at both international and national scales, is vital. The WEO-2021 emphasises that countries' transitions have to be ""secure, affordable and fair for all citizens"", and in this vein, the UK recognises that the energy transition should be undertaken in a manner that is fair and equitable to those currently working in and supporting the carbon-intensive oil and gas industries. According to the WEO-2021, current investment levels in the global energy sector are inadequate - both to meet near-term energy needs and long-term transition goals. It warns that the dangers inherent in today's shortfall in spending on the clean energy transition globally, compared to the levels required, cannot be understated; and the shortfall is most pronounced in developing economies. An acceleration of capital flows in support of the energy transition, and particularly in developing economies, is needed. It is recognised that such investment will need to come from private developers, consumers and financiers responding to market signals and policies set by governments. Powering Past Coal In most markets, the cost of renewable energy such as solar PV and wind is now cheaper than coal and there is increasing pressure to phase out coal worldwide. COP President Alok Sharma has called for COP26 to ""consign coal to history"" and the Powering Past Coal Alliance (""PPCA"") is one of the primary vehicles that is facilitating achievement of this goal at COP26 and beyond.7 Initially created by the governments of the United Kingdom and Canada in 2017, the PPCA is today a coalition of more than 130 members including countries,cities, banks and utilities committed to phasing out unabated coal power, and to ending the international financing of new coal plants, and the PPCA-led momentum has gained apace in 2021. The UK has also launched the COP26 Energy Transition Council (""ETC"") as part of its COP26 presidency, which aims to bring global leadership together to accelerate the transition to clean power. In its first statement in December 2020,8 the ETC confirmed its plans to seek opportunities, inter alia, (i) to make clean power technologies the preferred option for countries investing in new power generation, with the aim of doubling the rate of investment in clean power by 2030, and (ii) to develop policy and regulatory frameworks to attract the private sector to help deliver and finance these investment needs. The Evolving Role of the Oil & Gas Industry: Investment and Accountability The oil and gas industry increasingly recognises that, in order to survive long term, it must reimagine how it will fit into the energy mix going forward. Oil and gas majors, including BP9and Shell,10are increasingly announcing their net zero emission pledges at a company level and are becoming ever more central players in the clean energy and transport markets as they explore investment opportunities to diversify their portfolios and reposition themselves in the energy industry. Globally, the oil and gas industry is central to actively driving the transition to a cleaner and broader energy mix, with a pivotal role at the forefront of developing and investing in much needed new carbon abatement technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage (""CCUS""), that other industries can deploy whilst keeping the lights on. CCUS represents a game changer for the oil and gas industry, allowing oil and gas majors to keep producing oil, albeit with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and oil and gas majors are well positioned to drive developments in hydrogen given their expertise in transporting and selling gas.11 As more oil and gas majors declare their plans and strategies to achieving net zero, accountability - to regulators around the world, to other oil and gas companies, to shareholders and investors, to the workforce and to the general population in the societies in which they operate - will be critical, as these stakeholders become ever more concerned about the environmental impact of their own investments, the industry within which they work, and/or the energy they consume.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA95","Five Takeaways from the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26)","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 19, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com [co-authors: Shawn Whites and Samendra Pasad] Reflecting back on the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or 'COP26,' it may well become known as the 'Pledge and Commitment COP.' Governments, businesses, multilateral institutions and civil society focused their two weeks in Glasgow on how to 'get things done' to limit the planet's rising temperatures to 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. The apparent solution: pledges and commitments. Now comes the hard work: adhering to these pledges and commitments, with clearly defined milestones, in a transparent and accountable manner to ensure environmental integrity. At previous COPs business was present, yet its impact on the holistic outcomes were secondary. Historically, government negotiations over official decisions and specific nuances in the text dominated the energy and interest of businesses and civil society, who served as 'observers' to the UNFCCC process. Certainly, COP26 had its opportunities for diplomacy and single words do matter e.g., phase out vs. phase down in relation to coal power but in Glasgow, business played an outsized role inside the official 'Blue Zone,' as well as across Scotland at privately sponsored forums, roundtables and parties. There was a sense, despite the protests, that the business and environmental communities are working more in concert with governments toward common goals. Private sector driven climate action took on a life of its own with an incredible momentum irrespective of the technical outcomes that reflect clearer plans of action and a greater potential long-term success to meet the aspirations of the Paris Agreement. In our COP26 preview alert[1], we expected methane, money, markets, partnerships and nature to dominate the agenda. delivered in each of these areas, with several notable surprises. We present a snapshot of five important high-level takeaways below, and look forward to diving deeper into these issues in the weeks to come. Five Takeaways Climate finance, including accountability and 'loss and damage,' prominently figured into the negotiations Despite increased finance pledges just prior to COP26,1[2]developed countries fell short of their decade-old commitment to jointly provide $100 billion annually in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. As such, there was a heightened emphasis at COP26 on how and when developed countries will deliver on this commitment. This emphasis is reflected in the primary COP26 decision document, the Glasgow Climate Pact[3], which reaffirms developed countries' commitment to 'fully deliver' on the '100 billion goal through to 2025,' while also calling for governments to provide greater clarity on the implementation of their finance commitments. Climate finance was also a focal point of new pledges and commitments that occurred outside the context of formal negotiations. As we prognosticated, governments pledged new limitations on fossil fuel finance. The United States and 38 other countries, for example, issued a joint statement[4] committing to end new direct public support for the international 'unabated' (i.e., without carbon capture and storage) fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, 'except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5C warming limit.' New pledges and commitments on domestic and international coal financing were also announced, which we assessed here[5] and here[6]. Further, the Glasgow Climate Pact[7] 'calls upon' parties to accelerate actions toward the 'phase-out' of 'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.' While this new and caveated language elicited equal parts criticism and optimism, we note that eliminating even a small percentage of the estimated $6 trillion[8] in global fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 would represent a major step toward achieving the 1.5C limit. COP26 also saw unexpected finance commitments directed to climate adaptation, a historically underfunded slice of the climate finance pie. For example, the Adaptation Fund which finances projects and programs to help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change received a 'record-shattering' $356 million[9] in new government support, including a first-time $50 million contribution from the United States. Elsewhere on adaptation finance, 12 governments pledged $413 million[10] in new climate resilience funding for the 46 Least Developed Countries, and the U.S. Agency for International Development launched[11] a Green Recovery Investment Platform that will invest up to $250 million to mobilize $2.5 billion of private finance for adaptation and mitigation by 2027. Finally, as expected, the debate around funding for 'loss and damage' resumed with heightened intensity at COP26. While a group of 46 Least Developed Countries most vulnerable to climate change advocated[12] for a new 'Loss and Damage Facility' to be included among the conference's final decisions, parties to the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed instead to establish a new 'Glasgow Dialogue' to discuss potential Â£rrangements for the funding of activities.' Parties agree to rules for market and non-market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement After years of complex negotiations, parties managed to agree on a 'rulebook' for implementing the market-based cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The rulebook is reflected in two decisions: (i) Article 6.2 guidance[13] on bottom-up, bilateral or regional approaches involving the use of 'internationally transferred mitigation outcomes;' and (ii) Article 6.4 rules, modalities and procedures[14], governing a new centralized United Nations (UN) market mechanism akin to the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).2[15] The Article 6 rulebook provides a platform for the scaling-up of carbon markets across the globe e.g., by enabling greater linkages between countries' emissions trading systems, or by creating demand for a new category of high-quality 'Article 6-compliant' carbon credits for trading in the voluntary carbon markets. For a deeper dive into key elements of the rulebook and implications for carbon markets in Singapore, see our colleagues' analysis here[16]. Transportation, including aviation and shipping, remains a key area of emphasis for mitigating emissions 's 'Transport Day' centered on emission reductions from motor vehicles, including cars, vans, trucks and public transport. In the lead-up to 'Transport Day,' 154 signatories including national and local governments, automotive manufacturers, fleet owners and operators, investors and financial institutions issued[17] a Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% Zero Emission Cars and Vans. This Declaration sets a nonbinding goal to ensure that all new cars and vans sold by 2035 (in 'leading markets') or 2040 (throughout the rest of the world) are zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The next day, the Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council, a forum of governments with large automotive markets, announced[18] its 2022 priorities intended to meet the Paris Agreement's climate goals and accelerate the growth of the zero-emission automobile market. The Council's four priorities are to: Spur greater investment in ZEV charging infrastructure in collaboration with the private sector and in such a way that allows electricity grids to support increased charging demands. Support the deployment of light- and heavy-duty ZEVs through carbon dioxide or fuel efficiency standards and regulations. Reach a stronger consensus on the pace of the transition and technology choices for zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. Ensure a 'truly global' ZEV transition that includes engagement with developing countries, development assistance, and evidence-based, action-focused recommendations for strengthening international programs. Notwithstanding the attention given to motor vehicles, which account for over 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, COP26 also ended with commitments in the transportation sector's next two largest emitting categories: aviation and shipping. With respect to aviation, a group of 23 countries across all continents committed[19] to strengthening the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global market-based framework intended to keep carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation at their 2020 levels. Importantly, these countries also committed to promoting the development and deployment of (1) sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions while avoiding competition with food production; and (2) innovative low- and zero-carbon aircraft technologies that reduce aviation emissions. During the COP, the United States released its Aviation Climate Action Plan[20], applying the Biden-Harris administration's whole-of-government approach to 'put the sector on a path toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050,' emphasizing SAF and innovative technologies. As for shipping, a group of 22 countries supported[21] a goal of establishing so-called 'green shipping corridors,' defined as zero-emission maritime routes between two or more ports. These countries aim to establish at least six such corridors by the 'middle of this decade' through partnerships with ports and operators to accelerate decarbonization of the shipping sector. COP26's aviation and shipping commitments included a number of African, Asian, European and South and North American countries, but did not include key players like China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Russia and Mexico. Nature and biodiversity garnish significant attention, but operative provisions ultimately omitted in Glasgow Climate Pact The Glasgow Climate Pact omitted any significant nature- or biodiversity-based obligations, instead merely emphasizing the importance of ecosystem protection, conservation and restoration. Still, the convention featured a number of high-level initiatives likely to push capital and financing toward efforts to protect natural capital and biodiversity without compromising climate progress, including: The United States' Global Forests Conservation Plan, which focuses[22] on halting deforestation and nature degradation in critical ecosystems like the Amazon, Congo and Southeast Asian forests. A commitment from over 30 private financial institutions to eliminate[23] agricultural commodity-driven deforestation risks in their portfolios by 2025. The Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue Roadmap for Action, a framework intended[24] to encourage supply chain sustainability, support smallholder farmers' participation in markets, and improve supply chain transparency and technological innovation. A $1.7 billion pledge from countries and philanthropy organizations to advance[25] indigenous peoples and local communities' forest tenure rights and recognize and reward their roles as guardians of forests and nature. A Joint Statement on Climate Change and Biodiversity Crises through which over 25 land management organizations including key agencies within the U.S. Departments of Interior, Agriculture and Commerce agreed[26] to champion the role of protected and conserved areas in addressing the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Private sector organizations also made noteworthy nature-focused commitments, such as Burberry's three-pronged biodiversity strategy[27] and Botanic Gardens Conservation International's new 'global biodiversity standard' that seeks[28] to recognize and promote projects that actively protect existing habitats and enhance biodiversity while halting the spread of invasive species. Although COP26 similarly lacked any formal obligations to protect oceans, the Glasgow Climate Pact formally welcomed oceans into the convention and invited further global discussion on incorporating strong, ocean-based actions into climate commitments. To push this process along, the United Kingdom continued[29] to urge countries to support a global pledge to protect at least 30 percent of the world's oceans by 2030 and committed millions of dollars to ocean-related initiatives, including development of the 'blue economy,' financing to Fiji through its first sovereign 'blue bond,' and financial contributions to the Global Fund for Coral Reefs and the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance. COP26 also seemed to further solidify the growing nexus between the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity, in recognition of their complementary symbiotic relationship. Notable new partnerships coming out of COP26 will drive climate action going forward Expanding the tradition of past COPs, governments, businesses, investors, philanthropy organizations and nonprofits announced or formally launched numerous new partnerships 'on the sidel"

He also fears an increasing role for NGOs and other intermediaries may blur the voices of people who have the most to lose to a changing climate.""Many non-recognized Indigenous peoples who experience biodiversity loss due to climate change will probably not be assisted directly if not intermediated by NGOs or if they do not offer any opportunities for investors,"" Morales said.Morales is also worried that he didn't see Indigenous knowledge represented on expert panels at COP26""Science and its relationship with industry cannot be a neutral factor when development, infrastructure, extractive, manufacturing and transporting industries present threats to Indigenous peoples territorial, political, nature-based and human rights,"" he said.Diana Elhard, a doctoral candidate researching climate finance, said that COVID-19 widened the already large disparity in access to climate negotiations. ""Many small states, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS), were under- or unrepresented at this COP because people feared bringing COVID back to their communities when the conference was over,"" Elhard said.""On the last day the calls from SIDS went unheeded and the commitments at Glasgow were not enough to guarantee a world limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, which is already a target that makes life for these states and communities difficult,"" she said.A reason for hopeElhard said that a source of hope was seeing how many different actors were at COP26.""The work of Indigenous peoples, youth activists, environmental NGOs, and other non-state actors are all additional pieces of the puzzle that can both influence the UNFCCC proceedings and continue working outside of formal COP spaces,"" Elhard said. ""Actors at many different levels are engaged in influencing the COP process, but I also know that their energy will be aimed at change beyond COP26.""Contrary to previous summits, ""this time the rights-based approach does have a wider recognition, and there is language approved that reflect a new era in the consideration of Indigenous Peoples' rights specifically,"" Morales said.Morales is also encouraged by the growing support for an end to deforestation. ""This is an important advance particularly for Amazonian Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous peoples living within protected areas,"" Morales said. He added that now the challenge would be to direct financial assistance to protectors of Indigenous forests.The platform of Indigenous peoples was also well-represented, Morales said, with representatives from around the world with the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP).""We had the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) with the attendance of Indigenous leaders and members from all around the world.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA99","Alaska Voices: What COP26 means for Alaska","December 14, 2021","Peninsula Clarion (Kenai, Alaska)","By John Seymour and Charles ThorpeWith every class in the subject on the environment, we have become more aware of climate change and its multifaceted impacts. For our generation, as well as younger generations, climate change is a major force in both our present and future. However, it falls upon the entire living population to tackle this issue. Disappointingly, as proven by the recent proceedings at the United Nations Conference of Parties 26 in Glasgow, world leaders have again fallen short of doing so.COP26 was meant to mark a paradigm shift for climate change governance, given that the 2015 Paris Agreement pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were neither ambitious enough nor being met. Indeed, COP26 is the first U.N. climate agreement to specifically mention fossil fuels and calls on countries to strengthen their climate initiatives by the end of 2022 with more aggressive emissions reductions. Yet, the resulting Glasgow Climate Pact, in contrast to the Paris Agreement, is not legally binding. The Pact also shows how ambition for net-zero emissions gets watered down, such as when the draft provision to ""phase out"" coal was opposed by India and China and ultimately diluted to the more nebulous ""phase down.""Policymakers' failures to reach meaningful climate action agreements have set a poor precedent for our and future generations. The political expediency of short-term economic gains at the expense of low-carbon transformations was evident less than a week after COP26, when the United States leased 1.7 million acres for the purpose of offshore oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. This is predicted to lead to emissions with the annual equivalent of 130 coal-fired power plants, according to the Center of Biological Diversity. Industrial nations' reliance on fossil fuels threatens environmental sustainability and human well-being. For example, the air quality in Delhi, India, now regularly reaches a level 10 times higher than the safe level according to the National Air Quality Index, due to vehicle emissions, coal-fired power plants, and crop burning. Such harmful environmental change is quick to develop and does not wait for our environmental governance ambitions to check humanity's reckless growth. Yet policymakers continue to fall short when attempting to properly address such problems.The inadequacies of the international COP26 meeting highlight the role that local and regional entities can play in filling gaps in climate change policy. As fossil fuels continue to be phased down, we believe that Alaska, as a fossil fuel exporting state, must look at ways to adapt to the changing world economy with the prospect of becoming a leader in renewable energy innovation, design and production. For example, Alaska has the means to develop hydrogen fuel resources, which may be important during our transition towards a net-zero carbon future in which renewable energy resources such as hydropower and tidal power, play larger roles in producing electricity in our state. In addition, we need to continue to expand geothermal, wind and solar options and to consider ecological mitigation tools such as terrestrial (by way of trees) and aquatic (by way of seaweed/kelp) carbon sequestration. Alaska's sustainability success in the face of climate change is dependent on whether we grasp the urgency of the situation, adapt and become more resilient while supporting environmental and socioeconomic sustainability.John Seymour and Charles Thorpe are environmental science students at the University of Alaska Southeast and live in Juneau.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA110","WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON AT COP26","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation:Over the next two weeks, world leaders are meeting in Glasgow, Scotland for the 26th annual UN Climate Conference (COP26). Against a backdrop of intensifying climate impacts such as stronger and increasingly-common hurricanes and wildfires, rising sea levels, and melting glaciers COP26 is a make-or-break moment for climate action after the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change described the climate situation as an urgent code red for humanity.And yet, there is still hope. And an intensifying need to work collectively to stabilize our climate for a more equitable, sustainable future. The moment is now for governments to come together to commit to and act on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and for philanthropy to play a catalyzing role to spur action.As COP26A Major Pledge to Reduce Methane EmissionsCOP26, while also improving public health and food production. On November 2, President Biden announced that more than 100 countries have signed onto the Global Methane Pledge, which includes a commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 and limit warming to 0.2 a by 2050.Rapid methane reductions now will bring many significant social and health benefits, including reduced asthma-related deaths and other negative outcomes that are associated with the harmful effects of climate change. These positive outcomes are especially important to minority and low-income communities, which are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. To ensure a just and equitable energy transition, more than 20 philanthropic organizations from across the globe including the Packard Foundation have committed $328 million to support countries' abilities to meet the pledge.Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities Rights-Based Climate ActionIndigenous Peoples and local communities are proven forest guardians, p rotecting the diverse tropical forests that are vital to safeguarding the planet from climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemic risk. Half of the world's land is community land governed by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and by some estimates, 80 percent of the world's biodiversity is found on these lands. The need is urgent to advance tenure rights for Indigenous Peoples and local communities and scale up protections for these precious ecosystems.During the World Leaders Summit at COP26, a joint set of commitments was announced to advance support for Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' tenure rights and their forest guardianship. The Packard Foundation joined with governmental and philanthropic funding partners to commit a collective $1.7 billion of financing from 2021-2025 to support the advancement of these rights.A coalition of Indigenous and local communities, the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, is actively engaging at . If you'd like to stay up to date on the latest actions at the Summit, their Twitter account is a great one to follow.Ocean-Climate ActionIn a recent column in The Chronicle of Philanthropy, Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and vice chair of the Packard Foundation Board of Trustees , highlighted that COP26, ""is an opportunity both to recognize the role the ocean must play in mitigating climate change and to direct significant philanthropic funding to this endeavor."" The most durable, effective, and equitable conservation outcomes that can help meet the climate challenge arise from actions led by Indigenous Peoples and local communities. As an example, she points to the Packard Foundation's support for ""the Northern Chumash Tribal Council's leadership role in the nomination of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along California's central coast"" and ICCA's Global Community Fisheries Initiative.There are growing calls for the ocean to be integrated into this year's COP26 climate negotiations, as it has greatly slowed the rate of climate change. According to the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, the ocean has the potential to reduce emissions equivalent to pollution from all coal-fired power plants world-wide. The COP26 Virtual Ocean Pavilion offers an opportunity for people from around the world to join live events, engage with experts, and learn more about ocean-climate action.A Spotlight on Grassroots ActorsAlthough climate change impacts all of us, Indigenous Peoples and local communities are among the first and most severely affected.

Now the summit has drawn to a close, this article brings you up to speed with why it took place, the pledges that have been set, and share some of the resources Shoosmiths has created as all efforts turn to limit global warming and the impact of climate change.COP26'Conference of the Parties number 26' was the 26th time signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty have met. The UK hosted COP26 between 1 and 12 November at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow. The two-week summit was seen as a critical moment for commitments and action, with a record number of delegates and world leaders meeting to set the global agenda on slowing climate changing and reaching a consensus on actions to keep global warming to 1.5 C.Decisions that were made:Science and urgencyPrevious summits have been criticised for either not taking enough action on climate change, taking action too slowly, or failing to initiate substantial enough investments into sustainable solutions. In response, the Glasgow Climate Pact captures and voices country's wishes to fully embed science and sustainable decisions into all decision-making processes. The UN is now also directed to assess climate plans every year, turning every COP into a vital moment for nations to make further commitments.Adaptation finance'Adaptation' is used to describe funding to help poorer countries become more resilient against extreme weather caused by climate change. Investments may include new sea defences, more resilient power grids, or smarter early warning systems for wilder weather. A notable outcome of COP26, as recorded in the Pact, is the call for ""developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country parties from 2019 levels by 2025.""Financial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back 'clean technology', such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is seen as an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.MitigationThe outcome includes a series of actions that all parties are expected to take to accelerate their efforts following the summit, these include: A stronger commitment to limit global temperature rises to 1.5oC, and greater acknowledgement of the latest science which reflects the urgent need to take action during this critical decade The 'phase-down of unabated coal power' and 'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies', as well as 'mid-century net zero' Leaders from more than 100 countries, with about 85% of the world's forests, promising to stop deforestation by 2030Finance, technology transfer and capacity-building for mitigation and adaptationParties agreed to continue discussions on long-term finance through to 2027 and have asked the Standing Committee on Finance to prepare a report on progress towards achieving the $100bn goal.Representatives have also agreed to begin the process of setting a new collective post-2025 goal, citing that this process would be 'open, inclusive and transparent', seeking a broad range of views and inputs from across the globe.Loss and damageLoss and damage, discussed between the parties, refers to the impacts of climate change which occur beyond the limits of societies' and ecosystems' ability to adapt. It endorsed the need for a substantial amount of extra money to be provided to tackle loss and damage through existing sources.It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the greenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C. Current targets, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4 C.ImplementationCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. COP26 finalised the Paris 'rulebook', resolving the outstanding political decisions needed for parties to begin implementing the agreement. Parties also agreed a number of important practical and institutional arrangements, such as on Response Measures (responding to the impacts of climate policies) and the Consultative Group of Experts (to help fulfil reporting requirements).CollaborationCOP26 voiced aims to be both open and inclusive, with a greater variety of voices heard from across all corners of the world. This included responding to calls for further youth inclusion and those from low income countries. Plans have been drawn up on advancing climate education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and international cooperation as part of a new flexible framework.The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.Common time framesCOP26, a recommended plan has been put in place to allow a common time frame for commitments set forward by parties in 2025 to show what 2035 climate commitments add up to.Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed, with only a few countries making their targets and pledges legally binding.Enhanced transparency frameworkBy finalising the Enhanced Transparency Framework, an agreement was reached on how to track and communicate progress in tackling climate change as nations look to implement the Paris Agreement. This includes a series of common reporting tables that will track parties' emissions, support, and progress towards their nationally determined contributions - with nations agreeing to submit climate plans to a common five-year timeframe.So, what does this mean?Right now, the world is 1.2 C warmer than it was at the end of the 19th century. With the government drive towards carbon net zero, and a vested interest from stakeholders across the board - investors, customers, employees, suppliers and communities - it is crucial for businesses to establish, or revisit, their sustainability strategies to ensure tangible outcomes.Shoosmiths is committed to a net zero emissions future, with a target for its operations to achieve net zero emissions by 2025 and a commitment made and recently approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set science-based emissions reduction targets across the entire value chain that are consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels - further detail of which can be found here.Further resourcesTo aid our clients on their net zero journey we have recently partnered with Cornwall Insight to produce a report exploring the potential routes to decarbonisation that businesses have at their disposal to meet their net zero targets - 'Unlocking net zero strategies for businesses' which is available here ( HYPERLINK https://www.shoosmiths.co.uk/insights/news/open-dialogue-is-required-for-businesses-to-reach-net-zerohttps://www.shoosmiths.co.uk/insights/news/open-dialogue-is-required-for-businesses-to-reach-net-zero).

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA116","Agreement Reached on International Carbon Credit Trading Rules at COP26","CLS Blue Sky Blog","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 20, 2021( CLS Blue Sky Blog: HYPERLINK http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.eduhttp://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly referred to as 'COP26', was held in Glasgow, Scotland last month. Among other agreements coming out of COP26, government ministers representing nearly 200 countries reached a consensus regarding rules implementing Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which provides a framework for the creation of voluntary international carbon credit trading markets. This agreement follows six years of negotiations over the specific characteristics of such markets, and parties to the agreement have expressed the hope that this framework will lead to the establishment and growth of an international carbon credit trading market. ARTICLE 6 OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT The Paris Agreement, sometimes referred to as the Paris Accords or the Paris Climate Accords, is an international treaty on climate change mitigation.1 The Paris Agreement was negotiated and adopted by 196 countries at the United Nations' ('UN') COP21 meeting in Paris, France on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016.2 Its primary aim is to keep the rise in mean global temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels, in an effort to significantly reduce the effects of climate change.3 The Paris Agreement proposed a number of avenues through which countries can reduce their emissions, including Article 6, which sets forth a framework for the creation of a voluntary international carbon credit trading market. Article 6.4 contemplates a 'mechanism' supervised by a body designated by the parties to the Paris Agreement, which is intended to (i) 'promote the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions'; (ii) 'incentivize and facilitate [] the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by public and private entities'; (iii)'contribute to the reduction of emission levels' by each party to the agreement, including by means of mitigation activities by one party that can also be used by another party to fulfill its nationally determined contribution ('NDC', which corresponds to a country's emissions reduction commitment under the Paris Agreement); and (iv)'deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions.'4 This mechanism is intended to further the goal, articulated in Article 6.2, that countries will voluntarily engage in 'cooperative approaches' that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes ('ITMOs', emissions credits that can be traded globally) towards their NDCs.5 However, Article 6.2 also provides that, in so doing, countries must Â£pply robust accounting to ensure . . . the avoidance of double counting', such that an individual credit is not counted towards two countries' NDCs.6 Although Article 6 lays the foundation for the creation of a global carbon credit market, it left key implementation details to be determined at a later date. Following the Paris Agreement, disagreements over certain fundamental questions, including concerns regarding potential double counting of carbon credits and the ability to trade older carbon credits from a now-defunct trading system, had stalled progress toward definitive rules implementing Article 6.7 However, a compromise with respect to these and other issues was finally reached at COP26. AGREEMENT On November 13, 2021, negotiators from almost 200 countries agreed on final rules implementing Article 6 as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact, ending six years of negotiations over this protocol.8 Broadly speaking, the rules implementing Article 6 provide for the creation of a UN-certified carbon credit that can be used and traded globally, thereby allowing for the standardization of carbon credits internationally.9 In so doing, the rules implementing Article 6 enable countries to use carbon credit trading mechanisms to help achieve their NDCs. They also allow for the development of a global market based on credits that satisfy uniform standards. The agreement reached at COP26 on the rules implementing Article 6 also resolves certain fundamental questions that had been stalling such an agreement since the Paris Agreement in 2015. With respect to the concern regarding double counting, the rules implementing Article 6 provide that the parties to the agreement will cooperate on the use of carbon credits, including with respect to governance and accounting. Specifically, the rules call for the application of 'corresponding adjustments' to ensure that a single credit cannot be counted towards two countries' NDCs.10 In a similar vein, with respect to the debate regarding the usage of older carbon credits, negotiators agreed to limit the use of legacy emissions credits from the UN's Clean Development Mechanism ('CDM'), initially created in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.11 Specifically, the rules implementing Article 6 state that only CDM credits registered after January 1, 2013 may be used towards the achievement of a country's NDC.12 Though the rules implementing Article 6 lay the foundation for a global emissions trading platform, even these rules will require additional interpretation for such a marketplace to come to fruition. Therefore, the rules implementing Article 6 also establish a body that will supervise the creation and maintenance of an international carbon trading marketplace (the 'Supervisory Body').13 The mandate of the Supervisory Body will be, among other things, to develop the methodologies, registration, monitoring and other processes needed for the establishment and healthy functioning of the international carbon credit trading market for use by public and private entities.14 The rules invite the nomination of members and alternate members, and request that the Supervisory Body hold at least two meetings during the calendar year 2022 to begin its work.15 IMPLICATIONS The lack of agreement on the implementation of Article 6 had stalled efforts to operationalize the carbon emissions reductions required by the Paris Agreement and to develop a functional international emissions credit trading market. Currently, a patchwork of carbon credit markets exists across the globe, including markets established and regulated by individual governments. These include the European Union's Emissions Trading System and similar markets in China, the northeastern United States and California. In these systems, a regulator sets a certain limit on emissions and issues allowances for those emissions on an annual basis, and those entities that reduce their emissions below the limit set by the regulator can sell the remainder of their allowance to other businesses that are short of allowances.16 There are also voluntary carbon markets, whereby entities can buy and sell carbon offset credits at their discretion (e.g., to fulfill a voluntary commitment to reduce emissions). However, the standards set by these mandatory and voluntary markets vary significantly, which has raised numerous concerns, including with respect to the quality and validity of offsets and the associated credits.17 The rules implementing Article 6 provide a framework for a potential global trading market operating under uniform standards. Notably, however, the rules implementing Article 6 do not contain an enforcement mechanism, and rely instead on the good faith of individual participants to adhere to the framework that they propose.18 Ultimately, while the rules implementing Article 6 lay the groundwork for a global carbon credit trading market, they also raise the fundamental question as to whether governments will follow through on the principles that they set forth.

While the youth on the streets staged furious protests and called for urgent action, inside the key negotiations happened behind closed doors, with important actors like the US, China and India doing more to lower ambitions[2] than raise them. Recommended As the conference came to an end, the anger and disappointment among young people - especially those from developing countries - was palpable.

Clear science, clearer failure 'For me, having come to COP26 at a time when the science is clear, the cognitive dissonance is astounding,' said Eric Njuguna, a climate activist from Kenya. He spoke of the drought in his home country, Kenya[4], affecting millions, which the government was forced to declare a national disaster. 'It is just aggravating to see that no commitments are being made.' The world needs to go net zero[5] by 2050 to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees Celsius[6]. Given that the average global temperature is already around 1.2C[7] above the pre-Industrial era, many countries are currently battling a rise in extreme weather events. What is net zero? A net-zero scenario means greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide, CO2) - the main factor in human-induced global warming - should be absorbed in the same quantities as they are being emitted. This may happen through natural means, such asthe absorption of CO2 by trees, or through technological solutions, many of which remain uncertain at scale. 'It is really so sad that we are going to go back to [our] countries very angry,' said Patience Nabukalu, a climate activist from Uganda. Nabakalu said that she was there to demand the billions of dollars[8] rich countries promised to give to developing countries to deal with the climate crisis. In 2009, when COP15 was held in Copenhagen, developed countries promised to extend USD 100 billion a year[9] in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. This has not yet happened, with some developed countries now extending that date to 2023. Maybe more important is the issue of loss and damage[10] due to the rise in extreme weather events. Poor countries, with limited infrastructure, have contributed the least to global carbon emissions, and yet have to bear the additional cost of increased disasters[11]. While the Glasgow Climate Pact finally recognised loss and damage in principle, no plans have as yet been made to deal with the finances required. Eric Njuguna (left), from Kenya, and Patience Nabukalu, from Uganda, said they were angry and disappointed at how COP26 panned out (Image: Disha Shetty)COVID restrictions, travel costs restrict voices The Covid-19 pandemic only added to feelings of inequity. Whereas less than 5% of people in low income countries have received even one dose of a vaccine, rich countries are already giving their populations booster shots and vaccinating their young people. For citizens from developing countries, this has meant reduced access as travel restrictions are in place. Additionally, there is the high cost of a COP taking place in a developed country. 'We have a delegation of 15 young people from Brazil and it was really hard to get here because the Brazilian real is so [weak] compared with [the British] pound,' said Isvilaine da Silva Conceicao, a climate activist from Brazil. Nevertheless, she stressed it was important for them to be there. 'We need to [physically] be in the spaces to pressure our government.' We are the victims, not them [the negotiators]. It's us [who have] to be given microphones, not themPatience Nabukalu, climate activist from Uganda Conceicao added that she has lots of friends from African countries who could not travel because of Covid-19 restrictions. 'It was really bad because they have a lot to say and they need to be heard. [Hosting] the COP in countries that are difficult to come to and so expensive for us from the [global] south it's really hard to have a lot of the voices heard.' Those suffering need a say Aside from the difficulties of getting to COP26, the young activists from developing countries who spoke with The Third Pole saw the hope raised in the early days of the summit dissipate as declaration did not transform into action. As the impacts of climate change intensify, and several small island nations face the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels, the youth from developing countries said the urgency their situation demanded was not being responded to by the world leaders. There were many young activists attending COP26 as observers. But they wanted to do more than observe, and were keen to be allowed to participate in the actual negotiations. Recommended 'We are the victims, not them [the negotiators]. It's us [who have] to be given microphones, not them. They should go out of the conference rooms and let the most affected people start raising their voices and demand for climate justice,' Nabakalu added. Across the board, activists who spoke with The Third Pole felt that negotiators from developing countries were the saving grace of the summit, who were doing their best to push climate justice. They expressed disappointment that the discussions did not look at radical ways of thinking, while failure of rich countries to step up and take responsibility for their actions was another common issue the young attendees were angry about. 'Not here to defend governments, but people' For Jaciara Beatriz Sousa de Vasconcelos, who is from an indigenous community in Brazil, it was the lack of indigenous voices[12] that was concerning. She also made a distinction between the government stance and that of delegates like her. 'We are not here to defend Brazil but we are here to defend the indigenous people. And we know that forests are better when they are protected.' Isvilaine da Silva Conceicao (left) and Jaciara Beatriz Sousa de Vasconcelos, both from Brazil, said that the high costs of attending a COP in a developed country meant that many indigenous voices were left out (Image: Disha Shetty) 'We need to protect indigenous people because they are the future, they are the past, and they always stand up for the forests,' Vasconcelos added. Many of the young activists questioned why renewables were being pushed as a 'magic wand', given that some of the proposed solutions - like large-scale solar or hydro projects[13] - may displace indigenous people from their land. Greenwashing and lack of conversations on racial justice were other issues the youth felt this COP had failed to address. Recommended There was visible solidarity and cooperation from climate activists from developing and developed countries. Luisa Nuebauer from Germany criticised her government for not being bold enough. She said her country 'doesn't speak to me as if the climate crisis was my problem, and betrays Eric [Njuguna] and everyone else. You're [speaking to Eric] facing the consequences of the inaction of my government today.' What many did express was that while they did not get a seat at the negotiating table, they were able to occupy space at : by being visible, their issues were heard to some extent. This was a small win at a conference they had struggled to attend, and whose outcomes were far less than they had hoped.

Nuclear energy is the only energy source with a proven track record of producing firm, zero-carbon energy at the scale needed to meet global goals. Indeed, it's increasingly clear that achieving net-zero worldwide carbon emissions is simply not feasible without a significant expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy worldwide.""The letter expressed the need for all sectors of the world economy to decarbonize as quickly as possible and noted that nuclear technology can be used in industrial processes. But in order to achieve this level of decarbonization, governments and policymakers must acknowledge the need for significant investment in research and development of advanced nuclear technologies coupled with the implementation of technology-neutral, performance-based climate and energy policies that treat all carbon-free energy sources fairly and equally.""Nuclear must be treated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies,"" the letter stated. ""Delegates should not accept anything short of fair and equal treatment for nuclear energy vis-a-vis other zero-carbon sources, as doing so would be fundamentally incompatible with global progress on climate, economic prosperity, and energy security.""Also of note, ANS, as a recognized civil society organization with UN observer status, sponsored 10 Young Generation Network delegates from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to be on the ground in Glasgow during COP26. As representatives of ANS and their respective countries, the pronuclear delegates attended events in the exclusive Blue Zone that were available only to UN observer organizations and national representatives.ANS's message at COP26 was clear: Carbon-free nuclear energy must be a part of the climate solution, and the time to act is now. Six years on from the Paris Agreement, our world leaders need to get serious about climate change, and that starts by preserving and expanding nuclear energy.\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA120","More investors view divestment favorably post-COP26, survey finds","December 9, 2021 Thursday","Corporatesecretary.com","Thirty-six percent of investors say they support divestment as a tool against climate change, up from 30 percent before COP26. That's according to a survey of more than 5,000 investors across the US, UK, Italy, Germany and South Africa by investment manager Ninety One in an effort to determine attitudes toward ESG issues and whether investors are willing to modify their approaches following the climate summit.Although more investors (45 percent) still say that working with high-emitting companies for a green transition remains their preference, this is a marked drop from the 55 percent that said they preferred investment managers to use their influence to support a net-zero transition over divestment in a similar poll ahead of the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland last month.Hendrik du Toit, founder and CEO of Ninety One, is a vocal critic of divestment, instead arguing that 'responsible stewardship' and what he describes as an 'inclusive' approach to fighting climate change are essential.Despite 71 percent of investors saying they felt richer countries should be helping poorer countries to transition to net-zero, Ninety One's research also points to a lack of confidence in the outcomes of COP26: 57 percent of respondents do not believe the agreements made at the summit will lead to global climate alignment on tackling climate change.More than two thirds (69 percent) add that a lack of high-profile leadership from China and Russia has made the goals even more difficult to achieve.ESG GONE MAINSTREAM The survey does have some positives, though. It finds that ESG considerations are already part of the daily decision-making process at most investors, with 57 percent saying they have investments with a focus on net-zero or other environmental and societal benefits.As well as finding that ESG considerations are already integrated into normal decision-making for many investors, Ninety One says these investments also have more longevity, with more than two thirds (67 percent) saying they are invested for five years or more across investments featuring a net-zero, E or S focus.'These investors are committed to long-term environmental and societal benefits, or performance with purpose, with 70 percent agreeing that they will hold these investments for longer than those without,' the firm notes.It adds that investors expect the shift to a green economy to create appealing investments as well as helping fight climate change. 'Forty percent say they are happy for their money to influence decarbonization while also expecting a competitive financial return,' Ninety One says.

Agriculture accounts for around 10% of greenhouse gas emissions but many biotech tools exist to reduce ag emissions.The organic sector says it stands ready to lead climate change efforts by planting the seeds for a more sustainable future right here at home.

While attention was focused on national pledges to reduce emissions consistent with the goals established in the 2015 Paris Agreement, there were many related agreements and announcements that will affect specific industries and global finance, as well as create business risks and opportunities. This update discusses how international agreements and U.S. policy announcements coming out of COP26 will affect businesses and provide opportunities in the months and years ahead. From Paris to Glasgow Almost every country in the world signed the 2015 Paris Agreement[1] and pledged to develop nationally determined contributions to limit greenhouse gases. These efforts are designed to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2 C above pre-industrial levels, with the aim of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 C. The Paris Agreement calls for countries to update their pledges and conduct a global stocktake of greenhouse gases every five years. COP26 was scheduled for 2020 to coincide with this provision. After a one-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, national delegates, business representatives, and other stakeholders gathered in Glasgow to discuss new emissions reductions pledges and negotiate related agreements to reduce and avoid climate change impacts. Beyond lofty goals and ambitious language, COP26 resulted in a number of concrete developments that reflect a renewed sense of urgency and commitment to addressing the impacts of climate change.

The organization said that based on all pledges, including those made so far in Glasgow, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be around double what is necessary to limit warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. CAT's ""optimistic scenario"" \'e2\â‚¬ if all countries' net-zero pledges are implemented \'e2\â‚¬ would limit the temperature rise to 1.8\'c2\'b0C . But this estimate is ""far from positive, given the quality of the net-zero goals and the massive ambition and action gap in 2030,"" CAT said. Its country analysis shows that around 90% of global emissions are now covered by net-zero goals. Yet only a small number of those pledges \'e2\â‚¬ covering just 6% of global emissions \'e2\â‚¬ are rated ""acceptable"" and are backed up by plans to get there. The group also found that the announcements made at COP26 to reduce methane emissions and deforestation would narrow the global ""emissions gap"" only slightly, if at all. Misleading Climate Information An open letter with over 250 signatories, led by the Conscious Advertising Network (CAN), urges COP26 leaders and tech giants to play their part in addressing misleading information about climate change. The voluntary coalition said many digital platforms benefit from lucrative advertising that contains misleading climate information. But measures taken so far by tech platforms have failed to stem the flow of this kind of material. ""Such misleading content threatens to jeopardize climate negotiations and overall climate action,"" CAN said. The letter calls for: a universal definition of climate dis/misinformation, and action against climate dis/misinformation to be included in the COP26 negotiated text. It also asks for technology platforms to implement climate dis/misinformation policies and enforcement that extends to content, algorithms and advertising. ""At the onset of the pandemic, technology platforms came together \'e2\â‚¬ \Â£6 to combat 'fraud and misinformation about the virus.' So, we know that they can do it,"" said CAN co-founder Harriet Kingaby. Solar Investment Action The Solar Investment Action Agenda, launched at COP26 on Tuesday, will identify potential ""high-impact opportunities"" to scale up solar investment swiftly with the goal of mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030. This will be followed by a more detailed Solar Investment Roadmap to be released in 2022. The initiative is supported by the World Resources Institute in partnership with the International Solar Alliance and Bloomberg Philanthropies. ""Speeding up investment in solar power is critical to winning the battle against climate change,"" said Michael Bloomberg, who is also UN special envoy for climate ambition and solutions. ""It will also help us deliver energy to the hundreds of millions of people who still lack it without increasing carbon emissions and deadly air pollution.

At the end of the Northern Hemisphere's warmest summer on record, the United Nations announced that limiting planetary temperature level increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius relies on reducing global carbon emissions 45 percent by 2030, a goal that world governments are not on track to meet. Although pledges to curb methane emissions, deforestation, and phasing down (but not phasing out) the use of coal were secured, the COP26 countries punted on stronger emissions targets, deciding to come back next year. In short, COP26 failed to pulverize the status quo. One of the major culprits was a Biden administration wanting badly to reclaim the mantle of global leadership with a show of decisive action, but dragged down by the Democratic Party's internecine feuds and the residual shock to the international system that was Donald Trump. Biden has been proclaiming that 'America is back,' presumably to summon forth some of the authority that his predecessor had sapped away. But at Glasgow, he was rendered ineffective by members of Congress operating more like the de Medicis in 15th-century Florence than legislators in a representative democracy faced with a planetary emergency. House Democrats finally passed the bipartisan infrastructure framework which only works as a climate policy if the companion Build Back Better Act passes but couldn't get it together before the president left home. More from Gabrielle Gurley[1] To circumvent interference from the Manchin-ian opposition, the U.S. watered down its stance on coal, refusing to sign an agreement early in the conference that would have ended coal use by 2030, instead opting for a wind-down during the course of the third decade. This 'phase down' rather than 'phase out' strategy raised its ugly head again midway through COP26, thanks to an agreement between the U.S. and China. Though India got blamed for eleventh-hour maneuvering that saw the phrase 'phase down' inserted into the final agreement, the table had already been set[2] by Washington and Beijing. Whether this move tempers the goodwill the Chinese gained with a September announcement to stop building new plants is so far unclear[3]. Biden is playing a cynical and dangerous game on climate, with rhetorical flourishes followed by business-as-usual decision-making. On Wednesday, the administration announced that it would pursue the largest sale[4] of oil and gas leases ever in the Gulf of Mexico, not a week after the climate talks ended and only two days after prohibitions on new oil and gas leases near Native American cultural sites at Chaco Canyon and Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico. With the uncertainties posed by the approaching American midterms, the European Union, for its part, sees the U.S. as an unreliable partner at best. However, the EU has its own energy crisis and significant internal climate divisions. Creating a green-finance 'taxonomy[5],' a framework that spells out which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable, has split the Europeans on nuclear energy. The EU plans to decide in the coming weeks whether nuclear power is sustainable and will, under its regulations, 'do no significant harm.' The discord over this issue has split off an anti-nuclear bloc led by Germany, Austria, Denmark, Luxembourg, and Portugal and a pro-nuclear bloc led by France. Having abandoned nuclear power in the wake of Fukushima, Germany has returned to burning coal, faces[6] high energy prices, and is agonizing over an undersea natural gas pipel"

In our work in more than 100 countries, we've witnessed how catastrophic storms and more frequent and prolonged droughts decimate communities in low-income countries. In fact, those suffering the most from climate change are contributing to it the least. As such, we were pleased to see a renewed emphasis this year on climate adaptation in addition to the commitments made on emissions. And we applaud the Biden administration's new climate adaptation plan, as well as its contribution to several global funding streams that help low-income countries cope with the devastating consequences of the climate crisis.""However, the overall results of COP26 were decidedly mixed. Going forward, the U.S. and other world leaders must deliver on prior commitments, including ensuring that at least 50% of climate finance goes toward adaptation.""Countries must also continue looking for ways to increase their climate ambitions, especially regarding 2030 targets.

Today we're talking with Bill McKibben about the climate movements that continue to push for real change in spite of the dithering by world leaders, and we discuss how to stay sane, happy, and engaged even as the impacts of climate chaos increase around the world with author Trebbe Johnson. Listen here: The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, more commonly referred to as COP26, was held in Glasgow, Scotland earlier this month, and it was largely deemed a failure[1]. Countries failed to commit to   ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets that would keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. Rather infamously, it was reported that if all of the fossil fuels lobbyists attending COP26[2] represented a single nation, they'd be the single largest national delegation in attendance. The text of the Glasgow Climate Pact adopted by the 197 countries participating in COP26 was changed last-minute so that it spoke of a 'phase down' of coal[3] rather than a 'phase out'  which is a rather neat summary of how COP26 failed to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. There was some tentative progress made at COP26, however. Perhaps the biggest achievement was that 127 countries signed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use[4], committing to 'halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation' by 2030 as part of their efforts to combat climate change. Russia, Brazil, and China  which rank as the #1, #2, and #6 countries in the world in terms of tree cover  signed the Declaration, which is notable since they were not signatories to the NY Declaration on Forests, which was adopted by just 39 countries in 2014. The more than 100 countries that signed the Glasgow Declaration represent 85% of Earth's forested land, and some $19.2 billion in national and private funds were committed during COP26 to support their forest protection efforts. The Declaration also recognizes the important role that Indigenous communities play in protecting forests. But there are plenty of details that must still be worked out. For instance, as Mongabay founder and CEO Rhett Butler noted[5], 'That loose definition [of deforestation] leaves a lot of room for interpretation  for example, a country could potentially claim 'net zero deforestation' by converting natural forests to monoculture plantations[6].' And as Mongabay contributor Justin Catonoso reported from Glasgow[7], many NGOs are warning that commitments to stop deforestation in the name of climate change will be undermined by the continued burning of forest biomass as a zero carbon fuel. There are plenty of climate solutions available to us, of course, and we've covered many of them here on this podcast in recent months, such as securing Indigenous and local communities' land rights[8], making our food system more sustainable through things like agroforestry[9] and agroecology[10], and restoring forests[11] to unlock their carbon storage potential. And of course another way we can keep pushing for a more sustainable, equitable future is through activism. Bill McKibben, noted environmental activist, author, and founder of 350.org[12] as well as the newly created Third Act[13] initiative, joins us today to talk about the state of the climate movement and what gives him hope that we may yet rise to the challenge and halt global warming. McKibben tells us about his response to the failures of COP26, why he was inspired by the activism he saw at the COP, and how he sees climate activism evolving to counter the outsized influence of the industries that rely on burning fossil fuels and clearing the world's forests for profit. We're also joined today by Trebbe Johnson, author of Radical Joy for Hard Times: Finding Meaning and Making Beauty In Earth's Broken Places[14] and founder of an organization with the same name: Radical Joy for Hard Times[15]. Johnson tells us about ecological grief, how it can affect people concerned about the future of our planet, and how to deal with that grief and stay committed to working towards a better future for all life on Earth.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA133","COP26: Imperial College-London Experts Reflect on the Story So Far","November 12, 2021 Friday 9:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Imperial College London issued the following news:By Hana AmerCOP26 has seen surprising net-zero pledges, methane reduction targets and climate finance announcements, but what do they mean?There are now just a few days remaining of the major UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which is ongoing in Glasgow. COP26 is the first time, since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, when countries have been asked to update their emissions reduction pledges and set out more ambitious plans for tackling climate change.With the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report described as 'code red for humanity', hopes have been high that significant agreements will be made at COP26 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming to 1.5 C by the end of this century. However, with current pledges putting us on track for at least 2.4 C of warming, according to Climate Action Tracker, much remains to be achieved at the COP26 negotiations.Imperial staff and students reflect on some of the announcements and members of the College's COP26 so far, highlighting the need for increased ambition and collaboration, as well as the importance of details on how countries and organisations plan to meet the pledges they make.India's 2070 net zero target:India's Prime Minister announced at COP26 that the country, which is the world's third-biggest annual carbon emitter, would reach net zero emissions by 2070.Dr Joeri Rogelj, Director of Research at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment and Reader in Climate Science and Policy at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London commented:""This is an incredibly important first step, and highlights India's willingness to pursue ambitious climate policies. India is a developing country that still needs to tackle great challenges in terms of poverty eradication, together with climate change. It is not yet clear if India's target refers to all greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide only. If it covers all greenhouse gases, the target is incredibly ambitious. If it covers CO2 only, it is still ambitious, and an important step.""After this ambitious target, now the strategies, plans and policies are needed that will ensure that India's emissions are curbed onto a downward trajectory while ensuring sustainable development for its population. Without any doubt, developed countries should support India through finance and technology to make this formidable shift.""Global methane pledge:More than 100 countries, including the US, Japan and Canada, pledged to significantly reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Dr Paulo Ceppi, Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute said:""Any pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions are good and welcome news, and this is a step in the right direction. It's important to keep in mind, however, that in the long run carbon dioxide is more impactful than methane, since methane has a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere. Hence, we must not forget that this pledge alone is far from sufficient to meet the 1.5 C global warming target set out by the Paris Agreement, which will require achieving net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the twenty-first century.""Dr Joeri Rogelj, Director of Research at the Grantham Institute and Reader in Climate Science and Policy at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London said:""The global methane pledge shows global momentum towards tackling one of the second most important greenhouse gases that humans emit. If achieved, it will halt and even reduce the global warming that methane causes.""However, an analysis of the pledges with climate models that match the latest IPCC climate assessment shows that the global warming benefit of this pledge might not be as large as thought, and levels off over time. This points to the importance of tackling carbon dioxide and methane at the same time, for example, through deep overall emissions cuts and a phase-out of coal infrastructure.""Dr Rogelj contributed to a Carbon Brief blog on what this pledge can deliver.UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney's announcement of $130 trillion in private capital climate commitments:The former Governor of the Bank of England revealed that more than 450 firms representing $130 trillion, or 40% of global financial assets, now belong to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Dr Alex Koberle, Research Associate in Mitigation Technologies at the Grantham Institute commented: ""Whilst the announcement by Mark Carney's Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero to secure $130 trillion in private capital to fund the transition to net zero is positive, it remains to be seen what it will deliver. The devil will be in the details and at this point there isn't much information on the implementation of this. But it is encouraging to see these types of initiatives emerge as they set the agenda for the outcomes of COP26.""Youth engagement at COP26:The COP26Amy Wilson, PhD student at Imperial College London and Team Lead at ClimaTalk said: ""There are very few occasions where the youth get to review discussions and decisions. We see with Fridays For Future, and other youth organisations, a consistent movement of youth towards protesting and action - why can we not increase their involvement in negotiations and bring their views to the table? We should be advocating for education, training and youth inclusion, so that all young people feel empowered to actively be involved in climate negotiations, not only at COP26 but at climate meetings and sessions throughout the year.""International climate finance:UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an additional pound sterling1 billion over the next five years for international climate finance from the overseas aid budget.Mili Fomicov, Research Associate at the Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College Business School commented:""Emerging markets are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Government and corporate flows are required to fund their transition to a lower carbon economy, but emerging markets haven't received the amount of capital required. That needs to change. Local and foreign investors, as well as governments should invest in building out renewable infrastructure in emerging markets, as well as invest in adaptation and mitigation strategies. Climate finance frameworks need to evolve, barriers on foreign investment must be addressed, and bolder government policies should be adopted. All pillars need to come together to scale clean energy in emerging economies and to achieve a sustainable future globally.""Fossil fuel industry presence at COP26:503 delegates with links to the fossil fuel industry have been accredited for COP26, making it equivalent to the summit's largest delegation. With limited numbers of tickets available for delegates and concerns that fossil fuel delegates will lobby against decarbonisation, there is debate around members of the fossil fuel industry attending COP26.COP26. It is clear that current commitments from the oil industry are insufficient and do not align with global climate goals. The industry has been given its chance to act responsibly and they are not doing so. Therefore, they should only be attending COP26 if they are there to demonstrate how they plan to rapidly downscale the supply of fuels, in l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA134","Sharing Resources: Key to COP26 Success","October 28, 2021 Thursday 12:10 PM GMT","Send2Press","World leaders meet in Glasgow beginning October 31 for the United Nations COP26 Climate Change Conference, to address the conclusions of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report: that human activities have unequivocally warmed and damaged the planet. Share International attributes 80 percent of the warming to human actions, and says sharing resources to mitigate the inevitable consequences is key to solving climate change.As early as 2007, an article by a Master of Wisdom, recorded by the late British author Benjamin Creme and published in Share International magazine, gave this 80 percent figure and stated that we have a pivotal choice to make: to reap the beneficial results of immediate action, or face the destruction that would ensue from doing nothing, or too little.The article stated that the World Teacher for this age, Maitreya, who is gradually emerging into public view, \'e2\â‚¬  will advocate a simpler form of living, one more in keeping with the planet\'e2\â‚¬  s situation. When enough people are convinced that this is necessary,\'e2\â‚¬ it presaged, \'e2\â‚¬  there will be a growing movement to simplify throughout the planet.\'e2\â‚¬ It further predicted that \'e2\â‚¬  faced with the dilemma of necessary change, men will come to realize the inevitability of accepting the principle of sharing. Only sharing will make these changes practical and possible.\'e2\â‚¬ Although the effects of climate change are coming faster than scientists anticipated, the IPCC report affirms there is still time to slow or even reverse some changes by reducing CO2 emissions to at least net zero. But to accomplish this globally, the wealthier countries must not only curb their own emissions but also share resources and technology with less developed nations, to ensure that all can make the necessary rapid transition to sustainable energy sources.Three of the four goals of COP26 require potentially large financial investments: radical emissions reductions, strengthening adaptation to climate impacts, and mobilizing finances. The fourth is for countries to work together to accomplish these pressing but inescapable measures. The COP26 web site indicates, however, that developed countries have not even made good on their 2009 Copenhagen Accord pledge to mobilize by 2020 at least $100 billion in climate finance per year for developing nations. Another impediment noted by Jeffrey Sachs, president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network, is that poor countries must borrow internationally at rates of 5 to 10 percent, and many have no access to capital markets at all, while rich countries benefit from near-zero interest rates.Clearly, politicians have not yet responded to the climate crisis at levels commensurate with the danger, but COP26 offers a pivotal opportunity. To succeed at their stated goal of \'e2\â‚¬  uniting the world to tackle climate change,\'e2\â‚¬ participants will need to go beyond inequitable loan financing and fast-track unconditional sharing of the financial and technological resources necessary to bring all countries on board.

The job is on the shoulders of grassroots climate activists.","December 12, 2021 Sunday","The Salt Lake Tribune","The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, ended with the adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which seeks to keep global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees, phase down coal, and mobilize developed countries to jointly commit $100 billion in climate finance per year.There's a certain irony to the amount of emissions created by gathering such a large international group to discuss climate change. Alarmingly, fossil fuel companies had over 500 people at COP26, more than any single country. Utah Republican John Curtis was there with the Conservative Climate Caucus, which believes that free-market innovation and continued use of fossil fuels will provide the answer to our problems. They won't. We aren't going to engineer our way out of this.COP26 won't save the world. It doesn't truly treat this crisis as a crisis. At worst, it's a shiny PR campaign for the political elite, billionaires and fossil fuel executives to hide behind ""sustainability"" and ""green development."" At worst, it's further demonstration that the countries most responsible for the climate crisis are failing to meet targets that aren't anywhere close to enough in the first place. But at best, it's a forum for grassroots climate activists to connect with each other and represent the accountability and honesty that is consistently lacking from these conferences.The real climate leaders are not the big players at this summit. We are the leaders we've been looking for, as legendary activist Grace Lee Boggs would say. We know what we need to do, and unlike the players at COP26, we aren't scared of the changes it requires. This is not sacrifice; this is healing. This is not negotiation; this is accountability. This is not an apocalypse; this is an opportunity. We are the leaders we've been looking for.Maya Kobe-Rundio, Salt Lake CitySubmit a letter to the editor\l"

First, there's the content itself; second, there\' s the approach: piggybacking on a high-profile event to amplify your message.Glasgow, Scotland, is the host city for COP26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which begins November 1. As the countries of the world gather in hopes of agreeing to a path that will slow climate change, Scotland\' s national tourist organization has created a parallel conversation about sustainability in the business events sector. Its new 16-episode podcast looks at what the business events industry can learn from COP26 and what it can do to help achieve the goals of the conference.Four episodes are available so far, and a new one will be released on each day of the conference, aligning with themes of COP26, such as energy, nature, and equality. Speakers include events-industry leaders Sherrif Karamat, CEO of the Professional Convention Management Association; Sven Bossu, CEO of the International Association of Convention Centres; Amy Calvert, CEO of the Events Industry Council, plus many others, as well as VisitScotland executives who moderate the episodes.In large part, the podcast content could have been delivered at any time. However, plugging into COP26 builds on the excitement of the global climate event.Could other organizations use VisitScotland\' s approach as a roadmap to engagement? Consider the 2022 Winter Olympics Games in Beijing. A wide variety of interest groups will be watching through their particular lenses epidemiologists, travel writers, human-rights activists, and sports psychologists, to name just a few. Organizations with audiences drawn to issues around the Olympics could consider a podcast, webinar series, or even a live event to run concurrently. Some other events that generate the kind of media attention that could be parlayed into increased virtual or in-person participation include CES, TED, World Economic Forum, SXS, and any major election.The AgendaTo tune in to the  COP26 and the Journey to Change"" podcast, go to the HYPERLINK https://businessevents.visitscotland.com/why-scotland/cop26-and-the-journey-to-change-podcast/VisitScotland website HYPERLINK https://soundcloud.com/visitscotland/sets/business-events-cop26-and-the-journey-to-changeSoundCloud .Titles and speakers for the first four of the 16 episodes areEp 1: Scotland on the global stage: What COP26 means for Scotland beyond the eventNeil Brownlee and Rory Archibald, VisitScotlandEp 2: Business events for change: An international association perspectiveEp 3: Business events for change: A corporate and incentive perspectiveNeil Brownlee, VisitScotland, and Ben Goedegebuure, Maritz Global Events Ep 4: Ambassadors for change: Engaging business-event ambassadors in a post-pandemic worldAmanda Ferguson, University of Edinburgh, and Gordon Hodge, University of Strathclyde\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA138","COP26 DEBRIEF: WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR HEALTH?","November 22, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Academy of Medical Sciences:In October the Academy launched a joint report with the Royal Society looking at the health impacts of initiatives to tackle climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. As co-Chair of the group that prepared this report, Professor Sir Andy Haines FMedSci, reflects on his time at COP26 and pulls out the key messages that came out of the conference for health.A united health communityIt was gratifying to see the health community mobilised in unprecedented numbers compared to previous COP events, working together to raise the profile of health in the climate agenda.Ahead of COP26The Global Climate and Health Alliance were essential in coordinating meetings between health professionals and members of national delegations at the conference. These events helped to raise awareness of the health effects of climate change and the health benefits of climate action.The World Health Organisation (WHO) had a health pavilion which held 60 events and held a global conference on health and climate change which focussed on climate justice. The WHO also put together a COP26 special report which proposed 10 priority recommendations from the global health community to governments and policy makers, making the health case for urgent climate action.I was pleased to present the Academys recent joint report on climate change and health at an official side event put on by the InterAcademy Partnership, where I gave many win-win examples of actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that would have positive near term benefits for health.Overall: a mixed bagThe overall outcomes of COP26 were a mixed bag, with a major gap between the magnitude of the action required and the commitments made by many national governments. The goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial is barely alive, but every effort must be made to keep well under 2C.There was an important focus on coal phase out and although the final wording was weakened to phase down, the direction of travel is clear. There was also a welcome commitment to methane reduction for the first time and 105 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, compared with 2020 levels.An initiative of UK COP26 Presidency, the UNFCCC Climate Champions Team and others, was successful in securing commitments from 51 countries to develop sustainable resilient low carbon health systems, putting them on a pathway to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Of these signatories 14 nations have specified a target date for achieving net zero emissions, ranging from 2030 to 2050.Countries file Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) reflecting their commitments to deliver the goal of the Paris Agreement, limiting global temperature rise to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. An analysis of the inclusion of health in these showed that the highest ranking countries were all low and middle income nations that have contributed little to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly exposed to climate risks. All countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their current emissions targets to 2030, as expressed in their NDCs, by 2022, offering an important opportunity to strengthen the commitment to address health in the NDCs.After six years of discussions the Paris Rulebook containing guidel"

China and India had just proposed a last-minute change to the final text of the agreement, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, so that the call to phase out unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies was watered down to phase down. Delegates from other countries, from Switzerland to Cuba, deplored the move, but ultimately adopted the text in the interest of time, as the conference was runningmore than 24 hours lateby that point.\~ I apologize for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry said Sharma, who earlier in the week had told reporters he was sometimes called No-drama Sharma.

Sharma and the U.K. government had a clear goal for COP26 to keep the spirit of 1.5 alive, a reference to COP21 s milestone Paris agreement, which called for global action to prevent temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. To do so, it s crucial to reach net zero emissions by 2050 meaning that for every amount of greenhouse gas emissions, an equal number is removed from the atmosphere and, to be on track to reach that goal, scientists think global emissions should behalved by 2030.Earlier this year, a report from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that global temperatures have alreadyrisen by 1.1 degree Celsiuson pre-industrial levels. We have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action, Sharma said. It s a statement that doesn t hide the disappointment the conference organizers must have felt as the event that was dubbed the most important COP since Paris just couldn t fully deliveron its ambition.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA149","Key business takeaways from the COP26 climate summit","December 7, 2021","accountingtoday.com","Amid what is arguably one of the most crucial times in the fight against climate change, I had the incredible opportunity to join the conversation at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was the first time EY had an active role at COP, and we stood proudly alongside business leaders, NGOs, activists, government officials and dignitaries.The steps taken at COP26, such as the creation of the Glasgow Climate Pact, will continue the positive momentum for change. I'm hopeful that world leaders will take future actions to limit global warming to1.5 degrees Celsius. As primatologist Jane Goodall says, ""Hope is a call to action.""Reflecting on my time in Glasgow, two things are clear: Businesses want an active role in the climate solution, and tax policy will be on the agenda. To proactively participate in climate mitigation efforts, businesses need to understand the impacts of the Glasgow Climate Pact, seek a trusted advisor to explore the carbon credit market and learn about the carbon regimes across the globe.What's in the Glasgow Climate Pact?The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first United Nations agreement that mentions fossil fuels and asks countries to reduce their use of ""coal"" and ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies."" It asks countries to improve their 2030 national climate targets by the end of next year. The agreement establishes a dialogue for a new United Nations body to help ""vulnerable countries"" address the consequences of climate change. But what I'm most excited about is that the agreement establishes new rules for assessing carbon credits. This was a sticking point in the Paris Agreement, and now it appears to have been resolved by the Glasgow negotiations.What businesses should know about carbon credit rules\~There was substantial progress at to standardize a carbon credit market as part of theinternational carbon-tradingagreement. Under the revisedArticle 6of the Paris Agreement, the global carbon credit agreement establishes the rules around a carbon marketplace. The agreement is intended to lead to more carbon trading and renewable energy investment, and it establishes new, clearer accounting guidance for emissions trades between countries. This ""integrity framework,"" as it's being called, could result in an abundance of investments for renewable energy projects and environmental protection efforts. It could also prevent potential corporate ""greenwashing"" by establishing a more robust set of standards and accounting for carbon credits, and provide needed tools for a robust and accountable carbon market.Companies should prepare for a new carbon credit accounting and market to be established. That could impact the way they offset residual emissions. Governments need to take policy steps to implement a carbon credit market. It's prudent for businesses to partner with advisors to understand who the governing body will be and how the marketplace will be moderated. These climate-focused policies can have global and local economic impacts while also creating new investment opportunities and potential risks.Keeping pace with carbon regimesStaying on top of theevolving sustainability policy landscapeis critical for businesses that wish to take action on climate change and prepare for policy-related initiatives. Businesses need to evaluate the physical, market and regulatory impacts of climate change. Examining work practices and prioritizing long-term value and value-led sustainability are essential. Organizations are being asked to disclose their environmental, social and governance efforts. Tax departments need to be at the table when discussing longer-term strategies, since they play a key role in managing the obligations, risks and impact that increased environmental regulations introduce.Now more than ever, companies need assistance in building, implementing and reporting on global, enterprise-wide strategies that address the climate emergency. One tool that could be helpful in a business's climate change journey is ourEY Climate Cash and Tax Barometer. It reviews public and private spending to address climate change and includes interviews with sustainability officers so that others can learn best practices.To truly make their business stand out in 2022 and beyond, it's imperative that leaders embed these considerations into their mission and overall strategy.I am personally committed to the fight against climate change. And I am proud to work for an organization that is dedicated to providing the highest-level, comprehensive assistance to our clients to develop, implement, evaluate and report the strategies, methodologies, action plans and tools that are designed to reduce their carbon footprints.My hope is that COP26 will encourage more businesses to make climate change a priority so that, together, we can create a better, more sustainable working world.\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA150","COP26: How Significant Is the Glasgow Pact?","November 15, 2021 Monday","International Oil Daily","The outcome of the COP26 UN climate talks is best described as mixed. Did it deliver momentum? Undoubtedly. Urgency? Possibly. Substantive progress? Less so. Finance was also largely a fail, and the Glasgow Climate Pact still leaves a long way to go to close the gap to the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. But beyond the details of what was agreed in the COP26 text, the worldwide media coverage around the event shows that the climate issue is now more front and central than ever before. Fossil Fuels It was significant that coal got its first-ever mention in an official Conference of the Parties (COP) conclusion, and fossil fuel subsidies were referred to for the first time since the 1997 Kyoto protocol, even if the language in the final text was watered down. Opposition to this was led by Australia and Saudi Arabia, while the language was strongly supported by the EU and US, among others. It was an achievement for negotiators that it survived at all, but for now, its main importance is more symbolic than practical. The pledge on coal and subsidies seems unlikely to have an immediate impact, and does not really go beyond anything countries had already promised to do. Oil and Gas Again, the impact of the Glasgow agreement will likely be more symbolic than practical, in the near term at least. That\'e2\â‚¬  s not to say it doesn\'e2\â‚¬  t matter. Perceptions can be very important, and it\'e2\â‚¬  s fair to say that this was not the best COP for the oil and gas industry's image. Activists repeatedly called out the number of \'e2\â‚¬  fossil fuel lobbyists\'e2\â‚¬ present in the halls at Glasgow. Many of these were on national delegations, and there\'e2\â‚¬  s nothing necessarily untoward about that. Likewise, it was natural for Saudi Arabia, Australia and other producers to defend their national interests. Nonetheless, a growing negative perception of the industry was evident \'e2\â‚¬ with potential implications for the interests of international oil companies (IOCs), in particular. Their greater visibility and exposure to pressure in developed countries provides an easier target for activists. Article 6 An agreement on Article 6 \'e2\â‚¬ the long-stalled clause on carbon trading from the Paris Agreement \'e2\â‚¬ represents something of a win for IOCs. This was welcomed by the International Emissions Trading Association \'e2\â‚¬ which includes oil companies among its members, has an energetic presence at these events, and has acted as a longtime champion of Article 6. Ultimately, Article 6 could prove to be Glasgow\'e2\â‚¬  s most enduring legacy. It will set up a new framework for carbon markets, and potentially provide greater legitimacy for offsets. That seems to pass some climate campaigners' sniff tests too, on things like double counting, at least on first impression. Was It a Success? The dust has barely settled and much analysis will come in the coming days. As the COP26 halls emptied, many delegates were to be found crowded in long queues at Glasgow airport. And as news of the deal being struck began to filter through on Saturday night, general sentiment seemed to be that on the whole Glasgow was a modest success. But scientists are adamant that the world still needs to do much more to have any hope of keeping the 1.5\'c2\'b0C target alive. Many climate campaigners called Glasgow a failure, while signaling a determination to keep applying pressure to boost momentum. What Next? The coming year will likely see plenty of new policies and action based on the pledges and initiatives that emerged from COP26. This will support efforts to raise ambitions in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) \'e2\â‚¬ countries' pledges for climate action under the Paris framework \'e2\â‚¬ for the next COP in a year\'e2\â‚¬  s time in Egypt. With campaigners determined to step up pressure too, more legal cases against oil companies could also result. Activists see the courts as a key battleground \'e2\â‚¬ just as they have scored successes in corporate boardrooms and financial institutions. On a broader level, COP26 served to advance conversations about climate and the energy transition, and broadened them in wider society.

Joining CEO Ellie Cohen in Glasgow were long-time The Climate Center supporter Alex Gilchrist and chair of our Board of Directors Susan Thomas.While the negotiations between world leaders at COP26 yielded mixed results and few firm commitments, there was a lot to learn behind the scenes in Glasgow. I sat down recently with Alex and Susan to discuss their experiences.Q: Let's start on a positive note. What are you most hopeful about coming out of COP26?Susan: What is amazing about these convenings is that 200 countries come together and organizations like us get to see what's happening. What was happening outside is as important as what's going on inside. I think a ton of good work is being done.Q: At the same time, there's been a lot of criticism in the media that COP26 did not achieve enough. What's your take?Alex: Failure is what sells papers. Am I disappointed? Sure I am. But I don't compare it to past COPs and there's plenty to be hopeful about. One of the underlying themes was cooperation and collaboration.Susan: I've seen the negative press and they're not wrong. It [COP26] fell far short of expectations of people attending and far short of what's needed. But there's no other organization in the world other than the United Nations that can convene 200 countries to come together for two weeks to try to advance commitments on climate change. What that means, though, is that any agreement that comes out of the conference is going to be a compromise document.Q: Focusing on California, Governor Newsom did not make the trip to Glasgow but Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon was there. He said during the conference that California is not leading on climate anymore. What's your response?Alex: I like that he's rattling cages. Go and encourage the masses to do better. It's great. Very motivational.Susan: California is no longer a leader in climate change policy. This is very distressing to a number of officials in the state legislature, and it should be. We are the fifth-largest economy in the world and we have outsized influence, so for us not to be lagging behind is unconscionable. I do feel hope that our current legislators can do more, but the oil and gas lobby is very powerful in California. We all need to hold elected officials accountable for their action or inaction on climate.Q: How did being at COP26 change the way you think about The Climate Center's work and the Climate-Safe California campaign?Alex: It [Climate-Safe California] goes past where the groupthink is. We have to go past carbon neutral to net negative emissions. I think it's a very comprehensive approach and I like the fact that it's aggressive. A lot of people are missing the ability to use natural lands to sequester carbon. I think it's absolutely the right approach.Susan: I think what we're doing at The Climate Center to affect state policy is really important and necessary. The fundamental strategy is the right thing to do because it's the fastest way to affect change. We're very focused. Legislation is the fastest way to change behavior and that's our thing.Q: How has your time in Glasgow changed the way you see yourself within the climate movement?Alex: I stopped seeing myself as just part of the masses in the protest movement. I'll continue to protest, but I'm going to educate myself further. I learned what I didn't know in Glasgow. Now I need to be more outspoken in my circles. As a consumer, when I walk into a business, I'll ask about their supply chain to be sure it's carbon neutral.I'm part of a faith community with more than 200 members. There's a spiritual dimension to this. We want to care for the planet that we all live on. It is our home and nurtures all of us in so many ways. Forty percent of the United States is still anchored to a faith community, so it's a big chunk of us who can have influence.Susan: COP26Q: What about COP26 or anything you learned at the conference surprised you?Alex: As far as Â£ha' moments, the natural world's role in sequestering carbon is what surprised me most. Of course, we know the ocean is a carbon sink, but things like peatlands. I happen to enjoy whiskey every now and again and of course, whiskey is flavored with peat. I wondered what the difference is between peatlands and wetlands. It turns out there's a huge difference and peatlands are actually more important for sequestering carbon. That was hugely educational for me.Susan: Being there energized me to make sure that I enlist people to get involved. I sent a lot of info back to people I know. That kind of energy is what I came away with -- not just a base of knowledge, but passion.Susan: There were NGOs and university students there every day who, in real-time with the simplest of equipment, were reporting on the conference. This helps with accountability. Anyone can document climate change and voice opinions. I found that really inspirational. Artists and filmmakers with the barest of equipment can talk about climate.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA155","Climate Action Pretense At COP26 \u8211  OpEd","November 18, 2021 Thursday","Eurasia Review","Joe Biden's presence at was a photo opportunity giving the impression that he is fighting the climate crisis. But the U.S. and other governments continue carbon production while pretending to take action and ignore the needs of the Global South who suffer at the hands of the rich nationsThe 26th Conference of the Parties, COP26, climate summit ended with its president fighting back tears. Alok Sharma came to Glasgow, Scotland hoping for an agreement to end the extraction of coal. Instead he said this, ""I apologize for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry.""The international climate conferences are a perennial disappointment to anyone who understands the depth of the world wide catastrophe. Every year the rich capitalist nations find a way to undermine the process and consign millions of people to misery and devastation. Activists from all over the world gather in an effort to have an impact on the process, but they are literally outnumbered by fossil fuel lobbyists who always get what they want.This conference ended with an agreement to ""phase down"" the use of coal instead of phasing it out altogether. Phasing down is deliberately ambiguous and makes a mockery of the 2015 Paris meeting which ended with an agreement to allow a temperature increase of no more than 1.5 C. The fact that climate agreements allow world temperatures to rise is but one indication that the process falls far short from what the world needs.Yet the seemingly small 1.5 C will have devastating consequences, with droughts and storms bringing catastrophe to millions of people. The can is always kicked down the road and the final agreement is a sham.It doesn't matter if democrats show up at COP26 if they refuse to respond to elephants in the room. The United States military is the world's biggest polluter but its carbon production, and that of other nations' forces, are exempt from climate goals. When a journalist asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders about military spending and its role in climate change, it was clear they had never considered the issue at all. They were shocked to be asked a question which showed a direct relationship between their actions and global warming and then responded with nonsense. They said the military, which contributes to climate change, needs money to respond to the climate change it causes by its very existence. Why does it matter that George W. Bush and Donald Trump withdrew from previous climate agreements if democrats follow in their footsteps and ignore even the flimsy goals it asked the U.S. to meet?Joe Biden appeared in Glasgow but no one should be impressed. Like his predecessors he has opened public lands to oil drilling. Keeping temperature rise to 1.5 C requires that carbon emissions be cut in half. If the United States were serious there would be no fossil fuel extraction on public lands. It would have to end altogether.The U.S. is not the only nation keeping the status quo as the world heads toward a cliff. Brazil and Indonesia continue massive deforestation for logging and cash crop production but claim they will adhere to the agreement requiring the practice to end by 2030. Apparently they plan to destroy all of their forests before that time and then pat themselves on the back because they are no longer killing trees. India insisted on watering the coal extraction language, but if other nations had been serious they would have spoken up and demanded an end to the world wide coal industry. India agreed to be the bad cop in this story. The G20 nations have subsidized fossil fuel production to the tune of $3 trillion just since 2015. Clearly the U.S. is not alone in its subterfuge.Meanwhile the need to compensate the Global South for environmental damage is placed on the back burner of priorities. In 2009 rich nations promised to pay $100 billion per year for five years beginning in 2020. There is no mechanism to do this and the final COP26 agreement only includes a promise to continue discussing a problem which is already clearly understood.The movement needed to fight for climate justice must be massive and international in scope. The first order of business is to understand the manipulations and duplicity that COP26 and prior agreements have engendered. Kyoto, Paris and now Glasgow are not the saviors they pretended to be. They are in fact the obstacles.\l"

Wright[1] PDF Version:Preliminary Reflections on COP26 Matter Commented On: COP26[3] (Twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the Glasgow Climate Pact[4] (Decision -/CMA.3) Developments in UNFCCC & Paris Agreement Implementation This post is Part 2 of two posts presenting preliminary reflections soon after the conclusion of COP26 in Glasgow. In this part, I present and briefly discuss notable developments (or lack of) within the formal negotiations process with respect to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). A key objective for this particular conference was to finalize the rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement (see this helpful background document[5] on the Paris Agreement and rulebook). This did indeed happen, and most would agree that this constitutes a success even if there is discontent with some of the final features. It is a particularly significant step forward as there was a risk that Parties would not reach an agreement on the rulebook entirely, resulting in further delay in implementation (on top of losing a year due to a pandemic-induced postponement last year) and loss of confidence in the basic structure and approach of the Paris Agreement. The following discusses several of the notable developments on the rulebook front, as well as several other (but not all) matters. Mitigation Ambition Earlier this year, well before COP26 but formally within the ongoing Paris Agreement process to raise ambition in parties' respective 'Nationally Determined Contributions' to reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, Canada announced an updated emission reduction target[6] of 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030. There was worry in the lead-up to COP26 that too few parties had taken a similar step. That amplified long-standing concerns around the persistent 'emissions gap' between commitments under the Paris Agreement, most specifically to keep warming to 1.5 degrees, and actual measures that parties would take at the domestic level to implement Paris commitments (see this year's annual Emissions Gap Report[7] by the United Nations Environment Programme). Many were watching to see whether fresh rounds of higher ambition pledges before and during COP26 would add up to emission reductions in l"

Read his full speech below.""Thank you, and many thanks to my colleague Mr Speaker, for his remarks.I also want to thank the IPU and the BGIPU for organising this important meeting in the fantastic setting of the Kelvingrove Museum.Now, you can probably tell from my accent that I'm ""from around here."" I was born and raised in the West of Scotland, in a town called Dumbarton on the banks of the Clyde. I still live there now, when I'm not carrying out my duties from the Woolsack in the House of Lords.Dumbarton is about 20 minutes' drive from here, or (much more appropriately for this audience at COP26So, I'm proud to welcome you all to this part of the world, my home, for this crucial COP26 meeting.My family and I often visit this museum. In fact, two of my grandchildren are here today with me. I'm sure you'll agree that it's a truly inspiring place for our gathering.The exhibitions that surround us now are reminder of our amazing planet and all that is at stake during our discussions.It reminds us of the natural and technological precious assets that we could lose forever.It reminds us of the cultures that could be wiped away, if we don't take action.And it reminds us of the duty we have as parliamentarians in the battle against climate change.Even when the global economy shut down as a result of the pandemic, our emissions only dropped by 6%. This illustrates the enormity of the challenge ahead of us if we are to maintain the necessary pace for lasting change.So we have to find real, radical and alternative solutions to reduce the global temperatures, and that's the challenge we've got ahead of us.As parliamentarians we have a real responsibility. We have a duty to speak for all the people of this planet, including those whose voices are not always heard, and yet are the most affected.As Pope Francis has said:""We have to realize that a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.""This brings me on to the reason why we are gathered in this room, which is to reflect on our roles and how we can make a difference.As we know, this COP26 summit only lasts 2 weeks.But when we depart and the cameras go away, what are the risks if the dialogue suddenly stops after that?Where, then, will these important conversations about the emergency that faces our planet, continue?It is, of course, in our Parliaments.It is in these institutions from which these issues can be debated, and more importantly, actioned, through legislation.Daniel Greenberg, a parliamentary lawyer, captured this idea very well when he recently said. I quote ""rhetoric is not always as empty as it may appear on the surface. In Government and Parliament, one sees all the time how apparently endless dialogue suddenly emerges into real world change.""He went on to give the example of the Parliamentary debates over the Good Friday Agreement, and how ultimately that dialogue directly led to peace for the people of Northern Ireland.The success of the Good Friday Agreement was down to many years of face-to-face engagement and dialogue which helped to foster and repair relationships.The lesson for us here is that to achieve our agreed climate goals, our engagement must continue beyond these two weeks.And so, such dialogue, the lifeblood of our Parliaments, can lead to change.As Lord Speaker, I am aware that the House of Lords plays an influential role on the climate change debate in this country. I count myself fortunate to be sharing the Chamber with some of the leading thinkers on climate change.The red benches of the House of Lords and the green benches of the House of Commons are well-known around the world, but I would contend the House of Lords is, in terms of our expertise and contribution in this area, impressively green!Let me give you just a few examples. In the House of Lords we have our own Committee on the Environment and Climate Change, set up this year, and chaired by Baroness Parminter. Its remit is to hold the Government to account on issues like biodiversity and ensure that climate change action is embedded into all areas of government policy.We have in our ranks the current Chairman of the Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben. As well as having the Peers for the Planet group, chaired by Baroness Hayman who do excellent work. Both Lord Stern and Astronomer Royal Lord Rees of Ludlow are renowned globally for their work on climate change and related fields.When the Environment Bill comes back to the Lords next week, we will see Green Peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb fighting for local support to our transition to a zero-carbon economy.You'll see the Duke of Wellington continuing his campaign for sewage-free rivers.And you'll see Baroness Hayman of Ullock fighting for cleaner air.These examples are just a few to demonstrate that The House of Lords is a place of dialogue, scrutiny and concrete action.So, I want to end by thanking you again for your participation, and most importantly your future action and commitment.Let's never forget the crucial role that Parliaments will play in the conversation on climate change long after COP26 has ended.And I hope that when my grandchildren, sat just here, return to this museum, in years to come, they know that their Grandfather and you, my colleagues chose to do the right thing for our planet using the important Parliamentary platform we have been given.Thank you.""\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA164","COP26 - Where to Go From Here","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 02, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.comhttp://3blmedia.com Like so many others in the wake of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (or COP26 as we know it), I'm doing my best to digest the outcomes. The 'should haves' and'could haves'need to be put on hold for now, in favour of facing the future head-on and focusing on what we can do to mitigate further damage to the planet. I attended COP26 On the one hand, I'm wondering if reversibility is even a realistic goal. On the other, can we adopt a robust adaptability approach in time? The largest political gathering ever held in the UK overran, as predicted, until an agreement was finally thrashed out on the table. The new Glasgow Climate Pact is born out of the COP26 climate summit, a universal agreement that while 1.5C is the required goal, reaching it will vary in importance from nation to nation. Still, it did not come without controversy. China and India's decision to wade in at the last second, watering down the term 'phase-outs' to a weaker sounding and more ambiguous 'phase down' when talking about 'unabated' coal, left most feeling discouraged. And somehow, animal agriculture wasn't given a high status as a topic for discussion despite the global food system being responsible for nearly a third of emissions. But it isn't all doom and gloom. Even in the face of China and India's request for a last-minute change and lack of solid progress surrounding climate finance and adaptation, loss and damage, 190 nations have supported the Glasgow Climate Pact. Moreover, we should be immensely proud of what has been achieved by Alok Sharma (COP26 president) and his team. Sharma had to put his tears, frustrations and deep sorrow by the wayside over the negotiation outcome for the unfortunate new phrasing for coal power, to ensure the deal was protected with the developing countries and vulnerable island nations in mind. The new pact requests that countries update their current national plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, known as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), to the Paris Agreement by COP27, hosted in Egypt next year. Only India managed to produce a new NDC at the talks, but a new roadmap was designed for NDC revisions which I hope will hasten the pace somewhat. Time will tell. The Glasgow Climate Pact has called for countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance to developing nations. This is a historic commitment, but countries now need to delve deeper into their pockets to support the climate crisis already devastating many countries. Adaptation strategies to reduce the negative impact of climate change, whether they are reactive or anticipatory, will need to ensure nobody is abandoned and everyone will benefit from a climate-resilient future. So now, we must all collectively work towards the future and remain optimistic. Progress is being made - albeit slowly - towards COP27, which I hope will bring a little less drama and a lot more stability.

Answering questions from schoolchildren at a specialDowning Street news conference[1] this week, the prime minister said it would be'touch and go' whether world leaders could achieve the necessary agreements to protect the planet. But he added: 'I think it can be done.' Here is what the rest of the world is saying. Scottish setting 'It was once dubbed Europe's murder capital, but this year it was voted the world's friendliest city,' saidAl Jazeera[2]. Glasgow, 'home to one of the most bitter football rivalries', has rarely lacked drama and from Sunday will 'take centre stage as the host of a highly anticipated summit seen by many as the last chance to avert a global climate catastrophe'. The news site, which is part-fundedby the Qatari government, predicted that this 'city of contrasts' will either be 'hailed as the scene of a spectacular success or lamented as the place where dreams of a better tomorrow were extinguished'. Temperature talk The activists and delegates heading to the Scottish city from across the world 'have reason to be anxious', wrote climate campaigner Eleanor Salter inThe New York Times[3]. The summit represents 'perhaps one of the world's last chances' to limit the rise in global average temperature to less than 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Johnson has generally displayed 'bombastic optimism' that other countries will step up, said Salter, but Britain is 'far from a climate hero'.A 'glance' behind Johnson's speeches 'reveals hypocrisy everywhere'. Cop26, she continued. And ultimately, 'warm words won't stop a warming world'. Pressing agendas The negotiations Â£re likely to be fraught', saidFrance24[4]. The 'rulebook' on how climate goals are measured is yet to be finalised, 'long-festering disputes' over the governance of carbon markets persist, and poorer nations are calling on wealthier ones to make good on funding promises.

After a summer of fire and flood and a code red from climate scientists, we must reckon with the scale, immediacy and inequity of the climate crisis right now, said Nigel Topping, climate action champion at .  We need urgent, innovative breakthroughs on resilience and to address loss and damage. The Race to Resilience set out with a necessary goal of building the resilience of four billion people to climate hazards by 2030. The metrics framework and analytics underneath them will ensure we are backing the actions we know can increase resilience and help mobilise more resources toward them, Topping said.  This is just the start though. We need greater ambition and action from all actors to help communities adapt and build resilience to climate change. Sagarika Chatterjee, director of climate change at the Principles for Responsible Investment, said,  We need to focus more on resilience. Four billion people are susceptible to the physical impact of climate change.

By Michael Paparian, Special to CalMatters Michael Paparian is a former deputy state Treasurer and serves as senior adviser to the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative[1], a nonprofit that provides climate certifications to bonds worldwide. If you're a fan of platitudes, promises and pledges, you weren't disappointed in the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. But at least one significant positive action by the state of California went largely unnoticed. In fairness, COP26[2] overall was viewed as a modest success, but it fell well short of what we need to do to combat climate change, making positive actions taken by governments such as California even more important to not only showcase but to emulate elsewhere. I was among the 30,000 in attendance, and California was well represented. The state is treated in many circles like a major country. Though Gov. Gavin Newsom cancelled his trip at the last minute, the lieutenant governor and dozens of other California administration officials, legislators, scientists, activists and others were there. Keep tabs on the latest California policy and politics news California has much to be proud of in accomplishments and planned actions. During COP26, California pledged to stop selling gas cars by 2035, joined a coalition pledging to phase out fossil fuels and touted the many policies and programs that make California a climate leader. But most of the California leaders at COP26 missed one of the most significant accomplishments of Newsom's administration. Just two days into COP26, the state sold its first ever climate-certified bond for more than $465 million. In doing so, the state confirmed that a major infrastructure project is fully aligned with the climate goals of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade or less. The certification is hard to come by and is backed by scientifically credible analyses that a project is climate friendly and consistent with the infrastructure we need in the climate-challenged world. Bonds are used to fund infrastructure projects, from water and wastewater facilities to transportation systems to schools, hospitals, buildings and much more. However only a small, but growing fraction of the $450 billion in annual state and local bonds in the U.S. are labelled green. And an even smaller fraction is climate certified. The project financed by the recent climate certified bond is the new California Natural Resources Agency building. Not only will it be among the greenest office buildings ever built, it will use 'zero net energy.' In other words, through an agreement with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District to use solar energy, the building will produce as much renewable energy as it uses. Investors recognize that, for term stability, they need to steer their funds toward climate friendly projects. Green bonds verified by an independent third party provide one signal of climate friendl"

You'd think with this kind of landscape sustainability would be a pretty big priority. Instead, we have a federal government led by Prime Minister Morrison, who in 2017took a lump of coal to parliament[5]. The United NationsSustainable Development Report 2021[6]positions Australia as having done the least out of 193 countries to combat climate change. Anyone thinking the Australian government (who has had seven Prime Ministers in 10 years) has any real will to act is sadly deluded. The sponsor for the Australian booth at COP26 is a gas company  you can't make this stuff up! Day 3 of #COP26Turns out being sponsored by the gas industry isn't as cool as @AngusTaylorMP[9]@ScottMorrisonMP[10] thought. #auspol[11]pic.twitter .com/5S97Ja7RSM[12];  Michael Poland (@michaelpoland_) November 3, 2021[13] Like with any gathering of politicians, there's plenty of sleeping on the job. Guess the speaker#COP26[14]pic.twitter .com/CjwjyfsL7Z[15]; For example,in Victoria[20], owners of plug-in hybrid vehicle incur a charge for an indexed fee of 2 cents per kilometer. The charge for any other electric vehicles is an indexed fee of 2.5 cents per kilometer. It's like taxing people who give up Coca-Cola for not bringing in income from the sugar lobby. Never mind the other benefits of carbon reduction, like reduced health costs from improved air quality. If this astonishing move isn't bad enough, breathe in, it gets worse. COP this: you can subsidize a gas-guzzling ute Back in March 2020, the Australian federal government unveiled a stimulus package worth $17.6 billion. Included is the ability to write off the cost of a ute (aka utility truck or pickup truck) up to the top $150,000 threshold value, as long as they have a one-tonne payload or more. HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.comhttps://thenextweb.comcop26#The Murdoch-owned Australian media celebrates the ute tax write-off. So you can buy a gas-guzzling ute, but have to pay a tax if you buy an electric vehicle. No wonder utes areAustralia's top-selling cars[21].; This kinda thing passes through parliament using rhetoric about 'saving Australian jobs.' But let's be clear, Australia's automotive industry started dying decades ago, with the last car made in the country in 2017[22]. Australia's top-selling utes aren't even madein Australia[23].  I mention this deliberately as the biggest innovation in auto manufacturing in Australia right now are probably theH2X Global[24]powered by hydrogen HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.com/news/are-hydrogen-fuel-cells-the-future-of-green-transport-sortaandhttps://thenextweb.com/news/are-hydrogen-fuel-cells-the-future-of-green-transport-sortaand theAce Yewt[25] EV ute. Startups are the creators of these vehicles.

An example of a radical industry pivot is Fortescue Future Industries[26] (FFI). FFI is the green arm of Australian coal   Fortescue Metals Group. The company's founder is Australia's second-richest person, the infamous Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest. Their focus is green hydrogen andto achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. It's part of a gradual transition from an iron ore producer to a green renewables and resources company. Just before COP26, the company shared a deal to become the biggest supplier of green hydrogen[27]to the UK and previously signed an MOU to deliverhydrogen into Japan[28]. Look, I'm not under any illusion that business tax credits aren't a heavily contributing factor.I don't think that we'll ever see the demise of the parent coal company. I also would like countries to produce their own green hydrogen rather than importing it. But for a country like Australia that's so very addicted to coal, it's a good start.

They can also speak to freedom of action and permissiveness. At COP26, that permissiveness was all the more present in the haggling ahead of what would become the Glasgow Climate Pact. COP26COP26 president Alok Sharma called the outcome[2] Â£ fragile win', the outcome of 'hard work' and 'great cooperation' from the parties. The Pact is a flurry of words[3], acknowledging, for instance 'the importance of the best available science for effective climate action and policymaking.' Alarm and utmost concern is expressed by the parties at the fact 'that human activities have caused around 1.1 C of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region'. There is a stress on 'the urgency of enhancing ambition and acting in relation to mitigation adaptation and finance in this critical decade to address gaps between current efforts and pathways in pursuit of the ultimate objective of the Convention and its long-term global goal'. The pact had gone through a few iterations, stirring interest, sparking hope, even inducing, at points, a giddy optimism. The first draft[4] had called upon the Parties 'to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil-fuels'. Its appearance was considered[5] by The New Scientist to be 'remarkable' for explicitly mentioning fossil fuels, while Ed King of the European Climate Foundation suggested[6] that it was 'the first time fossil fuels have been called out in a draft UN climate decision text'. But in the final statement, an exit for countries still keen to keep the heart of coal alive, was carved. The parties might well ensure that technologies and policies would be adopted 'to transition towards low-emission energy systems', scale up the 'deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures' but this would also entail Â£ccelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies'. As this was undertaken, 'targeted support' would be directed towards 'the poorest and most vulnerable in l"

Thousands of people attended, organisations held hundreds of side of events, and a number of initiatives and plans were announced. But what does it all lead to? At the Global Resilience Partnership, we are taking forward the momentum and collaborations from COP26 into action to build a resilient future.This COP saw much more attention and funding being driven into resilience and adaptation from governments, the private sector, and communities. We are calling for resilience and adaptation to be equally supported alongside mitigation, and we are using our eight years of experience in resilience to help shape and support new initiatives and activities. Below are the key numbers, announcements, and actions that we as a Partnership were involved with at COP26 and will take forward in the coming months.Resilience Hub With over 154 events from 80 event partners featuring 176 participating organisations, the first ever COP Resilience Hub brought together a community of state and non-state actors in an unprecedented collaboration.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA183","UN\u8216 s COP26 is wrong climate strategy","January 18, 2022 Tuesday","Arizona Capitol Times","President Biden and the Democrats have a problem. For the second time in six years, a Democratic president has negotiated an international agreement that will never be presented to the U.S. Senate for consent and will never be voted on by any of America\' s elected officials. They have negotiated an international agreement that will likely be overturned by the next Republican president, and emissions will continue to fall regardless. The problem for the Democrats is that their supposed climate leadership isn\' t real.The Democrats don\' t want to solve the climate crisis. Their true goal is to destroy the fossil fuels industry and, by extension, destroy the communities supported by that industry. The Democrats pretend to care about the climate crisis, yet continually introduce unrealistic proposals that have less than a zero percent chance of being passed, shove climate boondoggles and unsound tax breaks into multi-trillion-dollar, omnibus bills that, if passed at all, would be done so on the smallest partisan margins in a generation.That isn\' t leadership. Going to international forums to make promises that hold no authority isn\' t leadership. Blowing out the deficit on wishful policies and unsound theories isn\' t leadership. Supporting a degrowth plan for the climate crisis isn\' t leadership. Focusing on making the transition to a clean economy as painful as possible isn\' t leadership.I just spent the week atCOP26 and the Global Conservative Climate Summitthat transpired at the same time as COP 26, a United Nations climate change conference. At those events, I found true climate leadership. We heard from conservative and liberal politicians from around the world, as well as from innovators, engineers, economists, and scientists. Outside of COP26 was where real leadership and ideas could be found.In conservative climate circles, the focus was not on rushing the transition to clean energy as Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm seems dead-set on doing, but instead as an opportunity to refocus our economy toward serving individuals and communities, and decoupling from China. In conservative climate circles, we see the climate challenge as an opportunity to spearhead American and Western leadership in manufacturing, automobiles, energy policy, land conservation, and water management. In conservative climate circles, the market is an ally, not a foe.At the same time across Glasgow, former President Obama, President Biden, and myriad other world leaders, one right after another, lectured the world about how we are failing to meet the current crisis with the veracity needed. In the world they described, we must regress to the Middle Ages, give up our technological advances, and pray that maybe, just maybe, the Chinese Communist Party would shut down a couple of their coal plants.Needless to say, most of those supposed  leaders arrived at COP26 in multi-vehicle armored motorcades after flying across the world in private jets.While one side is projecting optimism about our ability to meet our present challenge, the other side finds it fit to lecture us about how horrible we are. What makes all of this lecturing, hectoring, and hypocrisy even better is that one major industrial economy stands apart from the rest, not for its emissions increase, but rather its emissions decrease.The United States, much-maligned following President Trump\' s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords, is the only major industrial economy to actually see its net emissions drop. That drop wasn\' t facilitated by White House dictate, but rather market mechanisms in which technological innovations in natural gas production made transitions away from more carbon-intensive coal easier reducing our emissions while also embracing the economic prosperity that often comes with innovation.This brings us back to where we began. Under President Trump, the United States was a global leader in emissions reduction. Under President Biden, the United States has halted or greatly restricted the expansion of natural gas as an energy source, canceled or halted major oil pipel"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA184","FACT SHEET: COP26 - CHILDREN AND CLIMATE CHANGE","November 1, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF):UNICEF will be at COP26 to ensure that the climate crisis is recognized as a crisis for children and their rights, to promote approaches to decrease climate risk for those who are most vulnerable, and to support children and young people's participation in COP26 as part of efforts to support children and young people's participation in climate-related decision-making.""COP26COP26 have a significant, time-sensitive opportunity to redirect the terrible path we are on. They can do so by committing to strengthening the resilience of services that children depend upon, and by cutting emissions faster and deeper. The futures of billions of children depend on it.""Key Messages :The climate crisis is a child rights crisis.Climate change poses a major threat to children and young people's health, nutrition, education, development, survival and future potential. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors.Critically, current and future generations of children will have to navigate an uncertain future where the current model of growth that links economic development to environmental exploitation is no longer viable.An August UNICEF report, The Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), found almost every child on earth is exposed to at least one climate and environmental hazard, such as heatwaves, cyclones, air pollution, flooding and water scarcity.Approximately 1 billion children nearly half the world's children - live in 33 countries classified in the Index as ""extremely high-risk"". These children face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education.An estimated 850 million children over one third of all children live in areas where at least four of climate and environmental shocks overlap, and as many as 330 million children live in areas affected by a staggering five major climate shocks.Children from countries that contribute the least to climate change suffer the greatest consequences. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit 9 per cent of CO2 emissions. The 10 highest-risk countries collectively emit only 0.5 per cent of global emissions.Improving the resilience of key services that children depend upon is often the best investment to reduce the risks they face.Access to resilient water, sanitation and hygiene services reduces risks for 415 million children.Climate-smart health services reduce risks for 460 million children.Resilient schools and education systems reduce risks for 275 million children.And climate-responsive social safety nets reduce risks for 310 million children.Action at COP26Increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience.UNICEF urges developed countries to exceed their 2009 promise to mobilize $US100 billion annually in climate finance in light of evidence that these sums are insufficient to address the scale of climate impacts. UNICEF urges a greater emphasis on funding to build climate resilience and adaptive capacity.Mitigation efforts will take decades to reverse the impacts of climate change, and for the children of today, this will be too late. Unless we invest heavily in adaptation and resilience of social services for the 4.2 billion children born over the next 30 years, these children will face increasingly high risks to their survival and well-being.Critical services must be adapted, such as water, sanitation and hygiene systems, health and education services.It is imperative that, at COP26, countries commit to increasing investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children, prioritising the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. The decisions made at COP26 will shape the lives of every child in every nation on earth, now and in the future.Reduce greenhouse gas emissions.UNICEF is urging countries to cut their emissions by at least 45 per cent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2030 to keep warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.The number of children that UNICEF estimates to be at 'extremely high-risk' of the impacts of climate change will likely increase as the impacts of climate change accelerate.Include young people in all climate negotiations and decisions.UNICEF supports young people's calls for governments to end the consistent omission of young people, especially those from the most affected places.Young people continue to demand comprehensive, bold climate action from decision makers. As yet, the action demanded has not materialized to the levels required.Children and young people are underrepresented in policies and policy discussions despite being the major stakeholder in their outcomes. They are therefore limited in their ability to influence decisions that are critical to their future.Children's rights and voices must be reflected and included in the implementation of the Paris Agreement at national, regional and international levels. COP26 presents a critical opportunity to formalise this. 2022 will mark 30 years since the UNFCCC Convention was drafted and yet in that time, there has never been a decision focused on children and young people in climate action taken under the UNFCCC.Every government must provide climate education for children and young people so that they can meaningfully contribute to and participate in climate policy and action.# # # # #Notes to EditorsSpokespeople in Glasgow:Gautam Narasimhan, 1-6 November (UNICEF Global Lead on Climate, Energy and EnvironmentSilvia Gaya, 1-8 November (UNICEF senior adviser on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene)Valentina Otmacic, 9-12 November (UNICEF Deputy Director of Advocacy)We are also working with more than 20 youth climate advocates/activists including from countries worst affected by climate change.

""We were a little bit skeptical with everything going on, but when we got reassured that the meeting was being organized well we made plans and were fortunate enough to go. It was really a great experience.""Abate described the intensive COVID testing protocols that were in place at the convention, which required everyone to conduct daily self tests and produce a negative result before entering the venue. ""We were tested to death, but it was all for a good purpose,"" he joked.""More specific to the experience at the actual event, the Covid protocols just delayed things and restricted access in a way that was frustrating,"" he continued. ""The number of people allowed in the rooms was severely restricted. I had at least three or four sessions that I really wanted to attend but the door was shut and I was on a wait list that I was not able to get off of. I was literally running from event to event trying to avoid that, and it was unavoidable.""Many developing countries were unable to send representatives to Glasgow to attend the conference in-person due to COVID travel restrictions. Participation was further hindered due to technical difficulties experienced during the first few days of the convention that limited their ability to participate remotely.MacDonald described COP26 as ""a big convention for climate nerds"" and admired the networking opportunities it presented. Abate, however, had a very different networking experience and expressed that he often felt that the environment was overwhelming. ""It was a landscape that was very different for me, having primarily attended academic conferences in my career,"" he said.MacDonald and Abate also had different perspectives about the successes and shortcomings of the conference, with Abate tending to have more pessimistic views about what he felt was unsubstantial progress.""I'll try to say this with as little cynicism as I can - I would characterize the positive outcomes as seizing the low-hanging fruit. They're far better than not moving forward on these issues, but they are baby steps in the grand scheme of things,"" said Abate.Specifically, he referenced agreements among over 100 nations to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and commitments from countries with 90 percent of the world's forests to halt and reverse deforestation in that same time frame. According to Abate, these agreements were already being discussed prior to COP26 and were merely confirmed during the conference.""I'm a little bit less cynical than Randy even though I agree with everything he said,"" commented MacDonald. He went on to explain general changes in attitude and high ambitions he observed at the conference that he believed were indicative of progress, specifically noting increased engagement from the private sector and commitments made by the U.S. to decarbonize the shipping industry and electrify vehicles.Adding to the conversation about U.S. involvement, Abate commented on the nation's recent role in the climate crisis and the influence politics has had on climate engagement. ""One thing to take away from the U.S. and its engagement on climate change for the past three decades is that regardless of whether we've had a Republican or a Democratic administration, it's been well below where it needs to be,"" he explained. ""The U.S. needs to be the leader that it was on international environment issues in the 80's. We were a leader, and then we became part of the problem for the next three decades.""Still, the U.S. has taken steps in the right direction to better address the climate crisis. Notable progress has been made since the Trump administration, reengagement in the COP process being one of the most prominent improvements thus far. Still, Abate pointed out that the Biden administration can only make so much progress without Congressional support, which has remained largely divided when it comes to implementing climate legislation.Youth engagement was also cited as another avenue of progress at COP26. Abate noted the importance of involving youth activists in climate change regulation because ""it's the future they're going to inherit,"" but was still critical of what he described as participation opportunities that were ""better than nothing, but certainly not at the level that it should be.""Upon their return to Monmouth, Abate and MacDonald have been looking for ways to keep the conversation about climate change moving and incorporate it into different curriculums on campus.""I think there are more opportunities than people recognize,"" said MacDonald. ""This is really an issue that will affect everybody, so there's a role for anyone at Monmouth who's interested in this whether it's their career or not.""\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA189","COP26 is performative climate activism","November 18, 2021 Thursday","Pipe Dream: SUNY at Binghamton","CloseFrom Oct. 31 to Nov. 12, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) was held to address the issue of climate change. Those present included leaders such as President Joe Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Included also in attendance was Jeff Bezos. Although the stated purpose of the event was to combat climate change, many people have been less than confident in those who attended. This skepticism took the form of protests across the world, which accused COP26 of greenwashing, or behaving in a performative manner without putting forth real solutions.This skepticism is understandable, considering the presence of Bezos, CEO of Amazon and the second richest man in the world. Bezos, having recently returned from space, claimed that having seen Earth from above has given him a new perspective on its fragility and our need to conserve it.This is a nice sentiment. It would be more credible if not for the fact that Amazon increased its carbon footprint by 19 percent over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and that the majority of people threatened by climate change are able to understand its significance without a multibillion-dollar space flight. This reality was made apparent to millions of Americans as they suffered droughts, which resulted in wildfires in California just last year.It is ironic to hear someone like Bezos suddenly claim to be a climate activist, especially when considering that the rise of capitalism and the drive for profit is responsible. Carbon emissions began as much of the Western world began to industrialize.It is also worth noting that climate change was observed for the first time in the 1930s, and began to be discussed on the U.N. agenda in the 1970s. There has been increased awareness since, but for Bezos to present himself as having recently been enlightened after a $5.5 billion space flight - which cost more than the $2 billion he promised to contribute to battling climate change at the event - is damning.But the problematic nature of his being allowed to speak goes beyond incidents of hypocrisy. These contradictions are dwarfed by the ultimate contradiction of his attendance: he should have been a subject of discussion, rather than a guest. A serious examination of climate change should put at its focus the regulation of corporations like Amazon. Global warming is correlated with America's emergence as a capitalistic industrial powerhouse, and environmental conservation and the capitalist drive for resources are diametrically opposed.Positively, the nations present at the COP26 were able to come to an agreement. However, there were ways in which the results were insufficient. An agreement was reached to reduce gas emissions by over one gigaton by 2030, which is certainly an improvement, but this is still not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Objections to the demand that coal use be eliminated were raised primarily by China and India, two countries that have only recently industrialized, along with the United States. Even this issue can be traced to the industrial capitalism that has given Bezos power. Industrialization is the only means for China and India, both of which suffered under imperialist intervention historically, to remain competitive and essentially hold onto their autonomy. It is worth noting as well that many of the products sold on Amazon are manufactured in China. This further ties carbon emissions to the profit drive.This issue is exacerbated by the fact that very little was done in helping developing countries adapt to more environmentally sustainable practices. In 2009, the developed world promised ""$100 billion a year by 2020"" to underdeveloped countries to help them adapt, according to bbc.com. However, this goal has not been achieved. Those present at the event discussed setting $100 billion as a goal for 2023, but experts are skeptical that that will be enough. It is understandable that among those who protested around the world included Indigenous activists from Brazil and Ecuador - areas which, like the rest of the Global South, will be affected drastically by climate change despite their low rates of emissions. Alina Averchenkova of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment has stated that ""we need to move trillions in both public and private money."" Thus far, we have fallen short of both what is needed and what we can afford.COP26 discussed issues that didn't seem to get resolved. It saw money promised that fails to address issues sufficiently. Those in attendance were those who have been in power as we have come closer and closer to an ecological collapse, and who have, for the most part, allowed us to continue on this track.It is little wonder that Greta Thunberg derided the event as ""people in power pretending to take our future seriously.""Desmond Keuper is a sophomore majoring in philosophy.\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA191","COP26 and Article 6: Where Did Singapore End Up?","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 17, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com As COP26Finally, on Saturday evening, the 'Glasgow Climate Pact' (the 'Pact') was announced, a deal agreed by almost 200 nations, including Singapore. The Pact has resolved a series of outstanding issues relating to the Paris Agreement and includes, crucially, terms for the implementation of Article 6, which have the potential to, in theory, provide a platform for the scaling up of carbon markets around the globe. As we highlighted last week (Singapore: COP26 and Creating a Center for Carbon Trading[1]), the specific issues relating to Article 6 that needed to be resolved were, essentially: Whether Article 6.2 should contribute to generating revenue for the 'Adaptation Fund' (the fund is designed to finance climate change adaptation projects and programs based on the priorities of eligible developing nations and is financed by a share of the proceeds arising from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) developed under the Kyoto Protocol). Concerns around the potential double-counting of credits from emissions reductions under Article 6.4. The eligibility of pre-2020 carbon credits for post-2020 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) (this was favored by emerging economies who are currently carrying significant volumes of credits from reductions in industrial emissions and forest conservation work). The means by which Article 6 could support adaptation action through generating finance for added adaptation via Article 6.28. The key terms of the Pact, insofar as they relate to Article 6, can be summarized as follows: Share of proceeds - a fixed tariff on emissions trading, set at 5 percent, has been agreed with a view to generating funding for climate adaption in developing nations. However, it should be noted that, in order to reach agreement, negotiators resolved to determine that the tariff would only apply to the trade of voluntary emissions but not national transfers made under Article 6.2. Countries seeking to apply Article 6.2 will instead be encouraged to contribute towards the Adaption Fund. Limitations on the use of pre-2020 credits - Negotiators have agreed to limit the use of pre-2020 credits from the United Nations' CDM, with the rationale being to avoid a wholesale flooding of the carbon credits market which could have sent prices cratering. The final text of the Pact provides that only CDM credits registered post-January 1, 2013, may be utilized for the purpose of national targets. The debate around the use of pre-2020 credits was a major sticking point in the negotiations, particularly for large emerging economies (such as Brazil, India and China) who dominated the CDM market from the outset. Corresponding adjustments - Countries hosting an emissions reduction project will now have the ability to determine whether the reductions will be allocated towards meeting its own national emissions target, or be sold elsewhere for other purposes. If the latter, the country is required to notify a UN supervisory board. Furthermore, Article 6.4 states that voluntary emissions reductions may only be used towards a country's NDC if they are so authorized by the UN and the host country must apply a corresponding adjustment for units which are ultimately sold abroad this is geared towards avoiding 'double-counting' by two countries in determining emissions reductions. Critically for Singapore, agreement on the terms and application of Article 6 helps to provide the island nation with a foundation to build on as it seeks to achieve its ambition of establishing itself as a global center for carbon trading. Falling under the 'Green Economy' pillar of the Green Plan (Energy in ASEAN: Singapore and Hydrogen[2]), the creation of a carbon trading and services hub will encompass 'green finance, sustainability, verification, credits trading and risk management.' Following the announcement that the Pact had been finalized, Grace Fu, Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and leader of the nation's delegation at COP26, commented that the agreement was a 'big win for the multilateral approach to addressing climate change' and that 'while the work is not quite done yet, COP26 has laid a firm foundation for future progress, and is a positive step forward for raising climate ambition.1[3]' While the Pact has done much to provide clarity around the application of Article 6, there are two key concerns that need to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the compromise made to permit transfer of some credits from the CDM is likely to create an initial glut of credits in the future market and, in addition to the possibility of credit prices plummeting, there are also concerns related to the quality of certain legacy carbon credits. Secondly, implementation of the rules relating to corresponding adjustments will need to be strictly monitored and national governments will be required to devise regulations in order to ensure that they are applied appropriately. These concerns were echoed by Minister Fu who stated: 'It's one of those perennial issues that's complicated. And the reason it's complicated is because it has strands coming from ambition, finance, share of proceeds and also transparencyIf you are using the carbon market, there is a fear that it will actually dilute ambition if you don't use it properly, because there's greenwashing, there's double counting.2[4]' Post-COP26, Singapore is expected to review its climate change targets and we will be watching with interest to see whether the government increases its focus on carbon markets in light of the Pact3[5]. 1[6] HYPERLINK https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gracefuhy_ HYPERLINK cop26 -gamechangeclimatechange-sggreenplan-activity-6865535061899526144-jYHu[7]. 2[8] HYPERLINK https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cop26-singapore-climate-change-target-grace-fu-2312456https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ HYPERLINK cop26 -singapore-climate-change-target-grace-fu-2312456[9]. 3[10] Ibid.

But the very real successes of this year's Conference of the Parties will also be writ large: years of negotiations over core issues resolved and the completion of the Paris rule book as well as a substantial package on mitigation.Years of negotiations over core issues [have been] resolved, the completion of the Paris rule book [has been achieved] as well as a substantial package on mitigationCOP26 successesTo some extent, these have been overwhelmed by the disappointments, but the achievements need to be differentiated and highlighted, according to Professor Benito Muller, Managing Director of Oxford Climate Policy and Convener of International Climate Policy Research at Oxford's Environmental Change Institute.He insists, 'When judging the outcome of COP 26...it is important to distinguish between the core business...concerning the multilateral climate regime and the announcements of heads of state/government...The latter has become much more prominent and is attracting many more people than the former.'Meanwhile, Professor Lavanya Rajamani, professor of international environmental law, says, 'COP26 delivered, against all odds, a substantial package on mitigation. 1.5C might be on its last gasp but it still has a fighting chance. The outcome on mitigation, including the work programme on mitigation, is a remarkable achievement, the credit for which should go to those developing countries like India that agreed to enhanced mitigation action in the face of decades of breached promises on finance and support, and rapidly diminishing fairness in these negotiations.'The outcome on mitigation, including the work programme on mitigation, is a remarkable achievementProfessor Lavanya RajamaniProfessor Muller explains the importance of the COP26 achievements, 'One of the key core-business objective of the UK COP Presidency was to finalise the rule book of the Paris Agreement...There were three outstanding issues which have been languishing in the negotiation without resolution ever since 2015: Article 6, transparency, and common time frames (CTF).'In his latest blog post, he explains:, 'I have had the honour of being part of a group of stakeholders that has been working tirelessly and doggedly over the past seven years to bring about the agreement on a common (5-year) time frame...under the Paris Agreement. Even though the odds were 4:1 stacked against us.'It is difficult to say when the balance tipped towards the five-year frequency of NDC end-years but it was an uphill struggle.'I have had the honour of being part of a group...that has been working tirelessly and doggedly over the past seven years to bring about the agreement on a common (5-year) time frame...under the Paris Agreement. Even though the odds were 4:1 stacked against usProfessor Benito MullerHe continues, 'There is still something missing. It may sound complex, but it is important - the Glasgow Common Time Frame (CTF) decision does not include the request for regular (5-yearly) synchronised ambition updating. Revisiting and strengthening the ambition of NDCs that have been communicated earlier is key to harnessing much needed additional overall ambition; but to maximise the additional ambition, the process needs a time table for regular (5-yearly) synchronised updating.'\l"

They have come up with a design for such a skyscraper called the Urban Sequoia in homage to the famous redwood trees. In their presentation[1], representatives for SOM noted that urban areas[2] are the primary emitters of carbon dioxide[3], accounting for approximately a third of all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. And the problem is only going to grow worse as the population of the world grows. They suggest that one way to reduce emissions is to change the way large buildings are designed instead of being huge emitters, they claim, the buildings could actually be huge collectors. The team at SOM envisions skyscrapers incorporating technology that either sequesters carbon[4] pulled from the air or stores it for sale to manufacturers. They see buildings made of materials that absorb carbon, serving as a carbon sink over the course of their lifetimes. They also see buildings with areas dedicated to growing plants and algae both of which could be used to capture carbon and to provide fuel for the building. And they also suggest that the building itself could be designed in a way that captures carbon from the air using what they describe as a ""stack effect."" In such a design[5], air would be drawn into a central part of the building, where carbon-extraction devices could be put to work 24 hours a day. They suggest such a building would have a lifetime of approximately 60 years during which it would absorb up to four times as much carbon as was released. Credit: SOM The team[6] at SOM point out that carbon extracted from a building could be used to create road paving materials, pipes or other parts of urban structures. And they suggest that if all new buildings were made to collect more carbon than they emit, urban greenhouse gas emissions could be greatly reduced perhaps by as much as 1.6 billion tons a year.

I also appreciate that climate adaptation, international climate finance, youth empowerment, and gender equity received more attention and discussion in the climate talks than before, which I hope carries forward to next year when Egypt hosts the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.""EESI was primarily engaged in COP26 to help inform U.S. policymakers, and it was encouraging to see the United States once again embrace a leadership role in climate negotiations. U.S. leadership has been and will continue to be absolutely critical in efforts to address climate change. In particular, the Congressional delegation to COP26 was the largest yet and included Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle. Congress has an essential role in developing new policies and funding new investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home and abroad.

COP26 President Alok Sharma told a press conference on Thursday that the deal between the world\'e2\â‚¬  s two biggest carbon emitters was \'e2\â‚¬  good news,\'e2\â‚¬ and that he hoped the spirit of cooperation in that agreement helps to \'e2\â‚¬  drive forward\'e2\â‚¬ the negotiations in their last few days. \'e2\â‚¬  I think it does help to provide some momentum,\'e2\â‚¬ Sharma said. Building Consensus \'e2\â‚¬  It's an opportunity for China and the US within their respective negotiating groups, and talking to other parties, to encourage them as well,\'e2\â‚¬ Sharma said. However, Sharma acknowledged that a positive negotiated outcome at COP26 remains contingent on reaching a consensus between almost 200 countries, which will not be easily achieved. EU Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans agreed that the agreement has \'e2\â‚¬  huge political significance.\'e2\â‚¬ The agreement is particularly important because it shows that despite \'e2\â‚¬  many areas of conflicting views,\'e2\â‚¬ the US and China have declared that climate is an issue that \'e2\â‚¬  transcends all differences,\'e2\â‚¬ he said. And while there are still many areas of disagreement between countries at the summit, Timmermans agreed that the declaration could help move the negotiations forward. Practical Help Along with describing the climate crisis \'e2\â‚¬  in more serious language than before,\'e2\â‚¬ the declaration also offers some practical help for the Glasgow talks, Bernice Lee, the research director for UK-based policy institute Chatham House, told a press huddle. This includes cooperation on tackling methane emissions as well as working on enhancing climate action in the near term, with both the US and China saying they will come forward with new, more ambitious nationally determined contributions in 2025, which could be key to keeping hopes of achieving the 1.5\'c2\'b0C Paris goal alive.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA203","COP26 Final Hours: Don't forget people caught up in crisis","ASEAN Tribune"," ","13 November 2021 (International Rescue Committee) With the final hours of negotiations at COP26 underway, the IRC is urging world leaders to prevent catastrophic levels of emissions and to support the poorest countries to adapt to the immediate consequences of climate change, already playing out in places where the IRC works.The draft text from COP26 which was released yesterday lays out important, but insufficient, steps to meet this double challenge. Despite new and updated emissions pledges, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees C average temperature rise, far beyond the goal of remaining below 1.5 degrees C.Climate finance and vital support for adaptation remains a critical sticking point for the ongoing negotiations. It is a terrible symbol of neglect that the original pledge for developing countries of $100 billion in climate finance by 2020 will not be met until the end of 2022. Climate finance for adaptation to least-developed countries currently stands at $15 billion per year, out of the $80 billion in climate finance currently mobilized. This is a fraction of what is needed for people living with the climate crisis now. The IRC welcomes new pledges for climate adaptation made at COP26, including President Biden's $3 billion in adaptation finance annually until 2024 and the EU's pledge of $100 million to the COP26 adaptation fund, which raised over $350 million in total at COP26. The UN however estimates that $300 billion will be needed by 2030 for climate adaptation alone.The IRC is warning that the massive financial void will leave vulnerable, specially fragile and conflict-affected countries, with little support. These are places where climate change is already an extreme and everyday reality:Drought across 80% of Afghanistan is driving acute hunger and food insecurity;In Ethiopia, already one of the sites of the devastating 2012 famine in the Horn of Africa and an unprecedented locust outbreak last year, 11 million people are already facing crisis levels of food insecurity as conflict rages in the Tigray region.Last year, we witnessed over 1.4 million people displaced in Northern Central America due to the deadly combination of ongoing conflict and multiple natural disasters.The impact is already being felt as rising temperatures, drought and extreme weather conditions contribute to food shortages and spiralling hunger. Women and girls are suffering the most from climate change. The UK's COP26 Presidency signalled a commitment to women and girls by launching new, dedicated funding to advance gender equality in climate action, however its scale and geographical reach is too limited to meet the global challenge; commitments to support women and girls disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis must not end here.David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said:'COP26 needs to remember the poorest and most vulnerable in its final hours. This was billed as a critical moment for the international community to come together and make much-needed progress in tackling the climate crisis before it's too late. But for IRC's clients around the world already facing emergency climate conditions, time has already run out. In these critical final hours of negotiations, global leaders must keep the devastating implications for the lives of the most vulnerable people at the forefront of their minds - and ensure they are made part of the final agreement.""It is crucial that both tests set at this year's conference are met: to prevent the catastrophic breach of 1.5 degrees C rise in temperature, and step up to help the most at-risk communities adapt to the climate change already underway.""The US-China agreement for further cooperation is significant, a sign that the shared dangers of the climate crisis cannot be ignored. But the impact of the existential threat posed by climate change is spread unevenly - and thus far, vulnerable populations are being all but assured that they will continue to bear the brunt. With climate finance and adaptation funding woefully insufficient, large swathes of the global population will be left defenseless against a problem they did not cause.""The climate crisis speaks to a gross mismanagement of the global commons and a collective failure by countries to live up to their responsibilities. The great injustice is that these failures will be felt most deeply by people already mired in humanitarian catastrophe, and who contributed the least. The world, especially the world's most vulnerable, cannot afford for these negotiations to fail.'\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA205","ANS URGES COP26 TO RECOGNIZE NUCLEAR ENERGY'S CLIMATE ROLE","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the American Nuclear Society (ANS):On behalf of over 10,000 nuclear engineers, scientists, and technologists, the American Nuclear Society urges COP 26 delegates to insist that any agreement arising from COP26 include a strong role for nuclear technology in achieving carbon reduction targets.Deep decarbonization and electrification of the global economy will require the increased availability of firm, ""dispatchable"" zero-carbon energy technologies. Nuclear energy is the only energy source with a proven track record of producing firm, zero-carbon energy at the scale needed to meet global goals. Indeed, it's increasingly clear that achieving net-zero worldwide carbon emissions is simply not feasible without a significant expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy worldwide.Specifically, we urge the delegates to assume that a significant commercial deployment of new reactor designs and advanced nuclear fuel will occur in the 2030 timeframe and to acknowledge that such a scale-up will require a significant investment in research and development funding for advanced nuclear technologies.Deep decarbonization requires action in all sectors of the world economy, not just electricity generation. As such, we urge delegates to recognize the inherent advantages of employing nuclear technology for industrial process heat, hydrogen production, district heating, and desalination.To achieve decarbonization as rapidly and efficiently as possible, governments and policymakers must implement technology-neutral, performance-based climate and energy policies that treat all carbon-free energy sources fairly and equally. Nuclear must be treated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies. Delegates should not accept anything short of fair and equal treatment for nuclear energy vis-a-vis other zero-carbon sources, as doing so would be fundamentally incompatible with global progress on climate, economic prosperity and energy security.As a recognized civil society organization with UN observer status, ANS will be on the ground in Glasgow during where we are sponsoring ten delegates from the Young Generation Network. As representatives of ANS, the pro-nuclear delegates will be attending events in the exclusive bluezone during the next two weeks. ANS's social media channels will be resharing photos, videos, and observations from our COP26 delegates who hail from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.ANS is also taking our message directly to COP26 attendees by participating in Nuclear For Climate's booth where ANS's logo and images will be on display. Our message at is clear: Carbon-free nuclear energy must be a part of our climate solution and the time to act is now. Six years on from the Paris Agreement, our world leaders need to get serious about climate change and that starts by preserving and expanding nuclear energy.Sincerely,Craig H.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA206","#COP26: Where's the incentive?","The Finanser by Chris Skinner","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 03, 2021( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: HYPERLINK https://thefinanser.comhttps://thefinanser.com The discussions of today's COP26 interested me, as it's all about the money[1]. Ambitious plans to create a huge pool of money to invest in a green future will turn the UK into 'the world's firstnet zero[4]-aligned financial centre', with companies managing $130 trillion of assets committing to the goal of holding global warming below 1.5C,Rishi Sunak[5]has said. I love this idea but like the Queen I wonder if they're just talking and not doing. Everyone can say they are dedicated to climate change and then just not bother. It's like me saying that by 2030 I will have dieted, given up smoking and no longer drink wine. It's a New Year's Resolution, and how many of us keep our New Year's Resolutions? It's blah-blah-blah[6]. So, what's the answer? Well Kate Mackenzie touched on this in her article I discussed yesterday[7], but my focus is three-fold: We need countries that are rich to invest in countries that are poor to manage climate issues We need to encourage countries with rare wildlife to create eco-tourism We need the world to move from greed to inclusion First, there are many countries who rely on industries that destroy the planet. People who dig for coal, cut down trees and farming with cattle. There are millions, or over a billion, of these people. You cannot just end their jobs and industries overnight. Banks can help to do that but have no incentives. The governments of the world need to change this if we are to meet net-zero emissions, but governmental economies rely on these industries. You have a viscous circle of reliance on destroying the planet through industries that don't care. How do you change that? Second, biodiversity is at huge risk. Over half of the world's species have disappeared in the last century. We need to get countries to move from hunting with guns to hunting with cameras and selfies. That one seems to be working quite well. When I saw gorillas in Rwanda, we had to pay a fee for access that was quite high. I didn't mind paying the fee as it funds the biodiversity and protection of the environment for these species. Third, to move from greed to inclusion relates to the two points above. The incentive for inclusion is to save the world, but why would I want to save the world if there is no incentive. The incentive for seeing gorillas in Rwanda is the experience. The incentive for saving the world is the experience. If governments actively incentivised industries, business, commerce and consumers to have better experiences, they would convert. So, what's the answer? The answer is not cash or investment, although that is a part of it. The answer is experience or, more pedantically, it's about experiential marketing. If governments could offer tax incentives, support programmes and budget reallocations for carbon offsets every time a consumer or business used renewable energy and stopped planet destroying activities, maybe things would change. And yes, they do some of this already but if I have a family dependent upon deforestation, digging for fossil fuel or moving people from A to B, what are you offering me to stop doing that? That's the question and there's the rub. I don't have all the answers, but I know the one big one is that I'm happy to change if there's a reward. What are the rewards for stopping flying, driving electric and heating with sunshine?

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA210","Sharing Resources: Key to COP26 Success, says SHARE International","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","CaliforniaNewswire","In its push to control runaway climate change, the 26th Conference of the Parties must assist developing nationsBERKELEY, Calif. /California Newswire/ - World leaders meet in Glasgow beginning October 31 for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, to address the conclusions of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report: that human activities have unequivocally warmed and damaged the planet. Share International attributes 80 percent of the warming to human actions, and says sharing resources to mitigate the inevitable consequences is key to solving climate change.As early as 2007, an article by a Master of Wisdom, recorded by the late British author Benjamin Creme and published in Share International magazine, gave this 80 percent figure and stated that we have a pivotal choice to make: to reap the beneficial results of immediate action, or face the destruction that would ensue from doing nothing, or too little.The article stated that the World Teacher for this age, Maitreya, who is gradually emerging into public view, ""will advocate a simpler form of living, one more in keeping with the planet's situation. When enough people are convinced that this is necessary,"" it presaged, ""there will be a growing movement to simplify throughout the planet."" It further predicted that ""faced with the dilemma of necessary change, men will come to realize the inevitability of accepting the principle of sharing. Only sharing will make these changes practical and possible.""Although the effects of climate change are coming faster than scientists anticipated, the IPCC report affirms there is still time to slow or even reverse some changes by reducing CO2 emissions to at least net zero. But to accomplish this globally, the wealthier countries must not only curb their own emissions but also share resources and technology with less developed nations, to ensure that all can make the necessary rapid transition to sustainable energy sources.Three of the four goals of COP26 require potentially large financial investments: radical emissions reductions, strengthening adaptation to climate impacts, and mobilizing finances. The fourth is for countries to work together to accomplish these pressing but inescapable measures. The COP26 web site indicates, however, that developed countries have not even made good on their 2009 Copenhagen Accord pledge to mobilize by 2020 at least $100 billion in climate finance per year for developing nations. Another impediment noted by Jeffrey Sachs, president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network, is that poor countries must borrow internationally at rates of 5 to 10 percent, and many have no access to capital markets at all, while rich countries benefit from near-zero interest rates.Clearly, politicians have not yet responded to the climate crisis at levels commensurate with the danger, but COP26 offers a pivotal opportunity. To succeed at their stated goal of ""uniting the world to tackle climate change,"" COP26 participants will need to go beyond inequitable loan financing and fast-track unconditional sharing of the financial and technological resources necessary to bring all countries on board.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA211","COP26 THROUGH THE EYES OF THREE TUCK STUDENTS","November 23, 2021 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth:by Kirk KardashianFor students who attend, it's an experience that stays with them and builds upon the many climate-related courses and programs available at Tuck. This year, COP26 was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and it generated more than the usual amount of attention, due to a year of catastrophic climate-change-related weather disasters, including record heat waves, droughts, flooding and forest fires. Through sponsorship and organization provided by the Center for Business, Government and Society (CBGS) and the Revers Center for Energy, Tuck sent a delegation of six T'22s to COP26, where they had observer status and could sit in on negotiations and panel discussions, and network with professionals at the intersection of climate change, business, and public policy. They were led by Hannah Payson, executive director for the Center for Business, Government and Society, and Tracy Bach, a law professor, experienced climate change law and policy analyst, international negotiations advisor, researcher, and social entrepreneur who has been attending COP for years.""It's critical that our students have a front-row seat as they prepare to tackle these challenges as business leaders,"" says Payson.""Exposing Tuck students to the mechanics of decision-making in a real-world context is at the heart of how Centers amplify the MBA curriculum with transformational learning experiences,"" adds April Salas, the executive director of the Revers Center for Energy.Three of the students who attended COP26 from Tuck are Abigail Gary, Kaitlin Horan, and Sam Gant. Here's a bit about their backgrounds, why they went to Glasgow, and what they got out of it.Abigail Gary T'22Abigail Gary came to Tuck with five years of experience working with governments in Chile and Peru on public-private partnerships in the education sector. She came back to the U.S. a little disenchanted about working in government, and curious about the role businesses can play in making change. Before enrolling at Tuck, Gary worked with a foundation that does CSR consulting for large Chilean multinational firms, and that solidified her interest in not only attending business school, but also getting a master's degree in public policy. She's currently a dual-degree student at Tuck and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. ""I thought it would be really important to be able to speak the business language, not just the impact policy language,"" she says. ""I wanted to be able to make the business case for these public policy programs.""At Tuck, Gary is a fellow at the CBGS, a director of the Tuck ESG (environmental, social and governance) Funda student-led fund that invests in equities with an ESG negative and positive screenand a director of the Tuck Social Venture Fund, which does impact investing in early-stage companies. Those experiences have taught her a lot about the importance of proper measurement in impact-related endeavors. ""Right now is an interesting time for ESG metrics,"" she says, ""because people are starting to measure, standardize, and audit it. That was my main reason for attending COP26.""Gary left Glasgow more motivated and energized than she expected. Previous COPs have made little progress on a binding global agreement to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and this version didn't produce many breakthroughs. Still, Gary is optimistic because of the massive collaborative effort every country is making towards reducing climate change. ""Seeing everyone working on the problem, that was powerful,"" she says.\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA212","UNICEF Fact Sheet: COP26 - Children and Climate Change","November 2, 2021 Tuesday 10:15 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRep) -- UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) issued the following fact sheet: UNICEF will be at COP26 to ensure that the climate crisis is recognized as a crisis for children and their rights, to promote approaches to decrease climate risk for those who are most vulnerable, and to support children and young people's participation in COP26 as part of efforts to support children and young people's participation in climate-related decision-making.""COP26COP26 have a significant, time-sensitive opportunity to redirect the terrible path we are on. They can do so by committing to strengthening the resilience of services that children depend upon, and by cutting emissions faster and deeper. The futures of billions of children depend on it.""Key Messages:The climate crisis is a child rights crisis. Climate change poses a major threat to children and young people's health, nutrition, education, development, survival and future potential. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors. Critically, current and future generations of children will have to navigate an uncertain future where the current model of growth that links economic development to environmental exploitation is no longer viable. An August UNICEF report, The Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), found almost every child on earth is exposed to at least one climate and environmental hazard, such as heatwaves, cyclones, air pollution, flooding and water scarcity. Approximately 1 billion children - nearly half the world's children - live in 33 countries classified in the Index as ""extremely high-risk"". These children face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education. An estimated 850 million children - over one third of all children - live in areas where at least four of climate and environmental shocks overlap, and as many as 330 million children live in areas affected by a staggering five major climate shocks. Children from countries that contribute the least to climate change suffer the greatest consequences. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit 9 per cent of CO2 emissions. The 10 highest-risk countries collectively emit only 0.5 per cent of global emissions. Improving the resilience of key services that children depend upon is often the best investment to reduce the risks they face. Access to resilient water, sanitation and hygiene services reduces risks for 415 million children. Climate-smart health services reduce risks for 460 million children. Resilient schools and education systems reduce risks for 275 million children. And climate-responsive social safety nets reduce risks for 310 million children.Action at COP26 Increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience. UNICEF urges developed countries to exceed their 2009 promise to mobilize $US100 billion annually in climate finance in light of evidence that these sums are insufficient to address the scale of climate impacts. UNICEF urges a greater emphasis on funding to build climate resilience and adaptive capacity. Mitigation efforts will take decades to reverse the impacts of climate change, and for the children of today, this will be too late. Unless we invest heavily in adaptation and resilience of social services for the 4.2 billion children born over the next 30 years, these children will face increasingly high risks to their survival and well-being. Critical services must be adapted, such as water, sanitation and hygiene systems, health and education services. It is imperative that, at COP26, countries commit to increasing investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children, prioritising the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. The decisions made at COP26 will shape the lives of every child in every nation on earth, now and in the future. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. UNICEF is urging countries to cut their emissions by at least 45 per cent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2030 to keep warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. The number of children that UNICEF estimates to be at 'extremely high-risk' of the impacts of climate change will likely increase as the impacts of climate change accelerate. Include young people in all climate negotiations and decisions. UNICEF supports young people's calls for governments to end the consistent omission of young people, especially those from the most affected places. Young people continue to demand comprehensive, bold climate action from decision makers. As yet, the action demanded has not materialized to the levels required. Children and young people are underrepresented in policies and policy discussions despite being the major stakeholder in their outcomes. They are therefore limited in their ability to influence decisions that are critical to their future. Children's rights and voices must be reflected and included in the implementation of the Paris Agreement at national, regional and international levels. COP26 presents a critical opportunity to formalise this. 2022 will mark 30 years since the UNFCCC Convention was drafted and yet in that time, there has never been a decision focused on children and young people in climate action taken under the UNFCCC. Every government must provide climate education for children and young people so that they can meaningfully contribute to and participate in climate policy and action.

The United Nations granted permission for select organizations to participate in COP26 activities.More than 60 of the largest and most influential international architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, planning, and construction firms, along with two dozen organizations representing over one million building industry professionals worldwide, issued a Communique to government leaders headed to COP26 challenging them to step up their emissions reduction targets for the built environment. The firms and organizations are signatories of the 1.5 C COP26 Communique -- an open letter to sovereign governments demonstrating the firms' and organizations' commitment to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5 C carbon budget and demanding governments do the same.ASHRAE's focus at COP26 was to emphasize the importance of the building community's participation in addressing the climate crisis. Architecture 2030 and ASHRAE hosted a COP26 Official Side Event on November 10 featuring the 1.5 C COP26 Communique and its signatories. The event titled 65% by 2030 / ZERO by 2040: Top 200 Global Firms and Organizations Lead With 1.5 C Climate Actions highlighted ways in which the signatories are responding to the urgency of the climate crisis and specific actions to decarbonize the built world and meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5 C carbon budget.At the side event, 2021-22 ASHRAE Treasurer Ginger Scoggins, P.E., Fellow ASHRAE, CEM, CxA, highlighted the world's growing building stock and the role of built environment organizations, such as ASHRAE, in assisting both policymakers and industry leaders in better understanding their impact on our climate change solutions.""ASHRAE signed onto the 1.5 C COP26 Communique and we are here today because engineers and scientists involved with HVACR and building systems have been and will continue to be advancing solutions to address climate change,"" said Scoggins. ""We are here because we recognize that the built environment is a key source contributing to the world's greenhouse gas emissions and with the building stock continuing to expand and doubling by 2050, solutions from the buildings community is ever more critical.""Additionally, Scoggins spoke about the credibility of ASHRAE's technical resources and global standing in the development of consensus-based standards.""ASHRAE's flagship Energy Conservation Standard 90.1 is the benchmark for commercial building energy codes in the United States and has been a key basis for codes and standards around the world for more than 45 years, reducing energy consumption by 50%, yet only 38 countries have specifically named building standards and codes in their Nationally Determined Contributions,"" said Scoggins. ""Many of the countries where the building stock is expected to grow do not require energy standards for buildings. ASHRAE signed the buildings industry's communique, and we are ready to help policy makers and the buildings industry around the world transform our building stock into one that is sustainable, resilient, and healthy. We are here to be part of the solution and we are up to the challenge.""In a separate statement, 2021-21 ASHRAE President Mick Schwedler, P.E., Fellow ASHRAE, LEED AP, commented on ASHRAE's participation at and shared additional ways that the Society is addressing climate change.""ASHRAE's climate action efforts exemplify the Society's core dedication to engineering excellence in environmental stewardship,"" said Schwedler. ""The ASHRAE Global Headquarters building renovation project demonstrates that existing buildings can be transformed into net-zero-energy structures cost-effectively, using current off-the shelf technologies. Our Advanced Energy Design Guides, developed with our partners, provide zero energy K-12 schools and office buildings guides to equip designers in achieving zero energy and significantly reducing carbon. ASHRAE is proud to work with other world leaders to not only raise awareness of the issues surrounding climate change, but collectively seek to redefine the built environment for the times and continually explore what is possible through industry leading innovation.""[Category: Business]Contact: Karen Buckley Washington, senior public relations specialist, HYPERLINK kbwashington@ashrae.orgCopyright Targeted News Servicesnull-7664237 T40-MgEditor\l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA214","Glass Half Full: Cornell's COP26 Delegation Returns Informed, Inspired","December 17, 2021 Friday 9:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- Cornell University issued the following news:By Jana Wiegand Last month, 10 Cornell faculty traveled to Glasgow, Scotland to participate in the United Nations' climate summit, COP26, where they met with policy-makers, business representatives, researchers and activists from around the world -- all trying to finesse the finer details of the Paris Accord and refine global commitments to combating climate change.While governments discussed the billions of dollars they were allocating to meet existing commitments, advocates called for even more urgent action -- citing the trillions of dollars needed every year to keep global warming from surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius. They put the heat on negotiators, trying to convince parties from all sectors to make up the gap.Glen Dowell, the Henrietta Johnson Louis Professor of Management, noticed a clear shift in corporate conversations compared to COP23, which he also attended in 2017.""In prior years, the discussion focused on whether there was a business case to take climate action,"" he said. ""Now, in many companies -- even the large emitters -- the conversations are around how to accomplish the goals, how to report and how to get to the scale we need.""Investors are paying closer attention to firms' carbon commitments, Dowell said, and after a standardized accountability system is in place, then they can put even more pressure on companies whose efforts are falling short.In 2020, the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, took a public stance. CEO Larry Fink spoke publicly about how the risks from climate change presented a clear threat to business growth everywhere. As a holder of $9.5 trillion in assets, BlackRock said they intended to drive change from the top-down in the companies in which they invest. This move sparked larger conversations about what systemic actions need to happen, as well as how operating more sustainably is becoming less of a risk and more of an opportunity.""What investors consider to be a reward is undergoing a change [too],"" said Mark Milstein, faculty director of the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise in the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. ""In the investment community, the money is going to come from the adoption and diffusion of decarbonization technologies, which are ultimately going to become the products and services that fuel growth in business and address climate change simultaneously.""In Glasgow, Mike Hoffmann noted another key player: McDonald's. ""They are the largest restaurant chain in the world and operate in more than 100 countries,"" he said.Hoffmann is a professor emeritus of entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the lead author of ""Our Changing Menu: Climate Change and the Foods We Love and Need.""He met McDonald's chief global impact officer, who spoke about their commitment to changing the way that they source and serve meals to 65 million customers per day. With a shared interest in driving social and environmental change through food, Hoffmann said that this kind of individual organization shows enormous potential for partnership.""We have to be reaching out to these major corporations because they're the game-changers in climate change, along with government action,"" he said. ""But corporations move a lot faster than governments.""Danielle Eiseman, visiting lecturer in the Department of Communication and co-author of ""Our Changing Menu,"" agreed with the need to work with organizations who have more agency to act on their own. ""The most important groups to reach now for concrete action are those that can create the most significant and rapid change in terms of emissions reductions,"" she said.Energy and transportation are fields that will see a boost from the international community's commitments to green technology, broad policy reform and additional investments in sustainability.""Investors see future growth in non-fossil fuel-based energy and power sources,"" Milstein said. ""For the most part, international development and investment banks have moved money to solar, wind, geothermal, battery, and emerging low- to no-carbon technologies.""However, that's where Buz Barstow, assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences, noticed some significant hurdles that future COPs will have to confront.""We're going to have to rebuild the 100-year-old energy system that we already have. We're going to have to replace that by 2050. And then we're going to have to replace that four or five times over [by 2100] to account for the growing riches of the developing world,"" he said. ""I didn't get a sense that policymakers had any conception of that.""Such explosive innovation and widespread adoption will take decades, and much like the rise of the Internet, the clean energy revolution doesn't come with a roadmap. But Barstow said that being at COP26, talking with different delegations and seeing the rise of the youth movement helped underscore the importance and urgency of doubling down on climate efforts across sectors.""For most of our history, we've been a small perturbation on the biosphere. What we are becoming now is a force of nature,"" he said. ""And by the end of the century, we will be the force of nature on earth.""Outside of energy, to drive long-lasting, global change, Eiseman said that broad communication strategies need to adopt people-centered models and humanize the challenges that so many communities are facing.In Glasgow, billboards, buses and local businesses made it part of their mission to share messages about climate change. Yet, in parts of the world where those facts are less welcome and environmental activists experience high rates of persecution and violence, the formal policies developed at COP26 are essential in protecting vulnerable voices.""The central aim [of the UN] is to ensure human rights are protected in the policy-making process, and that inequality, discrimination and unjust power is eliminated,"" she said. ""It is important to include that language and framework to help protect those that are threatened by speaking out.""Funding to organize the Cornell COP26 delegation was provided by the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.

Harry Wilkinson, one of several climate science deniers at the Glasgow summit[1], suggested that the conference was relying on polluting diesel generators in an effort to highlight the supposed hypocrisy of the event. The tweet[2], which has been shared and liked over 10,000 times, echoes a scene in a documentary released last year by Michael Moore[3] in which the filmmakers do the same at an environmentalist musical festival. The government&8217;s COP26 unit has said all generators on site are in fact powered by batteries, vegetable oil and solar. Wilkinson is an employee at the MP-backed Net Zero Watch pressure group, the new name for the Global Warming Policy Forum[4], campaign wing of the UK charity established by former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson. He is attending the UN summit as part of a delegation sent by the US-based Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow[5] (CFACT), which has a long history of rejecting mainstream climate science and has previously taken funding from oil giant ExxonMobil. Diesel Rumours On Tuesday, the tenth day of the talks, Wilkinson posted pictures on Twitter showing several large blue and white machines, branded with Aggreko, the name of a generator company based in Glasgow. &8220;Are these diesel generators at #COP26 ? They seem to be behind black screens,&8221; he asked. But the COP26COP26,&8221; a spokesperson said, adding that the summit was being powered by the National Grid, with contingencies in place &8220;in the unlikely event they are required&8221;, powered using &8220;battery, hydrogenated vegetable oil or solar&8221;. &8216;Cheap Shot&8217; Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University, said the machines pictured were heat pumps, heaters and air conditioners.&160;&160; &8220;This is classic diversion and perfectionism,&8221; he told DeSmog. &8220;These meetings are crucial for global agreement on how we are going to collectively solve this problem. The Scottish government, the event organizers, and the attendees can do all we can to reduce the energy and waste of meeting, but for now there will still be emissions associated with doing so.&160; &8220;This is a very cheap shot, really a sign of desperate grasping for something to criticise,&8221; he said.

The Conference of the Parties ('COP') is the annual gathering sponsored by the United Nations (this is the 26th) of world leaders in public, private and social sectors, coming together to debate and decide on the future path of the global society's efforts to address climate change challenges. Almost 200 nations are officially parties to the 'Paris Agreement' -- the accord reached at COP21 in Paris in December 2015. This is a legally binding global treaty for most nations and called for: substantially reducing GHG emissions to limit global temperature rise to 2C, while striving to limit to 1.5C (2.7F) within this century. reviewing countries' commitments every five years (and here we are in Glasgow doing that, with 'Nationally Determined Contributions' or NDCs in focus). providing financing by developed economies to developing countries to help these smaller economies develop 'resilience' to the effects of climate change. The UN explains that the Paris Agreement 'provided a durable framework to guide the global effort by all sectors in all nations in the decades leading out to the end of the 21st Century and is a marker for the intended shift toward a 'net zero emissions' world.' The Agreement also is essential, says the UN, for the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their 167 underlying targets. These have target dates of 2030 - just eight years in the future. As you read this, we are expecting to see the final communique coming out of COP26 that will help to explain Â£greements reached' by official participants.

The rally-and hundreds of other international demonstrations on 'Call to Earth Day'#8212;occurred amid the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, otherwise known as 'COP26.' Over the past two weeks, global leaders have gathered to explore solutions to combat climate change as the world continues to warm at an unprecedented rate. Rowen Kliethermes, one of the organizers of the UC Berkeley demonstration, noted that, while the summit is a step in the right direction, many global powers have yet to adequately address consumerism and large corporations' reliance on fossil fuels, some of the root causes of global warming. COP26 culminated on November 13th, 2021 with the Glasgow Pact, a historic agreement explicitly mentioning the need to 'phase down' coal among the international community. However, the pact has received mixed reactions from observers[1]. Critics of the agreement argue that the language used in the document and the negotiations does not go far enough to minimize the catastrophic effects of global warming in a reasonable timeframe. Demonstrations such as UC Berkeley's exemplify public support for increased action regarding climate change. The California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG), a student-run grassroots organization focused on environmental activism, organized the rally at Berkeley. According to their figures, around 70 students attended the event. The crowd was fully receptive to the speakers' remarks, remaining energetic throughout the rally and chanting slogans. The first speaker at the event was CALPIRG's Renewable Campaign Grassroots Coordinator, Jose Luongo, who called for immediate action from policymakers in the continued fight against the devastating impacts of global warming. 'Especially in California, we have seen more record-breaking wildfires each year,' Luongo said in reference to pursuing more assertive climate policy. In recent years, California's spate of worsening fires has been linked to the effects of climate change.[2] The next speaker at the event was Professor David Romps, who explained the scientific consensus on the negative externalities of global warming and the university's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. 'That [plant] right next to Eucalyptus Grove is putting out 3 tons of carbon dioxide every year for every student, every undergraduate student on campus,' Romps stated in regards to the Cogeneration Plant owned by the university. Professor Romps remarked how the university could move to 'electrify our campus' to reduce UC Berkeley's reliance on fossil fuels. Finally, environmental activists Jakob Evan and Varsha Madapoosi took the podium. They explained how the university had made nothing but empty promises in enacting meaningful changes to their climate policy directives. 'UC Berkeley has no real plan. They are basically just greenwashing,' said Madapoosi. Amidst drastically underpaid lecturers and plans to build on People's Park, Madapoosi's statement supports many students' views of UC Berkeley as an institution purporting to be on the frontier of social justice activism, but reluctant to engage in tangible action. According to the Climate Action Tracker[3] (CAT), the measures that arose out of COP26 remain well over the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping the temperature under 1.5 C. Despite these bleak numbers, many climate activists-including Berkeley students-have yet to lose hope.

Initially revealed in August , this alliance aims to set an end date for oil and natural gas exploration and extraction and curtail new licensing. Core Members include Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, Quebec, Sweden and Wales; California and New Zealand are associate members, and Italy is a \'e2\â‚¬  friend\'e2\â‚¬ of the alliance. The founding members have all signed the BOGA Declaration pledging to support a \'e2\â‚¬  socially just and equitable global transition to align oil and gas production with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\'e2\â‚¬ Core members are committed to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds and to set a Paris-aligned date for ending oil and gas production. While the group does not contain any major producers, Danish Climate Minister Dan Jorgensen said he hoped it would grow in time as more countries recognize the urgency of ending fossil fuel production if the world is to meet the 1.5\'c2\'b0C Paris goal. The UK has been criticized by environmental campaigners for not joining this alliance. However, COP26COP26 summit, \'e2\â‚¬  Even some of our member states only a couple of years ago were saying coal is forever. And now every member state in the EU knows that there is no future for coal. That happened over a couple of years. So I think the sense of urgency has increased.\'e2\â‚¬ However, Timmermans, who was an architect of the European Green Deal, also said it was now vital to invest in pre-fitting the infrastructure needed for natural gas to be able to transport green gases as well. \'e2\â‚¬  If you pre-fit your new infrastructure for hydrogen, ammonia and other gases that could be created through renewable energy, you really invest in a carbon-free future in Europe. \'e2\â‚¬ \Â£6 That is why in this transitional period we will have to continue to invest in natural gas infrastructure. ... I think this is a justified investment.\'e2\â‚¬ Timmermans also insisted that EU language included in an earlier COP26 draft agreement on phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels must remain in the final version. ""That has to be part of the conclusion here today \'e2\â‚¬ \Â£6 Removing it would be an extremely, extremely bad signal,"" he said. Fossil Fuel Tracker Financial think tank Carbon Tracker and US-based NGO Global Energy Monitor (GEM) launched a prototype of the first open-source, independent fossil fuel database at COP26 on Thursday. The Global Registry of Fossil Fuels will be a concrete policy tool to measure what is being dug out of the ground, the associated emissions, and how those relate to a 1.5\'c2\'b0C-compatible pathway, Carbon Tracker said. Founder Mark Campanale said the registry would drive greater transparency about the plans of governments\'e2\â‚¬  and companies for oil, gas and coal in the future, enabling users to link fossil fuel production with national climate policies. \'e2\â‚¬  We see one of the key user groups \'e2\â‚¬ \Â£6 being the finance sector: it will enable investors much more effectively to assess stranded asset risk,\'e2\â‚¬ said Campanale. The registry will be refined and finalized over the coming months for a full open-access public launch. Interested stakeholders are invited to reach out to Carbon Tracker for initial access to the registry. Urban Climate Action The new Urban Climate Action Programme launched at COP26 will help at least 15 cities in developing countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America become more resilient to climate change and deliver on net-zero targets. Backed with \'c2\Â£327.5 million of new UK government funding, the joint initiative is supported by C40 Cities, a network of mayors from 97 megacities around the world focused on climate action, and German development agency GIZ. The program will help selected cities, including Nairobi, Kuala Lumpur, Bogota and Lagos, develop low-emission public transport systems, renewable energy generation, sustainable waste management, new climate-smart building codes and climate risk planning.

With more than $1 billion notional value traded, the market hit a special milestone this past year. While carbon offset credits remain """" by their very nature - bespoke instruments, benchmark prices and futures are emerging, bringing a highly welcome measure of standardization to the market. During COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference held at the end of 2021, countries agreed on a common approach to the Paris Agreement's Article 6, which deals with international carbon markets. This should provide the market with fresh impetus and a higher level of legal certainty as the international community moves towards a low-carbon future.The Offset MarketplaceThe idea behind voluntary carbon offsets is simple. Entities develop projects that have a CO2 reducing impact on the environment. This CO2 reduction is certified by a third-party registry which will check that this is a real, permanent, additional reduction. The marketplace evolves around project developers and buyers financing these projects via the purchase of project-backed offset credits. Buyers may seek to net off their own emissions against these offset credits.While the underlying idea is straightforward, carbon offset credits come in many shapes and forms. Broadly speaking, the market can be separated in nature-based and technology-based projects. ""Nature-based"" includes projects that incorporate natural carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands, or other ecosystems. In contrast, ""technology-based"" projects may involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, methane capture from landfills, the deployment of efficient cookstoves in rural communities, etc.Some projects will qualify for additional co-benefits in addition to the reduction in emissions """" a wetland restoration project will not only sequester CO2, but it may also promote biodiversity and help the local community. Different registries may apply slightly divergent criteria to their certification process. Finally, corporate buyers may have preferences for different geographic locations, project types and vintage years.Clarity Comes to the Carbon MarketThe result is that for a number of years, pricing for voluntary carbon offsets has been highly variable, with nature-based projects with co-benefits typically attracting the higher prices. At the same time, governments around the globe are recognizing the urgent need to transfer to a low-carbon economy """" and there is broad acceptance that carbon offset credits must be part of solution.Some researchers estimate that nature-based solutions alone could provide up to 1/3 of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global temperature increases under two degrees. A number of public-private initiatives are pushing forward and recommending frameworks for the voluntary carbon market to grow """" most notably the 'Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets' (TSVCM) sponsored by the Institute of International Finance.The successful Article 6 negotiations that took place during COP26 have also brought further clarity to the market. The implementation of the agreement will take time, and a number of questions remain open. But overall, the agreement was welcomed by market participants. It provides clarity to what extent legacy offset credits generated under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) will be allowed for futures emission reductions. It also deals with a thorny issue that plagued the voluntary carbon market for years: the problem of double counting emission reductions.In the past, an emission reduction outcome may be accounted more than once when it is claimed by the country in which the project was based, and, at the same time, by the entity which ultimately bought the certified offset. This issue is being addressed by the introduction of Corresponding Adjustments (CAs). Once implemented, that mechanism should ensure that offset credits can only be claimed once.Carbon Offset Futures AcceptanceCME Group entered the voluntary carbon market in 2021. The exchange launched two offset futures in partnership with CBL Xpansiv, a marketplace for spot trading of environmental commodities. The contracts are physically delivered and based on CBL's Global Emission Offset (GEO) and its Nature-Based Global Emission Offset contract (N-GEO).GEO reflects the market price of CORSIA-eligible carbon offsets. CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, is a framework to support reducing emissions offsets from the international aviation sector. While the contract is designed to comply with CORSIA, its user base is not restricted to airl"

At the event, TransAlta and 27 new members joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance (the Alliance ) where the new members were announced by the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom, Co-Chairs of the Alliance.The Alliance is a global organization of governmental and private sector organizations working to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and accelerate the energy transition.TransAlta's President and CEO, John Kousinioris, stated, Our decision to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance is a natural extension of the Company's commitment to delivering clean energy solutions for our customers, strong returns for our investors, and reliable energy for the communities that we serve. Our growth plan will expand our renewable electricity fleet by two gigawatts over the next five years and deploy energy storage at a much larger scale. We look forward to continuing our contribution to global efforts to deliver an accelerated clean energy transition. TransAlta has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 61 per cent over 2005 levels and has a 2030 target that equates to a 70 per cent reduction compared to 2005 levels.TransAlta's transition away from coal-fired generation started in 2019 and by the end of 2021, the Company will end coal-fired generation in Canada. Through this process, TransAlta will eliminate 2,135 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity from its fleet and will have converted a further 1,259 megawatts to gas-fired generation, consistent with the regulatory frameworks set out by the governments of Canada and Alberta. The Company's sole remaining coal-fired unit in the U.S. will also cease operations at the end of 2025. By that time, the Company will have also delivered on its plan to grow its leading renewable portfolio by two gigawatts, which will result in 70 per cent of the Company's EBITDA being generated by renewables.The Company is well positioned to leverage its significant expertise across a variety of geographies and technologies. TransAlta's ongoing focus is to be a leading provider in the renewables space, bringing solutions that work for its customers and the communities that it serves. TransAlta's success will enable it to continue its role as a leader in the energy transition and to reach the critical goals set out at COP26.See Campaign: HYPERLINK http://transalta.com.http://transalta.com.Contact Information:transalta.com.Tags: HYPERLINK https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/Wire, HYPERLINK Disclosure Newswire HYPERLINK https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/United States, HYPERLINK https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/English\l"

Arbitration has been utilised as a tool for resolving disputes as market mechanisms have developed to deliver greenhouse gas emission reductions. At COP26 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021, governments adopted long-awaited rules for carbon market cooperation under the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact/cop26-outcomes-market-mechanisms-and-non-market-approaches-article-6'shttps://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact/ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact/cop26-outcomes-market-mechanisms-and-non-market-approaches-article-6'scop26 -outcomes-market-mechanisms-and-non-market-approaches-article-6's Article 6.2 and Article 6.4. This post discusses the significance of these rules, what they mean for carbon disputes and how arbitration can contribute to the resolution of such disputes. Carbon Markets Rising Carbon markets exist to incentivise emission reductions HYPERLINK https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbon-pricinghttps://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbon-pricing at the least cost. By purchasing a carbon credit, a government or company can offset a proportion of its emissions, i.e., count the actual emission reductions underlying the credit against its own emission reduction commitments. Carbon markets can also create incentives for investment and technology transfer in climate-vulnerable countries. By setting quantified emission targets for developed Parties, the Kyoto Protocol HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol was a major spur for the development of carbon markets . This treaty sets out three 'flexibility' mechanisms HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms:https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms: Joint Implementation (JI) HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/joint-implementation;https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/joint-implementation; the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism;https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism; and Emissions Trading https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/emissions-tradinghttps://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/emissions-trading. Following Kyoto's adoption, domestic carbon pricing was introduced in various jurisdictions, with the EU's Emissions Trading System HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en being the largest example. Today, carbon markets have largely outgrown the Kyoto mechanisms. For instance, carbon pricing continued HYPERLINK https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620 to expand during the past year, with the proportion of global emissions covered by carbon pricing up from 15% in 2020 to 25.1%. Arbitrating Carbon Market Disputes Carbon market transactions are effected through forward contracts https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asphttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp for the production and delivery of credits (emission reduction purchase agreements HYPERLINK https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erpa.asphttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erpa.asp) and spot and derivatives contracts HYPERLINK https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asphttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp for secondary trading.

Verra's template agreement HYPERLINK https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/rules-and-requirements/ provides for disputes with validation/verification bodies (which assess projects under Verra's standard) to be settled through arbitration in London under ICC rules. The Gold Standard has developed bespoke rules HYPERLINK https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/v2.2_annex-ah.pdfhttps://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/v2.2_annex-ah.pdf, based on the PCA environmental rules, for arbitrating disputes concerning project registration and credit issuance and labelling. Carbon disputes often turn on issues common to other contractual disputes: commodity non-delivery, breach of covenants or warranties, failure to fulfil conditions precedent, disputes over title or security, etc. Distinctive elements include the nature of the commodity, the carbon crediting project cycle, and the application of international climate standards. The project cycle itself can also generate disputes, e.g., concerning project registration or credit issuance.

However, following an 11th-hour move, lead by China and India, the language was reduced to a ""phase down"" of coal use, allowing fossil fuel dependent countries a longer runway in terms of reducing their reliance on the world's dirtiest form of power.The final text, which included no timescale, only commits the signees into ""accelerating efforts towards the phaseout of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" in order to keep the broader COP26 ambitions of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius alive. ""Did I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way? No.,"" said UN Climate Envoy John Kerry. ""But if we hadn't done that we wouldn't have a deal.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA241","COP26 DISCUSSIONS MUST PRIORITIZE AGRICULTURE","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Local, national and world leaders, and committed climate change activists are in Glasgow for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) to share the progress they\\x92ve made since the COP21 in Paris six years ago and to discuss what comes next. One of the issues that must be on the table at COP26 is the worrying impact of climate change on agriculture in Africa.Agriculture accounts for over 25 percent of Africa\\x92s GDP while employing over 70 percent of people that live in rural communities. When agriculture is impacted, women, who work in the agricultural sector suffer the consequences. The entire agriculture value chain is threatened by climate change. According to a recent World Bank Report, unless urgent actions are taken, climate change could force millions of Africans to migrate to new areas.At the production level, climate change is impacting agriculture via drought and flooding events. In 2020, flooding in East Africa impacted over six million people. In 2021, flooding has affected 669,000 people in West and Central Africa, over 700,000 people in Sudan and South Sudan and over 100,000 people in Nigeria.It is also having an impact through invasive and transboundary plant-eating insect pests such as the fall armyworm and the desert locust. Invasive insect pests cost the African continent U.S. $1 billion every year. Impacted the most are vulnerable groups that include African small holder farmers, women and girls, children, disabled and elderly people.Without a climate-resilient agricultural sector, even the most ambitious climate initiatives will bear minimal returns. It is imperative for countries participating in the COP26 meeting to finance agriculture initiatives.Looking at many developed countries, it is evident that it is possible to build climate resilient agriculture. This is particularly possible when several interlinked short-term and long-term strategies are put in place. At the foundation of climate-resilient agriculture is the need for smallholder farmers to have access to dependable and year round sources of water to support agriculture. At the moment African agriculture is dependent on rain-fed agriculture and because of climate change rains are no longer dependable.Complementing access to water for agriculture are other important tools including access to most recent and improved agricultural technologies and resources. From improved and climate-smart seeds to drought, flooding, insects and plant disease-tolerant crops varieties to recent knowledge of agricultural practices and access to markets and financial help.Important is the need for African countries to strengthen their early warning systems. These can only be achieved through strengthening African countries abilities to tap on big data and use it as a tool to stay ahead of all the climate linked disasters. Accompanying early warning systems is the need to lay out comprehensive climate adaptation initiatives.At the center of all actions and strategies is the need to put the people on the ground and African countries at the center of climate action. As a founder to a startup, Oyeska Greens that is working with farmers at the Kenyan Coast I have seen firsthand the value of putting farmers at the forefront.\\xA0 Putting them at the forefront ensures that the strategies and initiatives that are laid out are relevant and meeting the current challenges that small holder farmers and other vulnerable groups are facing as it relates to climate change. Without including the very people whom we are serving, we risk unsustainable and irrelevant solutions.Climate change is the most urgent crisis of our times. While talk and meetings such as COP26 are important, in the end it is the initiatives and actual projects being implemented in African countries, particularly in the agricultural sector that will help move the needle and address the escalating climate change crisis.All countries must work together and take action in the fight against climate change to avert many crises that are projected to happen if we fail to act.\\xA0 Lives of vulnerable citizens including women, elderly and people with disabilities are at stake.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA242","University community responds to COP26 with hope, cautious optimism","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","Cavalier Daily: University of Virginia","World leaders gathered in Glasgow for the 26th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties from Nov. 1 to 13 to discuss and create comprehensive plans for addressing climate change. Members of the University community shared their thoughts on the strides made at COP26, as well as the limitations of certain decisions.By the end of the proceedings, the 197 signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which established an international treaty to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate, produced a landmark agreement - for the first time, these signatories identified fossil fuel as a cause of climate change and urged developed nations to double their funding for reducing emissions in the developing world.The UKCOP26 promoted COP26 as the best last chance to address escalating climate change, as it builds on the steps taken at the 21st annual United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, commonly known as the Paris Agreement. Under this international treaty, 191 countries and the European Union agreed to work toward limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. Countries also agreed to avoid or minimize the risk of climate-related damage by implementing early warning systems and restoring habitats for storm and flood defenses.Environmental Science Prof. Scott Doney researches the relationship between climate change, the global carbon cycle and ocean ecology. He explained the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees draws on scientific studies exploring the damage to ecosystems, society and people.""We're already seeing substantial impacts to the climate system - coral bleaching, droughts, increase in wildfires [and] heat waves,"" Doney said. ""1.5 degrees is not magical. Current problems will continue and probably will be exacerbated.""While Doney noted that countries have pledged larger reductions in emissions, like India's recent net-zero pledge by 2070, since the Paris Agreement, many climate topics - such as global equity, decarbonization funding and emissions reduction - were at issue in the lead-up to COP26 as countries were expected to increase their commitment and funding to better combat climate change.In the days leading up to COP26, over 100 world leaders started the summit with a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. If implemented, this pledge could help to avoid nearly 0.3 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2040.Fourth-year College student Brooke Crouch is active in the student organization Veggies of Virginia, and worked for Turning Green, a San Francisco based environmental non-profit in 2019. Crouch explained what a reduction of methane emissions could mean for the environment.""[The 30-30 Pledge] has been exciting to me, because there hasn't been a lot of talk at the international level of reducing greenhouse gases ... other than carbon dioxide,"" Crouch said. ""Methane is much more potent than CO2 so it has a really huge impact when it's emitted ... we can see large positives from emission reduction.""In addition to reductions in emission, more than 100 countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030 during the summit. This pledge was a recognition of the crucial role that forests play in climate. When forests are cut down, they are no longer able to act as a carbon sink - in which a forest absorbs more carbon than it releases into the atmosphere - thereby contributing to climate change through their inability to sequester carbon dioxide.Environmental Science Prof. Deborah Lawrence is a former science advisor for the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change in the U.S. State Department and researches the link between tropical deforestation and climate change. Lawrence explained that forests play a crucial role in regulating climates.""Without our forests, we would already be a lot hotter, and [so] we've got to keep them [in] the ground,"" Lawrence said.Doney said deforestation is particularly concerning since it impacts primarily tropical countries in the global south that have a rich variety of species.""Deforestation is not just a carbon cycle or climate issue,"" Doney said. ""It's also biodiversity and social equity.""In an unprecedented push for reducing global emissions, a group of countries, cities and car manufacturers - including Ford and General Motors - explicitly recognized that internal combustion vehicles needed to be phased out by 2040. A number of major countries - including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea and Germany - did not sign on to this pledge.Another significant step at COP26 was the joint U.S.-China commitment to work together to significantly reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases - including the U.S. goal to reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and China's plan to phase out coal consumption. In 2019, the U.S. emitted approximately 5.1 billion metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Additionally in 2020, China burned 3 billion tons of coal, according to the BBC.""There was a worry that China was somehow stepping back,"" Lawrence said. ""I think [the joint commitment] is really important because without China, we cannot meet our goals.""COP26 also included important discussions among delegates about the ongoing concern to address fairness - particularly in regard to financing - for developing nations, Lawrence said.""One of the issues that still hasn't been fully resolved ... [is] the extent that the developed world can provide funding to support actions [that] the global south needs to take to help them not only with addressing their emissions, but also adapting and trying to reduce the damages from climate change,"" Doney said.Despite the inclusion of fossil fuels and pledges made on methane and deforestation at COP26, certain world leaders and officials - including Secretary General Antonio Guterres - viewed the emissions reduction pledges as insufficient given the growing danger of climate change and the lack of actionable mechanisms to help at-risk and developing countries decarbonize and adapt to a warming world. Doney explained that while international pledges are significant, they do not represent actual policy.""When countries come [to COP26] and make pledges, a lot of the really hard work goes on at the national [domestic] level to actually implement [these pledges],"" Doney said. ""It's one thing to say what you're going to do - it's another to actually act on it.""At the regional and local level, the University has taken steps toward its own sustainable future. According to the University's 2030 sustainability plan, the University aims to be carbon neutral by 2030 and fossil fuel-free by 2050.These goals - which Lawrence described as an ""ambitious"" - have been met with some disappointment from Crouch, who believes more action is necessary.""Our targets should be bigger, bolder,"" Crouch said.Crouch ultimately believes these goals are a step forward, but that students should do all they can to keep pushing those in power to take climate action.""Writing letters to the editor about issues you care about, calling and writing to your representatives, meeting with your representatives, joining local advocacy groups - they might be small actions, but they do add up to a much larger impact,"" Crouch said.\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA250","ICRA sees up to $500B in investments needed to achieve India's COP26 goals","Biofuels Digest","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 06, 2022( Biofuels Digest: HYPERLINK http://www.biofuelsdigest.comhttp://www.biofuelsdigest.com In India, the Indian Credit Ratings Agency, ICRA, in its recent research report, has analyzed India's COP26 commitment in two phases - up to 2030, and the net zero target for 2070[1]. Being a developing country, which is at an inflection point in terms of its energy consumption, the nation's per capita energy consumption is expected to surge 3x-4x over the long term. Parallel to this, India has also committed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 1 billionn metric tons by 2030. The country has additionally committed to a net zero carbon emission target by the year 2070, by when the per capita energy consumption would have surged from current levels. Rohit Ahuja, Head of Research and Outreach, ICRA says, 'In order to achieve the net zero target by 2070, a focused roadmap would be required. It calls for timely interventions by the government and large capex/investments in GHG emitting sectors like power, industry and transport. These sectors together emit ~90% of CO2 as per 2019 data of International Energy Agency. Ambitious targets for COP26 opens massive investment opportunities across segments stemming from 500 GW renewables by 2030, higher EV penetration (~10% by 2025), 20% ethanol blending for petrol (~3x increase from current levels), improvement in energy efficiencies (battery storage, smart cities, etc.) and improvement in carbon capture from enhancing green cover and use of advanced technologies. This would be a daunting task and would need massive policy interventions to ensure investments across aforementioned sectors remain profitable enough to sustain well beyond 2030.' The ICRA research report notes that as per the government's five key investment areas, an incremental addition of 5x in non-fossil fuels power generation capacity by 2030 is required for which India would need about $450-500 billion investments including investment towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities.

The Youth StatementThe same call was made inside the Blue Zone of the conference, where climate activists from YOUNGO, the Children and Youth Constituency of UN Climate Change, delivered to the COP presidency and other leaders a statement signed by 40,000 young people demanding change. The statement raises several points of concern, among them inclusion in climate negotiations. They also asked Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( https://unfccc.int/UNFCCC), to support their efforts to have a paragraph mentioning the importance of the youth included in the final declaration that is expected to be adopted at the end of COP26. The statement, which was handed over to Ministers, also asks for action on climate finance, mobility and transportation, wildlife protection and environmental conservation.  Wherever I have been in the world, I have been struck by the passion and the commitment of young people to climate action. The voices of young people must be heard and reflected in these negotiations here at COP.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA253","Hawaii's Message At COP26: The World Must Move Beyond Zero Emissions","Honolulu Civil Beat","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 22, 2021( Honolulu Civil Beat: HYPERLINK http://civilbeat.comhttp://civilbeat.com Editor's note: The state's Climate Commission is hosting a post-COP26 event on Jan. 13 with Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. See details in HI EVENTS on climate.hawaii.gov. 'Keep Glasgow cold, wet and grey,' said a sign held by one of the protesters standing outside the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference venue in Glasgow, Scotland. It succinctly portrayed what combatting climate change means  an existential threat to our way of life, cold and wet as it may be for some of us. Taking an important message to the world, a delegation from warm and sunny Hawaii headed to COP26 earlier this month, led by Gov. David Ige. Cabinet officials, climate policy staff, and an 'ohana' delegation of lawmakers, UH scientists, law professors, students, and youth and youthful activists from Hawaii community groups spent time at COP26 relaying Hawaii's world-leading ambitions through High Impact Actions, and a strong message that net-zero greenhouse emissions is not enough  we must go beyond zero to save islands. Hawaii is the David to climate change's Goliath, the small state with a big ambition, 'because we believe that big ambition leads to big action.' When Gov. Ige announced the goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045, other governors were disbelieving of him; three years later in 2018, California  the world's fifth-largest economy  followed and set the same target as Hawaii. Hawaii was the first state to show its commitment to the Paris Agreement by enshrining it in law. This year, the Hawaii Legislature declared a climate emergency, making Hawaii the first state to do so, and highlighting once again, Hawaii's leadership. Special U.S. Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said that Paris, in 2015, was the building of the arena. This year, Glasgow starts the race to zero and gives a blueprint for how to get there by 2030. Hawaii's ambitions are already beyond zero. By law, Hawaii must absorb more carbon than it emits by 2045 or sooner. Gov. Ige compared the situation to being in a sprint relay. Hawaii delegation to COP26 included Department of Land and Natural Resources Chair Suzanne Case, First Lady Dawn Ige, Gov. David Ige, Climate Commission Coordinator Anukriti Hittle and Hawaii State Energy Office Chief Energy Officer Scott Glenn. The governor is pictured at top with U.S. Climate Alliance Govs. Jay Inslee of Washington state, Kate Brown of Oregon and J.B. Pritzker of IllinoisOffice of the Governor/2021 Why go all the way to Glasgow? Everyone knows Hawaii, and when Hawaii speaks, people listen. At , Hawaii continued to push the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) goal, and highlight the challenges faced by small island states. Going to Glasgow in the face of adverse pandemic conditions showed Hawaii's commitment to climate action, and its support of the federal government's renewed efforts. More broadly, what did Glasgow achieve? The U.S., to show it was Â£ll in' after being absent from the world climate stage the past four years, unveiled more funding for adaptation, and signaled more of a role for 'mother nature.' With all the new pledges combined, forecast models say we will still achieve only 1.7 degrees Celsius, not the well-under 1.5 Celsius needed to keep Hawaii warm, sunny, and wet where it should be. Still, that's one thing that came out of COP26  higher ambition. Priority Policy Areas So what does higher ambition mean for Hawaii? as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a 25-governor bipartisan network that represents an economy larger than all countries but the United States and China, and works hard to uphold and go beyond the U.S. pledges offered. The priority policy areas for collective coalition adoption span sectors of power, buildings, industry, transportation, and across the economy, including areas such as resilience, just transition and equity, natural and working lands, and the cost of greenhouse gases. Hawaii was applauded in particular for its impressive record of including women and diversity in climate governance  over 50% of positions in the state's Climate Commission are held by women, and almost three-quarters are held by ethnic minorities. Everyone knows Hawaii, and when Hawaii speaks, people listen. But high ambition is not enough. It only means something if it leads to big action. The state's Climate Commission Co-Chair Suzanne Case unveiled Gov. Ige's-approved Hawaii High (HI) Impact Actions that define our own state-level version of the pledges made at the national level. Only  you guessed it  Hawaii's are more ambitious. Case pointed to nitty-gritty actions that commission member departments are taking over the next year. She showed what these high impact actions look like on the ground. Over 70 specific actions are listed on the commission's Goals and Progress page[1], for anyone wishing to take a peek. In a consensus-driven process such as the COP26, we go only as fast as our slowest runner. And that means truly embracing that we are a global community with global impacts  we cannot hide behind national borders. Even with its many inequities, vulnerabilities, capacity constraints and challenges, Hawaii's culture and community embodies connections to the larger Pacific. It is a place that understands how to move ahead with everyone in agreement, sprinters and less-resourced alike. And that's what Hawaii brings to the world  an island leadership that is relevant not only for the sunny places, but also for those that are cold, wet and grey.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA256","Pockets of leadership ahead of COP26","Investor Strategy News","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 22, 2021( Investor Strategy News: HYPERLINK http://www.investorstrategynews.com Usually restrained fund managers are venting their frustrations with governments and companies over climate inaction. The rebukes get louder as COP26 gets closer. Martin Currie, a global equities house with about $9 billion in Aussie shares, has made its position clear on what it would like to see come out of the Glasgow meetings for world leaders and others, scheduled to run from October 31-November 12. Martin Currie's recently established Stewardship Institute issued a note to investors last week (October 22) which indicates the roles all interested parties, including asset owners and managers, should play. The manager also calls out the Australian government for its tardiness on climate action. The investors' note, 'COP26: A climate for change?' says that high-level commitments on climate change are no longer enough. If the gathering is to be considered a success, then more specific action and a greater sense of urgency are needed - not just from governments, but also from companies and investors - resulting in a tangible shift in the decarbonisation pathway of the wider economy. 'As investors, we are extremely concerned that action at COP26 will not be significant enough to put the world on a pathway to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,' the note says. 'The latest IPCC report, published in August, was rightly described by UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, as a 'Code red for humanity' and a warning that without a significant step up in efforts then keeping warming below a threshold of 1.5 degrees could become out of reach. 'In our view, it is critical that COP26 is used as an opportunity to accelerate action and for governments, companies, and investors to take specific action to rejuvenate momentum on climate action. We want to see COP26 set up a climate for real change, commitment, and action from all players.' John Gilmore The note was written by David Sheasby, Martin Currie's head of stewardship and ESG, and John Gilmore, stewardship and ESG specialist. They say that COP26 must succeed in creating decisive action from governments in three key areas: 1. Climate laggards need to step up. The note points out that G20 countries account for 78 per cent of the world's emissions and have the resources to tackle climate change effectively. 'There should be no excuses for inaction here, and key hold-outs such as Australia should stop vacillating and make national net-zero commitments and follow it up with real policy action.' In addition, countries without interim targets or where they lack detail, such as India and China, need to show a much clearer roadmap for immediate action rather than further postponement. China, for example, is still increasing its use of coal and that needs to change quickly. 2. Fair financing needs must be met. The commitment agreed at COP16 for developed countries to provide US100 billion annually to fund climate transition has not been met. only a fraction of the financing comes from grants, too much of this funding comes with unwelcome conditions or in the form of loans, many of which have above market interest rates. This creates a disincentive for climate investment by developing countries. 3. Fixing carbon pricing and ending fossil fuel subsidies. Carbon pricing is a key mechanism for incentivising economies to move away from fossil fuels and carbon intensive activities. 'Our view is that even in the absence of a global carbon tax or trading scheme being implemented, a commitment on a global floor for the cost of carbon would be a promising first step. Without this, there is a clear disincentive to move first on carbon pricing,' the note says. For investors and investee companies, Sheasby and Gilmore say there is an urgent need for more decisive action in three key areas. They are: Investors must take collective action to promote net zero Companies need to deliver real-world emissions reductions, and As a fund manager, Martin Currie, which became a signatory to the UN's PRI in 2009, has accelerated its own commitments and stepped up its actions through corporate engagement, reducing its carbon footprint as a business, becoming a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and by building 'climate resistant portfolios'. Sheasby and Gilmore said separately that for the latest round of talks there had been more focus on individual country actions than collective responses. 'There hasn't been a real follow through on prior challenges around financing climate action for developing countries that we refer to in the article and no real traction on areas that need a collective response like carbon pricing,' Sheasby said.'This requires leadership and goodwill and there seems to be a lack of goodwill or bandwidth to generate real progress on these items.' With fund managers, they could be clearer in setting out expectations for companies and engaging with them on these. They should be using escalation tools at their disposal, such as holding directors to account through voting or filing or supporting carefully targeted shareholder resolutions. Sheasby said: 'Climate change is a material risk for many companies, so they need to be prepared to provide detail and context on how they are approaching this. Managers need to be prepared to scrutinise the targets that companies are setting to understand whether the businesses that they are investing in are really sustainable over the long term.' Asked about Australia, he said the Australian government did not show leadership but that the finance industry and many of the super funds had stepped up and taken on this role. Even in the global context those funds had shown leadership, he said. 'An example is HESTA, which has focussed on climate change for a number of years and last year was the first major superannuation fund to set out a goal of being net zero by 2050.'

The 151 new national climate commitments submitted ahead of and during COP26 fell short of putting the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C. But after two weeks of negotiations, delegates reached consensus that countries should further strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets next year, deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts.Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute:""In a year marked by uncertainty and mistrust, COP26 affirmed the importance of collective global action to address the climate crisis. While we are not yet on track, the progress made over the last year and at the COP26 summit offered bright spots and a strong foundation to build upon. The real test now is whether countries accelerate their efforts and turn commitments into action.""Negotiators found common ground on key issues, including agreeing to further strengthen 2030 targets in order to keep the 1.5C goal within reach, step up and accelerate financial support to developing countries, establish a dedicated space to finally address permanent losses and damages from climate impacts, and finalize rules to implement the Paris Agreement. A particular bright spot at COP26 was how effective vulnerable countries, youth and climate campaigners were in demanding greater action and accountability. And for the first time, negotiators explicitly agreed to accelerate action to phase down unabated coal power and phase-out fossil fuel subsidies an important step forward.""A number of major emitters have weak 2030 plans and will need to put forward more aggressive targets to drive down emissions this decade. Encouragingly, countries agreed to come back next year to submit stronger 2030 targets and to put forward long term strategies that aim towards a just transition to net zero by around mid-century.

Mitchell/Getty Images News via Getty ImagesUnder pressure to avoid catastrophic climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed for the first time to phase down unabated coal-fired power plants and most fossil fuel subsidies while pledging to submit more ambitious emission reduction targets just a year from now.The 11-page Glasgow Climate Pact also adds pressure on nations to quickly ramp up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade in hopes of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. By adopting the pact, they might be able to keep a narrow window open for meeting the most ambitious goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.The unprecedented deal reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Nov. 13 came after days of grueling and often tense negotiations over wording for the coal plant retirements, rules guiding a global carbon market, and how to compensate vulnerable nations for climate disasters happening today.People bring water and food to neighbors in a Belgian town that suffered record-high rain tied to climate change in July 2021.Source: Tierry Monasse/Getty Images News via Getty Images""Together, over the past two weeks, parties have demonstrated what the world had come to doubt: That countries can rise above their differences to unite against a common challenge,"" an emotional COP26 President Alok Sharma told delegates after the Glasgow pact was adopted. ""I think today we can say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees within reach. But its pulse is weak, and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate our commitments into rapid action.""Deep disagreements remained over the final Glasgow document, with the European Union and other nations telling the summit they were disappointed with the coal language becoming weaker at the last minute. Coal-dependent China and India nearly jeopardized the final deal by insisting that ""phaseout"" of coal plants be changed to ""phase-down."" Small island states and developing nations also demanded and failed to secure finance commitments for the loss and damage they already suffer from climate change.In the end, government diplomats huddling in the cavernous conference center in Glasgow chose to set their differences aside to support the deal, which also finalized rules of the Paris accord. Here is how nations delivered and fell short on three critical goals that the U.K. COP26 presidency set for the high-stakes summit.1. Keeping 1.5 degrees C within reachThe Paris Agreement called on nations to keep the global temperature rise to ""well below"" 2 degrees and ideally to 1.5 degrees over preindustrial levels. If world leaders managed to keep hopes alive in Glasgow, they also kicked the can down the road by agreeing to revisit their emission pledges a year from now.As part of their Paris commitments, countries were expected to deliver updated and more ambitious plans to the United Nations ahead of , detailing how they planned to cut emissions by 2030. Unless the total output of climate-warming pollution is reduced by 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, a stabilized net-zero emissions world would become unattainable, scientists have warned.In all, 13 countries and the 27-nation European Union submitted updated plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, but their effort fell short. Although the U.S. and many other countries set more ambitious carbon reduction goals in recent months, some nations simply resubmitted their 2015 emission reduction plans. Brazil and Mexico were among a few that even scaled back their ambitions.Halfway through the conference, researchers sounded the alarm. Not a single country including the world's top emitters had policies in place that could zero out emissions by midcentury, Climate Action Tracker concluded. The world was on track to reach 2.4 degrees or higher, the organization projected.The U.S. was among the nations in Glasgow that pushed for another round of Nationally Determined Contributions by late 2022 when leaders meet for the next climate summit in Egypt. It means nations get another chance to submit new and possibly significantly more ambitious plans next year.2. Boosting climate financeDeveloping nations wanted to see rich countries make good on a decade-old promise to award $100 billion annually to help them develop clean energy sources and adapt to rising sea levels, drought and other climate impacts. The vast majority of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere were generated by the U.S. and other Western economies over the past 250 years.The Glasgow Climate Pact promised to double funding for adaptation by 2025 and to report back on the progress they were making in meeting the $100 billion goal. It also, for the first time, called for a two-year dialogue on a finance mechanism to compensate nations for loss and damage. But the lack of concrete funding commitments and weak deliverables frustrated COP26 delegates and groups who for years had pushed for more support for vulnerable nations.""It is inexcusable that developed countries failed to meet their commitment to deliver $100 billion annually starting in 2020, even as they provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for fossil fuels,"" Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement.Others warned that the failure to immediately address ""loss and damage"" could slow the overall global climate effort.""Rich countries dragging their feet on the mechanism to compensate the poorest countries for climate damages that are already being suffered is shameful and has to be resolved,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. ""Both because it's the right thing to do and because failure on this would greatly complicate things on emission reductions.""But COP26COP26Thirty countries along with numerous local governments, automakers and investors also signed a declaration to accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles during the two-week climate summit, and more than 130 leaders from government, corporations and financial firms promised to collaborate to halt deforestation by 2030.3. Wrapping up carbon market rulesWhen Sharma hit his gavel Nov. 13 to declare ""Article 6"" of the Paris Agreement rulebook adopted, the COP26 meeting hall broke out in a cheer. An outstanding but critical part of the Paris rules, Article 6 spells out how nations can establish a global carbon market to help reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which proved to be one of the thorniest issues to resolve from the 2015 pact.""The agreed Article 6 rules give countries the tools they need for environmental integrity, to avoid double-counting [emission reductions] and ultimately to clear a path to get private capital flowing to developing countries,"" said Kelley Kizzier, the Environmental Defense Fund's vice president for global climate.There has been concern over the Glasgow deal allowing countries to carry over old credits from the Kyoto Protocol that preceded the Paris Agreement to meet their new carbon reduction commitments. But Kizzier noted that the credit allowance was limited to 120 million metric tons of carbon and would not be allowed past the first round of national climate commitments.4. COP26While the national climate pledges disappointed, COP26 delivered in some other key areas that Sharma had deemed critical for meeting the 1.5-degree target: speeding up the retirement of coal plants and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. Before agreeing to the new language on coal in the Glasgow Climate Pact, 46 nations had already pledged during the summit to phase out their coal fleets and to stop building new plants unless they are equipped with carbon capture technology. Three of the world's top 10 coal generators signed the deal but not the three largest ones the U.S., China and India.The focus on coal at COP26 was unprecedented and signals change, said Chris Littlecott, an associate director for the climate change think tank E3G.""We have broken through the barrier of governments accepting that coal has to go,"" Littlecott said. ""Even for those who are trying to slow it down and who try and do it on their own terms, that mental barrier has now gone.""\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA262","Commentary: How global climate negotiations work and what's expected from COP26","New Hampshire Bulletin","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 26, 2021( New Hampshire Bulletin: HYPERLINK https://newhampshirebulletin.com Over two weeks in November, world leaders and national negotiators will meet in Scotland to discuss what to do about climate change. It's a complex process that can be hard to make sense of from the outside, but it's how international law and institutions help solve problems that no single country can fix on its own. I worked for the United Nations for several years as a law and policy adviser and have been involved in international negotiations. Here's what's happening behind closed doors and why people are concerned that COP26 might not meet its goals. What is COP26? In 1992, countries agreed to an international treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[1] (UNFCCC), which set ground rules and expectations for global cooperation on combating climate change. It was the first time the majority of nations formally recognized the need to control greenhouse gas emissions[2], which cause global warming that drives climate change. That treaty has since been updated, including in 2015 when nations signed the Paris climate agreement[3]. That agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to 'well below' 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), and preferably to 1.5 C (2.7 F), to avoid catastrophic climate change[4]. COP26COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 through Nov. 12, after a one-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPERLINK https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FAnL5/4/https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FAnL5/4/[7] Why are world leaders so focused on climate change? The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report, released in August 2021, warns in its strongest terms yet that human activities have unequivocally[8] warmed the planet, and that climate change is now widespread, rapid, and intensifying. The IPCC's scientists explain how climate change has been fueling[9] extreme weather events and flooding[10], severe heat waves and droughts[11], loss and extinction of species[12], and the melting of ice sheets and rising of sea levels[13]. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the report a 'code red for humanity.'[14] Enough greenhouse gas emissions are already in the atmosphere, and they stay there long enough that even under the most ambitious scenario[15] of countries quickly reducing their emissions, the world will experience rising temperatures through at least mid-century. However, there remains a narrow window of opportunity. If countries can cut global emissions to 'net zero[16]' by 2050, that could bring warming back to under 1.5 C in the second half of the 21st century. How to get closer to that course is what leaders and negotiators are discussing. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the latest climate science findings a 'code red for humanity.' (UNFCCC) What happens at COP26? Once the heads of state depart, country delegations, often led by ministers of environment, engage in days of negotiations, events, and exchanges to adopt their positions, make new pledges, and join new initiatives[17]. These interactions are based on months of prior discussions, policy papers, and proposals prepared by groups of states, U.N. staff, and other experts. Nongovernmental organizations and business leaders also attend the conference, and COP26 has a public side[18] with sessions focused on topics such as the impact of climate change on small island states, forests, or agriculture, as well as exhibitions and other events. The meeting ends with an outcome text that all countries agree to. Guterres publicly expressed disappointment[19] with the COP25 outcome, and there are signs of trouble[20] heading into COP26. Celebrities like youth climate activist Greta Thunberg add public pressure on world leaders. (UNFCCC) What is COP26 expected to accomplish? Countries are required under the Paris Agreement to update their national climate action plans every five years, including at COP26. This year, they're expected to have ambitious targets through 2030. These are known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs[21]. The Paris Agreement requires countries to report their NDCs, but it allows them leeway in determining how they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The initial set of emission reduction targets in 2015 [22]was far too weak to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One key goal of COP26 is to ratchet up these targets to reach net zero carbon emissions[23] by the middle of the century. Another aim of COP26 is to increase climate finance[24] to help poorer countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change. This is an important issue of justice for many developing countries whose people bear the largest burden[25] from climate change but have contributed least to it. Wealthy countries promised in 2009 to contribute $100 billion a year[26] by 2020 to help developing nations, a goal that has not been reached[27]. The U.S.[28], U.K., and EU[29], among the largest historic greenhouse emitters, are increasing their financial commitments, and banks, businesses, insurers, and private investors are being asked to do more. Other objectives[30] include phasing out coal use and generating solutions that preserve, restore, or regenerate natural carbon sinks, such as forests. Another challenge that has derailed past COPs is agreeing on implementing a carbon trading system[31] outl"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA272","COP26: The Time for Delivery is Now, Say Imperial College-London Experts","November 17, 2021 Wednesday 8:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Imperial College London issued the following news:By Hana Amer, Simon Levey, Katrine Petersen and Siobhan Stack-MaddoxExperts discuss the work that needs to happen now, after the UN climate change conference concluded with a new agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact.COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference that came to a conclusion in Glasgow this weekend, has delivered a new climate pact that was agreed by more than 190 countries that have signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change.The conference saw the UK Presidency finalise an agreement where all signatories acknowledged, for the first time, that burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) is warming the planet and causing our climate to change.However, many were disappointed by the shortfall in countries' pledges to cut their emissions, known as their 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs), which scientists say still do not put the world on track for the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperatures to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.Dr Fredi Otto, Senior Lecturer at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, said: ""1.5 C is not dead, but pledges do not reduce emissions, only national policies do, and they have to be implemented. So, it's a Schrodinger's cat situation in that it's dead and alive for now - and we'll only know which it really is when we measure emissions in the coming years.""Another critically important part of the COP26 negotiations was the issue of climate justice, and finance from developed countries to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, as well as compensate for what is known as 'loss and damage' - those impacts that cannot be adapted to, such as hurricanes destroying homes, or island nations disappearing due to sea level rise.COP26 saw progress on acknowledging the importance of this finance and the responsibility of developed countries to provide it, but many developing countries were left frustrated with a lack of tangible outcomes.Alyssa Gilbert, Director of Policy and Translation at the Grantham Institute, said: ""At an international stage, loss and damage was a bigger and clearer discussion in this COP than I have seen previously, but still not addressed head on. This topic will remain essential to developing nations and an international compromise is not clear yet.""For researchers at Imperial College London, a delegation of whom attended the climate summit as official observers of the process, the opportunity to meet activists, business representatives and policymakers from all over the world has sparked new discussions and ideas.In this piece, they consider what the Glasgow Climate Pact means for their ongoing work to bring about a greener, cleaner, fairer future for all, and emphasise the importance of rapid, immediate action to deliver on the outcomes of COP26, and close the gaps and shortfalls it left behind.Emission reduction pledgesProfessor Martin Siegert, Co-Director of the Grantham Institute, said: ""Whereas the Paris COP21 in 2015 was characterised by a huge wave of enthusiasm for the 'Nationally-Determined' first steps towards decarbonisation, Glasgow COP26 has been a sobering meeting where we acknowledged that much more global ambition is needed if we are to avoid the worst consequences of dangerous climate change.""Certainly, the next attempt to raise ambition cannot wait another 6 years - and one outcome from Glasgow will be more regular updates to carbon reduction targets. Such meetings may succeed if non-State actors and Governments work together to form not just 'pledges' but comprehensive plans for rapid decarbonisation that are supported by their citizens.""Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, Chair of the Grantham Institute, added: ""Overall, COP26 achieved as much as I realistically expected, with some pluses and some minuses. However, the crucial tests of all the words spoken and promises made are:will the global greenhouse gas emission curve reach a maximum by the middle of this decade and then start to fall? Are the developed countries now going to give substantial help to developing countries to cope with damage due to climate change and to pursue low carbon growth?""Looking ahead, Dr Ajay Gambhir, Advanced Research Fellow at the Grantham Institute, commented: ""[The updated pledges] signal a pathway to a less than 2 C warmer world for the first time, which is hugely encouraging. But that has to be contrasted with the fact that emissions continue to rise, so it's now critically important that the policies and measures to deliver the envisaged peak and then rapid fall in emissions are put in place all over the world.""Professor Ralf Toumi, Co-Director at the Grantham Institute, added: ""The CO2 in the atmosphere is the ultimate verdict on all our efforts.""Climate finance and justice Izhar Shah, Research Associate at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, said: ""It is clear that the climate conscience is back in policymaking [...] Globally speaking, I see a divided house between developed and developing countries. What I'd like to see is developed countries providing technological and financial assistance to developing economies.""Dr Friederike (Fredi) Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute, commented on the COP26 outcomes on climate finance:""The weak outcome on loss and damages[...] shows that climate change is still mainly regarded as a future problem in anything other than rhetoric. The developed states are still not prepared to take responsibility for what has happened already and that is a problem, the next COP really needs to move forward on climate justice which is not just inter-generational.""On important next steps, Courtnae Bailey, Research Postgraduate on the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP, commented:""Doubling adaptation finance from 2019 levels [as agreed in the text] is great, but this still does not fill the adaptation finance gap."" She continued: ""The private sector needs to be engaged in financing adaptation for the scale of finance needed to flow. Governments therefore need to start rewarding investment in resilience and sustainability.""In agreement that despite the steering for more finance towards adaptation, more technical know-how and deeper understanding is needed of what works successfully, Alyssa Gilbert highlighted:""Similarly, just transitions are an essential part of the discussion. Recognised very clearly in Glasgow, but also lacking funding and, perhaps like adaptation, it is still not clear what a just transition really looks like - which could be very different in different parts of the world. This will remain an important area for development.""Nature and biodiversityPatrick Walkden, a Research Postgraduate on the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP (SSCP DTP) at the Natural History Museum and Imperial college, highlighted that at COP26, ""there was finally some recognition of the interconnectedness of both the climate and biodiversity crises and that there are synergies in addressing both.""Fellow SSCP DTP Postgraduate Researcher Galina Jonsson agreed that ""despite being long overdue, officially recognising the crucial role of 'protecting, conserving and restoring ecosystems and nature' in tackling climate change is a leap in the right direction.""For Senior Lecturer Dr Bonnie Waring, ""one thing is certain: meeting net zero goals will necessitate not only protection of existing forest, but also the recovery and restoration of areas deforested in the past. There is a very urgent need for the ecological community, working in concert with local stakeholders, to provide data and tools that can guide best practices for restoration efforts. We must also provide rigorous ways to explore potential synergies or trade-offs among the different ecosystem services forests provide.""Postgraduate Researcher Galina Jonsson emphasised that future action must ""bridge the gap between the climate and biodiversity agendas. Currently, climate change and global biodiversity loss have separate international conventions (UNFCCC and CBD, respectively). The vital next step is to enable a unified approach where international goal and targets are well-informed and appropriately implemented to simultaneously tackle both crises and avoid finding ourselves with divergent goals and targets that should be tackled under one banner, where progress towards one can be at the expense of the other.""Fossil fuelsKrista Halttunen, a Postgraduate Researcher on the SSCP DTP, emphasised that ""COP26 was the first time that fossil fuels were explicitly mentioned in a climate agreement. Even though the final language on coal 'phase-down' and 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies is not particularly strong, the deal still sends a signal to investors and markets that fossil fuels may not be a good investment for the future."" Additionally, ""the last-minute change of phrasing highlights the need to include developing country perspectives in the discussion about the future of fossil fuels, specifically how to map out realistic pathways for phasing out incumbent industries. I hope to include this perspective more in my future research as well.""For Krista, ""the next important question is, what will a managed phase-out look like in practice, from the perspective of companies, governments and investors?"", a question which is central to her research. ""I think the announcements at COP26 have paved the way for more concerted efforts and new collaborations to develop pathways and solutions in this area.""Looking ahead, Krista said ""the discussions at COP26 show that even though an energy transition will not happen overnight, fossil fuel phase-out is now firmly on the global agenda. I hope that governments, companies, and investors will take note of this and start planning for a managed transition away from fossil fuels now. Delaying the planning will only increase the risk of a sudden and disorderly transition, likely to have significant negative impacts on societies, economies and investments.""Paloma Ortega Arriaga, a fellow SSCP DTP Research Postgraduate stressed that ""fossil fuels should be phased out and the money spent on these should be relocated to clean energy technologies and to people who lack energy access.""Civil society and climate changeSocietal engagement with climate change - through education, local climate solutions and citizen engagement - will play an essential role in driving climate action.COP26, Dr Vasiliki Kioupi, Assistant Teaching Fellow at the Centre for Environmental Policy, said: ""This COP26Dr Neil Jennings, Partnership Development Manager at the Grantham Institute, stressed the importance of engaging everyone in the journey to reduce emissions:""Although the level of public support for climate action is very high, it still remains a significant challenge to implement emission reductions on the scale and speed necessary while keeping all the public on board. This challenge points to the importance of deliberative democratic approaches for guiding local climate action and to focusing on the principles of a Just Transition - ensuring that the shift to a low carbon economy is well planned and that no one is left behind.""Dr Emma Lawrance, Mental Health Innovations Fellow at the Institute of Global Health Innovation, said people may experience impacts on their mental health when engaging with climate change:""It's important that we can create communities that have the foundations to care for each other and our health while simultaneously acting on climate. The good news is that invariably, what is good for climate is good for people's mental health; whether reducing air pollution, more active ways of getting around, or more tree cover and biodiversity in our cities.""We will be working with our partners around the world to create ways to learn from each other and ensure the hidden costs of climate inaction on our wellbeing, as well as the multiple benefits of climate action for healthier, fairer societies, are accounted for and heard by decision-makers.""Representation and inclusionWith the UK Presidency committing to deliver an ""inclusive "", Postgraduate Researcher Paloma reflected: ""since I started studying my PhD on energy access, I realised how important it is to understand and include the needs of the local communities before designing any type of intervention. COP26 has reinforced this view, because the most valuable lessons I learned and the wisest words I heard during the week I attended COP26 were from youth activists and indigenous people.Like Paloma, Postgraduate Researcher Patrick was inspired by youth activism ""especially against the backdrop of what is an incredibly slow and oftentimes demoralising process, it injected much need enthusiasm and inspiration, giving hope that we can begin to hold governments and corporations to account so that they can bring down emissions and move towards greater sustainability.""However, Paloma highlighted that youth and indigenous groups ""were underrepresented, and on many occasions, overlooked by decision makers, media and other people attending COP26. I really believe that we need to give them the space and attention they deserve and include them more in the process.""Postgraduate Galina agreed, emphasising that COP is ""the only formal democratic space where smaller climate-vulnerable nations have a voice and the only place where indigenous peoples, women and other groups disproportionally affected by climate change have a voice, but only when they are not locked out of the process. RINGOs, the only non-advocacy observer constituency, were also locked out. UNFCCC must ensure this is not repeated at future COPs.""Reflecting on the UK Presidency, Alyssa Gilbert said: ""It was hugely inspiring to have a COP hosted by my home country. The locality meant that the discourse influenced people across the nation, spurred on by greater media attention, and the UK as hosting government was forced, even if too briefly, to make climate change issues central to other policy areas and commitments. I had underestimated how powerful this effect can be.""Copyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7668022 MSTRUCK\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA274","Insurers make progress on climate resilience at COP26, face fossil fuel battle","December 3, 2021 Friday","SNL Insurance Daily","The insurance industry made further progress on climate change resilience at November's COP26, but has a ways to go when it comes to reducing or eliminating underwriting for carbon-related activities.Insurers had a bigger presence at COP26 than at previous gatherings and had a particularly robust showing in the resilience conversation, Rowan Douglas, head of global insurance broker Willis Towers Watson PLC's climate and resilience hub, said in an interview. The industry unveiled two initiatives to advance greater climate resilience globally.The Insurance Development Forum, an industry-led public-private initiative that aims to improve countries' natural disaster resilience through insurance and risk management, at COP26 launched the Global Risk Modelling Alliance, which seeks to improve climate-vulnerable countries' access to risk modeling. It also co-established the Global Resilience Index Initiative to create a global model for measuring climate resilience.The next step for both initiatives is building public-sector support and getting the Global Resilience Index Initiative up and running by next year's COP27 meeting in Egypt, Ekhosuehi Iyahen, the Insurance Development Forum's secretary general, said in emailed comments.Fossil fuel feudContinued support for fossil fuel underwriting got a frosty reception from some at COP26, raising questions about their progress on climate goals. Industry representatives were clear during COP26 that carriers would not stop insuring fossil fuels entirely, but instead help companies make the transition to renewable energy.There is a role for engagement with fossil fuel companies on a transition, Peter Bosshard, global coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign, said in an interview. But that engagement should be time-restricted and have consequences, otherwise insurers are just ""kicking the can down the road,"" he said.Bosshard said insurers have made rapid progress on exiting coal underwriting, but expressed disappointment in their different approach to oil and gas. He said the first step carriers should make is to stop insuring the expansion of oil and gas production and stop giving off the impression that they are ""trying to buy themselves more time"" to underwrite fossil fuel projects.Members of the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, or NZIA, consisting of 14 insurers and Lloyd's of London, pledge to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in their underwriting portfolios to net-zero by 2050. The NZIA is looking to launch its target-setting protocol in January 2023, after which members have six months to come up with their first set of interim five-year goals. The alliance is also working with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials on a global standard for measuring and disclosing insured greenhouse gas emissions, slated for launch in summer 2022.""If it is 100-meter race we are just off the starting blocks,"" Butch Bacani, program leader for the UN Environment Programme's Principles for Sustainable Insurance Initiative, said in an interview. Just getting startedS&P Global Market Intelligence asked the eight NZIA founding members whether they planned to go further on curbing oil and gas underwriting than already announced and what limits they were imposing on engagement.Swiss Re AG reiterated a pledge made in 2020 to stop providing individual insurance cover to the companies responsible for the 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas production in the world by July 2023.Munich Re said it was sticking to the plan announced in December 2020, which includes cutting carbon emissions relating to oil and gas underwriting by 5% by 2025.""We monitor relevant market developments and continuously expand our ESG strategy,"" an Allianz SE spokeswoman said in an email.The NZIA waiting for certain metrics and goal-setting does not mean its members are doing nothing in the meantime, Bacani said. Insurers joining the alliance need to tell the UN what they plan to do over the next 12 months to decarbonize their underwriting portfolios immediately.The alliance is also pushing for companies to do more carbon reduction early on so there is less reliance on not-yet-proven carbon reduction technologies to reach net-zero, Bacani added.\l"

Nuclear energy is the only energy source with a proven track record of producing firm, zero-carbon energy at the scale needed to meet global goals. Indeed, it's increasingly clear that achieving net-zero worldwide carbon emissions is simply not feasible without a significant expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy worldwide.Specifically, we urge the delegates to assume that a significant commercial deployment of new reactor designs and advanced nuclear fuel will occur in the 2030 timeframe and to acknowledge that such a scale-up will require a significant investment in research and development funding for advanced nuclear technologies.Deep decarbonization requires action in all sectors of the world economy, not just electricity generation. As such, we urge delegates to recognize the inherent advantages of employing nuclear technology for industrial process heat, hydrogen production, district heating, and desalination.To achieve decarbonization as rapidly and efficiently as possible, governments and policymakers must implement technology-neutral, performance-based climate and energy policies that treat all carbon-free energy sources fairly and equally. Nuclear must be treated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies. Delegates should not accept anything short of fair and equal treatment for nuclear energy vis-a-vis other zero-carbon sources, as doing so would be fundamentally incompatible with global progress on climate, economic prosperity and energy security.As a recognized civil society organization with UN observer status, ANS will be on the ground in Glasgow during where we are sponsoring ten delegates from the Young Generation Network. As representatives of ANS, the pro-nuclear delegates will be attending events in the exclusive bluezone during the next two weeks. ANS's social media channels will be resharing photos, videos, and observations from our COP26 delegates who hail from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.ANS is also taking our message directly to COP26 attendees by participating in Nuclear For Climate's booth where ANS's logo and images will be on display. Our message at is clear: Carbon-free nuclear energy must be a part of our climate solution and the time to act is now. Six years on from the Paris Agreement, our world leaders need to get serious about climate change and that starts by preserving and expanding nuclear energy.Sincerely,Craig H.

Setting a new pledge to reduce emissions by 2030, launching a global initiative to rapidly cut methane, and increasing financing for developing countries are a good start.""However, more is needed to turn words into action. Given the urgency of the climate crisis, and as the largest historical emitter, the US must step up with bold climate action promises and pledges are no longer enough. We urge the Biden Administration to do everything in its power to pursue more ambitious and just emissions reductions, further scale up of finance for adaptation, and address the climate impacts already devastating vulnerable communities across the world.""In the following days at COP26, the US must work with other countries to secure a strong outcome that ratchets up emission reductions by major economies. Current pledges are still far below what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.""Back in Washington, the US must back up its global climate commitments with congressional action. Passing the Build Back Better plan offers an historic opportunity to invest in good green jobs and reduce emissions. But achieving emission reductions must go beyond investing in the green energy transition. The time has come to end the chokehold fossil fuels have on our economy by ending subsidies that allow fossil fuel companies to profit even more from climate destruction. Additionally, Congress must also make good on US global climate commitments by scaling up appropriations for international climate finance.""We are seeing the devastating impacts of the climate crisis in the US and across the world, particularly on vulnerable communities. It is code red for humanity. Ambitious climate action cannot wait.""\l"

During the panel events, representatives from the delegation presented their work and plans towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the country's NDC, or Nationally Determined Contribution. They discussed how the Government of Tajikistan and the international community could collaborate on climate-resilient development in mountain areas, taking into account four key priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and Sustainable Development Goals 11 (building sustainable communities and cities) and 13 (climate action). With the Government of Switzerland agreements for joint engagement on forestation, glacial lake monitoring, snow leopard preservation and modalities for integrated habitat and watershed assessments were finalised.Recognising the scale of the challenge and the need for closer cooperation, the five countries of Central Asia Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan came together for the first time to present a single regional position at COP26. The opening ceremony of the exhibition of Central Asian countries was held under the motto ""5 countries, 1 region, 1 vote"". During the talks in Glasgow, the countries discussed the implementation of key issues of the Paris Agreement and initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, as well as the transition to a green economy, renewable energy sources and climate-sustainable development.AKAH Tajikistan CEO Mr Hadi Husani said:""Tajikistan is among the states that have consistently pursued a strategy to reduce carbon emissions voluntarily and is interested in the world's best green practices, applying cost-effective, environmentally-friendly and socially inclusive technologies and solutions. AKAH, together with other international partners, will continue to help Tajikistan promote international environmental dialogue, exchange of information and knowledge to support science-based and climate-resilient decision-making.

COP26 is the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted and is the most significant climate event since COP21, the 2015 United Nations climate conference which resulted in the Paris Agreement. There were over 7,000 applicants for exhibition space in the Blue Zone of the conference with just 15 art/photography exhibits being selected by the organisers.The co-founders of the charity, Robert Ferguson and Sara White, travelled to Glasgow to install their exhibition last week and will return to attend the conference next month.Sara White said: 'It is a huge thrill to showcase the work of our contributors on the world's biggest stage, and to reinforce the message of 'Protect and Restore' through our art and photography collections. All 25 pieces being displayed at COP26 feature endangered species or at-risk wild spaces and provide an important visual cue, reminding us that we must take action now to limit climate change.' Activity at COP takes place in two different zones - the Blue Zone and the Green Zone. The Blue Zone is for people registered with the UN body tasked with coordinating the global response to the threat of climate change . It is here that delegates from countries meet for both formal negotiations and informal consultations. They may also take part in meetings with other delegations to clarify their position and interests with the aim of reaching agreement or overcoming a negotiating deadlock.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA281","4 Things Businesses Need to Know About COP26","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 29, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.comhttp://www.jdsupra.com The Paris Agreement approved by the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (""UNFCCC"") aims to (i) hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and (ii) pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre industrial levels. In order to achieve these goals, the nearly 200 nations that signed the Paris Agreement agreed to a framework for promoting policies and environmental actions focused on achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century. This objective of balance is often referred to as ""net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions and will be one of the main challenges that delegations representing the Parties to the Paris Agreement take up next week. Tackling that challenge, from October 31, 2021 until November 12, 2021, global leaders will gather in Glasgow, UK, for the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (""COP26"").1 We have identified four key points that businesses should be aware of ahead of the COP26 negotiations. First: Nationally Determined Contributions Nations that signed the Paris Agreement agreed to prepare, communicate and maintain Nationally Determined Contributions (""NDCs""). The NDCs are how each country decides what its contributions will be towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement's goals, including the temperature targets.2 Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, Parties are supposed to communicate updates to their NDCs every five years.3 The United States has recently updated its NDC, setting the target of reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels in 2030.4 The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, have committed themselves to a net reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990.5Many Parties have not announced updated NDCs since 2015. Given that the NDCs are the bedrock of the Paris Agreement, agreeing on enhanced NDCs is expected to be one of the more debated and closely watched topics at COP26, including when and for which timeframe the new NDCs should be adopted. During the World Leaders Summit, when about 120 government leaders willspeak at the start of COP26, we will likely see announcements from heads of state on updated NDCs and how countries plan to strengthen their commitments. Second: Paris Agreement Article 6 To ensure the operationalization of climate action, Article 6[1] of the Paris Agreement aims to incentivize international cooperation in implementing NDCs through various proposed mechanisms. One proposal concerns greenhouse gas emissions reduction or offset credit trading, a model allowing countries that are Parties to the Paris Agreement to sell unused emission reduction or offset units. Another proposal focuses on an international greenhouse gas emissions reduction or offset credit market, where private and public sector parties can trade credits. Article 6 is the only article in the Paris Agreement for which the Parties have not yet established rules, due to the complexity of its ambition. A key goal of the COP26 is finding a solution for Article 6. New rules will likely have more of an impact on countries that intend to use markets to satisfy their NDCs, and on businesses operating in those countries. Key issues that are likely to arise are accounting, certification of emissions reduction, and whether credits associated with the Kyoto Protocol market mechanism can be used under Parties Agreement Article 6. Third: Finance At the COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009, developed country Parties pledged to provide developing countries with $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020.6 The latest studies indicate this target will likely have been missed with climate funding by developed countries reaching about $80 billion in 2019.7 The United Nations has described climate finance for both mitigation and adaption to climate change as a key pillar to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement,8 and promoting an ambitious climate finance policy is one of the main goals of the UK presidency of COP26.9 In the run up to COP26, the European Commission announced it is increasing its climate finance by EUR 4 billion until 2027, up from the existing $25 billion yearly contribution by the EU and its Member States.10 President Biden also announced that the US is doubling its financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis, and that with the help of increased private capital, the goal of mobilizing $100 billion to support climate action in developing nations will be met.11 Even with increases in financing by developed countries on the horizon, negotiation points at COP26 will include how the financing must be done in practice; for example, whether it should be loan-based or in the form of grants, with the latter preferred by developing countries. There will also be debates over how to increase funding for climate change adaptation in the developing world, which currently receives less funding than climate change mitigation efforts. Fourth: Accountability and dispute resolution Since its adoption, the Paris Agreement has influenced climate change litigation in ways that cannot go unnoticed by negotiators. Climate actions have been filed not only against states but also against companies. In a series of landmark decisions, both states and companies were ordered to reduce emissions and comply with targets set out in the Paris Agreement.The Dutch Supreme Court's 2019 Urgenda v. the Netherlands decision referred to the Paris Agreement in ordering the Dutch State to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. That ruling was followed by courts in Belgium[2] and Germany[3] finding that governments in those countries had not met their obligations to implement robust climate change mitigation policies. In a recent landmark decision, the Hague District Court ordered Shell [4]to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions from its business operations and sold energy-carrying products by at least net 45% at the end of 2030, relative to 2019 levels. While the Paris Agreement did not provide a binding legal requirement in these cases, it provided the factual backdrop for judicial action and, in some cases, informed the duty of care of states and companies from which basis the courts calculated its decisions. These rulings not only put pressure on both states and companies to set emissions targets, they are also expected to accelerate negotiations during the upcoming COP26. Dispute resolution under the Paris Agreement is not likely to be a topic of debate. While Article 24 of the Paris Agreement sets the stage for negotiation and resolution of climate disputes, only a few states have made declarations to submit disputes to the International Court of Justice or arbitration. 1 The Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, which is the decision making body that oversees the Paris Agreement, will also be meeting in Glasgow. 2 UNFCCC, ""Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),"" available at: HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcshttps://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs[5]. 3 Article 4(9) of the Paris Agreement. 4 United States of America, ""Reducing Greenhouse Gases in the United States: A 2030 Emissions Target,"" April 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/United%20States%20of%20America%20First/United%20States%20NDC%20April%2021%202021%20Final.pdfhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/United%20States%20of%20America%20First/United%20States%20NDC%20April%2021%202021%20Final.pdf.[6] 5 European Union, ""Update of the NDC of the European Union and its Member States,"" December 17, 2020, available at: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdfhttps://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/climate-finance-roadmap-to-us100-billion.pdf.h-2019-data-03590fb7-en.htm: Delivering on $100 billion climate finance,"" 12 October 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/cop26-dEuropeanhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/ HYPERLINK cop26 -dEuropean eliverinon-100-billion-climate-finance/[9]; OECD, ""Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries: Aggregate Trends Updated with 2019 Data,"" 17 September 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/env/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-aggregate-trends-updated-witments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdfhttps://www.oecd.org/env/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-aggregate-trends-updated-witments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf.[10] 8 UNFCCC, ""UN Climate Chief Urges Countries to Deliver on USD 100 Billion Pledge,"" 7 June 2021, available at: https://unfccc.int/news/un-climate-chief-urges-countries-to-deliver-on-usd-100-billion-pledgehttps://unfccc.int/news/un-climate-chief-urges-countries-to-deliver-on-usd-100-billion-pledge[11]. 9 UKCOP26, ""COP26 Goals,"" available at: HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goalshttps://ukcop26.org/ HYPERLINK cop26 -goals/[12]. 10 European Commission, Press, ""Opening address by President von der Leyen at the EU Sustainable Investment Summit via videoconference"", 7 October 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_5121https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_5121[13]. 11 The White House, Briefing room, 'Remarks by President Biden Before the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,' 21 September 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/21/remarks-by-president-biden-before-the-76th-session-of-the-united-nations-general-assembly[14]/.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA283","Leverage #COP26 Twitter BETTER (fast), Climate Communicators","Learned On Women","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 05, 2021( Learned On Women: HYPERLINK http://learnedon.comhttp://learnedon.com HYPERLINK https://learnedon.com/wp-content/uploads/Influence.pngWe'rehttps://learnedon.com/wp-content/uploads/Influence.pngWe're in a climate moment, folks. If you've been thinking that your Twitter platform is not worth developing, let COP26 preparation be your mind-changer. From the real-time, rapid changes and behind the scenes finagling of decision-makers, to the unbelievable number of organizations and leaders wanting to be seen on stage or in media coverage, COP26 social engagement is about leader-to-leader signaling. Are you ready to do your influencer part? Would there be value in not wasting time on that platform this time around? Here's a call to action: You've got a few weeks. You actually can make a difference if you more intentionally approach this platform. I've been behind the scenes building climate-focused leadership platforms (for NGOs and corporate clients), using Twitter as a key tool, since COP21. I've developed Twitter handles with high value followers and no affiliated website from week one. I've helped organizations who didn't know the corporate sustainability space well, or understand how to align with global climate stories, dig right in and make their climate announcements ring. I've helped get clients on the radar of key media with just 30 days before a milestone event. (See my LinkedIn[1] recommendations.) It's very rewarding and very doable, but it's not something that can be templated. It takes a few customized tips that speak specifically to things like how you should manage your 'pinned tweet' for most impact, how to use hashtags that bridge your organization to the news topics, and how more intentional quote tweeting can earn you extra thanks and appreciative follows (among many more). How on earth can YOUR tweeting get seen in the frantic COP26 streams? I have simple strategies. I never saw it coming, but Twitter naturally aligns with my particular reading, monitoring, journalist-appreciating, cheering on and community-engaging predilections. If even a handful more leaders or organizations leverage this awareness-raising power tool in this dire climate moment, the impact would be significant. Beware: Twitter is not the same as all of your other social platforms, so, my top, perhaps counterintuitive, tip is: don't waste time on Twitter at all if you can't tend it with strategic intention. Or, you can get help. That's why I'm here - to jumpstart the smart Twitter advantage that leaders, corporations and nonprofit communications, partner development professionals can take along with them to the virtual climate action dais. To be clear: this is not about rapidly gaining bazillions of followers just because. This is about you thinking 'in a dream world, we'd be able to informally DM with this journalist, that academic, or that potential partner' and aiming for it. It's about warming connections because you know you'll have reason to activate them for all the climate events to come (and they'll only get more dire). To influence climate discussions we have to build and amplify our own climate influence (before we need it). Let's do this. Even at this late date, you'd likely highly value a bit more expertise in your approach. A 30-minute coaching session, right now, will energize, guide and jumpstart your smarter use of this tool for leader-to-leader and media relationships in ways you can put to use immediately.

Momentum, money, and measurement.Momentum.COP26 provided an important signal boost for the messages that participants were trying to get across.Momentum is also key to unlocking a crucial force for combating climate change: collective action. Efforts to reduce emissions or transform global trade networks only work if many people lock arms and agree to jump into an uncertain future together. Some activists will surely conclude that there wasn't enough collective action taken at COP26. But the public pledges made at the conference-on HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/deforestation, on HYPERLINK https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/cop26-heres-what-countries-have-pledgedmethane, on HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-declaration-on-accelerating-the-transition-to-100-zero-emission-cars-and-vans/electric vehicles-were substantial. And these public promises help create momentum for further action. After all, upon reading a declaration of intent, the next question is: how do you plan to live up to it?Efforts to reduce emissions or transform global trade networks only work if many people lock arms and agree to jump into an uncertain future together.One of the biggest commitments made at had to do with the second M: money. Take HYPERLINK https://www.gfanzero.com/GFANZ: spearheaded by former UK central banker Mark Carney, who HYPERLINK https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Mark-Carney-on-a-values-led-economyspoke to strategy+business last summer, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero brings together 450 institutions with collective assets of US$130 trillion. That's a lot. One of the noteworthy developments of the last couple of years has been the volume of capital lining up behind technologies, products, services, and goods aimed at lowering emissions. To be sure, some of these dollars-and pounds and euros-can be ascribed to the good intentions of finance leaders concerned about their public image. But GFANZ demonstrates that there's a larger, more powerful dynamic at work.With each passing year, more and more low-emissions businesses pencil out, yield profits, and find viability in competitive marketplaces, from solar power plants to electric buses. As a HYPERLINK https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/audit-assurance/corporate-reporting/esg-investor-survey.html?utm_campaign=sbpwc&utm_medium=site&utm_source=articletextrecent PwC survey foundHow do we know this? Well, it's because of the third M: measurement. There's an old saw in manufacturing that what gets measured in this world gets controlled. That speaks to efforts like tightly managing inventory and eliminating waste. When it comes to climate issues, measurement takes on a more important meaning. Measurement is one of the levers that will accelerate the energy transition that was discussed with such gravity in Glasgow, that will harness all that momentum, and that create a safe harbor for all those investor dollars. After companies, organizations, and countries make pledges to reduce emissions, both from their operations and from supply chains, they will have to measure and report those reductions accurately and carefully. Prices are one of the most familiar forms of measurement. And as HYPERLINK https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2021/pwc-global-carbon-pricing-report.html?utm_campaign=sbpwc&utm_medium=site&utm_source=articletexta joint PwC/World Economic Forum report, released on the eve of Glasgow, found, establishing an (acronym alert) ICPF, which stands for an International Carbon Price Floor, could spur emissions reductions.\~As we look ahead, our responsibility-as consumers, businesspeople, and leaders-to measure our own progress will grow, and fast.

The new index \'e2\â‚¬ developed by the Insurance Development Forum \'e2\â‚¬ will help insurers, lenders and investors measure the climate resilience of countries, companies and supply chains. The coalition behind the initiative aims to provide data using metrics that are based on insurance risk modeling principles. ""It is imperative that it is clear which financial flows and investments are Paris-aligned. Without this, we will not achieve the net-zero transition needed for 1.5\'c2\'b0,"" said UN Climate Envoy Mark Carney, who supports the GRII. ""GRII can play an important role by creating a shared understanding of mounting physical climate risks. In turn, this will help close the insurance protection gap and direct investment and aid to where they are needed the most."" Clean Energy Fund The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Allianz Global Investors plan to raise \'e2\Â£c500 million for a new fund that will support climate mitigation, climate adaptation and access to electricity in developing countries. The Emerging Market Climate Action Fund (EMCAF) will be a ""fund-of-funds"" that will invest in other climate-focused funds and clean energy projects. The initiative is supported by the governments of Germany and Luxembourg, the Nordic Development Fund and Swedish insurer Folksam. Launched at COP26, the fund plans to mobilize substantial amounts of private capital to get projects off the ground in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. EMCAF will invest in specialized funds that support renewable energy projects such as onshore solar and wind, domestic and industrial energy efficiency, and adapting cities' infrastructure to make it more resilient. As EMCAF's investment adviser, the EIB will be responsible for identifying and appraising potential investments, while Allianz will manage the fund. AXA Tightens Up Oil Investment Policy French insurer AXA has tightened up its investment policy for the oil and gas sector announcing at COP26 on Monday that it will divest investment in ""climate laggards"" after three years if they are not making sufficient progress toward net-zero emissions. From 2022, AXA will apply a ""stronger climate lens"" to its investment criteria, using a science-based framework for the oil and gas sector that it plans to release this year. It will monitor actions taken by companies until 2025 and then decide if they should remain in its portfolio. ""If we don't see progress and strong commitments from companies, we need to be \'e2\â‚¬ \Â£6 ready to divest,"" said AXA Investment Managers Executive Chairman Marco Morelli. ""We must give companies the time to adjust but we must also adopt a no-compromise approach with investee companies that don\'e2\â‚¬  t take climate change seriously."" Starting in early 2022, AXA's portfolio will exclude companies for which oil sands represent over 5% of total production. It will divest from companies that derive over 10% of production from the Arctic region and exclude small players with over 30% of their production derived from shale/fracking. AXA also plans to exit all coal investments in OECD countries by 2030 and in the rest of the world by 2040.Staff Reports\l"

The 151 new national climate commitments submitted ahead of and during COP26 fell short of putting the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 C. But after two weeks of negotiations, delegates reached consensus that countries should further strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets next year, deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts.Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO, World Resources Institute:""In a year marked by uncertainty and mistrust, COP26 affirmed the importance of collective global action to address the climate crisis. While we are not yet on track, the progress made over the last year and at the COP26 summit offered bright spots and a strong foundation to build upon. The real test now is whether countries accelerate their efforts and turn commitments into action.""Negotiators found common ground on key issues, including agreeing to further strengthen 2030 targets in order to keep the 1.5 C goal within reach, step up and accelerate financial support to developing countries, establish a dedicated space to finally address permanent losses and damages from climate impacts, and finalize rules to implement the Paris Agreement. A particular bright spot at COP26 was how effective vulnerable countries, youth and climate campaigners were in demanding greater action and accountability. And for the first time, negotiators explicitly agreed to accelerate action to phase down unabated coal power and phase-out fossil fuel subsidies - an important step forward.""A number of major emitters have weak 2030 plans and will need to put forward more aggressive targets to drive down emissions this decade. Encouragingly, countries agreed to come back next year to submit stronger 2030 targets and to put forward long term strategies that aim towards a just transition to net zero by around mid-century.

Setting a new pledge to reduce emissions by 2030, launching a global initiative to rapidly cut methane, and increasing financing for developing countries are a good start.""However, more is needed to turn words into action. Given the urgency of the climate crisis, and as the largest historical emitter, the US must step up with bold climate action - promises and pledges are no longer enough. We urge the Biden Administration to do everything in its power to pursue more ambitious and just emissions reductions, further scale up of finance for adaptation, and address the climate impacts already devastating vulnerable communities across the world.""In the following days at COP26, the US must work with other countries to secure a strong outcome that ratchets up emission reductions by major economies. Current pledges are still far below what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.""Back in Washington, the US must back up its global climate commitments with congressional action. Passing the Build Back Better plan offers an historic opportunity to invest in good green jobs and reduce emissions. But achieving emission reductions must go beyond investing in the green energy transition. The time has come to end the chokehold fossil fuels have on our economy by ending subsidies that allow fossil fuel companies to profit even more from climate destruction. Additionally, Congress must also make good on US global climate commitments by scaling up appropriations for international climate finance.""We are seeing the devastating impacts of the climate crisis in the US and across the world, particularly on vulnerable communities.

Despite new and updated emissions pledges, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees C average temperature rise, far beyond the goal of remaining below 1.5 degrees C.Climate finance and vital support for adaptation remains a critical sticking point for the ongoing negotiations. It is a terrible symbol of neglect that the original pledge for developing countries of $100 billion in climate finance by 2020 will not be met until the end of 2022. Climate finance for adaptation to least-developed countries currently stands at $15 billion per year, out of the $80 billion in climate finance currently mobilized. This is a fraction of what is needed for people living with the climate crisis now. The IRC welcomes new pledges for climate adaptation made at COP26, including President Biden's $3 billion in adaptation finance annually until 2024 and the EU's pledge of $100 million to the COP26 adaptation fund, which raised over $350 million in total at COP26. The UN however estimates that $300 billion will be needed by 2030 for climate adaptation alone.The IRC is warning that the massive financial void will leave vulnerable, specially fragile and conflict-affected countries, with little support. These are places where climate change is already an extreme and everyday reality: Drought across 80% of Afghanistan is driving acute hunger and food insecurity; In Ethiopia, already one of the sites of the devastating 2012 famine in the Horn of Africa and an unprecedented locust outbreak last year, 11 million people are already facing crisis levels of food insecurity as conflict rages in the Tigray region. Last year, we witnessed over 1.4 million people displaced in Northern Central America due to the deadly combination of ongoing conflict and multiple natural disasters.The impact is already being felt as rising temperatures, drought and extreme weather conditions contribute to food shortages and spiralling hunger. Women and girls are suffering the most from climate change. The UK's COP26 Presidency signalled a commitment to women and girls by launching new, dedicated funding to advance gender equality in climate action, however its scale and geographical reach is too limited to meet the global challenge; commitments to support women and girls disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis must not end here.David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said:""COP26 needs to remember the poorest and most vulnerable in its final hours. This was billed as a critical moment for the international community to come together and make much-needed progress in tackling the climate crisis before it's too late. But for IRC's clients around the world already facing emergency climate conditions, time has already run out. In these critical final hours of negotiations, global leaders must keep the devastating implications for the lives of the most vulnerable people at the forefront of their minds - and ensure they are made part of the final agreement.""It is crucial that both tests set at this year's conference are met: to prevent the catastrophic breach of 1.5 degrees C rise in temperature, and step up to help the most at-risk communities adapt to the climate change already underway.""The US-China agreement for further cooperation is significant, a sign that the shared dangers of the climate crisis cannot be ignored. But the impact of the existential threat posed by climate change is spread unevenly - and thus far, vulnerable populations are being all but assured that they will continue to bear the brunt. With climate finance and adaptation funding woefully insufficient, large swathes of the global population will be left defenseless against a problem they did not cause.""The climate crisis speaks to a gross mismanagement of the global commons and a collective failure by countries to live up to their responsibilities. The great injustice is that these failures will be felt most deeply by people already mired in humanitarian catastrophe, and who contributed the least. The world, especially the world's most vulnerable, cannot afford for these negotiations to fail.""[Category: International]Contact: Hope Arcuri, 336/813-4673, HYPERLINK mailto:hope.arcuri@rescue.orghope.arcuri@rescue.org; Kim Nelson, HYPERLINK mailto:kim.nelson@rescue-uk.orgkim.nelson@rescue-uk.orgCopyright Targeted News ServicesMSTRUCK-7665874 MSTRUCK\l"

The offending quartet - Volkswagen, Toyota, the Renault-Nissan alliance, and Hyundai-Kia - have not showed their support to the pledge which is to be announced at COP26 today, despite months of pressure from the UK. By signing the agreement, the signatories have pledged to end the sale of new cars that produce emissions in 'leading markets' by 2035, and globally by 2040. Hundreds of city and regional authorities have signed the deal which covers a quarter of the world's cars and is backed by manufacturers including Daimler, Ford, General Motors and China's BYD, as well as governments including Canada and Chile. China, the world's largest car market, did not sign, while the US, the second largest, was also absent from the agreement by Tuesday evening. However, individual states including California, New York and Washington backed the deal, as well as cities such as Dallas, Charleston, Atlanta and Seattle. So Paulo in Brazil and Buenos Aires in Argentina have also signed the pledge. LeasePlan, the world's largest car leasing company, has also signed the agreement, while Uber has also joined, committing to make its entire fleet zero emission by 2030. Ola Kallenius, Daimler chair, told the Financial Times: 'Each company has to make their own choice, but all the colleagues I know are all moving forwards at a very fast pace. 'There are very few countries putting as much money, resources or brain power into the transformation than the German auto industry.' Mercedes-Benz has already committed to selling only electric cars by 2035 where feasible, and will only launch battery models after 2025, which means backing the deal will cost it very little.

She urged them to act ""for our children and our children's children"" and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen added she took ""great pride"" in how her ""dear late husband"" Prince Philip promoted environmental issues. The 95-year-old monarch had been scheduled to attend the United Nations conference in Glasgow. But she pre-recorded her address last week at Windsor Castle after being advised to rest following medical checks.

She referred to his warning at a 1969 academic gathering of the dangers of failing to address pollution. The Queen said: ""It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William. ""I could not be more proud of them."" She mentions how the environment was a subject close to the heart of ""my dear late husband"" Prince Philip and says she ""could not be more proud"" that it was an interest sustained by her son Charles and grandson William. She also seems to make reference to her own mortality: ""None of us will live forever."" But there is also the authoritative voice of someone looking back after almost 70 years as head of state, telling world leaders to take the long view and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen says ""statesmanship"" means serving the future rather than short-term political rewards. She might be on the video screen but she was telling world leaders to focus on the big picture. The Queen said she also drew ""great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages - especially the young - in calling for everyone to play their part"". She said: ""In the coming days, the world has the chance to join in the shared objective of creating a safer, stabler future for our people and for the planet on which we depend.

She added: ""It is the hope of many that the legacy of this summit - written in history books yet to be printed - will describe you as the leaders who did not pass up the opportunity; and that you answered the call of those future generations. ""That you left this conference as a community of nations with a determination, a desire, and a plan, to address the impact of climate change; and to recognise that the time for words has now moved to the time for action. ""Of course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. ""But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps."" Ahead of COP26, the Queen was overheard appearing to suggest she was irritated[14] by people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"", when it comes to climate issues. Prince Charles told COP26 earlier that a ""war-like footing"" is needed to tackle the climate Addressing the opening of the conference earlier in the day, the Prince of Wales urged world leaders into action, saying he understood that many countries could not afford to ""go green"". Instead, he said, there needs to be a ""vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector"", which had trillions of dollars at its disposal. ""The scale and scope of the threat we face call for a global, systems-level solution, based on radically transforming our current fossil fuel-based economy to one that is genuinely renewable and sustainable,"" he said.

Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!"" echoed throughout central Glasgow on Friday as thousands of protesters took the streets during the dedicated ""Youth Day"" at COP26.From small children waving their handmade picket signs, to older adults demanding a better future for those that will come after them, the COP26 host city saw citizen activists in unprecedented numbers rallying to get their message heard.An even larger march is expected on Saturday.Young climate activists take part in demonstrations at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland.Welsh citizen Jane Mansfield carried around a sign that read: ""Code red for humanity"", the signature phrase UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres used after the latest IPCC report published earlier this year warned of a looming climate catastrophe.""I really care about the world that we are passing on to future generations, and what we are doing to the Global South. I live in southwest Wales and climate change is clearly happening, but we dont even grasp what is happening in so many other parts of the world and I am scared,"" she told UN News.Latin-American Indigenous leaders were also among today's demonstrations. They were the ones leading the march and several of them sent a loud message to world leaders: stop extracting resources and to 'leave carbon in the ground'.""Indigenous people are dying in the river; they're being washed away by massive floods. Houses are being washed away, schools full of children inside, bridges, our food our crops, everything is being washed away"", they said at a stage in George Square.""Act now so that we still have a future to live in.""While the World Leaders Summit took place in the Blue Zone this week, we asked visitors to our Green Zone what their message was for global leaders across the river.The youth have spoken.

This is an active choice by the leaders to continue the exploitation of nature and people and the destruction of presents and future living conditions to take place"", she said, calling the conference a ""greenwashing event"".Other Fridays for Future members, speaking to UN News, asked for more participation and better youth representation in the negotiations that are underway at COP26.""Every year we have been disappointed by COP, and I don't think this year will be different. There is a sliver of hope but at the same time we don't see enough action, we can't achieve anything with just pledges and empty promises"", said a representative of Youth Advocates for Climate Change in the Philippines""Negotiations are happening and yet we are here in the street, because we haven't been included. The richest people come in their private jets and take the decisions. We are here and we won't be ignored. We will make our own space"", another climate advocate added.The Youth StatementThe same call was made inside the conference's Blue Zone, where climate activists from YOUNGO, the Children and Youth Constituency of UN Climate Change, delivered to the COP Presidency and other leaders a statement signed by 40,000 young people demanding change.The statement raised several points of concern, among them inclusion in climate negotiations. It also asked Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to support young people's efforts to have a paragraph mentioning the importance of the youth included in the final declaration that is expected to be adopted at the end of COP26.The statement, which was handed over to Ministers, also asks for action on climate finance, mobility and transportation, wildlife protection and environmental conservation.""Wherever I have been in the world, I have been struck by the passion and the commitment of young people to climate action. The voices of young people must be heard and reflected in these negotiations here at COP. The actions and scrutiny of young people are key to us keeping 1.5 alive and creating a net-zero future"", said Alok Sharma, COP26 President.Meanwhile, the UK and Italy, in partnership with UNESCO, Youth4Climate and Mock COP coordinated new global action to equip future generations with the knowledge and skills to create a net-zero world.As Education Ministers and young people gathered, over 23 countries put forward national climate education pledges, ranging from decarbonizing the education sector to developing school resources.UN News/Laura QuionesActivist dressed as dinosaur character takes part in demonstrations at the Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland.The youth are right: the new commitments aren't enoughThe UNFCCC published its latest updates of the national commitments thus far to reduce carbon emissions, and although some advances have been made during the conference, they are still not enough. ""A sizable increase, of about 13.7 per cent, in global greenhouse emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 is anticipated"", the report says.Before COP, the increase was calculated at 16 per cent, but for the world to be able to curb global heating and avoid disastrous consequences, emissions must be cut by 50 per cent in the next nine years.For Carla Huanca, a young activist who travelled all the way from Bolivia to be in Glasgow with her friend, the dinosaur ""T-Resilient"", another extinction can't be a possibility.""We young people will be the ones that will inherit this planet, and that is why it is so important that our voices are heard.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA311","OUTCOME OF THE UN COP26 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","November 22, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Government of Sweden:The UN COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow has ended. The main successes of the conference were that countries were encouraged to sharpen their climate goals as early as next year, double support for adaptation to climate change by 2025 and that the role of fossil fuels in climate transition was mentioned for the first time.Both before and during the conference, much revolved around the need for increased ambitions in global climate work and the gap between the countries current commitments and the Paris Agreements 1.5 degrees Celsius target. The commitments made by the countries are decided at national level and are therefore not subject to negotiation. However, the overarching decision of the meeting contains wording on the phasing out of subsidies for coal and fossil fuels, more ambitious commitments on the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, the importance of a just transition, human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples. The parties are now also encouraged to ensure meaningful and inclusive participation of young people.Limiting heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require a lot of us, but the decision we have taken in Glasgow lays the foundations for making it possible. Over these past two weeks, the countries of the world have shown that they can agree on even the most difficult climate decisions and take major steps forward. This will not be enough, but it will speed up the pace of climate efforts and give us much greater opportunities to counter the climate crisis, says Minister for Environment and Climate Per Bolund.During COP26Climate financeOne of the conferences major negotiation issues has concerned climate finance, i.e support for emission reductions and climate change adaptation in developing countries, and the commitment to mobilise USD 100 billion per year from 2020 to 2025. This is important to enable climate transition in developing countries and enable them to raise the level of ambition in their climate action. The UK Presidency gave Per Bolund, together with his Egyptian colleague Dr Yasmine Fouad, the task of leading the negotiations on climate finance. Together, they proposed, among other things, doubling the support for climate adaptation by 2025, which was requested by those most affected by climate change, and was also part of the final decision.Climate change is already doing enormous damage in many places and is making life more difficult for millions of people. The message were sending from the conference is clear: support for climate adaptation will double by 2025. This will make a big difference to all those people who would otherwise have been hit hardest by the climate crisis, says Minister for Environment and Climate Per Bolund.The conference also decided how the process for a new joint financing goal should be designed. A decision on such a goal is expected in 2024.International cooperation and emissions tradingA sticking point has been the rules for how countries are to report their emissions. For Sweden and several other countries it has been important that all countries report their emissions in an equivalent way and that certain countries not be exempt from certain reporting requirements. The rules now agreed require all countries to report in such a way that their emission figures can be transparently reviewed.Common timeframesAt COP26Loss and damageThe conference has also agreed on functions for the Santiago network and a process for deciding on the structure and financing of COP27. The aim is to strengthen technical assistance to the most vulnerable developing countries in order to identify and access solutions to counter loss and damage from climate change. The conference also agreed on a dialogue to discuss financing arrangements to counter, prevent and address damage and losses from climate change.InitiativesIn connection with COP26, a high-level meeting was also held in the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, which was launched by Sweden and India in 2019 to drive the climate transition in heavy industry. The meeting gathered ministers and business leaders who agreed to develop road maps to achieve net-zero emissions in heavy industry.During COP26\l"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA314","COP26 REVIEW: GLASS HALF FULL?","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change:Tim Lord Phil McNallyIntroductionAfter two years of waiting and two weeks of intense negotiations, COP26 has finally drawn to a close and Glaswegians have their city back.But how did the conference perform? Is 1.5 still alive? And do we now have reason to be optimistic on climate change?COP26 cannot, and should not, be measured in absolutes. Some may have hoped for a sudden leap in ambition to set the world on track for the goals of the Paris Agreement. But considering the whole economy reorientation required for net zero and the relatively limited negotiating mandates of the delegates involved in a COP, it was perhaps wishful thinking to expect transformation rather than incremental improvement.In truth, Glasgow was far from being a failure on the scale of Copenhagen but neither was it a transformational success comparable to Paris. Progress was made perhaps more than might have been expected but not enough to satisfy the science on climate change.So how do the agreements of the past fortnight measure up? And where do we go next on climate change?A success with limitations, or a failure with some bright points? Success or Failure?In our July paper, we set out four ways the UK, and the world, could ensure that COP26 was viewed as a success. So, it's worth taking a moment to judge performance against those metrics.First, we called for raised ambition backed by credible delivery plans. On this point, it makes sense to take the long-term view. At the time of Paris, the world was on track for 4 degrees of warming. At the time of the last COP, in Madrid in 2019, only 16 per cent of global GDP was covered by a national net-zero target. As COP26 drew to a close, warming of under 2 degrees is potentially in reach, and almost 90 per cent of global emissions are now covered by a net-zero target. This is real progress and was supported in Glasgow by increased long-term ambition in particular, by India coming forward with a net-zero target for 2070.But while the long-term targets are cause for qualified optimism, there was less progress on the crucial issue of cutting emissions in the short term. Net-zero targets provide important long-term direction but the cumulative nature of climate change means that the rate at which we get there, and in particular the actions we take in the next ten years, are crucial.As Figure 1 below shows, the pathway to 1.5C would have been far more manageable if the world had taken sustained action at an earlier point. But the steep increase in annual emissions since 1990 means that the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C has been depleted and the pathway is now much steeper. It's for this reason that a focus on near-term emission reductions is more important than long-term goals, and that is why nations' 2030 ambitions and plans also known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are so core to the COP framework.Figure 1:Source: HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reachhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reachTo stay on track for the objective of keeping warming under 1.5C, we need to cut global annual emissions by roughly 45 per cent by 2030. If we add up all the emission savings from updates to NDCs as well as the sector deals agreed in Glasgow, that delivers a reduction in 2030 emissions of around 5.5 to 6.9 GtCO2e, or 11 to 14 per cent below current levels. This doesn't look good for the UK's primary objective for COP26 to ""keep 1.5 alive"".Figure 2:Source: HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1002/CAT_2021-11-11_Briefing_GlasgowSectorInitiatives.pdfhttps://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1002/CAT_2021-11-11_Briefing_GlasgowSectorInitiatives.pdfGiven the lack of willingness from key countries to strengthen their 2030 targets, it is important that the final text of the Glasgow Climate Pact offers a lifel"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA315","Q&A on COP26: Carlson School's Susanna Gibbons Reflects","November 19, 2021 Friday 9:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSOps) -- The University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management issued the following Q&A with Susanna Gibbons, managing director of the Carlson Funds Enterprise on Nov. 17, 2021:This month world leaders met at the United Nations climate conference, COP26, to negotiate a deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impacts of global warming.Susanna Gibbons, the managing director of the Carlson Funds Enterprise, was among the University of Minnesota delegation that attended the historic conference in Scotland. She shares her insight from the conference and her views as an investment professional on how policymakers and financial leaders can unite to meet the climate targets.Q: At the conference, the term ""sustainable finance"" or ""green finance"" was often used. What does it mean?One of the issues that I encountered at COP26 is that policymakers and investment professionals are using the term ""sustainable finance"" to mean two different things. For policymakers, it is really just a question of funding: How do we get funding for the many different initiatives which will drive the necessary emission reductions? For investment professionals, the question involves expectations of risk and return surrounding those needed investments. I think that has been one of the key holdups in driving investment.My own view is that sustainable finance is about pricing the negative externalities that accompany any sort of environmental impact, whether it is around carbon emissions, water pollution, or species loss. A negative externality occurs when an entity engages in an activity that causes some harm to others. Negative externalities are really difficult to price because the effects are usually broadly distributed, and they accumulate over time.Q: In terms of carbon emissions, leaders at COP26 finalized ""Article 6,"" which determined the rules for international trade of emission reduction units. How does this resonate with your view of sustainable finance?The agreements appear to move in the direction of pricing those negative externalities. The accounting guidance in particular--allowing an emission reduction project in the U.S. to generate credits that can be purchased by a company operating in Europe--will help provide incentive to a number of important projects. However, the carbon trading agreements alone won't solve everything.Businesses need to make decisions not just on whether they are required to price external consequences today, but on how those impacts may be felt across time. We have seen time and again--whether it is with asbestos or tobacco--businesses that do not anticipate shifts in society's willingness to accept the consequences will ultimately lose. If prices do not accurately capture some of the significant effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change, then the markets will ultimately fail. Carbon markets are moving in the right direction, but most participants do not feel they fully capture the true cost of greenhouse gas emissions.Successful markets need to be guided by good public policy, and climate change is one of those areas where unpriced externalities are leading to global systematic failure. In order for markets to channel sustainable finance, we must price those costs appropriately.Q: How can Minnesota businesses incorporate more ways to combat climate change?I think Minnesota is incredibly well positioned to start developing solutions to climate change, but it will require a significant amount of collaboration--particularly among people who do not always agree.For example, Minnesota's agricultural industry is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Simply imposing mandates is not the solution. Instead, it could involve providing regulatory frameworks like the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which creates an economic incentive for capturing the methane lost through waste products. This in turn allows for cost-sharing so that the farming community doesn't shoulder the financial burden of the transition to a lower carbon system. The systemic shift would also require investing in biogas distribution systems and continued public funding in electric vehicle charging stations.The key is to get these separate systems--private agriculture, private finance, municipal waste and sewage, municipal finance, electric and gas utilities--to all move together toward a zero carbon future. The solutions require a degree of coordination and cooperation across systems which I think has rarely been attempted, but which I think Minnesotans are stoic enough to undertake.Q: What did you learn at the conference that gives you hope?Climate change messaging should really be about one of excitement over where we could be heading rather than despair over where we currently are heading.One of the things that impressed me the most at COP26 was the extent of technological innovation that is already available and poised to deliver on our promise of limiting global warming to a threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Business plays a critical role in bringing these technologies to market--there is no solution to climate change that does not involve the business community.I also see hope from our world's youth. Young people--not just in our delegation--were clearly frustrated with the slow pace of progress to date, but I think they are forcing the world to take notice and respond; to try and deliver a better world than the one they were born into.Q: Ultimately, what should people take away from the actions made at COP26?The clear message from COP26 was that it is time to act.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA316","EPRI CEO: COP26 Agreement 'Solidifies Global March Towards Decarbonization'","November 14, 2021 Sunday 9:28 AM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire On Saturday, world leaders from nearly 200 countries came to an agreement at COP26, increasing national ambitions to reduce near-term emissions, reiterating the long-term aim of 1.5C warming that entails net-zero targets around mid-century, and increasing the climate change focus on adaption and resilience. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) CEO Arshad Mansoor, who was in attendance at COP26, had the following statement:""This agreement solidifies the global march towards decarbonization. It will take collaboration in technology and institutional innovation by countries around the world to reach both the near- and long-term goals. Cleaner electricity,accelerated electrificationand the deployment of cleaner energy resources and fuels will play a critical role in all countries.""In particular, numerous sectors of the economy including transportation, buildings, and industry stand to achieve large carbon emissions reductions through increased energy efficiency, broader electrification, and the deployment of zero andlow carbon fuels. Through collaborative research and development with public and private stakeholders, we are developing a broad suite of clean electric generation, storage, grid, and end-use technologies that will help countries decarbonize their electric sectors and reduce emissions across their economies. This will enable countries to choose what works best to meet those needs, while keeping electricity accessible, affordable, and reliable for all consumers.""For the United States, an EPRI analysis issued earlier this week finds that carbon reductions across all sectors of the U.S. economy through cleaner energy, increased energy efficiency, and accelerated electrification will be crucial to achieving the 2030 U.S. climate goal. Accelerated electrification will help to lower emissions from transportation, buildings, and industry, while reducing overall energy costs for many consumers. A copy of EPRI's analysis is availablehere.In the longer-term, meeting national and global net-zero goals entails developing an array of technology options that are not commercial at scale today, including carbon capture utilization and storage, advanced nuclear, low-carbon fuels, and advanced electric end-uses. EPRI is working with its research partners on these technologies, engaging in a number of collaborative global clean energy initiatives, including itsLow-Carbon Resources InitiativesandEfficient Electrification Initiative.\~Additionally, EPRI continues its work on resilience, adaption, and equity issues, which spans the organization's entire research portfolio.About EPRIFounded in 1972, EPRI is the world's preeminent independent, non-profit energy research and development organization, with offices around the world. EPRI's trusted experts collaborate with more than 450 companies in 45 countries, driving innovation to ensure the public has clean, safe, reliable, affordable, and equitable access to electricity across the globe.

To have a chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C, emissions of greenhouse gases must halve by 2030 and reach 'net zero' by 2050. Every additional increment of warming escalates the risks to people, ecosystems and communities.National emission reduction targets submitted in 2015 were not ambitious enough to keep the rise in the global average temperature to 'well below' 2C, let alone 1.5C. And across the world, countries are grappling with increasingly severe and more frequent climate change impacts. COP26 needs to be a turning point. For a positive outcome in Glasgow substantial progress is needed in three main areas: in raising the ambition of countries' 2030 nationally determined contributions (NDCs); on providing support for climate-vulnerable developing countries; and on agreeing the remaining details of the 'Paris Rulebook'.\l"

""It is the way in which we have to address the issues. It's problem solving and listening to all voices."" Robinson, who also served as the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Change from 2014 to 2015, delivered the keynote speech on the climate crisis and ecological hospitality during the conference, which also included panel discussions and art performances.When discussing how to address the climate crisis, Robinson said it is important to integrate the stories and perspectives of those who are most affected.""I came to understand that we weren't able to grasp the climate story because of the way we were learning,"" Robinson said. ""We have to move to storytelling.""Robinson said climate change causes major injustices, especially in the developing world, which is already suffering from generations of poverty and other social issues.""I learned that [climate change] was impacting African countries far more,"" Robinson said. ""Then I learned that small island states, Indigenous peoples, and the poorest parts of richer countries were also suffering, and they were the least responsible for [the climate crisis].""As the first female president of Ireland, Robinson, elected in 1990, spoke extensively about gender inequality around the world and how the climate crisis is advancing this inequality.""Eighty percent of the food in the developing world is produced by women, yet they own much less of the land and get much less access to credit,"" Robinson said.Robinson said her role in the male-dominated world of politics inspired her passion for bringing women leaders together to address the climate crisis.Robinson also said her experience as the U.N. Special Envoy for Climate Change helped her recognize the full extent of the climate crisis and its effects.""[The scientists] made it clear that in that time, bad things will probably happen,"" Robinson said. ""First of all, the coral reefs will probably disappear entirely. Secondly, the Arctic ice will disappear and the permafrost will melt. Permafrost is very substantial.""Even with these dire predictions, Robinson said there were significant achievements at COP26-the U.N.'s annual climate change conference where participants pledged to reduce their contributions to global warming.""The interesting thing-which is positive about COP26 despite the fact that the [countries'] pledges are not enough and we're not on target yet-is that everybody was talking the language of aligning with the 1.5 degrees celsius and that's really important,"" Robinson said.According to Robinson, there is an international goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Even a slightly higher temperature, Robinson said, could have serious consequences.""The most significant step that was taken [to limit global warming] was done because of pressure from climate justice,"" Robinson said. ""Pressure from the small island states, Indigenous people, and young people, who marched in the street in Paris. The mantra was '1.5 to stay alive.'""Robinson concluded her talk by encouraging people to change how they think about the climate crisis.""Imagine the world we need to be hurrying towards,"" Robinson said.

""Glasgow has a serious credibility gap.""""We know that the window to keep 1.5 degrees alive is closing but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that it is still achievable,"" a COP26 spokesperson said in a statement. ""As today's reports make clear, we've seen genuine progress in the first week of COP26, but we have a lot more to do. We need to be serious about both ambition and action this decade and that is why as COP26 Presidency, we are pushing hard through negotiations this week to build on progress to keep 1.5 degrees in reach.""Delegates from around the world are gathering at COP26 to attempt to limit the climate crisis. While there were several breakthroughs in the first week of negotiations, experts warned the deals may not meet the urgency of the moment -- specifically, that they won't bring the world closer to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.""There's a lot of big statements, which don't have the details underneath: exactly when, how much, who's going to do what,"" said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics with the World Resources Institute.More than 130 countries that represent more than 85% of the planet's forests HYPERLINK http://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/world/cop26-climate-deforestation-deal-intl/index.htmlpledged last week to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030, in what was seen as the first big deal of the COP26 summit. When destroyed, forests can emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The agreement included some of the world largest carbon stocks locked away in tropical forests.In another breakthrough, more than 25 countries have so far signed on to an agreement to HYPERLINK http://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/world/countries-agree-to-end-fossil-fuel-financing-abroad-cop26-climate/index.htmlstop financing fossil fuel projects abroad. But critics say it doesn't go far enough and should include financing for fossil fuel projects at home, not just internationally.Christine Shearer, the program director for coal at Global Energy Monitor, called the deal ""a game changer,"" but stressed that fossil fuel projects must be stopped within these countries' own borders, too.Under current policies -- not proposals, but rather what countries are actually doing -- CAT projects global temperatures to climb to 2.7 degrees.If all net-zero pledges are fully implemented, CAT reported the most optimistic scenario would be warming of 1.8 degrees, which would require bold and rapid action by 2030. Still, countries' climate targets for 2030 remain inadequate, according to the analysis. CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report. TM & \Â£9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The UN climate talks , which kick off Oct. 31, will see broader consensus than ever before on the need for urgent climate action, even if divisions still persist on the pace of change and who foots the bill. In formal \'e2\â‚¬  conference of the parties\'e2\â‚¬ business, there are some critical decisions to be taken on important details like accounting and carbon trading. Glasgow is also the first test of the five-year ratchet and review mechanism agreed in Paris, with all countries asked to submit ambitious new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to get to net zero by midcentury. COP26 is about more than just the official negotiations though; what happens alongside is important too in building and sustaining momentum for subnational actors, businesses and civil society groups. What happens around the COP, in preparation, is also critical in building momentum. So far, 147 countries representing 57% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have communicated new or updated NDCs. This still leaves the world on track for a temperature rise of at least 2.7\'c2\'b0C this century, according to a new report this week from the UN Environment Program (UNEP). That report offered another glimmer of hope, however, suggesting that net-zero pledges made so far could make a big difference. If fully implemented, they could limit the predicted global temperature rise to 2.2\'c2\'b0C. While many of these have been in big consumers like the US and EU, producers have also been stepping up , with this week\'e2\â‚¬  s net-zero pledges from Saudi Arabia \'e2\â‚¬ following Russia, the United Arab Emirates and others \'e2\â‚¬ representing a major symbolic shift, confirming net zero as essential industry requirement. These signal acceptance that the energy system will see far-reaching change over the coming decades. Oil and gas production is still however central to future plans, highlighting differing views on how fast or by what means the world should move to midcentury net-zero goals. The world\'e2\â‚¬  s current energy crunch has significantly shifted the rhetoric of the discussion heading into COP but it's not clear that it has changed the trajectory or the pace of the transition. Major producing countries and Western oil majors point out that oil and gas will be needed for decades and investment in capacity is critical as demand continues to grow. Consuming nations are keen to mitigate current prices and secure near-term supplies. But they have not backed off decarbonization targets and ambitious goals for low-carbon fuels like hydrogen. China has increased coal production quotas for this year but also unveiled plans to cap its oil refining capacity, with no net increase allowed after 2025. India\'e2\â‚¬  s oil and gas demand are expected to continue growing for the next two decades, and under some BP scenarios the country accounts for 90% of energy growth, CEO Bernard Looney said. But India is also keen to develop renewable and hydrogen sectors that can cut into costly oil and gas imports. Pledges by countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia as well as large oil companies to reach net-zero emissions show that producers understand the need for a place at the climate table, even if they differ on the path to achieve net zero. While Glasgow's focus is broader than just the energy transition, there are a few specific areas that could impact the industry. With NDCs still falling short of what\'e2\â‚¬  s needed, the UK, as COP26 president-designate, is preparing an agreement to deliver some short-term measures to help keep 1.5\'c2\'b0C in reach. Phasing out unabated coal power is one priority. There are calls too for COP26 to help tackle methane emissions from fossil fuel production. Agreement on Article 6, which covers cooperative approaches including carbon trading, could also provide a more solid basis for carbon pricing, emissions trading linkages and perhaps oil companies\'e2\â‚¬  offsetting plans. But this has proved one of the most difficult parts of the Paris accord to push over the finish l"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA329","COP26 Roundup: Methane, Carbon Pricing, Coal","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","International Oil Daily","Methane Emissions Methane emissions were high on the agenda on the second day of the COP26 conference, with the US and the EU formally launching the Global Methane Pledge they first unveiled in September. Signatories to this agreement have committed to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Over 100 countries have now signed up, US President Joe Biden told a COP26 event. The US has also announced steps it will take at home to implement the agreement. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted that Brussels will also launch new methane regulations next month. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said he is fully committed to ""doing the hard work"" at home to develop and implement a plan to slash methane emissions. He said that Canada was going beyond the requirement of the Global Methane Pledge by committing to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by at least 75% by 2030. Carbon Pricing and Article 6 Negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were due to begin in earnest on Wednesday \'e2\â‚¬ after the conclusion of the two-day leaders' segment of COP26 on Tuesday. But a leaders' roundtable on carbon pricing touched on some of the key issues involved. Von der Leyen said that Europe had showed carbon pricing can work and that it hopes this will be adopted more widely. This would be preferable, she said, to the carbon border adjustment mechanism Europe has proposed as an alternative to prevent ""carbon leakage."" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also spoke of the importance of setting a minimum global carbon price, which World Trade Organization Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala agreed would be less of a headache than carbon border levies, which developing countries in particular are afraid of. Green Grids World leaders have backed a new Green Grid Initiative that supports a massive increase in the transmission and distribution of renewable electricity generated by solar and wind power. The scheme aims to address the mismatch between renewable power and the global grid network that is currently ill-equipped to transmit green electricity to consumers and communities that need it most. The idea is to build a global power network across time zones and borders that can bring hydropower, solar and wind-generated electricity from the best locations, such as wet, mountainous countries, deserts and windy oceans, to demand hotspots that currently rely on fossil fuels. The project is backed by the US, India, the UK and France, as well as countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Clean Tech Boost Over 40 world leaders signed up to a new Breakthrough Agenda, including the US, India, the EU, China, and other developing economies. The aim is to make clean technologies the most affordable, accessible and attractive choice around the world in each of the most polluting sectors by 2030. The plan will see countries and businesses work closely on a range of international initiatives to accelerate innovation and scale up green industries. These include clean power, zero-emission vehicles, and near-zero emission steel and hydrogen. It could potentially create 20 million new jobs. Nigeria's Net-Zero Pledge Nigeria has committed to hit net-zero emissions by 2060. President Muhammadu Buhari told the COP26 summit that the country intends to cut emissions 20% below ""business as usual"" levels by 2030. The reductions could be increased to 47% if Nigeria can secure ""financial assistance, technology transfer and capacity building from the more advanced and more willing international partners,"" he said. ""We are looking for partners in innovation, technology and finance to make cleaner and efficient use of all available resources to make a more sustainable transition in energy markets,"" Buhari said. Gas will continue to play a role in Nigeria's energy transition until 2040 ""without diverting from the goals of the Paris Agreement."" South Africa's Coal Exit South Africa will receive an initial $8.5 billion commitment from the US and European countries to help it accelerate its transition away from coal-fired power generation. The financing will be provided through loans, grants and investments and risk-sharing instruments over five years to help South Africa move away from coal-fired plants which generated about 90% of the country's electricity last year. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the funds would help support the country's more ambitious pledge to reduce emissions by 2030. It plans to accelerate investment in renewable energy and new sectors like electric vehicles and green hydrogen while helping state-owned utility Eskom to transition away from coal.Staff Reports\l"

As a result, many are taking bold and transformative steps to green their communities, advocate for climate justice and protest against government inaction.Changing the status quoPhoto courtesy of Aurelia Bruce.Young climate leaders who are part of the UNCTAD Youth network of young changemakers participating in UN discussions on trade and development matters made their voices heard at COP26.

""We were tasked with organizing youth-focused events, actioning an intergenerational dialogue on shaping inclusive climate policies and bringing more youth expertise to the decision-making processes,"" Ms. Bruce said.Coming from a small island developing state (SIDS), Ms. Bruce believes delayed action to combat adverse effects of climate change will only exacerbate natural disasters and related social inequalities being faced by many Caribbean islands.""For SIDS to survive increasingly extreme weather conditions, we must bridge the divide between developed and developing states to address this global issue together,"" she said.Attending his third climate conference, Daniele Guadagnolo from Italy participated in youth-led events at the invitation of the European Commission and the Italian government to talk about the role of youth in climate advocacy.He was one of the 400 youth delegates who drafted the Youth4Climate Manifesto, a global proposal for climate justice with a focus on reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2030, increasing youth participation in decision-making processes, education on climate and financing a greener future.""This document gives us a fair chance to do something more ambitious,"" he said.

""Most vulnerable countries are grappling with many challenges at the same time, one of them being the fiscal crisis,"" Mr. Kaim said.Photo courtesy of Vladislav Kaim.He said the way climate finance is currently disbursed will not make a significant dent in countries' efforts at adaptation and mitigation if comprehensive debt restructuring for countries facing a fiscal crisis is not done.""I advocated for the inclusion of debt relief and partial conversion of debt to climate resources, outside of the $100 billion target earlier agreed in Paris so that countries would get an income and feel relief on the expense side,"" he said.Another point of discussion was how climate finance is disbursed at the micro level, with resources being allocated to a few big projects for which the youth don't have the capacity to apply. ""The rules of adaptation finance should be revised to make sure it's circulated towards smaller community projects led by the youth,"" Mr. Kaim said.The relevance of new generations in bringing about climate action has never been greater, even though meaningful inclusion of young people in shaping global climate politics and governance remains unsatisfactory.The COP26Climate action was one of the issues deemed to be crucial to young people in the Youth Declaration presented at UNCTAD's 15th quadrennial conference held in October 2021.The youth are the decision makers of tomorrow and can play a powerful role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Through the UNCTAD Youth Network, women and men between the ages of 18 and 30 will continue to help build the narrative about the future by sharing ideas and experiences, working with fellow youth in preparing inputs to UNCTAD meetings on trade and development-related issues, and making their voices heard in major youth events and more.\l"

He will first head to Italy for the G20, an intergovernmental forum comprising 19 countries and the European Union, and then to Scotland for the COP26 international climate conference. Before that, Biden is scheduled to meet Pope Francis in Rome on Friday. It will be followed by meetings with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He will also meet with French President Emmanuel Macron later in the day. On Saturday and Sunday, Biden will attend the key G20 events in Rome. There will be several sessions covering the main elements of the international economy and international affairs. ""On the margins of the Summit he will engage with key leaders on a range of issues of importance to the American people, including supply chain resilience, energy prices, the Iranian nuclear program, and more,"" the White House said. The COP26 will bring leaders together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In Glasgow, the U.S. President will deliver a major speech on climate. He will also have the opportunity to engage on the margins there on a range of important issues, including the Build Back Better World initiative - B3W - that the G7 announced at the summit in June. In the past few weeks, the U.S. and the EU came together for joint action on Covid-19, launched a global methane pledge and other key climate initiatives, and launched a Trade and Technology Council to set the rules and standards for economics and technology in the future. ""President Biden and key European partners will sit down at these two summits to coordinate policies on Iran, on supply chains, on global infrastructure efforts, and so much else,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters. He pointed out that neither China nor Russia will be represented at the summit at the leader level, reportedly due to COVID-19. ""The U.S. and Europe will be there, and they'll be there energized and united at both the G20 and COP26, driving the agenda, shaping the agenda as it relates to these significant international issues,"" said Sullivan.

Without decisive action, we are gambling away our last chance to \- literally - turn the tide , UN https://www.un.org/sg/Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has said ahead of the meeting. But why could it be our last chance?Here\' s some answers we\' ve found to the most common questions you might have about what\' s coming up.Let\' s start with the basics, what is COP26?COP26In 1992, the UN organised a major event in Rio de Janeiro called the Earth Summit, in which the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/UNFCCC) was adopted.In this treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories.Since 1994, when the treaty entered into force, every year the UN has been bringing together almost every country on earth for global climate summits or  COPs , which stands for \' Conference of the Parties\' .This year should have been the 27th annual summit, but thanks to HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/coronavirusCOVID-19, we\' ve fallen a year behind due to last year\' s postponement \- hence, COP26UN Photo/Amanda VoisardFormer United States Secretary of State John Kerry, accompanied by his grand-daughter, signs the Paris Agreement at UN headquarters in April 2016.So, what happens at COP26? Don\' t we have enough meetings about climate change already?Various  extensions to the UNFCCC treaty have been negotiated during these COPs to establish legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries, and to define an enforcement mechanism.These include the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocolKyoto Protocolin 1997, which defined emission limits for developed nations to be achieved by 2012; and the HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreementParis Agreement, adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to try and limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, and boost climate action financing.So, here\' s where COP26 gets interesting: during the conference, among other issues,delegates will be aiming to finalise the \' Paris Rulebook\' , or the rules needed to implement the Agreement. This time they will need to agree on common timeframes for the frequency of revision and monitoring of their climate commitments.Basically, Paris set the destination, limiting warming well below two degrees, (ideally 1.5) but Glasgow, is the last chance to make it a reality.IMF/K. M. AsadIn Bangladesh, efforts are undertaken to improve coastal protection from flooding caused by storms and a rise in sea level due to climate change.So, this bring us to our initial question: why is it the last chance?Like a boa constrictor that slowly squeezes its prey to death, climate change has gone from being an uncomfortable low-level issue, to a life-threatening global emergency, in the past three decades.Although there have been new and updated commitments made by countries ahead of COP26, the world remains on track for a dangerous global temperature rise of HYPERLINK at least 2.7\'b0C this centuryUN chief Ant\'f3nio Guterres bluntly calls it  climate catastrophe , one that it is already being felt to a deadly degree in the most vulnerable parts of the world like sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island States, lashed by rising sea levels. HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/04/1090432Millions of people are already being displaced and killed by disasters exacerbated by climate change.For Mr. Guterres, and the hundreds of scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scenario of 1.5\'b0C warming, is the  only liveable future for humanity .The clock is ticking, and to have a chance of limiting the rise, the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.This is a gigantic task that we only will be able to do if leaders attending COP26 come up with bold, time-bound and front-loaded plans to phase out coal and transform their economies to reach HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1078612so called net zero emissionsADB/Ariel JavellanaEmissions from coal-fired power plants contribute to air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.Hmm, but didn\' t countries like China and the United States already commit to net zero?The most recent UN HYPERLINK Emissions Gap ReportThis covers over half of global domestic greenhouse gas emissions, over half of global GDP and a third of the global population. Eleven targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions.Sounds great right?But there\' s a catch:many of the commitments delay action until after 2030, raising doubts over whether these net zero pledges can actually be achieved. Also, many of these pledges are  vague and inconsistent with the officially submitted national commitments, known as NDC\' s.This again explains why COP26 is so important:  The time has passed for diplomatic niceties...If governments - especially G20 governments - do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering , warned Guterres in the UN General Assembly this week.UNFCCCFriday for Future demonstration at COP25So, what exactly is COP26 hoping to achieve (practically speaking)?{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\parThe official negotiations take place over two weeks. The first week includes technical negotiations by government officials, followed by high-level Ministerial and Heads of State meetings in the second week, when the final decisions will be made \- or not.There are four main points that will be discussed during the conference according to its host, the United Kingdom:1. Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reachTo do this, countries need to accelerate the phase-out of coal, curb deforestation, speed up the switch to greener economies. Carbon market mechanisms will be also part of the negotiations.Since the climate is already changing countries already affected by climate change need to protect and restore ecosystems, as well as build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure.3. Mobilise financeThat promise was not kept, and COP26 will be crucial to secure the funds, with the help of international financial institutions, as well as set new climate finance targets to be achieved by 2025.4. Work together to deliverThis means establishing collaborations between governments, businesses and civil society, and of course, finalising the Paris Rulebook to make the Agreement fully operational.In addition to formal negotiations, COP26 is expected to establish new initiatives and coalitions for delivering climate action.Unsplash/Adam MarikarCOP26How, when and where?The main event will be held at the Scottish Event Campus, from 31 October to 12 November, with the possibility of negotiations spilling over an extra day or two. So far, there are over 30.000 people registered to attend representing governments, businesses, NGOs, and civil society groups.The 197 Parties to the UNFCCC treaty, often get in groups or  blocs to negotiate together such as the G77 and China, the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, the Umbrella Forum, the Small Island Developing States, and the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean.The negotiations also include observers, which have no formal part in them but make interventions and help maintain transparency. Observers include United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, faith-based groups, and the press.But besides the official negotiations, there will be a conference, a pavilion, and thousands of side events happening, divided over thematic days, on topics like finance, energy, youth and public empowerment, nature, adaptation, gender, science and innovation, transport, and cities. The conference will happen across two zones \- The Blue Zone (Scottish Events Campus), and the Green Zone located at the Glasgow Science Centre.The Blue Zone is a UN-managed space where negotiations are hosted, and to enter all attendees must be credited by the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Young and future generations will disproportionately face the impacts of climate change itself, so additional negative consequences of short-sighted policy design should be avoided. Moreover, the UK cannot act in isolation and should do more to encourage a global transition towards net zero, even once its own transition is complete.The paper calls for: The UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emission to net zero by 2050 Secure and transparent supply chains must be established for the critical mineral resources essential to low-carbon energy systems. Increased government attention and R&D funding must go into developing solutions for energy system waste disposal, with the incorporation of circular economy concepts. Stable policy is needed to encourage CCS commercialisation, which must include robust regulation of storage monitoring. Carbon sequestration through afforestation should be encouraged with broader financial incentives alongside education programmes that shift consumption patterns to ease land-use competition. A Climate Action Unit within the FCDO should be formed, led by a senior minister, to ensure the long-term international climate leadership of the UK. A mechanism for continuing the evaluation of the long-term consequences of climate policy is needed to improve policy design; the remit of the Climate Change Committee should be updated to include this.Owen Tutt (MA in International Studies and Diplomacy 2020-21) who alongside Johanna Caitlin Dieffenbacher contributed to the briefing said: ""It was a pleasure to write this briefing alongside such enthusiastic students from across the UK.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA348","COP26's Failure to Advocate Livestock Reduction is a Ludicrous Failure, Says Humane Society International","November 12, 2021 Friday 8:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSOps) -- The Humane Society International issued the following news:As COP26 prepares to reveal the final pledges focused on cutting emissions from energy, transport and other sectors, campaigners from Humane Society International, one of the largest global animal protection NGOs in the world, say the total omission of targets to reduce livestock farming and cut meat and dairy production and consumption, represents a ludicrous failure considering the sector is the world's second largest emitter of human-induced greenhouse gases.Stefanie McNerney, plant based solutions manager at Humane Society International, says: ""Whilst there were many conversations at side events and press conferences about the urgent need for global food system reform to cut meat and dairy production and consumption, this vital climate mitigation strategy was depressingly absent from the COP26 leader negotiations. Current pledges on methane, coal, forests and transport still look set to put us way off target to limit global temperature rise, so it is a ludicrous failure to ignore the opportunity to limit one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, animal agriculture. We need policies and targets that shift farming toward plant-based food production, and the clear lack of ambition to do so is deeply troubling. We have reached a stage in the climate crisis where so called technical solutions such as cattle feed additives are nowhere near enough to tackle emissions from this sector. The climate clock is ticking and it is well past time to move beyond these low-impact greenwashing distractions offered by Big Ag that merely perpetuate the growth of an unsustainable industry. The science is clear that that's not an option. Will governments follow the science and plan a just transition to a more climate-resilient, plant-centric food system, or will we be waiting until the cows come home for them to stop ignoring the cow in the room?""Key points: Despite world leaders at COP26 acknowledging that food production not only contributes to climate change, but also holds one of the keys to mitigating it, dialogues around this sector lacked ambition, with most official conversations focusing on low-impact strategies such as modifying livestock feed, tackling nitrous oxide in fertilizer and rewilding, whilst completely omitting discussion of high impact actions such as livestock reduction and diet change. HSI welcomes the pledges on methane reductions and bringing an end to deforestation. However, animal agriculture is one of the largest contributors to both methane emissions and deforestation, and these issues cannot be addressed without reducing global livestock numbers and shifting to more plant-centric food production and consumption. Diverting the discussion toward short-sighted mitigation tactics whilst willfully ignoring and even shooting down the topic of livestock reduction and diet change is nothing short of greenwashing by the livestock industry. Governments that are serious about climate change must address emissions from animal agriculture, and that means reducing the number of animals raised for consumption and transforming our food system to a more sustainable, resilient, plant-centric system that is just for all. On the subject of missing the point, in the draft CMA decision by the COP26 president, the words Â£nimal agriculture' and 'farming', let alone 'livestock reduction' do not even feature once. The other cow in the room was the cow served on the COP plates. The provision of meat on the menu at a climate conference was disappointing. The CO2equivalent labelling on all food served at the conference clearly demonstrated the very large carbon footprint of beef dishes compared to plant-based options. The juxtaposition of emissions between a beef burger weighing in at a hefty 3.3 kg CO2 e compared to a plant-based burger at just 0.2 kg CO2 e literally served up an obvious mitigation strategy on a plate--one that was a glaring omission from the COP26 negotiations.HSI's #TheCowInTheRoom campaign called on COP26 to acknowledge and act on the climate damaging impacts of intensive animal agriculture. The campaign has the backing of leading plant-based food companies and investors including Beyond Investing, Mosa Meat, Eat Just, Wicked Kitchen and Linda McCartney Foods, as well as celebrities such as Moby, Billie Eilish, Joaquin Phoenix, Alan Cumming, Alicia Silverstone, Mary McCartney, Leona Lewis, Martin Freeman, Lily Cole and Stephen Fry.

The previous record of 38 million, twenty times the current daily average, was smashed by a margin of 6 million, with the new record standing at 44.7m. The causes are easy to identify from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service's own chart of the Transmission System fuel mix. Wind power, the dark blue bars, was extremely low for most of the day, with a minimum of only 1 GW, under 5% of its capacity. Minimum wind generation coincided neatly with peak demand, and as a result system prices reached stunning levels, with a maximum of just over 4,000 a megawatt hour, nearly 100 times the wholesale price normal before the current crisis started, as can be seen in this BMRS chart[2] These prices brought coal and gas back on to the system to save the day, but emergency measures are expensive, and the cost to consumers and the wider economy was little short of horrifying. h/t Adrian [ 1]: HYPERLINK https://www.netzerowatch.com/coal-keeps-lights-on-at-cop26-as-low-wind-strikes-againhttps://www.netzerowatch.com/coal-keeps-lights-on-at- HYPERLINK cop26 -as-low-wind-strikes-again HYPERLINK https://www.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=eds/mainhttps://www.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=eds/main The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the ""Newstex Authoritative Content"") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Many climate action groups have taken to the streets in recent days to demand that government leaders make more progress.Source: Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images News via Getty ImagesThe world's eight largest emitters account for nearly two-thirds of all greenhouse gases that humans spew into the atmosphere, and all those nations are falling short of meeting their net-zero emission pledges, climate researchers warned.A key goal of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, now in its second and final week, was to keep the global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels ""within reach."" The high-stakes summit was the first time nations would assess progress after signing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Importantly, countries were expected to arrive at COP26 with new carbon reduction goals for 2030 that would keep them on track to decarbonize by midcentury.But with only a few days left at the summit, concern is growing over the massive gap between what nations plan to do to slow emissions by 2030 and what is needed to keep warming within the 1.5-degree limit.Efforts by the top-emitting nations China, the U.S., India, the European Union, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil and Japan all range from ""insufficient"" to highly or critically insufficient, a new analysis by the Climate Action Tracker shows. A separate United Nations report released Nov. 9 concluded that even if official climate pledges known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, were implemented, warming by the end of the century could reach 2.7 degrees, far above the Paris targets.""Not a single country has short-term policies in place to put itself on track toward its own net-zero target,"" said Niklas H\'f6hne with the NewClimate Institute, one of the organizations behind the Climate Action Tracker. ""We would in 2030 be emitting twice as much as we should if we want to [reach] 1.5 degrees.""A look at the pledges that the seven top-emitting nations and the 27-nation European Union made in the weeks and months leading up to makes clear why the climate breakthrough many hoped for may not materialize.Weak pledges, inconsistent policiesIndonesia and Brazil submitted the same NDC climate pledge ahead of COP26 as they did in 2015, although Brazil's has effectively been weakened, according to Climate Action Tracker's analysis. Brazil in its update allowed for an increase in its base year emissions that it uses as a reference, meaning Brazil can continue to grow its emissions and still meet its targets.Russia's updated NDC did not show an increase in ambition and the country's net-zero goal for 2060 has not been formally adopted. India announced a long-awaited net-zero goal Nov. 1, saying it will decarbonize its economy by 2070 two decades later than what scientists say is needed to keep climate disruptions manageable. India has not yet submitted a new NDC.China, also with a 2060 net-zero goal but a relatively detailed NDC, continues to invest in coal generation as does Indonesia. Japan submitted a strengthened NDC that calls for a 46% reduction in emissions from 2013 levels by 2030, close to the 50% required to align the nation with the 1.5-degree goal. But Japan's plan to still get 19% of its power from coal plants in 2030 is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement goals, the Climate Action Tracker analysis said.The European Union's 27 nations this year adopted and financed its ambitious Green Deal, mandating a 55% emission reduction below 1990 levels by 2030. But many EU member states have been slow to implement these policies which means they may not meet that goal. Climate Action Tracker rated the EU ""insufficient.""The U.S. NDC, meanwhile, is hanging in the balance of Washington politics. It remains uncertain whether the Biden administration's ambitious climate agenda will be fully implemented and whether the world's second-largest emitter and top per-capita greenhouse gas producer will deliver on its pledge to the Paris treaty.Without actual policies to back announcements and promises, declaring progress at COP26 is premature, many researchers say. On Nov. 4, the International Energy Agency caused a stir when it projected that if all net-zero pledges were implemented and nations make good on a voluntary global methane pledge, global warming would be limited to 1.8 degrees C, approaching the Paris goal.""Clearly we don't have the 2030 numbers in hand that get us where we need to go,"" said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute. ""Not even to 1.8 degrees, let alone 1.5.""\l"

Produced by Earth | Food | Life[7], a project of the Independent Media Institute After more than two weeks of negotiations during the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, diplomats from almost 200 nations finally agreed on two major points: ramp up the fight against climate change and help at-risk countries prepare. Specifically, governments agreed to meet again[8] next in 2022 with more robust plans to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent by 2030[9], significantly reduce emissions of methane (which has even more global warming potential than CO2), and nearly double the aid to poor countries to help them mitigate the effects of climate change. Notably, nations agreed to initiate reductions in coal-fired power and to begin slashing government subsidies on other fossil fuels, representing the first time a COP text mentioned coal and fossil fuels. Alok Sharma, COP26's chief organizer, called[10] the Glasgow Climate Pact Â£ fragile win.' Acknowledging the deal is imperfect, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry registered his support. 'You can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and this is good. This is a powerful statement,' he said[11]. 'We in the United States are really excited by the fact that this raises ambition on a global basis.' And while the agreement represents a step forward, it has been roundly criticized by scientists, climate activists and representatives from small, poorer nations who will feel the brunt of the climate impacts much sooner than big, richer ones.

This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow decides the future of emissions and international cooperation on climate, but some questions remain: Who will commit? And with everything at stake, will it be enough? COP26 President Alok Sharmadelivered a speech[1]from Paris on Tuesday, reiterating the importance of keeping our global temperature rise within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit set by the Paris climate agreement and calling out certain countries for their lack of commitments. The appointed leader of COP26 sets the agenda ahead of the talks, heading negotiations while prioritizing the conference's predetermined goals. This year, Sharma has a crucial message for G20 countries: The world's richest nations 'must honor the promises made here in Paris six years ago.' 'Temperatures have risen at least 1.1 above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather is on the march around the world,' said Sharma, citing the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'Code Red' report[2]from August. 'This summer we've seen devastating flooding in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America, record temperatures across the globe, and what some have called the world's first climate-induced famine in Madagascar.' Sharma, a British member of parliament and minister of state at the Cabinet Office, highlighted the countries that have renewed and increased their commitments to reducing emissions, usingrecent net zero target declarations[3]from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as examples. He then went on to point out the lack of effort coming from G20 countries, 'which account for around 80% of global emissions.' 'Under the G20 climate and energy ministers meeting in July, every G20 country agreed to set out ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets before COP26,' said Sharma. 'The UK, France, Italy, Germany, the EU, Canada, the US, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, and South Africa have done so. Now the rest must deliver.' The G20 countries missing from the list of those that have renewed commitments include Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. ""So I say to those G20 leaders, they simply must step up ahead of COP26."" COP26 begins, G20 countries will meet in Rome for the Summit of the G20 Heads of State and Government on Oct. 30 and 31. The COP26 Currently, the Australian government is under pressure to increase its goal of cutting pollution, according to theSydney Morning Herald[5]. Sharma is hoping that through its participation in COP26, Australia can commit to a larger pledge toward net zero. The country is one of the world's top exporters of coal, second only toIndonesia[6]. On sustainability and clean living, Sharma urged world leaders to leave coal power in the past, shift toward electric vehicles, end deforestation, and cut methane emissions. 'We recognize that these can be complex transitions for countries, which comes as we face global gas supply challenges,' he said. 'Yet volatile prices underscore the importance of countries accelerating their move toward more clean, renewable power.' Sharma also spoke onChina's new coal financing policies[7], which pledges a halt to building foreign-based coal plants, and he urged G20 leaders to target rampant coal use at home. 'We need a system that accelerates progress, recognizing that whilst all countries must act, those with the greatest responsibility must do more.' We have a limited window of time to address global warming in order to prevent the currently predictedworst case scenario[8]. As time runs out before the highly anticipated COP26 climate conference ticks down, so do our chances of preempting the climate crisis before bearing irretrievable consequences. 'The point is, that at 1.1 degrees warming, the effects are already alarming,' said Sharma. According to the IPCC report, Earth's temperature is on track to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit, and without immediate action to reduce global warming emissions, we will see even moredevastating extreme weather events[9]. Sharma warned that even if the world reaches net zero tomorrow, governments must have plans in place to protect people, land, and vulnerable nations from the effects that human-caused climate change has already set in motion. Advocacy groups, environmental leaders, and climate activists have urged leaders to commit to climate financing for low-income nations ahead of COP26. At the COP15 conference in 2009, the world's richest countries pledged$100 billion a year[10]to fund climate adaptation and sustainability for countries at risk of bearing the worst consequences of climate change. In his speech, Sharma urged the G20 to finally deliver on that promise. 'I hope that we will come together as a global community to help equip the most vulnerable to protect themselves from climate change,' he said. 'Success  or failure  of COP26 is in [world leaders'] hands; and so is the fate of the Paris agreement ... because since it was signed, the world has not done enough.'

Yet, the world's largest carmaking economies, including China, the U.S., Japan and Germany, are absent from the commitment, as are major automakers Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Corp.Cities signing up include many from nations that are not signatories, including New York City, Los Angeles and Rome, which have pledged to shift to zero-emission fleets by 2035.

It is joined in the declaration by Ford, GM, Mercedes-Benz AG and Jaguar Land Rover Ltd., among others.According to Samuelsson, concerns over electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which remains a prohibiting factor to adoption for many drivers, are resolvable. ""I'm not too nervous about that,"" he said, adding that he expects supply to ramp up alongside increasing uptake of EVs.Rather, the CEO sees a need for progress in the primary energy supply that fleets will be drawing from. ""The primary energy needs to be fossil-free,"" he said. Instead, countries across the world, including the U.S. and Germany, are rolling out EVs while coal continues to play a key role in the power mix.""We will also have to start thinking about the primary energy in the supply chain,"" Samuelsson added. Volvo is buying initial quantities of so-called green steel, made with the electrification of heat generation by Swedish steel firm SSAB AB. Green steel is picking up momentum as a hydrogen market takes shape, but the method remains in an expensive pioneering phase.Battery production will also need to be fossil-free, or else cars will build in more emissions through their supply chain than they avoid over their lifetime, Samuelsson noted.Equality in the transitionNigel Topping, the U.K.'s high-level champion for climate action at COP26, said that polluting petrol and diesel cars phased out in developed nations ought not be exported, or ""dumped"" into poorer nations, shifting pollution and emissions overseas.\l"

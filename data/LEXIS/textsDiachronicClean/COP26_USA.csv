"COP26","USA","COP26_USA1","COP26 - IMPACT ON JUSTICE SYSTEM: SUMMARY REPORT","April 28, 2022 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Scottish Government: Overview The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow between 31 October and 12 November 2021. This short report investigates the result that the conference had on Scotland's justice system as a whole. COP26 resulted in[1]: over 40,000 visitors to the city 128 world leaders 25-day policing operation over 10,000 police officers deployed on some days COP26 on the Scottish justice system In addition to the unprecetended scale of the policing operation, there was significant planning across other areas of the justice system to deal with the extra business that an event of this scale could potentially produce. Across Scotland, summary trials in the Sheriff and Justice of the Peace courts did not take place from 25 October to 12 November, as a result of police officers not being available for witness duty. In addition, Sheriff and Jury trials did not take place for a two-week period from 1 November to 12 November. High court trials continued as usual but business was temporarily moved from Glasgow to other locations in Scotland. In anticipation of additional need: extra custody courts were provided across the country, including weekend courts in key locations the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) provided extra resources for the marking of cases In total there were 97 COP26 related arrests made by the police over the course of the conference[2]. As of 22 March 2022, 46 of those arrested had been reported to COPFS, twelve of those were reported from custody[3]. Of the 46 people reported to COPFS[4]: 28 had no further action taken 2 were issued with a fiscal fine 6 were marked for summary proceedings 2 are awaiting marking Of the 14 people who were to be proceeded against in court[5]: one was not convicted one was fined one was given a custodial sentence the remaining 11 cases are ongoing Conclusion As shown above there were 97 arrests and 46 reports to COPFS resulting from COP26 . This is much lower than might have been expected, given the potential for unrest an event of the scale and nature of COP26 presented. The potential for a substantial increase in business was recognised by justice organisations across Scotland and significant effort was made to prepare for and minimise the impact of COP26 across the justice system (and other sectors). It is likely that this level of preparedness and multi-agency working contributed, in no small part, to ensuring that disruption to the day-to-day running of justice organisations (downstream of Police Scotland) was minimal.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA3","EARTH DAY 2022: CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE ACTION IN THE BAHAMAS PRE AND POST COP26","April 20, 2022 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: UK Government's Regional Ambassador for Latin America and the Caribbean, Fiona Clouder visits to The Bahamas pre and post COP26 . Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Published 20 April 2022 On Earth Day 2022, and as the Bahamian Government prepares to host the first ever English-speaking regional youth conference on climate change, we reflect on Ambassador Clouder's experience in The Bahamas pre and post COP26 . Climate change is a global issue. The big policy issues are something we have to work on together internationally. No country can solve these problems by itself, but we can all play our role to achieve worldwide outcomes. Ambassador Clouder visited The Bahamas in October 2021 to support the UK's COP26 objectives. She met representatives of government, private sector and environmental NGOs. One of the key messages that Ambassador Clouder discussed was that governments play a critical role in reducing carbon emissions as part of their medium term to long-term policy priorities. Ambassador Clouder accompanied by High Commissioner Dickson during a visit to Grand Bahama saw first-hand how extreme weather and other environmental challenges can impact The Bahamas The damage caused by hurricane Dorian is being slowly addressed by organisations such as the Bahamas National Trust and Coral Vita. Making sure the coastline is strong with reefs and mangroves will make a difference for the future. Climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience begin with everyday choices that we make. People can reduce their carbon footprints and participate in protecting and restoring the environment through tree planting and other nature based solutions to climate change. In her follow-up visit in March 2022, Ambassador Clouder heard progress reports from the Ministers for Environment and Natural Resources; Agriculture, Marine Resources and Family Island Affairs; and Economic Affairs. The Bahamian Government's climate policy priorities are: adaptation measures to protect communities and natural habitats form the effects of climate change, mobilising finance for green renewal, and accelerating collaboration between government and civil society (including youth) to deliver on Bahamian climate goals faster. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA4","Climate Finance: Moving Forward After COP26","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Apr 14, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com By William Hepworth[1] and Arya Rudra[2] Funding Climate Action: The Need for Private Sector Leadership From rising sea levels to the acidification of ocean water, from deforestation to the introduction of invasive species in ecosystems, the global effects of climate change are expanding in scope and scale. Financing, both from private and governmental sources, is required to drive tech development and expand decarbonization efforts to all geographies, industries, and stakeholders. But financing in itself forms a significant part of the challenge. An estimated $100 billion per year in investment is required for financing climate related issues, a target that developed countries were aiming to achieve by 2020[3]. However, this target has largely been aspirational since global investments in the past 4 years have averaged around $75 billion[4] - a gap that highlights the need for active participation by the private sector. Bridging the Funding Gap at COP26 : Governmental Pledges At COP26 , an intergovernmental Green Climate Fund[5] was created to investigate the policies and criteria that would determine funding. Japan pledged $10 billion and Italy $7 billion over the next 5 years. The EU further pledged \€ 1 billion, along the lines of the EU Green Deal, dedicated to protecting the world's forests. The climate finance gap magnifies a dual burden on low income countries, which are more at risk of climate disaster and lack the required infrastructure to face the consequences of global warming. Twelve other countries pledged an additional $413 million[6] in funding to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) within the Green Climate Fund. Bridging the Funding Gap at COP26 : Private Sector Initiatives One of the main goals of COP26 was for governments to leverage private financing in support of the Race to Zero[7]. To this end, 36 countries pledged to provide reliable, consistent information about climate risk to facilitate the flow of capital towards greener investments. Furthermore, the development of the new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)[8] will ensure common terminology and compatibility for investors who are comparing the sustainability strategies of companies on a global scale. Harmonization of reporting standards has been a key development for achieving global sustainability in business. Indeed, the five largest reporting organizations (CDP, CDSB, GRI, IIRC and SASB) announced in 2020[9] that they had established a working group to develop a more comprehensive corporate reporting system. As the results of this collaboration come to fruition, pressure on the private sector to provide reliable and transparent ESG data will only continue to increase. Private financial institutions from across the globe used the opportunity of COP26 to form a new coalition called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)[10]. Four hundred and fifty financial firms from across the globe, representing over $130 trillion in assets, have pledged to accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy. Members have prioritized areas of transformation within the financial sector, including sector specific pathways for global industries and portfolio alignment with targets. With capital increasingly flowing towards strong sustainability performance in all sectors, the creation of GFANZ demonstrates that leading Financial Market Participants (FMPs) are prepared to push an even higher percentage of capital towards companies accelerating and enabling climate-action. Sustainability, the New Norm for Investors: Sector Trends GFANZ is an example of how financial actors can work together towards accelerating the transition to a green economy. Such initiatives solidify regulatory efforts in Europe to promote those companies with the strongest sustainability strategies. The EU Taxonomy[11], the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive (CSRD)[12] and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)[13], are shaping institutional investor strategy towards sustainability. By classifying the sustainability of various economic activities, increasing the percentage of European companies required to divulge Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) data, and pushing for transparency at investor portfolio level, these regulations have set the triple bottom line as the new norm in European business, and the announcement of the new ISBB is taking this standardization of sustainability reporting global. Under the new SFDR regulation, European asset managers will, by March 2022, not only have to divulge the percentage of their investments which are Taxonomy aligned, but also the percentage of investments which have adverse sustainability impacts. Strong sustainability performance will define how capital is allocated over the coming decades, and external ratings of sustainability management systems can function as a means for companies to display their commitments, attain recognition for concrete actions and demonstrate sustainability leadership in order to attract investors. Indeed, whatever a company's size or activity, trends in the financial sector display that the need for comparable, accurate and transparent ESG information will only continue to grow, and with it, the flow of capital towards the best performers in each sector. Sustainability ratings, such as the EcoVadis rating[14], allow companies to gauge their networks' sustainability performance and benchmark their sustainable impact against that of industry peers. The EcoVadis methodology[15] also helps define clear areas of improvement for rated companies, providing them with a framework to demonstrate to investors and buyers that the climate transition is at the core of their business objectives, irrespective of the relative maturity of their sustainability management system. This engagement mechanism is particularly valuable to support smaller business partners in tracking and reporting on climate action, given SMEs accounting for upwards of 70% of global supply chains and related carbon emissions. Best Practices by Global Climate Leaders, and How Your Company Can Take Action To bridge the funding gap, climate-action financing needs to come from financial markets and governments. However, it must also derive from corporate climate leaders and, in this regard, supply chain finance holds the potential to cascade positive impact at scale by drawing additional stakeholders on board of the global decarbonization journey. Climate finance and decarbonization tech has already attracted billions[16] in private funding. L'Oreal, for instance, has established a \€ 100 million impact investment fund[17] dedicated to enhancing climate resilience. Amazon has created two impact investment funds, namely the Climate Pledge Fund[18] ($2 billion investment by 2040) and the Right Now Climate Fund[19] ($100 million investment) to develop nature based solutions. With significant uncertainty over the cost and technical feasibility of carbon reduction levers, driving technology development and access is key to ensuring that decarbonization progress involves all tiers of global supply chains, including upstream players and SMEs. Whether your company is looking to direct or attract finance, comparable information on sustainability management systems is imperative. EcoVadis sustainability ratings are the most trusted in evaluating the management system of an organization with regard to environment, labor practices, business ethics and sustainable procurement, and dive deeper into greenhouse gas management practices through the new Carbon Scorecard[20]. With over 75,000 companies rated across the world, EcoVadis' rigorous approach provides a backbone of trust for investments made by green and ESG funds directly and can also boost individual firms' ability to attract investments from other impact funds. To put COP26 's climate finance commitments into practice, private sector leadership will be essential, and allow for an acceleration of technology access, climate action, and quality reporting towards decarbonization - for all parts of global supply chains.

From: British Embassy Ashgabat Published 28 March 2022 On March 24, the British Embassy Ashgabat was delighted to organise an online conference in Ashgabat, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan and the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan. The conference focussed on the outcomes and achievements of last year's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and was an opportunity to generate new ideas and improve cooperation to take forward the Glasgow Climate Pact. The conference was a continuation of the high-level roundtable that the British Embassy held in March 2021 in Ashgabat, ahead of the COP26 . COP26 , representatives discussed the best ways to deliver stronger sectoral action to accelerate Turkmenistan's transition to a low-carbon, more resource-efficient and sustainable economy. The conference helped international partners and donors better understand plans the Turkmenistan government has for decarbonisation and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These plans are outlined in the final draft of their new NDC, as part of their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Participants from both the UK and Turkmenistan announced new climate change initiatives between national and international partners. Those attending the event included representatives of the ministries of Turkmenistan, the UN agencies, foreign diplomatic missions, international organisations and development partners, financial institutions, university students and others. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan moderated the event. The Turkmen Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection announced that the country's next set of climate change plans would soon be submitted to the UN. These plans include projects to reduce both carbon dioxide and methane emissions. UN agencies pledged to continue working with Turkmenistan to address challenges of mapping emissions, changing legislation, provide technical assistance and support education. Nick Bridge, the British Foreign Secretary's Special Representative for Climate Change, stressed the need to go clean and green and deliver on our promises faster. Kenan Poleo, the UK's Trade Commissioner for Central Asia, highlighted that change can support growth in the last 30 years the UK has cut emissions by 44% while growing its economy 78%. The British Ambassador, Lucia Wilde, reaffirmed the Embassy's commitment to support both the implementation of climate change policies and support for Turkmenistan to introduce more green energy technologies. Participants identified joint priorities and new areas of climate cooperation in the run-up to COP27. Climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions negatively affects the health and well-being of people and countries around the world. As such, experts at the event agreed that it is important to learn from each other and continue a productive dialogue and exchange of professional experience in this important area. At the end of the conference, experts and participants thanked the organisers and highlighted how important it was to continue these discussions in order to help the transition of Turkmenistan to a green economy. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA6","BC Faculty Share Perspectives on COP26 and the Climate Change Crisis","March 27, 2022 Sunday","The Heights: Boston College","Boston College faculty met on Thursday to discuss the University's involvement in COP26 and the larger climate crisis facing the world today. ""Last November, another chapter of the University's global engagement opened when BC sent its first delegation as an official UN observer organization to the UN's Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland,"" James Keenan, S.J., vice provost for global engagement, said. The Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society sponsored the event, which featured three faculty presentations followed by a panel discussion and Q&A with students. ""The Schiller Institute is leading the organization of BC's participation in COP26 and developing programming that creates dialogue on the pressing need to address climate change,"" Keenan said. David Deese, a political science professor who led one of the delegations at the conference, discussed the climate initiatives agreed upon at COP26 and steps the global community needs to take to address the climate change crisis. ""If fully implemented, the national commitments that were made in Glasgow would get us to somewhere just under 2.2 degrees Celsius, which of course is not adequate,"" Deese said. The goal of COP27 is to establish long-term strategies across the globe to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and phase out domestic fossil fuels like coal, according to Deese. ""We can surely reach a zero carbon future by deep decarbonization of energy and agriculture with specific limits on carbon pollution and prudent fiscal policies,"" Deese said. Philip Landrigan, director of BC's global public health program and Global Pollution Observatory, discussed the present dangers of climate change and the way the crisis is unfolding around the world. ""The key message here is that climate change is here today,"" Landrigan said. ""Yes, it's going to get worse as the century rolls out, but it's killing people today."" According to Landrigan, the climate crisis has shown its impact across the globe through air pollution, natural disasters, drought, and famine, creating a new type of crisis-environmental refugees. ""One of the consequences of drought, of course, is famine,"" Landrigan said. ""When people starve, they start to try to go someplace where they can find food for their families and for themselves. They go through all of the horrors of migration."" The 2022 COP27 conference, which BC will send another delegation to, will be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Kurt Straif, a visiting scholar and co-director of the Global Pollution Observatory, related the global climate crisis to BC, specifically the University's position on divestment. ""I think divestment is most critical and central because really, money makes the world go-round, and you really need to put your finger on where the problems are created,"" Straif said. ""What we discuss is really global policy, but where the rubber hits the road is locally."" Andrea Vicini, S.J., Michael P. Walsh professor of bioethics and professor ordinarius, said the issue of climate change is a shared problem. ""I think we experienced that we cannot focus only on ourselves,"" Vicini said. ""The problem of the other is my problem. What is happening to the other is what's happening to me. We are all in this together. So there is sort of urgency, gravity, and complexity, but we all share it.""

From: Government Legal Department Published 26 January 2022 Led by Deputy Directors Claire Macmillen and Julia Goring, the team supported the event prior to, and during COP26 itself. Over the past two and a half years the team worked extensively with lawyers across GLD and the wider Government Legal Profession to provide the necessary legal frameworks to enable COP26 to take place in the UK. The team led the negotiations with the UN on the principal international agreement the Host Country Agreement as well as advising on numerous supporting mechanisms with the UN and other partners on the hosting of the COP during the pandemic. The conclusion of these complex arrangements delivered an inclusive, accessible and safe event and enabled tens of thousands of people from almost 200 nations, comprising party delegates and observers, and representatives from civil society, NGOs, business, and indigenous groups to attend COP26 . COP26 our expert team of international climate change lawyers provided advice to the Presidency negotiations team on a large range of strategic and process-related preparatory matters. During the two-week conference the team were embedded in the Presidency team on the ground, and continued to provide support and guidance on a very wide range of climate negotiations issues, many culminating in decisions adopted by the Parties, notably the Glasgow Climate Pact, which should ultimately be translated into actions, policies and laws around the world. Some of the key issues concerned finance, completing the technical rules to operationalise the Paris Agreement, and ramping up ambition for countries to increase their carbon reduction ambitions by 2030 and beyond. Lawyers from the team continue to lead on important climate change matters alongside COP26 , such as the net zero strategy, opening the next round of renewable energy auctions, and delivering international climate finance supporting developing countries around the globe. In an article published on the International Bar Association it states, 'there's a sense that the law and legal work can help translate words into action when it comes to addressing the climate crisis'. The article includes a comment from Claire who says, 'It's all very well and good to make the pledges, but how do you make these into translatable actions? The law can be a very powerful force in that."" The event was also a time to remember Clare Radcliffe who sadly passed away at the beginning of the year. Clare was dedicated to making a positive change, and was a leading figure in GLD's work for COP26 . In tribute to Clare, her work and exceptional legacy, a plaque in the conference centre garden in Glasgow was unveiled at COP26 . \"

However, quantifiable progress was achieved on one major climate driver - methane - giving reason for optimism amid much uncertainty. Global emissions of this tiny molecule - made up of one carbon surrounded by four hydrogen atoms - are responsible for up to 30% of all global warming[5], with 60% of total emissions deriving from human sources[6]. Furthermore, methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in a 20-year timeframe, meaning that aggressive action to remove and mitigate methane emissions in the near-term can provide immediate benefits for the climate, and will be key to achieving Paris Climate Agreement targets. As regulators in Europe and North America edge ever closer to imposing Methane reporting requirements and emissions restrictions on companies, it is essential that business leaders are proactive in their response and acquire a firm understanding of why supply chain action is key to fulfilling the Global Methane Pledge.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA9","AGENDA OF COP26, GLASGOW","March 24, 2022 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Government of India: by PIB Delhi The Government of India has articulated and put across the concerns of developingcountries at the 26thsession of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Glasgow, United Kingdom. As a part of its overall approach, India emphasized the foundational principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and called for climate justice in global climate action. It also highlighted that all countries should have equitable access to the global carbon budget, a finite global resource, for keeping temperature increase within the limits set by the Paris Agreement. All countries must stay within their fair share of this global carbon budget while using it responsibly. India alsocalled on the developed countries to undertake rapid reductions in emissions during the current decade so as to reach net-zero much earlier than their announced dates, as they have used more than their fair share of the depleting global carbon budget. India also highlighted that the transfer of climate finance and low-cost climate technologies have become more important for the implementation of climate actions by the developing countries. The ambition on climate finance on the part of developed countries cannot remain same as it was at the time of the Paris Agreement in 2015. It was also emphasized that just as the UNFCCC tracks the progress made in climate mitigation, it should also track climate finance.India also announced to intensify its climate action. The major decisions at COP26 , as reflected in the Glasgow Climate Pact, pertain to mitigation, adaptation and finance required for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. All decisions at the annual Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC are arrived at by consensus and hence the question of India being directed to undertake any action by suchdecisions does not arise. India, for its part, abides by commitments to the UNFCCC in letter and spirit. India with more than 17% of the global population has contributed only about 4.37% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019. Even though we are not part of the problem, India is committed to being part of the solution and has done far more than its fair share. Indias commitment to emission intensity reduction of the economy isan economy-wide target and not specific to any sectors including transport and energy sectors. The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC),which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specificareas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs)consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. The Government stands committed to combating climate change through its several programmes and schemes.Many such efforts are underway and include, inter-alia, initiatives to accelerate the renewable energy transition, decarbonisation of transport and adoption of electric mobility,etc. The government has announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission with the goal to make India a global hub for Green Hydrogen production and export. The Government, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, notified production linked incentive scheme for manufacturing advanced chemistry cells and for automobiles andauto components. India has leapfrogged from Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) to Bharat Stage-VI (BSVI)emission norms by April 1, 2020, which was earlier to be adopted by 2024. Indiascurrent share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40%. Under UnnatJyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, a total of 36.79 croresLED bulbs have been distributed to enhance energy efficiency as on date. India has announced a voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles, which will help in encouraging fuel-efficient and environment-friendly vehicles. Indian Railways has taken a number of initiatives including setting up Dedicated Freight Corridors, further railway electrification, improving energy efficiency in traction, and increasing the share of renewable energy. Indian Railways has set a target of making itself net zero by 2030. This information was given by Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in Rajya Sabha today. \"

These visits continue the work of the UK COP Presidency to press for updated climate commitments from all countries ahead of COP27 in Egypt, aligned with the crucial goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. In Viet Nam (13-15 February), Mr Sharma met Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Tran Hong Ha - Viet Nam's Chief Negotiator for climate change, and Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien, and Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung. Mr Sharma welcomed the ambitious commitments made by Prime Minister Chinh at COP26 , including a 2050 net zero commitment and endorsing the 'Coal to clean power transition' statement. He underlined the UK's determination to work with Viet Nam to achieve its commitments and to put forward a 2030 climate action plan that aligns with the 1.5 degree goal. The COP President also acknowledged the scale of the task to deliver the public investment needed for Viet Nam to transition to clean energy, and the finance needed to provide dedicated support to Viet Nam to support its ambitious climate commitments. This includes the potential for support through the 'Clean Green Initiative', which aims to help developing countries take advantage of green technology and grow their economies sustainably. In a meeting with members of civil society, Mr Sharma explored the opportunities and challenges for their organisations and Viet Nam in responding to climate change, and emphasised that active engagement with these organisations was key to the success of COP26 and will be vital in delivering the commitments of the Glasgow Climate Pact. He also hosted a roundtable with representatives from international companies to discuss the vast potential of renewable energy in the country. This potential is highlighted in the UK-chaired Energy Transition Council report on coal abatement, which highlights that by switching to wind, solar and gas, by 2030 Viet Nam can reduce 59% of emissions, create 280,000 jobs and save $120bn of fuel imports. In Indonesia (15-17 February), Mr Sharma met the coordinating Ministers of Maritime Affairs and Investment, and Economic Affairs, and the Ministers for Finance, and Energy and Mineral Resources, thanking each for Indonesia's strong presence at COP26 . Mr Sharma welcomed the Indonesian government making climate action a key priority for their G20 Presidency and pledged the UK's support in encouraging all G20 countries to keep to the commitments made in the Glasgow Climate Pact. This follows fresh UK announcements made at COP26 working with Indonesia and the wider region on nature and biodiversity, climate resilience, renewable technologies, and UK funded green investments to support clean infrastructure projects. With huge renewable energy resources that could power all the country's electricity needs more than five times over, Mr Sharma also said that Indonesia can become a regional and global leader in low carbon energy technologies and innovation, creating new industries and jobs. On the final day in Indonesia, Mr Sharma visited the seawall in Jakarta to speak to flood experts and communities on efforts to increase the city's resilience to land subsidence. Extreme weather and sea level rises linked to climate change may make addressing this challenge even more difficult, emphasising the need for support for countries to build resilience to climate change. COP President Alok Sharma said: The Glasgow Climate Pact is making its mark in South East Asia. Vietnam and Indonesia are set on a net zero future. COP26 was a fragile win and in 2022 we need countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to honour their commitments and revisit their 2030 emissions reduction targets this year. I welcome the climate leadership Prime Minister Chinh demonstrated at COP26 , including the vital goal to reach net zero by 2050. It was beneficial to discuss in person how the UK can work with Viet Nam to achieve these ambitious targets, particularly around how improvements in their grid infrastructure could be transformational and help deliver a 2030 plan that aligns with the 1.5 degree temperature limit. On Indonesia, Mr Sharma said: Indonesia, as G20 President, has a vital role to play in ensuring countries deliver what they promised in Glasgow. The transition to a net zero economy represents an enormous economic opportunity to every country and sector. Net zero has become the guiding light for modern, competitive growth. As a fast growing economy with significant renewable energy potential, Indonesia has the opportunity to become a climate leader and accelerate the transition from coal power. We and other G20 partners are keen to support and recognise its ambition. \"

Right after the conference, the Government established a National Steering Committee led by PM Pham to implement Viet Nam's commitments at the COP26 . Viet Nam is stepping up efforts to further improve legal framework, build up concrete plans and roadmaps, overhaul related strategies and plans, mobilize resources for climate-resilient infrastructure in order to carry out these commitments, Pham stressed. The Southeast Asian country is also renewing its national power development plan with a focus on accelerating the development of renewable and clean energy in an appropriate and sustainable manner, Pham said. COP26 President, continue playing a role in fostering cooperation between Viet Nam and the UK and development partners to help Viet Nam realize those commitments. Pham called for support for Viet Nam to connect with the financial institutions and credit organizations capable of providing financial aid and credit for the country similar to the Just Energy Transition Partnership that the UK, France, Germany, the U.S. and the European Union signed with South Africa. PM Pham also said Viet Nam is in need of assistance to set up a domestic carbon market linked with the international one, a renewable energy center to promote human resource training, technology transfer, and sharing of legal and governance experience. Sharma, for his part, highly valued Viet Nam's strong commitments to the success of the COP26 as well as its swift and comprehensive actions to make sure that the commitments are implemented in reality. He vowed to cooperate and share experience with Viet Nam to help the country carry out the commitments, adding that energy transition process is key to realize Viet Nam's commitments as 70 percent of the country's gas emissions comes from the energy sector. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA13","Post COP26: Developing and Funding Energy Transition Projects","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 27, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com With an attendance of more than 190 world leaders, the long-awaited twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) concluded with agreement on the Glasglow Climate Pact and the Paris Rulebook. Amid mixed views of whether COP26 was a success, there was a particular focus on the international leadership's stance on the energy transition and how support for cleaner technologies can help limit the global average temperature rise to less than to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Energy transition is generally taken to refer to the global energy sector's shift to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen, while maintaining a parallel focus on ""greening"" existing energy sources such as hydrocarbons, including through the use of decarbonisation technology such as carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). This article highlights some of the key points discussed at our recent webinar titled ' COP26 - Energy transition's pivotal role in delivering climate change targets' featuring panelists Yasushi Hirai (Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)), Angela Yuen (JERA Co., Inc.), Lei Zhang (Socit Gnrale) and Tim Power (White & Case), as moderated by Paul Harrison (White & Case). In particular, we discuss how COP26 goals will affect the development and funding of energy projects and what opportunities and challenges of the decarbonisation journey lie ahead. Significant developments from COP26 Ever since COP26 COP26 really plugged into the ESG zeitgeist that's going on at the moment, driven primarily by businesses and their shareholders and investors and by capital providers, to decarbonise businesses and to pursue sustainability objectives."" He added that COP26 has provided a forum for ""public attention and government commitment to decarbonising, right at a time where businesses and financiers especially are also very much focused on achievement on the ESG front."" Key energy transition developments from COP26 included the following: Breakthrough agenda: Over 40 countries committed to accelerate the development and deployment of clean technologies and sustainable solutions with the Breakthrough Agenda. Signatories including the UK, US, Japan, India and China set goals for 2030 in five key sectors - Power, Road Transport, Steel, Hydrogen, and Agriculture. For Hydrogen, the goal is to make affordable renewable and low carbon hydrogen globally available by 2030 and for Power, it is to make clean power the most affordable and reliable option to meet power needs by 2030. Pledge to quit coal: More than 40 countries committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally; and phasing down unabated coal power in the 2030s for major economics and the 2040s for poorer nations. Pledge to end fossil fuel financing abroad: At least 20 countries agreed to end new direct international public finance for unabated fossil fuels by the end of 2022, including funding for oil and gas projects. While the US, Canada, UK and New Zealand were signatories, Asian powerhouses, China, Japan or South Korea, did not sign up. Importantly, the focus is on international finance (the countries did not rule out domestic financing) and on unabated fossil fuels. On the pledge to quit coal, Tim noted that the final language agreed was controversial, particularly in Australia. ""While the initial commitment to phase out coal was toned down [to ""phase down""], it is still, to my mind, a pretty unambiguous message that coal fire power generation has a shelf life if the emissions are unabated. And that is a big qualifier, as that leaves open carbon capture and storage or other similar technologies."" Moving toward cleaner energy technologies: A sponsor's perspective Many traditional oil & gas entities are transitioning to become ""energy companies"" - rather than moving away entirely from their traditional core business, they are supplementing their business model with investments in renewables and cleaner technologies such as hydrogen, battery storage and carbon capture. As the largest power generator in Japan with power generation capacity equivalent to half of Japan's thermal power generation output, JERA is taking a similar approach. ""On the one hand, we really are in a position to lead the transition to the green economy but on the other hand we need to strike a balance with our responsibilities to maintain a stable supply of energy,"" Deputy General Counsel, Angela Yuen said. JERA has announced a 2050 zero emissions roadmap, with a focus on greener power generation and smart technology and has entered into a large number of investments, collaborations and initiatives, both in Japan and internationally, including in hydrogen development and co-firing of ammonia. However, the transition to renewables and clean energy is not without its challenges. For renewable projects, Angela explained that common roadblocks in Japan include, for example, ""grid infrastructure, port capacity limitations, lengthy environmental processes and land constraints for onshore wind and solar projects, and collaborations with fisheries for offshore wind projects."" She added ""So for Japan to really achieve the 2030 target of 36-38% renewables as a generation source, and for there to be a pipeline of projects, the government will really need to be able to provide their policy support and to remove a lot of the regulatory constraints that prevent scaling of renewable projects."" Financing 'traditional' and 'new' projects So what does this all mean for financiers who wish to support their clients? ECAs, banks and funds who are active in the energy sector are also having their business model disrupted and are increasingly seeking to re-balance their lending and investment portfolios. For example, JBIC, the Japanese export credit agency, committed in its ESG policy announced in October 2021 to pursue efforts to achieve operational net zero by 2030 and net zero in its finance portfolio by 2050. Similarly, Socit Gnrale has become a member of the UNEP-FI Net-Zero Banking Alliance and committed to carbon neutrality in its portfolio by 2050. These public commitments are important and establish a clear direction of travel; however, in the shorter term, financial institutions are facing complex and competing demands, while navigating the uncertainties caused by the energy transition. Panelist and Socit Gnrale's Head of Energy Finance and Advisory for North Asia, Lei Zhang commented that, as financial services providers, it is critical for lenders to continue to support their clients during this period of transition. Lei saw a two part approach to the energy transition: firstly, to increase investments in renewables and clean energy to reduce carbon emissions and secondly, to take the correct approach to decarbonisation and transition to cleaner technologies one step at a time. ""Ultimately, we do need to service the real economy, we do need electricity and we do need to supply and fuel homes,"" he added. In the world of traditional project financing, lenders rely heavily on projections based on historical data including past performance of project technologies. With new technologies, however, Lei explains how lenders approach the market uncertainty and associated risks: ""For us, the key is to understand the technologies and the industry we are working with. You can make the financial structure workable depending on the project - project financing is certainly one of the tools but you can also structure financing with a combination of project financing, corporate financing and mezzanine financing. Mini-perm financing is also an option to shorten the risk period"". Lei added, ""We recognize that different decarbonisation and energy transition technologies are required for different stages of projects and once technology is scaled up and proven, more finance options will become available."" Director of JBIC's Corporate Planning Group, Yasushi Hirai agreed with this sentiment and highlighted the importance of growing energy demand in emerging markets going forward: ""Given the emerging markets, we will be seeing a growing energy demand as these countries' operations become bigger in the future. Energy transition, especially in Asia, will be the key and I strongly believe divestment in the traditional energy sectors alone would not be the solution in this space. JBIC will continue to engage with host countries and government authorities to support their pathway toward a decarbonised society and their energy transition efforts."" JBIC's ESG policy sets out JBIC's continued efforts to help achieve a sustainable energy economy. Hirai-san explained that the key tools that JBIC will deploy to meet these objectives include ""scaling up green finance, transition finance and social finance and issuing green bonds. By doing these things, we will be aligning our financial flows with the principles set out under the Paris Agreement."" Even with these guidelines in place, Hirai-san notes that a fundamental question remains: ""Whether there will be enough energy projects in these emerging markets to absorb the financial flows?"" Cautious but hopeful optimism When considering energy transition in the context of an event like COP26 , the elephant in the room is always the lack of concrete progress following previous summits. However, despite the failure to make headway in the past, the panelists were cautiously optimistic about COP26 . They took the view that greater public awareness and the stronger global alignment of interests and governmental policies in respect of the energy transition made the goals set out by world leaders at COP26 seem more realistic than in the past. However, the energy transition will need to be carefully planned and invested in and all participants in the energy space have a key role to play. In Tim Power's words, ""We can't wave a magic wand and fix it today but we can start planning for the future now. And that will require investment and testing. We will have some wins and we will make some mistakes. It will not be a linear process."" While there is still a long way to go, there are certainly steps being taken in the right direction on the energy transition journey.

The extraordinary opportunity was facilitated by Leah Dundon, director of the Vanderbilt Climate Change Initiative, who secured for Vanderbilt official United Nations Observer status in 2019. The U.N. accreditation enabled Vanderbilt students to attend the conference for a second year, in part through an interdisciplinary AandS Honors Seminar on climate change taught by Dundon. ""Attending these climate change negotiations is an incredible experiential learning and discovery opportunity for students,"" said Dundon, also a lecturer in the Earth and environmental science department. ""Our group had the opportunity to interact with a wide range of climate scientists, researchers and government leaders and present their own work on the world stage in front of a diverse and sophisticated audience."" Left to right: Lily Hauptman and Sammy Knoblauch participated in a briefing with U.S. State Department negotiators. Vanderbilt students had the opportunity to ask questions. Graduate students Madeline Allen and Charles Doktycz presented on their work with the NSF-supported Youth Environmental Alliance in Higher Education, a project that connects institutes around the world to provide integrated knowledge to students, equipping them to address complex global environmental problems. Undergraduate Robin Young presented at ""Live from the COP,"" a YEAH event that brings COP26 developments to YEAH students around the globe who were not able to attend in person. Dundon also presented on the YEAH network and announced Vanderbilt's new status as an official signatory to the U.N.-backed Race to Zero campaign. Dundon acknowledges that many young people are extremely distressed at the state of world, with particular concerns around climate change and the environment. ""My hope is that my students, and by extension their friends and peers, begin to reframe the problem as one that humans created, and that humans can solveand in a manner that solves other societal problems as well. There is a lot of reason to be hopeful."" ""I'm a neuroscience and MHS major, so this may seem far outside my area of study. But it's been incredible to learn in depth about how climate change is such a wide-ranging topic that's going to impact all of usand all of our careersas we move forward,"" said undergraduate participant Samantha Knoblock. ""I've gotten to explore how it's going to affect my own path, but also to learn from my peers in their different disciplines about how it will affect theirs."" Dundon underscored how important it was for students to see peaceful international negotiations that spark meaningful problem solving because, while it may be easy to forget, the world is mired by a long history of addressing problems with violence and war. While the negotiation process is slow, it is extraordinarily civil and takes place within a framework centered around meaningful action, Dundon said. ""The value of this experience is not just what we're learning but how we're learning it. We're getting the chance to show up and listen and form opinions and articulate our ideas on a public stage, interacting with people we've never met from all over the world,"" Doktycz said. ""It's a crucial developmental experience that we'll take not only into the rest of our academic experience but into our lives and careers."" In one of the most exciting experiences at COP26 , Vanderbilt students engaged directly with members of the U.S. Department of State negotiating team, asking probing questions about their efforts and daily negotiating outcomes. Throughout the conference, students got to observe breakout sessions and discuss the process, strategy and mechanics of diplomatic negotiation with meeting participants. ""Seeing international diplomacy in action was an eye-opener and a first for many students,"" Dundon said. Students also engaged in the incredible programming that occurs at country and organizational pavilions, from political discussions among state governors at the U.S. Center to scientific presentations at the Science Pavilion. ""I'm a public policy major and have taken classes related to climate change and to indigenous people's rights. Seeing the way these different policy issues are coming together at this conference has been very fulfilling for me,"" said Brannen Dickson. ""This is real-life stuffit has more truth than what you read in a textbook."" Coalition building was a broad trend at COP26 . In particular, students observing a small group of negotiators discuss methane emissions were amazed to see that by week's end, what had started prior to COP26 as an announcement between the U.S. and the European Union concluded at COP26 with an additional 103 countries pledging to cut methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. Dundon's students experienced firsthand the catalyst for action that was COP26 . Dundon hopes that participating students and those in her classes have a stronger understanding of how varied and diverse climate change issues are. ""My hope is that no matter what career paths these students pursue in the future, they'll always have an appreciation for how climate change is connected to their discipline, and also retain the optimism needed to pull humanity towards an even better future."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA15","CLIMATE DIPLOMACY: COUNCIL CALLS FOR ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GLASGOW COP26 OUTCOMES","February 21, 2022 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Union: The Council today approved conclusions on 'EU climate diplomacy: accelerating the implementation of Glasgow outcomes', which stress the key importance of climate diplomacy and of EU outreach to third countries to accelerate the implementation of the COP26 outcomes in 2022. The conclusions set out that the EU and its member states, in a joint Team Europe approach, will engage with partners around the world to address the challenges linked to such implementation, and will actively work on the various COP26 sectoral initiatives and calls. In its conclusions the Council recognises that the direct and indirect effects of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation represent risks to the realisation of human rights, human and state security, undermining global peace and stability and often accelerating or deepening existing vulnerabilities and instability. In this light, the Council welcomes the increased focus by the UN on the climate, peace and security nexus, but also reiterates the need for human rights to be integrated systematically into climate action and energy diplomacy. The Council also stresses that the lack of at-scale finance for resilient and just energy transitions in middle and low-income countries remains a barrier for green and sustainable development. Therefore, the EU will continue to provide a sustainable, green and positive offer to partners for the development of trusted climate resilient energy, transport and digital infrastructure. At the same time, the EU calls on other developed countries to meet the collective commitment to mobilise $100 billion per year in 2022, and on multilateral development banks and international finance institutions to play a catalytic role in mobilising the private sector and shifting the global financial flows towards sustainable and green investments. \"

The COP (Conference of the Parties) was first held in 1995 under the ""Presidency"" of Germany. The conference has been held every year since its origin, pulling in more nations, businesses, and organizations over time, until the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, COP26 was delayed until 2021, picking up the conversation from the previous council held in Madrid, Spain, COP25, with tens of thousands of participants attending. One of the other key past conferences with which COP26 engaged was COP21, which created the Paris Agreement. The official COP26 COP26 , having been pushed from its original 2020 date, acts as the first mark of return since this plan was created. Another significant aspect of the Paris Agreement that COP26 dealt with was the goal to keep global temperature increase to a maximum of 2?, with an ideal of 1.5?. Looking at the progress toward this objective was one of the foremost focuses of the conference. The conference cited four overarching goals to be achieved: 1) Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach 2) Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats 3) Mobilise finance 4) Work together to deliver. In order to achieve the first goal, countries discussed an acceleration of phasing out the use of coal, combat against deforestation, a faster switch to electric vehicles, and more investment in renewable energy. For the second, they pushed protection and restoration of ecosystems while also creating structures to protect communities from the unavoidable consequences of climate change. For the third, they aimed to get developed countries to mobilize at least $100 billion in climate finance per year to make the first two goals actionable. For the fourth, they aimed to finalize the Paris Rulebook and set a precedent for working collaboratively. After the negotiations that took place throughout the run of the conference, many of these goals were agreed upon and courses of action were laid out. The COP26 website summarized the outcomes under four categories: Mitigation; Adaptation, Loss and Damage, Finance; and Collaboration. These categories are meant to align with their initial objectives. In regard to Mitigation, the two main goals were the 1.5? cap and reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by 2030. Approximately 70% of the world's economy is committed to the 2030 goal, and there is still hope for the 1.5? aim. ""We can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action,"" stated COP26 President Alok Sharma of Britain. The financial aspect of COP26 also included a goal for developed countries to raise $100 billion annually to support the climate change movement; the conference claims to have made significant progress toward this goal. It is now estimated that ""$500 billion will be mobilised over the period 2021-25."" COP26 delivered on the Adaptation, Loss and Damage front with finance packages related to the environment and land use. Additionally, in order to protect those who will inevitably be affected by climate change, ""80 countries are now covered by either Adaptation Communications or National Adaptation plans to increase preparedness to climate risks."" The Collaboration goal was met by the finalization of the Paris Rulebook, which offers ""the detailed rules and systems"" to make the Paris Agreement actionable. Overall, COP26 seems to have made progress towards achieving the goals it set out before the start of the conference, even if all have not yet reached ideal numbers, and they have maintained committed to transparency about the process and progress of the climate change initiatives. The next step will be seeing how actionable these ideas are and how well the commitments made hold up in an ever-shifting political landscape. \"

In addition to the dozens of Yale students, faculty, and staff taking part, alumni from the Yale School of the Environment brought their expertise to the negotiations during the two-week conference, playing a major role and making headlines in the global media. Lia Nicholson '14 MEM Nicholson was the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a United Nations bloc of 39 Small Island Developing States (SIDS) that, although economically small, constitute 20% of all U.N. Member States. Ahead of COP26 , Lia led several days of SIDS preparatory meetings to refine group positions, working closely with the fifteen AOSIS coordinators that speak on behalf of the group in each thematic negotiation. Nicholson spoke on behalf of AOSIS in the Glasgow Climate Pact negotiations, forwarding three main goals: finalizing the Paris Agreement rulebook, including the conclusion of negotiations on the carbon market mechanism and transparent reporting under the agreement; raising ambition to limit warming to 1.5-degrees, across mitigation; and securing new and additional financing that would support SIDS to cope with ongoing loss and damage due to climate change. "" COP26 COP26 decision text. Incredibly, the UNFCCC has never before singled out the words ""fossil fuels;"" usually we just talk vaguely about trajectories and pathways."" At the conference, Nicholson said she was ""extremely disappointed"" by the lack of financing for loss and damage for countries already feeling the worst effects of climate change -- remarks that made headlines in major media outlets like the BBC and The New York Times.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA18","COP26's head on the fight after the fight","Axios","Newstex Blogs ","Apr 25, 2022( Axios: https://link.axios.com/join/am-signup?source=aci https://link.axios.com/join/am-signup?source=aci Delivered by Newstex) The British politician who helped prevent a fractious United Nations climate summit from collapsing last year now faces another daunting task: keeping climate on the global agenda amid Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine. Driving the news: Alok Sharma spoke with Axios over the weekend, offering revelations about his strategy in the uphill battle to keep the Paris Agreement's targets from slipping away. The big picture: Sharma said the 1.5-degree target should remain the focus leading into the next climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November. He said his game plan is to push for climate change sessions at meetings of world leaders or ministers, such as the G7, to ensure climate change doesn't slip off the list of priorities.He's seeking to ensure that countries translate their pledges from Glasgow into concrete actions as soon as possible. Between the lines: ""When I've traveled around the world talking to communities on the frontlines of climate change, that's actually what they say. Literally, every ratchet up makes a difference in terms of the impact of lives and livelihoods,"" Sharma told Axios. ""So I think we have to hang on to the 1.5-degree target."" Threat level: Sharma's main concern right now is the lack of ""bandwidth"" that leaders have due to the war in Ukraine, and ensuring a continued focus on global warming solutions. Policymakers need to know climate change is a ""chronic threat"" that is not going away, he said.""Every fraction of a degree makes a difference,"" he said, noting we are already at 1.1C of warming. Why it matters: Recent UN climate science panel reports[1] and other studies[2] show dim chances of limiting global warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, a Paris goal that leaders reaffirmed in Glasgow. If warming exceeds this target, research shows[3], the risk of potentially catastrophic climate impacts grows. The intrigue: Pressed further about the feasibility of the 1.5-degree Paris target, Sharma said the stakes are simply too high to abandon it. He cited an impassioned speech Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley gave[4] at COP 26. ""She said, you know, 2 degrees is £ death sentence' for her country. And it's not just her country. I mean, there are millions and millions of people across the world, for whom 2 degrees will be a death sentence,"" Sharma said. ""We have to do absolutely everything we can to hang to that target of 1.5 and keep pressing and pressing,"" instead of moving to another target. Yes, but: Time is an issue, but Sharma emphasizes positive signs like the plunging costs of renewables. ""This is going to be the decisive decade, right? So the moment of truth will be upon us over the next few years,"" Sharma said. Sharma on the next transition partnership During COP 26, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and the European Union unveiled an $8.5 billion initiative[5] to help transform South Africa's electricity sector away from coal and toward renewables. Sharma said policymakers are currently exploring options for another transition partnership, with some of the discussions focused on Southeast Asia. Countries such as Indonesia are heavily reliant on coal for their electricity, for example. Vietnam has also come up in energy policy circles as a possible partnership country, though Sharma would not name any specific nations under consideration.""I think what we would like to do, ideally, is to be able to announce in principle some more of those types of transition plans by the time we get to Sharm el-Sheikh,"" Sharma told Axios, referring to COP 27 in November.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA19","COP26 goals an opportunity, not a challenge, says PM","The Hindu Business Line","Newstex Blogs ","Mar 04, 2022( The Hindu Business Line: HYPERLINK http://www.thehindubusinessline.com New Delhi, March 4 STATES The pledges made by India at COP26 , including increasing the mix of non-fossil fuels in energy mix to 50 per cent by 2030, is not a challenge, but an opportunity that can drive the world's third largest oil consumer to adopt sustainable practices, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. 'Today's theme of 'Energy for Sustainable Growth' is not only inspired by our traditional knowledge, but will also lead the future of the country. I consider the COP26 goals of achieving the Net Zero target not as a challenge, but as an opportunity. By 2030, India has set the target of extracting 50 per cent of its energy from non-fossil fuels. It is our opportunity to shift to more sustainable practices,' Modi said while addressing a budget webinar. Emphasising the need to focus on energy efficiency, the Prime Minister said the Union Budget 2022-23 has shown light on the battery swapping policy that can scale India's energy efficiency capabilities. Hydrogen ecosystem 'We need to focus on building a hydrogen ecosystem in which the private sector can play a pivotal role. We must develop sustainable and innovative business models to improve efficiency in the EV ecosystem,' he added. Modi point out that the government's scaling up production of LEDs had resulted in prices of such bulbs coming down. Besides, under the UJALA scheme, the common man has also been able to save over Rs. 20,000 crore in electricity bills, he noted. 'Four pilot projects for coal gasification and conversion of coal into chemicals required for the industry will be set up to evolve technical and financial viability. With the coming years, India's energy demands will increase, therefore, we must transition to renewable energy,' the Prime Minister stressed. Suggesting coming out with innovative methods to increase awareness on solar power, Modi said every household should develop its own solar tree that can contribute to saving up to 15 per cent electricity. It will not only be unique, but also environment-friendly. 'The intent of this seminar is to focus on the implementation of the new budget schemes, and to chalk out ways by which we can begin execution that is effective and concrete. We have to focus on the seamless implementation of the Budget to benefit the masses. These seminars are designed for industries to come up with innovative solutions that can give optimum outcomes of this year's Budget,' he stressed.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA20","How did COP26 help business move towards a net-zero economy?","February 4, 2022 Friday","McKinsey & Company","HYPERLINK https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/future%20of%20asia/videos/how%20did%20cop26%20help%20business%20move%20towards%20a%20net%20zero%20economy/standard-india-sustainability-video.jpg Link to Image I thought I might kick off by sharing a few reflections on how far COP26 helped us move towards a net-zero economy, and what some of the implications to business are. These remarks are really formed by four different sets of insights. In the year running up to COP, we helped create the fact base on two of the major themes that were discussed in Glasgow: firstly, around mobilizing capital for the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero group; and secondly, we worked with high-level UN climate champions to really put a fact base together around resilience. Thirdly, in the run-up to COP, we created partnerships with people like the Mission Possible Partnership and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development to better understand some of the most difficult parts of the problem-those hard to abate sectors-and we tried to lay out what some of the pathways might look like there. Lastly, we convened a major program of events in Glasgow. More than 1,000 field leaders from around the world joined our program in person, more than 10,000 watched it and interacted with us live on McKinsey.com, and more than 100,000 engaged with the content on social media. We built all of those perspectives into the view that we have now. Over the two months since COP, I've spoken to around 1,500 leaders around the world sharing these perspectives; gathering their input and refining our points of view as we go. The net-zero transition The transition to a net-zero economy is certain to be complicated, messy, and hard. Anyone who looks at the outcomes of COP26 will see there is still a huge amount that needs to get done, but our overall view is that COP26 was a more important step forward than is visible in much of the media and activist response. That step forward sets a clear challenge for business, which is how to create strategic resilience in an era of certain volatility. I'd like to just pick into both of those assertions in a little bit more detail-firstly, on why we think COP26 was a more important step forward than many think. Much of the commentary around COP26 has focused on adding up the temperature implications of the many thousands of different commitments that were made there. You can see ranges of estimates from 1.8\'b0C to 2.1\'b0C, 2.4\'b0C, 2.7\'b0C temperatures. COP26 had. We think COP26 was an important milestone because really, the debate has now shifted from whether we need to make this transition, to how we need to do it. And capital is starting to form to press the pace. So, the capital markets are now integrated in a way that they weren't before COP. We think that is going to build momentum quickly from hereon in, and the clarity of that demand signal is what sets up this fundamental challenge for business. If I think about how to simplify the message from COP, rather than think about the thousands of different announcements, I'll point to five things we think really mattered. First is the breadth and comprehensiveness of net-zero pledges now: more than 90 percent of global emissions-with India and Nigeria being the two largest countries to step up during COP26 -and more than 5,000 companies have now signed up to the race to net-zero. Secondly, the movement on coal. Of course, there's been plenty of debate about coal and what happened in the last few days of COP, with most people thinking that the watering down of the pledge around coal was a bad thing. I choose to see what was agreed on coal as a first and a clear step toward an eventual post-coal economy. Thirdly, the US-China bilateral was really important because it spoke to action this decade, recognizing the urgency with which we need to move, and because it identified technologies that the US and China would work on together to scale-things like carbon capture and storage. The fourth thing that we thought was important was that you will have seen a series of agreements that moved beyond carbon, tackling methane, deforestation, electric vehicle adoption, and so on, with groups of 50, 70, 100+ countries agreeing to work in these areas. This sets the foundation for the next generation of the agenda. Then the fifth thing we thought mattered was the extra prominence that resilience against climate hazards was given in the narrative. We think that has been overlooked in the past but is now starting to get the cut-through that is important. Even if global emissions stop tomorrow, we know, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last August, that the inertia in the earth's systems will mean that temperatures will continue to increase. So, resilience is an important issue that received more prominence in COP. All of those things were supported by the mobilization of capital in greater quantities than we've seen before. Now, there is a paradox around capital because, on the one hand, capital mobilization is likely to be inflationary. There is, in a way, too much capital for the amount of supply that is available. On the other hand, recently published McKinsey research has shown that the amount of capital that's been raised is less than is needed by quite a significant amount. We believe that around $9.2 trillion of capital every year will be needed over the next 30 years to deliver an orderly transition to a net-zero economy. So, there is a short- and long-term paradox about capital, but nevertheless, COP showed that we could really start to mobilize more than we have in the past. Net-zero is becoming an organizing principle for business. Now, organizations need to turn their pledges into plans and to demonstrate some form of credible traction against those plans. The need for this capital to find a home, we believe, will create an environment of certain volatility. Firstly, because demand for green materials will exceed our ability to supply. Secondly, because we live in a more fractious world and regrettably, the flash points in that fractious world also overlap with the parts of the world that are often exposed to climate hazards. So, we're going to see political and governmental pressure brought to bear. Thirdly, because customer habits and regulations are going to change in different ways, in different speeds around the world. So, it is certain to be a volatile mix. How companies can prepare for the transition to a net-zero economy We think that gives four main things for business to be thinking about to thrive or to create strategic resilience in this era of certain volatility. The first is that as organizations seek to turn pledges into credible plans, the importance of a change narrative is greater than ever before. Companies will need to articulate a north star for their organizations that can sustain the confidence of investors and colleagues, even while there are bumps along the way. Secondly, we think there's an opportunity to reinvent finance. In a world of raw material volatility and supply chain fragility, we think finance is the place that can think about hedging of raw completed prices, futures contracts, and how companies can get supply of green materials when their competitors can't. Essentially, more sophisticated ways of thinking about scenario planning so you can allocate your capital in a thoughtful way. And finally, perhaps building greater circularity into business models to act as a buffer against raw material price exposure. The third thing we think is important for organizations is to think about how to use the sustainability imperative to complete the digitization of their organizations. If you don't know how to begin on a sustainability journey, one of the places to look is the adoption of digital techniques-analytics, automation, AI, the things that have been proven at scale, but not yet fully adopted-from the last decade. We also think the technology that will scale in the coming decade will allow us to account for carbon in supply chains, the scope three carbon emissions, and will give much greater transparency about supply chain performance. This will be the catalyst for the next era of supply chain productivity improvement. Finally, we think that organizations should think about how to build their physical resilience to climate hazards. When we were doing our work with the race to resilience, we were shocked at how few executives were able to articulate how fragile their assets and supply chains are to climate hazards, how that will change, and how that differs to their competition. So, that's a very quick view of our reflections on COP26 ; an important step forward because it sets the demand signal. But we're not naive-we recognize there's a huge amount that needs to be done, both to increase the pledges and to put substance behind the pledges that have been made. But the demand signal now sets an environment for business, and an environment that has a challenge, which is how to create strategic resilience in an era of certain volatility.

On March 2022, Business Today, a Taiwan-based financial journal which has long focused on the connection between ESG and industry, held the 2nd ESG & Sustainability Taiwan International Summit. More than 350 government and industry leaders participated in the event, including officials from the Financial Supervisory Commission and the Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Taiwan president Tsai Ing-Wen delivered a speech at the forum. President Tsai Ing-Wen said in her speech that the Net-Zero 2050 target is not only a challenge for the world, but also for Taiwan. She stressed that despite a number of tough challenges, it behooves Taiwan to boost its net-zero transformation by way of a four-pronged approach: first, research into new energy sources such as hydrogen and forward-looking green energy must be undertaken to maintain the energy transition; second, industrial transformation from process optimization to the use of renewable energy must be accelerated to meet changing market conditions; third, a transition to low-carbon public buildings and net-zero emission transportation is a necessary lifestyle change that must be adopted; and fourth, fairness is a must for public engagement in society transformation. The summit also invited global experts to present an ESG development roadmap to corporate leaders and investors. Key speakers included Robert N. Stavins, A. J. Meyer Professor of Energy & Economic Development, John F. Kennedy\~School of Government, Harvard University, who spoke about his insights into post- COP26 climate policies, and Todd Cort, co-director at Yale Center for Business and the Environment, who elaborated on the carbon trading market after COP26 . The two speeches were delivered online. From the standpoint of financial companies, Wing Fung Financial Group chairman Sih-Kuan Chen pointed out that Climate Action has emerged as the most widespread global consensus of all time, and that companies need to integrate four ""imperatives"" into their net-zero strategies: compliance, optimization, reinvention and leadership. Wing Fung is committed to realizing net-zero emission goals from operations by 2030 and from the whole asset portfolio by 2050. Ying-Chou Chen, head of Sustainability Services Group, Deloitte & Touche, said that there are two ways to cope with climate change: on the one hand by operational procedures and/or production facilities are modified to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while, at the same time, energy efficiency is enhanced by developing new carbon reduction technologies, on the other hand, by taken precautionary measures to protect the enterprise from the impact of climate change in the future. China Petrochemical Development Corporation (CPDC) chairman Ruey-Long Chen noted that in response to future industrial demand, the priority of the current existing green power supply should be to improve carbon output from the process side and upgrade existing equipment to reduce energy consumption. He further added that the amount of water vapor being used by the petrochemical industry is excessive, and that its use should be curtailed or even cut to zero. Alex Araujo, fund manager of global equities at M&G Investment, mentioned that the influx of money into sustainability funds has led to an overvaluation of clean and renewable energy businesses, and, should the current boom falter, investors are likely to face huge losses. Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation (TDCC) president Hsiu-Ming Lin pointed out that TDCC is the world's first IR platform to provide ESG ratings of individual and institutional investors, a measure that has become highly valued by foreign investors. The platform has become one of the region's key ESG data sources. Taiwan Housing Group president Pei-Ye Peng said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) act as the backbone of Taiwan's economy, and what they can bring to the table is something we need to think about. Taiwan Housing is now promoting a 10-year tree-planting initiative, as a way of demonstrating to employees that the company they work for is operating with a long-term perspective. Pension Fund Association chairperson Professor Li-Ling Wang noted that the ESG investment market has continued to expand and that, post pandemic, investors have been paying more attention to ESG. Over 90% of large institutional investors and pension funds have increased their ESG investments, showing the importance of ESG in future investing decisions.

Recovery packages and policies to address the impacts of the pandemic must also bolster climate action and promote the transformative changes we need to realize the objectives of Paris and Glasgow as well as the SDGs  , upheld the ECOSOC chief. \' Best tool\' forward General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, acknowledged that COP26 outcomes fell short of what was hoped for.  We saw this in watered down language and in climate targets that had yet to reach the ambition needed [and] in the wide gap between promises and the policies needed to deliver upon those promises , he explained. On the other hand, he continued, solace was found in the fact that steps were taken to keep 1.5C alive, and to ensure that humanity reaffirmed its trajectory.  What we need now is to agree on the pace, and to implement the measures to accelerate and get there , he said. He also affirmed that COP26 outcomes remain  our best tool going forward . \' Building a bridge\' The Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change body ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/ UNFCCC ), Patricia Espinosa, highlighted that during COP26 , parties  built a bridge between good intentions and measurable actions to lower emissions, increase resilience and provide much-needed finance.  Now, we must build on this momentum to push actions forward in 2022 , she said. Meanwhile, Selwin Hart, Special Adviser for Climate Action noted that from strong commitments to achieve the 1.5C goal to doubling adaptation finance, Glasgow demonstrated some  real progress . However,  we are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe and must go into the emergency mode to protect lives and livelihoods , he argued, urging everyone to  get to work and make 2020s a decade to accelerate climate action  . \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA23","COP26: Hydrogen in the spotlight","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 01, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com Hydrogen featured heavily at COP26 , providing cause for optimism for the transition toward a low-carbon hydrogen economy. This alert highlights key hydrogen developments that emerged during COP26 . The global push toward a hydrogen economy In recent years the global push toward a hydrogen economy has gained momentum as the focus on climate change has intensified. Hydrogen is poised to play a key role in the energy transition. The rapid deployment of large-scale renewables and the falling cost of electrolysers means that hydrogen could deliver reliable baseload power with a low carbon footprint. Further insight on the developing global hydrogen economy is provided in our Hydrogen Economy Series[1] and our Global Hydrogen Guide[2], which tracks and monitors hydrogen-related regulatory developments and incentives across the globe. Hydrogen took centre stage at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ("" COP26 ""). Most national pavilions ran hydrogen-related events, and many used the conference to highlight their respective hydrogen strategies or plans. COP26 also served as the platform for some of the most significant global discussions to date on the use of hydrogen as an energy source. As a complement to the official COP26 conference programme, Climate Action (a global media and events platform) also held a Hydrogen Transition Summit at which key policy, investment, technology, regulator and government stakeholders discussed opportunities, initiatives and obstacles relating to the transition to a low-carbon hydrogen economy. Hydrogen developments at COP26 Several hydrogen-related commitments and initiatives were announced during COP26 : Breakthrough Agenda A key outcome of COP26 was the Breakthrough Agenda - a commitment endorsed by 42 countries to work together in the 2020s to accelerate actions needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals (which include keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius). The Breakthrough Agenda launched four separate goals known as the Glasgow Breakthroughs which ""aim to make clean technologies and sustainable solutions the most affordable, accessible and attractive option in each emitting sector globally before 2030."" The Glasgow Breakthroughs include a 'hydrogen breakthrough' goal which is to ensure affordable low-carbon hydrogen is globally available by 2030. As the global hydrogen market remains nascent, a key tool in the push for a globalised hydrogen economy is market research. To this end, COP26 delegates sought to co-opt global bodies such as the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency (""IRENA"") to lead an assessment of progress toward the achievement of the hydrogen breakthrough, including by providing detailed evidence of hydrogen production costs, volumes and affordability. Based on this collection of evidence, it was surmised, a robust and market-tested framework for hydrogen project development could be assembled. Green Hydrogen Toolbox The World Economic Forum and IRENA launched a jointly-developed suite of policy recommendations titled 'Enabling Measures Roadmaps for Green Hydrogen'. Nicknamed the 'Green Hydrogen Toolbox', the roadmaps aim to empower policymakers to prioritise policies for green hydrogen and accelerate its deployment at the international level in pursuit of a net zero energy system. National commitments and international partnerships The United Arab Emirates and Germany signed a declaration of intent to expand their cooperation on green hydrogen. The UAE separately announced its 'Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap' and is targeting a 25% global market share of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030. Japan announced a US$100 million investment for the conversion of fossil-fired plants into ammonia- and hydrogen-based plants. The European Commission announced a partnership between the European Investment Bank and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, which will mobilise up to \€ 820 million (US$1 billion) between 2022-2026 to accelerate the deployment of technologies to deliver on the European Green Deal's ambitions and the EU's 2030 climate targets. Industry announcements A range of industry players also seized the opportunity presented by COP26 to announce notable hydrogen initiatives and projects. Key themes in the hydrogen transition The Hydrogen Transition Summit which was held alongside COP26 featured a full day of events focussed on embracing hydrogen as a core component of the road to net zero. Key themes included: The market for low-carbon hydrogen While much of the current global discussion on hydrogen has focussed on the prospects for hydrogen production, as discussed on the hydrogen panel session White & Case recently hosted with ENGIE, BNP Paribas, Arup and InterContinental Energy[3], a hydrogen market can only function where there is adequate demand for the hydrogen produced. Demand and supply side initiatives need to be actively pursued in tandem to facilitate the success of a hydrogen economy. Removal of barriers for producers Promoting the hydrogen transition Carbon pricing - establish a market-based price on carbon in domestic markets (with the potential to develop international pricing); Carbon trading markets - work with industry to scale up carbon trading markets in order to unlock low-carbon hydrogen's value potential; Financial support - offer government support in the form of grants, subsidies, loans, R&D investments contracts for difference, and domestic and multinational public-private partnerships; Facilitate international trade - form bilateral and multilateral partnerships to facilitate international hydrogen trade; and Political vision - work with industry partners to establish a comprehensive hydrogen strategy to guide the design and implementation of measures aimed at supporting the transition to a low-carbon hydrogen-based economy. Hydrogen guarantee of origin certification The establishment of 'guarantee of origin' certification schemes to verify the source of low-carbon hydrogen is considered an important catalyst toward a hydrogen economy. Ideally, this would tie into existing and prospective carbon trading frameworks in order to unlock a key financial incentive for transitioning to low-carbon hydrogen. The role of transition fuels 'Grey' hydrogen (produced via methane steam reformation, with carbon emissions) and 'blue' hydrogen (grey, combined with carbon capture and storage) were discussed as transition fuels on the path to more widespread use of green hydrogen. The productive capacity for grey and blue hydrogen already exists, and scaling up these systems may be easier than starting from scratch with green hydrogen. Additionally, grey and blue hydrogen are currently cheaper than green hydrogen, and embracing lower-cost hydrogen now could help create a broader market for hydrogen, which could in time transition to green hydrogen. Outlook COP26 COP26 has given the industry momentum to drive the policy reform, innovation and partnerships necessary for the realisation of a hydrogen economy. COP26 has provided governments with a key reference point for the development of domestic hydrogen markets, and has reinforced the truly global nature of this industry. If the momentum is seized, COP26 may well be remembered as the conference that finally catalysed international cooperation toward the development of a low-carbon hydrogen-based economy.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA24","I SAW COP26 FAIL FIRSTHANDHERE'S WHAT WE NEED FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE","February 16, 2022 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by American Jewish World Service (AJWS): Posted by Sostine Namanya COP26 ), an annual United Nations meeting in which countries around the world discuss ways to slow the onset of global climate change. I attended with support from AJWS, and I was one of the few women, one of few activists for rural women farmers and one of even fewer African women to attend. I found it outrageous that I and other activists like me spoke at press conferences and side events but were not in the room when negotiations were taking place. Through my work in Uganda with the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE), a national environmental organization supported by AJWS, I have witnessed the impacts of climate change firsthand. I've seen flooding caused by climate change that has displaced over 100,000 people. I've seen large-scale sugar plantations, oil pipelines and other climate-changing developments destroy farmlands and ecosystems and displace local communities. The examples are too abundant to count. The rural women farmers and other community members I work with know how to farm sustainably and manage forests to keep them healthy so they can absorb the emissions that are causing climate change. The rural people in my community know that they are the least responsible for climate change but bear the brunt of its impacts. They know that we must transition away from dirty fossil fuels and toward a renewable energy future, and that those countries emitting the most must change course and support those who are most impacted by their decades of high emissions. We know that climate policy must be informed by the needs of the majority of people on Earth and not private-sector profits. Sadly, at COP26 COP26 fell completely short, and what we can doin the narrowing window of time we have to support the leadership of those closest to the climate crisis in the Global South and ensure global climate justice in the future. We cannot eat oil, and sugar will not feed our children Fossil fuel executives were at the negotiating table at COP26 , but not the small-scale farmers and other communities directly impacted by climate change. So it's no surprise that a basic truth went unacknowledged: we cannot eat oil, and sugar alone will not feed our children. If there is anything that the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us in Uganda, as well as many other places in the Global South, it is that rural women farmers are the ones who feed us during good times and crises alike. When airports and supermarkets shut down and started running out of food, it was rural women farmers who kept communities fed, and in a way that is environmentally sustainable. When their land is taken from them by oil companies or mega industrial farms aiming to grow commodities like sugar cane or palm oil, an important community food source is taken away and our climate is threatenedas food must be trucked, shipped or flown long distances to communities that used to feed themselves from their own backyards. Across Uganda, subsistence farmers who make up about 80% of the national population are being evicted by armed Ugandan forces to make way for foreign mining companies, oil drilling, plantations and resorts. Biodiverse forests and national parks are being sold to the highest bidder. The tropics, where trees grow fastest due to the regularity of sunlight, is our planet's hope, yet, according to Uhuru Institute for Social Development in Kampala, Uganda only has 10% forest cover now. Forests are the lungs of the Earth, as they absorb the carbon dioxide that is warming our climatea natural feat that monoculture agriculture is incapable of performing. Cutting pristine indigenous forests and replacing them with palm oil plantations is driven by capitalism, and is part of the shortsighted, profit-driven development that got us into the climate crisis in the first place. We must wake up to this reality and change course quickly. We must do more to limit the planet's warming Most importantly, the Glasgow Climate Pact, the global agreement reached at COP26 , fails to get the world on track for keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, the level of warming above which scientists generally agree will contribute to even more devastating catastrophic impacts on our planet. Measures like carbon trading and ""net zero"" targets are not real solutions for mitigating the climate crisisthey simply create a massive escape hatch for countries and companies in the Global North to keep emitting carbon as long as they ""offset"" it. The offsetting activities often involve acquiring large tracts of land in the Global Southsometimes through displacing the communities who reside thereand converting them into ""forest"" plantations that may later be used for timber. Perhaps most outrageously, the Glasgow Climate Pact still allows continued fossil fuel use, only calling for phasing down of unlimited coal burning. It also leaves open the possibility of coal usage with carbon capture and storage, which is still an unproven technology and could harm ecosystems. It also allows for governments to continue to provide fossil fuel subsidies to oil and coal companies, only calling for phasing down of ""inefficient"" subsidies. We must end all subsidies for dirty energy, prioritizing renewable sources instead. Solutions must right historical wrongs The agreements coming out of COP26 let Global North countries off the hook for reducing their emissions and do not provide financing for Global South countries to develop their economies with renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. The Glasgow Pact calls for global emissions cuts without recognizing that countries in the Global Northwhich have done exponentially more to cause climate change by emitting the lion's share of global greenhouse gas emissionshave the wealth and the responsibility to cut their own emissions. Instead, the Global North continues to perpetuate climate colonialism, emitting climate-changing greenhouse gases like there is no tomorrow, while expecting people of color to bear much of the burden of reducing global emissionseven as many lack access to electricity in their homes. This is not climate justice. Rich countriesthose responsible for skyrocketing greenhouse gas emissionsalso failed to commit to climate reparations, including financing for clean energy and adaptation to climate impacts that are sorely needed in the Global South. This is a betrayal of the millions of people suffering the most from the climate crisis. Funding for solar power that is controlled by rural communities; water management systems like community-based rainwater harvesting systems to help deal with climate-induced drought; storage facilities for seeds and sustainably grown produce; and community-led forest management are all effective solutions that deserve to be funded in the communities where I work, and across the Global South. In the United States, the US Climate Action Network has charted a pathway for what the US fair share climate commitment would be. Here is how we can achieve climate justice Despite witnessing the disappointing failure of COP26 firsthand, I remain hopeful that we can slow the worsening of the climate crisis and begin to achieve climate justice for those around the world who most suffer its impacts. When demanding action for climate justice, let's call upon our leaders to: Phase out fossil fuel extraction, production and use and end all fossil fuel subsidies Create binding agreements to stop deforestation and industrial farming on indigenous lands and existing forests Fund real climate justice solutions, such as sustainable farming and agroecology, legal recognition of community land rights, community-controlled renewable energy sources and the indigenous management of forests Sostine Namanya is the Gender and Food Security Officer at the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE). \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA25","Journalism professor gives climate talk","April 30, 2022 Saturday","Old Gold and Black: Wake Forest University","On April 14, Justin Catanoso - author and Wake Forest journalism professor - spoke at a Great Decisions forum to address global policies that slow down the impact of climate change.\~ The talk was held in Scales Fine Arts Center as a part of the ""Great Decisions Series"", a national foreign policy education program sponsored by the non-partisan Foreign Policy Association.\~ Catanoso described potential policies that inspire hope for the future, since he believes most international efforts thus far have been ineffective.\~\~ Catanoso recounted his travels across the globe to participate in many U.N. Climate Summits -- conferences that bring together leaders of governments and corporations around the world to discuss solutions to climate change.\~ These conferences are often referred to as ""COPs"", or Conference of the Parties. During Catanoso's first conferences - COP20 and COP21 - the U.N. formed and signed the Paris Agreement, which set limitations on each country's environmental impact in an effort to reduce their contributions to climate change. Catanoso left that conference believing there was immense hope for progress.\~ ""There was this amazing hope that we would continue to make this level of progress year after year,"" he said.\~ However, Catanoso expressed worldwide concern for the environment after the 2016 election, as former President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.\~ ""The climate movement, if there was one, essentially ground to a halt,"" he said.\~ According to Catanoso, with the absence of the U.S. at COP25 in 2019, the leaders that held the most power at the following conference were those whose interests lie in the destruction of the environment: Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Australia. After that conference, Catanoso's hope for future change began to fade.\~\~ ""This was the opposite direction that we needed to be going, and any of the hope that came out of Paris had dissipated,"" Catanoso said.\~ He began to describe how this lack of international cooperation spurred climate change. Following these conferences, climate scientists were shocked by the rate of impact from global warming, which was accelerating much quicker than anticipated.\~ COP26 in 2021 seemed to be the last hope to slow down global warming. With the United States back in the movement, the hope of progress was imminent. More people participated in COP26 than ever before, and tremendous progress resulted.\~\~ ""However, the progress came six years too late,"" Catanoso said. ""If this meeting had come a year or two after Paris, it would have been deemed a qualified success. But six years later, the consensus was that it was a failure."" To combat this disappearing sense of hope, Catanoso emphasized that there is still time to act - if we aggressively fight to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. He declared that there were two promising solutions resulting from COP26 : returning land rights to Indigenous communities and removing methane from the atmosphere. He also said that the tropical rainforest biome is an asset to the fight against climate change. This biome sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, generates oxygen and maintains biodiversity, among other functions.\~ He described how over the decades, deforestation has demolished the tropical rainforests at a rapid rate. To secure the land against threats of logging and deforestation, he suggests that land rights - to as much of the rainforest as possible - be returned to the Indigenous communities that reside within the rainforests.\~ During COP26 Catanoso argues that ""words must be matched by money"" to successfully implement change. For example, at COP26 , philanthropists pledged $1.7 billion to promote this legislation.\~ In terms of greenhouse gasses, Catanoso advocates that world leaders should turn their attention to methane gas. While this compound is not as abundant as carbon dioxide and dissipates faster, it is 85% more heat-trapping than carbon dioxide.\~ COP26 introduced innovations that would remove methane from the atmosphere, a technique known as global cooling. ""Removing methane already in the atmosphere is the quickest pathway to mitigating the effect of greenhouse gasses,"" Catanoso said. To do so, scientists would release a compound of iron chloride to oxidize methane gas, essentially breaking it down into CO2, which is far less heat-trapping,"" Catanoso said. This would dramatically ""speed up the natural processes that are already happening"". If accomplished, removing methane could reduce global temperatures by 0.4% or more in 20 years, putting the planet back on track by accomplishing the temperature target set by the Paris Agreement.\~ However, much like returning land tenure rights to the Indigenous, this can only be accomplished if matched by large amounts of funds for research and testing - and it must be done as fast as possible.\~ ""We've lost so much time already, and there simply is none left,"" Catanoso said.\~ Speaking directly to Wake Forest students, Catanoso urges students to use their knowledge of climate change to get involved. \~""The most important thing college students can do is vote for candidates who will make this climate action happen,"" he said. \"

From: Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP Published 21 April 2022 COP President Alok Sharma will attend World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings in Washington DC He will highlight the vital role of finance and energy transition partnerships in tackling climate change and delivery of commitments made at COP26 While in the US, Mr Sharma will also speak to students and climate activists at Tufts University in Boston on the vital role of youth activists in global efforts to tackle climate change Countries must get finance flowing for greater climate action to keep 1.5C in sight, COP26 President Alok Sharma will urge leaders at this week's World Bank and International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings. The COP26 To do this, Mr Sharma will argue the international community must move towards an energy secure and net zero future which avoids the worst impacts of climate change. Russia's illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine has added renewed urgency to the need for shared global action to phase out fossil fuels and accelerate the low carbon transition. In meetings with finance ministers, including ministers from India, Indonesia and South Africa, Mr Sharma will outline the role developed countries have to play to urgently meet the $100 billion previously pledged as well as doubling the finance for adaptation to enhance financial support from the effects of climate change for the most climate vulnerable countries. Mr Sharma will meet leaders from Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry to outline why a coherent approach is needed between governments, MDBs, and the private sector to avoid unnecessary disbursement delays and bureaucracy so finance can reach those that need it most quicker. He will also promote the South Africa Just Energy Transition Partnership, announced at COP26 , as an example of a new track to deliver climate and development finance globally, accelerating the energy transition in the highest emitting countries, expanding low carbon opportunities in emerging economies and protecting the vulnerable by reducing emissions. Mr Sharma said: The Russian President's illegal and brutal war has been a wake up call to the world, demonstrating to countries the vital importance of making the transition to homegrown green energy and embracing the economic opportunities it offers. Across the world we see renewables creating good, green jobs and connecting people to reliable low cost power for the first time. What we now need to do is support developing countries to make this transition. The South Africa Just Energy Transition partnership is a great example of this. I am here in Washington DC to push further to see whether we can get further such deals announced by COP27. If we want to make the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C a reality, we have to get finance flowing and push developed countries, MDBs and private finance to deliver on their finance commitments. Following the Spring meetings, Mr Sharma will travel to Boston to speak with students and climate leaders at The Fletcher School at Tufts University on the vital role youth and climate activists played in CO26 and how the young leaders of tomorrow are vital in global efforts to tackle climate change. Notes to editors: COP26 President Alok Sharma will speak to an audience of climate leaders, students, faculty, and the community at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, Boston in a conversation with Dean Rachel Kyte.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA28","COP26: Success or Failure?","December 1, 2021","Voice of America News","December 11, 2021 2:51 AM A month after the U.N. climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, known as COP26 , politicians, analysts and climate action advocates are taking stock of what was agreed to. And the consensus is that while substantial progress was made in a number of areas, there wasn't enough. The world still remains off track to avert a climate crisis and is falling short of limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a goal set at previous talks in Paris in 2015. And it remains off track despite deals to cut carbon and methane emissions, end deforestation, reduce the use of coal, and a renewed pledge of financing for poorer countries most vulnerable to extreme weather. Britain's own Climate Change Committee, an independent, statutory body established to advise the UK government on emission targets, says COP26 ""marked a step forward in global efforts to address climate change."" It says there was an increase in ambitions to reduce emissions across the world and it lists as achievements the ""finalization of rules on reporting emissions and international carbon trading, and the launch of a range of new initiatives and sector deals."" However, the committee added, ""How far this can be considered a success will depend on follow-up actions over the coming year and beyond."" Activists unimpressed For many climate activists, the two-week summit was just more noise. Teenage activist Greta Thunberg dubbed COP26 ""a global north greenwash festival."" But some serious analysts also agree the summit should be marked a failure, because it didn't reach the goals it set itself. ""Was COP26 a failure? If we evaluate this using the summit's original stated goals, the answer is yes, it fell short. Two big ticket items weren't realized: renewing targets for 2030 that align with limiting warming to 1.5?, and an agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal,"" Robert Hales and Brendan Mackey, academics from Australia's Griffith University, concluded in a commentary for The Conversation website. Because of a last-minute intervention by India, an agreement to accelerate the phasing-out of coal was watered down in the final communique to the much vaguer ""phasing-down"" of coal. But Hales and Mackey also say at COP26 ""there were important decisions and notable bright spots."" They say COP26 may well be seen later as the moment the world took ""an unambiguous turn away from fossil fuel as a source of energy,"" and they highlight COP26 's emphasis on the importance of mitigating damage to nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity. In a side deal at Glasgow, 124 other countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030.Other analysts praise the final pact urging countries to deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver $100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage to help them with adaptation and to develop resilient infrastructure. Many developing nations are already seeing dwindling crop yields and are experiencing devastating storms. Rob Stavins, professor of Energy and Economic Development at Harvard University, remains cautiously optimistic and says assessing COP26 's success and failure is ""both simplistic and obscures much of the purpose and function of these annual negotiations."" ""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told the Harvard Gazette. ""To continue that metaphor: It's a relay race and the fundamental thing about an individual Conference of the Parties in any given year is that you don't drop the baton when you pass it off to the next one. And this was a reasonable pass off to the next Conference of the Parties."" The next global climate talks are scheduled next year in Egypt. Stavins says before the 2015 Paris talks, the world was heading for 3.7 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of this century. After COP21, the trajectory was reduced to 2.7 degrees of warming. The updated emission reduction targets agreed to at Glasgow cut the trajectory further to 2.4 degrees Celsius. ""And then, if you add in all of the statements from countries about net zero emissions by the year 2050, as well as private industry statements, we could be at about 1.8 degrees centigrade,"" he says. That keeps the 1.5 Celsius goal within reach, the chairman of COP26 , Alok Sharma, said in his concluding remarks in Glasgow, although he noted, its ""pulse remains weak."" Who will pay? Weak or not, some worry that governments, especially Western ones, may be going too fast with decarbonizing and risk losing the support of their own populations by failing to take into account the economic impact of the monumental shifts envisaged. Opinion polls suggest that across the globe, overwhelming majorities of people see climate change as an emergency requiring radical action. But some polls in recent weeks have also suggested that when people are told what the costs to them may be to curb global warming, they are reluctant to shoulder the financial burden. COP26 saw plenty of discussions about how to fund the transition away from fossil fuel dependency to renewable, sustainable energy and how to finance projects to make countries more resilient to extreme weather. But there was little clarity about how the costs should be shared among governments (via taxation), consumers, households and the private sector. At Glasgow, major banks, investors and insurers pledged trillions in green funding in a coordinated commitment to incorporate carbon emissions into their investment and lending decisions. The commitment was made by more than 450 financial institutions across 45 countries managing assets valued at $130 trillion."" These seemingly arcane but essential changes to the plumbing of finance can move and are moving climate changes from the fringes to the forefront and transforming the financial system in the process,"" Mark Carney, a former head of the central banks of England and Canada, said when announcing the pledge. ""The architecture of the global financial system has been transformed to deliver net zero,"" he added. But some industry analysts and economists cautioned the private sector plans are far from concrete, and that significant problems remain on how to measure the carbon footprint of investment portfolios and align those measurements across international financial markets. Of particular concern is how to verify the accuracy of what banks and investors report. Others worry that financial firms are there to maximize profits for clients and shareholders and that they risk losing customers or breaching their fiduciary obligations if they fail to maintain good returns. It remains unclear at this stage how profitable green investments will be. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA30","JOINT STATEMENT FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF COP26 PRESIDENT TO EGYPT","January 15, 2022 Saturday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: Egypt-UK Joint Statement following the meeting between Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President Designate H.E. Sameh Shoukry, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environment and COP27 Ministerial Coordinator and Envoy, and COP26 President Minister Alok Sharma. From: Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP Following an open and constructive exchange of views on climate change issues, priorities, and areas for collaboration, in the follow-up to COP26 and in preparation for COP27, COP26 President Alok Sharma and COP27 President Designate Sameh Shoukry released the following statement: As the current and incoming UNFCCC COP Presidencies, we affirm our joint commitment to accelerating the fight against climate change during this critical decade. In this context, we agreed that the United Kingdom and Egypt would strengthen bilateral cooperation to fight climate change and to maintain and build on the current momentum for global climate action. We will work together in 2022 and beyond to drive ambitious implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and to deliver on the outcomes of the Glasgow Climate Pact to keep 1.5 degrees in reach and support developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering ambitious outcomes at COP27, including ensuring that it delivers for those most vulnerable to climate change. We emphasize the urgency of action required to address the gaps in ambition across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance, and the importance of responding to the best available science in this respect. We recognize that significant progress was made at COP26 , but there is much more to be done - particularly to implement commitments made. We aim to pursue a lasting legacy that ensures the UNFCCC process continues to drive ambitious action to address climate change and its impacts. Through our partnership, we will drive and support key processes, activities, and initiatives to increase ambition and implementation to achieve the goals of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. We will work together to encourage all Parties to meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and finance; requesting that by the end of 2022 parties revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions target to align with Paris temperature goals, including enhancing NDCs long term strategies and stepping up ambition therein, ensuring accelerated delivery of the $100bn and to make progress towards doubling of adaptation finance on 2019 levels, as envisaged in the Glasgow Climate Pact. We also recognize the importance of our own domestic climate action, to demonstrate leadership globally. We further recognize the opportunity our partnership offers to enhance our shared prosperity through green trade and investment opportunities. To achieve our aims, we will share experience and expertise and work closely with key partners, including the UNFCCC Secretariat and the Chairs of the Subsidiary Bodies. We will pursue inclusive leadership and engagement that leaves no issue and no one behind, and enables the voices of all Parties, civil society, and vulnerable groups, including youth and indigenous peoples, to be heard. To this end, we agree to continue close consultations in the months ahead, both on the ministerial and technical levels. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA31","The Results of COP26","National Law Review","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 29, 2021( National Law Review: HYPERLINK https://www.natlawreview.com https://www.natlawreview.com Article By Erin Grisby[1] Shannon S. Broome[2] Clare Ellis[3] Samuel L. Brown[4] Charles H. Knauss[5] Hunton Andrews Kurth[6] The Nickel Report[7] After over two weeks of conferencing, the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change ( COP26 ) concluded with the finalization of theGlasgow Climate Pact[8](the 'Glasgow Pact') listing the accomplishments of the summit. The Glasgow Pact reaffirms the long-term global goals (including those in the Paris Agreement) to hold the increase in the global average temperature to 'well below 2C' above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. It also states that limiting global warming to 1.5C requires 'rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in other greenhouse gases.' Despite agreement on overarching goals, country-specific commitments and actions will be key to achieving the stated objectives of the Glasgow Pact. A February 2021 United NationsSynthesis Report[9]on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) concluded that the Party commitments to the Paris Agreement are not on track to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Although the Glasgow Pact and the Paris Agreement are not enforceable, they are meaningful in that they guide domestic actions when the country representatives return home. The release of the Glasgow Pact comes at a time of rapidly increasing energy prices throughout Europe and the US, threatening the speed of economic recovery in many countries. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) nowestimates[10]that domestic coal use in electricity generation will rise for the first time since 2014 by 18 percent and that U.S. coal exports will also increase by 29 percent in 2021 to meet a rising global demand. China is also leaning more heavily on coal,reportedly[11]expanding mines to produce 220 million metric tons more of coal per year, a 6-percent increase from last year. Questions over the transitory nature of these energy market fluctuations could significantly affect the ability of countries to meet their emissions reduction commitments that rely upon phasing down the use of coal. In the Glasgow Pact, signatories commit to accelerating and scaling up the transition to clean energy and adverting the impacts of climate change through adaptation and the financing thereof. Its terms encourage submission of enhanced national adaptation plans and invite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the next annual COP27 in November 2022. One of the final provisions agreed upon commits to £ccelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.' National Determined Contributions. With the 2021 COP26 marking the five-year anniversary of that 2016 Paris Agreement, updatedNDCs[12]were largely anticipated. NDCs are the foundation of the Paris Agreement and reflect efforts by each country to reduce national GHG emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. NDCs are supposed to be submitted every five years and, over time, successive NDCs are expected to increase the goals for GHG emission reductions. Countries can submit NDCs at any time. Since 2016, 194 counties have submitted NDCs overall, and 13 of those countries have submitted second NDCs. Months before COP26 , in April 2021, President Bidenannounced[13]the U.S.'s updated NDC, which puts the country on a more urgent schedule to cut GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 50 percent by 2030 almost double the U.S.'s prior commitment, prompting curiosity as to whether other nations would follow suit. The U.S. is one of the top five emitters of CO2globally, along with the EU, China, India, and Russia, and the UK, according to a 2021report[14]. The EU, the U.S., and the UK all share the goal to be net zero by 2050, and the UK and the EU had already updated their NDCs in 2020 before the U.S.'s 2021 pronouncement. Coming out of COP26 , the UK has maintained its 2020 NDC pledge of reducing its emissions by at least 68 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The EU has also stood by its 2020 commitment to at least a 55-percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. For net zero goals, China's NDC commits to carbon neutrality by 2060, whereas India and Russia have reportedly announced goals for carbon neutrality in 2060 and 2070, respectively. India also set a goal of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. Other aspects of COP26 are aimed at practical implementation measures to ensure that pronounced NDCs become reality. Carbon Markets. Progress has been made on setting standards, incentives, and rules for carbon markets. Carbon markets are tools - regulatory and voluntary - that aim to cost-effectively reduce the emission of CO2and other GHGs. Rules for such markets are intended to give confidence and otherwise help guide investments in new technologies.As we previously wrote[15], COP26 would focus on a framework or 'Paris Rulebook' pursuant to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement in order to answer some key questions associated with carbon market operations, such as whether Kyoto-based credits could be relied on to meet Paris-based NDCs (i.e., double counting rules). TheArticle 6 deal[16]struck at COP26 is said to help avoid double counting of emissions reductions. Specifically, the deal allows for the use of clean development mechanisms (or CDMs) from the Kyoto Protocol that were registered on or after January 1, 2013, yet it limits both (1) the amount of such credits that can be carried over into the Paris credit system and (2) the use of such credits to the first (or first updated) cycle of NDCs, to avoid an overwhelming market supply. The deal also restricts claims of emissions reductions to those backed by 'corresponding adjustments' made at the point of authorization of an offset. Corresponding adjustments are adjustments made by the host country to its own inventory to account for the credit transfers. Adaptation. The Paris Agreement included a goal to increase adaptation efforts (e.g., global resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate-related impacts). At COP26 , over 100 organizations joined together to launch theAdaptation Research Alliance[17]aimed at effective adaption to reduce the risks posed by climate change, particularly for those most vulnerable. The conversation on adaptation often focuses on whatdevelopedcountries should be doing to assist with adaptation efforts indevelopingcountries. As a first step, the Alliance set out guidelines to help 'stimulate systemic change.' The impact principles underscore need-based research, concepts such as 'learning-while-doing' to enable adaptation action to be evidence-based and increasingly effective. Finance. Related to mitigation and adaptation is financing, namely who is going to pay for the efforts necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement commits developed countries to contributing $100 billion per year from 2020 to 2025 - from public and private sources - to assist developing countries with mitigation and adaptation. Developed countries have thus far failed to meet this goal. At COP26 , developed countries nonetheless remained committed to the $100 billion goal. Thus, the Glasgow Pact references Canada- and Germany-led efforts on the development of aClimate Finance Delivery Plan[18]that seek to provide clarity on when and how developed countries will meet the goal. Relatedly, COP26 leaderspledged[19]to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.According to the UK, the pledge includes almost$19.2 billion[20]of public and private funds. The 141 signatory countries cover approximately 91 percent of the world's forests, close to 14.25M square miles. Methane.Beyond CO2, methane, which issaid[21]to be much more potent from a global warming potential perspective, was a focus in the run-up to COP26 . Ahead of COP26 , the U.S. launched theglobal methane pledge[22]that seeks to reduce methane emissions, by at least 30 percent by 2030. The U.S. used the COP26 stage to issue its domestic policy and actionproposal[23]that would lead to achieving this goal. While many other countries supported the pledge, China, India, and Russia have yet to sign on. Coal.The UK, the host of COP26 , sought commitments from developed countries to cease using coal as an energy source by 2030 and for all nations to phase it out by 2040. As a result of COP26 , 46 countries signed onto aGlobal Coal to Clean Energy Transition Statement[24], committing to transition away from unabated coal power generation by about 2030 for 'major economies' and a global transition by roughly 2040. Additional entities, such as states, energy companies, and other organizations also signed the agreement. 'Unabated coal power generation' refers to the use of coal power that is not mitigated with technologies to reduce CO2emissions, such as Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (or CCUS).The transition statement focuses on scaling up technologies, policies, and deployment of cleaner power generation and concomitantly ceasing new permitting and construction of new unabated coal-fired power generation projects. In their statement, the signatories recognized the economic concerns associated with decarbonization through a more rapid phase-out of coal a principal concern of union officials, workers, communities, and governments in coal-dependent countries, such as South Africa. Viewed as a potential model for phase-outs, under theSouth Africa Coal Deal[25]struck at COP26 with wealthier nations, South Africa said[26]to be the 12thlargest global CO2emitter will receive $8.5 billion in aid from France, Germany, the EU, the U.S., and the UK. The deal to phase out coal prompted immediate concerns over the fate of the country's economy, workforce, and communities sustained by its mining and power industries, which provide 80 percent of power to the country. Since returning from COP26 , governments around the world face the task of planning a sure path to achieving their commitments. Questions surround how domestic and international policies and rules will evolve to implement COP26 agreements, including verification methods and metrics for involved public and private institutions.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA33","Buening: What You Need to Know About COP26","December 1, 2021 Wednesday","The Daily Utah Chronicle: University of Utah","In 1995, the first Conference of the Parties (COP) was held. Since then, world leaders have gathered to collaborate on solutions to the climate crisis. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), hosted in Glasgow, Scotland, ended in mid-November. COP26 stood apart from its predecessors because of this decade's unique urgency. Because human activity has already resulted in a 1.1 degree Celsius increase in global temperature, COP26 may have been our ""last chance"" at limiting warming to the 1.5 degree threshold established by The Paris Agreement during COP21. But COP26 What Was Accomplished? Although vastly inadequate, COP26 resulted in some steps in the right direction. Collin Rees, the U.S. Program Manager for Oil Change International and eighth consecutive COP attendee noted that COP26 focused more on loss and damages than in previous years. Climate Reparations are a critical step in recognizing climate change as a present issue, not just a future inevitability. Shockingly, COP26 COP26 achieved the bare minimum. However, notably, a public finance commitment pledged 40 countries and major development banks to ""end public finance for oil, gas and coal by the end of next year."" An alliance of countries also committed to stop exploring or permitting any new fossil fuel projects. The diplomatic initiative presented a remarkable example of the kind of tangible, near-term commitments we desperately need to reduce warming. Naturally, major polluters like the U.S. omitted the alliance. We did enter into the Glasgow Climate Pact, aimed at phasing down fossil fuel subsidies and increasing financial support for developing countries through a Climate Adaptation Fund. Developed countries pledged $356 million. Although these contributions surpassed records, they still don't reflect estimated climate needs or the disproportionate role of the first world in the creation of this problem. One of the most severe limitations of these accomplishments is that they aren't legally binding. Therefore, countries can fail to meet standards without repercussions. In the past, we've seen how this mistake aids climate inaction. For instance, the developed world pledged $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries back in 2009 - a promise that remains unfulfilled. Likewise, the Paris Agreement had ""few legal teeth,""\~despite being described as ""legally binding."" And, during the Trump administration, the U.S. easily withdrew from it. Most Exclusionary Conference COVID-19 restrictions, unaffordable accommodations and virtual inaccessibility restricted participation from nearly one-third of the Global South. Rees stated that climate talks as a whole ""continue to be an extremely inequitable space."" In COP26 , he said, we ended up with a ""COP that was more white, more Global North, more rich-country focused than ever before."" The most impacted people were excluded and polluters took center stage. More than 500 fossil fuel representatives attended in efforts to undermine aggressive action. Some of the worst polluters in the world drove negotiation blocs while civil society groups had to make their voices heard through demonstrations and powerful protests on the outside. Having fossil fuels participate in climate talks is like letting the tobacco industry run the World Health Organization's international negotiations. Wherever big oil executives go, greenwashing follows. Fittingly, climate activist Greta Thunberg described the event as a ""Global North greenwash festival."" The priorities of the conference blatantly reflected big oil interests. For instance, conversations boiled down to the phasing down of coal, which is used predominantly by developing nations. While we cannot allow for coal expansion, first-world influences used the issue to deflect from their own oil and gas divestments. Rees said ""the fact that we're focusing only on coal at the very end is a very clear sign of the influence of big oil and gas players."" India even ""repeatedly raised the motion"" to include phrasing about oil and gas, but it was ""struck down by the U.S. and U.K."" COP26 gave precedence to the same world leaders and fossil fuel corporations that have exacerbated the climate crisis for decades. The conference exemplified how environmental circles continue to fall victim to manipulative power dynamics, privilege and racism. Maintaining elitist climate negotiations will not adequately address the climate crisis. And indeed, COP26 achievements fell massively short of what's necessary. Wholly Inadequate COP26 Coalition spokesperson Asad Rehman described COP26 as the next in a chain of COPs littered with broken promises. The Biden administration dedicated 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling leases shortly after the summit ended. And as Rees said, the difference between 2.4 and 1.5 degrees of warming means ""life or death"" for many people. Remaining under the 1.5 threshold requires that the world halves its greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years. COP26 produced a far cry from those results. So, make no mistake, keeping 1.5 degrees alive requires an enormous revolution. Because final texts were hardly legally binding, it's up to us to ""hold Biden's feet to the fire,"" as Rees said. Our country can make empty commitments, but we need to demand that it upholds them. Passing the Build Back Better act is only part of the equation going forward. Even without Congress, there are about 23 new fossil fuel projects sitting on Biden's desk. ""If he stopped them,"" which he could tomorrow with the ""stroke of a pen if he wanted to,"" Rees said, ""it would be worth more than this entire congressional bill."" It's critical that we reduce global warming as much as possible, even if 1.5 degrees is only barely within reach. We must continue applying pressure to keep polluters out of climate negotiations, demand for the materialization of better climate finance and fight for urgent action from Biden's administration. Climate talks must continue to happen, but they need to do more to salvage our future. \"

Following this submission, numerous experts are also voicing their opinions about how ineffective such meetings have become in recent times. Held in Scotland, the 2021's meeting offered more problems than solutions. According to some important statistics, around 400 private planes took businesspeople to the conference. Unfortunately, these planes released about 13,000 tons of CO2, which is quite larger than the amount of CO2 emitted by 1,600 Scottish residents every year. While commenting on the conference, Monica Lennon, a Scottish Parliament member, claimed that it is hypocritical to be traveling around with CO2-emitting private planes while supposedly trying to solve climate issues. The actions of these business attendants have shown that they don't care about the ongoing climate emergency. Basically, COP means Conference of the Parties[1] which is often held annually. The UN conference is usually attended by nations that signed a 1994 treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It should be noted that COP26 is the latest edition of this annual conference. Hosted in Glasgow, Scotland, the conference was meant to hold in 2020 but was postponed to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It finally took place from 1 to 12 November 2021. Various decisions were made at the conference, and many of them could affect the everyday lives of many individuals around the world. Although we have lots of new gadgets today, there has not been any significant development in science in the last 50 years. The majority of the scientific developments available today were developed several decades ago. However, we have only been upgrading, improving, and correcting them to better our lives. However, we tend to be dealing with the illusion of tackling the challenge. Lots of conferences, seminars, research, protests, expert discussions, etc. are going on, but none has been able to proffer reliable solutions. Nowadays, we only discuss the problems and their causes without doing much to solve them. Therefore, there is a need for us to develop new, effective solutions. Greener energy must be provided to take care of our energy needs without exposing us to toxic emissions. Roberto Hroval is a trusted expert who is popular for using special approaches and solutions to provide green technologies. As he launched Project Phoenix8, this European entrepreneur might have found a solution to our green energy challenges. With the aid of this project, there is a solution to the issues associated with waste. Project Phoenix8 does not rely on weather sources nor uses any potentially toxic nuclear energy. After a while, Roberto Hroval took the solution to another level by launching the Themis Ecosystem[2], which is a US$22 billion project. Through the Themis Ecosystem, you can reduce or eliminate harmful CO2 emissions in your personal life or family without having to make any significant lifestyle changes. It encourages people to adopt green life and nature preservation to spend less, drive electric cars, and do other things that will reduce CO2 emissions around the world. While enjoying the benefits of this project, you can also make tons of money to improve the quality of your life. Themis Ecosystem features a wide range of elements, and the Online Industrial Exchange (OIX) is one of them. On OIX, people trade special e-vouchers called Industrial Tokens (iTos). On the Themis Ecosystem, the Industrial Tokens (iTos) are founded, provided, and traded by the users. On this ecosystem, various stringent rules are offered to determine: The companies that can issue the Industrial Tokens The circumstances under which the companies can issue tokens The circumstances for accepting the companies into the Themis Ecosystem The conditions for listing the companies on the OIX Exchange The technology must have been tested and already offering solutions that address the global challenge and also deal with CO2 emissions These rules will play a key role in ensuring that the ecosystem is well-regulated. They will also boost the confidence of the stakeholders in the efficiency of the project. The founder Roberto Hroval talked more about the project. He noted that, apart from setting up OIX, algorithms, and supportive factors, the first step is to look for the right projects. He continued to establish that Project Phoenix8 (PP8), which is a waste-to-energy project, was suitable for it. He claimed that the process functions exceptionally without commissions or brokers. According to Hroval, the Themis Ecosystem works directly to reduce CO2 in the environment, tackles global challenges, and improves the prosperity of people and businesses. How does Industrial Token (iTo) work? One of the innovations of Roberto Hroval is Industrial Token (iTo). The value of the Industrial Token depends on the distribution of the value of created products within a pre-determined number of tokens as well as the level of CO2 negativity produced by the project. Since the number of tokens doesn't change, there is an organic increase in their price. However, there can never be a major improvement if individuals don't get some noticeable benefits from the project. Hroval noted that the biggest climate change enthusiasts and protests cannot make any difference. The general public must support the change to make it permanent. Roberto Hroval believes that his technologies can bring much-needed improvement that will encourage many people to support the change in different industries. These industries include environment and waste, housing, energy, IT, nutrition, health, and transport. Notably, Themis Ecosystem provides everything that is needed for this change. The team of Themis Ecosystem has more than 25 years of experience in providing important solutions in different sectors. With its familiarity with world-class technology, this team is set to make a big difference in the market. So, the founder of Themis Ecosystem is encouraging everyone to join forces with the team to make the world a greener place.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA35","4 Key Takeaways From COP26","Foreign Policy","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 15, 2021( Foreign Policy: HYPERLINK http://www.foreignpolicy.com http://www.foreignpolicy.com     The latest United Nations climate summit, or COP26 , officially concluded Saturday, bringing an end to two long weeks of grueling negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, among almost 200 countries. Deliberations dragged on[1] a day later than scheduled, and the final deal that was struck the Glasgow Climate Pact[2] was weakened by stubborn, last-minute compromises, such as one inserted by India that gives coal a second lease on life. So what came out of Glasgow, really? Scientists and many policymakers stress that action on climate change now is urgently needed, especially as the dire impacts of warming have thrown entire countries into disarray. Just this summer, heavy flooding[3] ravaged central China, killing more than 300 people; across the western United States, a searing heat wave strained power grids[4] and the water supply. In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reviews climate science under the auspices of the U.N., warned that the world was experiencing unprecedented levels of warming[5] that could produce irreversible damage not just heat waves, floods, and shrinking glaciers but sea level rise that will continue for centuries regardless of what policymakers decide in the next few decades. This is a 'defining decade,' said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. 'If we don't have large success this decade in bending the carbon curve we will be producing an earth that looks very different in a few decades from now.'     The latest United Nations climate summit, or COP26 , officially concluded Saturday, bringing an end to two long weeks of grueling negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, among almost 200 countries. Deliberations dragged on[6] a day later than scheduled, and the final deal that was struck the Glasgow Climate Pact[7] was weakened by stubborn, last-minute compromises, such as one inserted by India that gives coal a second lease on life. So what came out of Glasgow, really? Scientists and many policymakers stress that action on climate change now is urgently needed, especially as the dire impacts of warming have thrown entire countries into disarray. Just this summer, heavy flooding[8] ravaged central China, killing more than 300 people; across the western United States, a searing heat wave strained power grids[9] and the water supply. In August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which reviews climate science under the auspices of the U.N., warned that the world was experiencing unprecedented levels of warming[10] that could produce irreversible damage not just heat waves, floods, and shrinking glaciers but sea level rise that will continue for centuries regardless of what policymakers decide in the next few decades. This is a 'defining decade,' said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. 'If we don't have large success this decade in bending the carbon curve we will be producing an earth that looks very different in a few decades from now.' As with previous climate confabs, the reviews of COP26 's achievements are mixed. While U.S. climate envoy John Kerry declared that the world was now the closest it had ever been to £voiding climate chaos,' others have been less optimistic, with activist Greta Thunberg criticizing its promises as 'blah, blah, blah[11].' Foreign Policy looked into where progress was made and where negotiations fell short. More action is needed to keep temperatures from rising much further. Experts have long agreed that it's crucial for levels of warming to stay below the pivotal threshold[12] of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a key objective of the 2015 Paris Agreement[13] and the point at which the risk of deadly climate disasters surges. (The world is currently 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.) In Glasgow, some countries did make strides in this direction. More than 100 countries agreed to slash their methane emissions[14] by 30 percent, relative to output in 2020 and that matters because methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas. Another 100-plus nations holding more than 85 percent of the world's forests[15] pledged to halt deforestation and land degradation by 2030. And India, one of the biggest consumers of coal, pledged to reach net-zero emissions[16] by 2070, meaning that it will no longer add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by that point. But the final pact failed to outline a clear pathway[17] to stop the world from breaching the 1.5 degree mark or adequately answer how countries must share[18] the responsibility of curbing emissions. According to the Climate Action Tracker[19], existing national policies would see the world on track to heat up by 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2100. In acknowledgement of this, countries agreed to return next year[20] with greater cuts and new targets, accelerating, in theory, their efforts to bend the curve. Fossil fuels were singled out but coal is still king. COP26 produced the first-ever[21] international climate pact to explicitly reference fossil fuels[22], one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions, or to broach limits on the use of coal. Widely regarded as the dirtiest fossil fuel, coal is estimated to be responsible for almost one-third of warming[23]. 'Any continued use even, let alone an expansion of coal, is extremely consequential,' Swain said. But any excitement was quickly dampened after language in the final agreement was watered down in the eleventh hour. In an extremely last-minute change, India, backed by China, insisted on a final tweak, agreeing only to 'phase down,' not 'phase out,' coal use. Earlier in the summit, language in initial commitments to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels was also modified[24] to specify 'unabated' coal and 'inefficient' subsidies. National pledges are voluntary, with no enforcement mechanisms, making the last-minute change especially disappointing, Swain said. Before, 'even if it was very strong language, it's still going to be voluntary language,' Swain said. 'But now it's also relatively weak and voluntary.' The push was widely met with dismay. COP26 President Alok Sharma apologized[25] for the change, while Swiss Environment Minister Simonetta Sommaruga expressed her 'profound disappointment' in the tweak. 'This will not bring us closer to 1.5 but make it more difficult to reach it,' she said. But as in any big climate summit gathering all the world's nations together, the lowest common denominator sets the bar. 'If we hadn't done that, we wouldn't have had an agreement,' Kerry said afterward. A surprising show of U.S.-China climate cooperation. The United States and China surprised onlookers when they agreed to work together[26] to curb emissions and limit warming over the next decade, after Beijing previously insisted that any sort of climate cooperation[27] would hinge on overall relations between the two countries. In the months leading up to COP26 , analysts questioned whether cooperation or competition between the United States and China would spur the most action on climate. The move was significant, although the joint announcement[28] was vague and neglected to include important, or almost any, details. China and the United States are the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, jointly accounting for an estimated 40 percent[29] of global annual carbon output. China is the world's top emitter[30], exceeding all developed countries' emissions combined, while the United States is second. 'The U.S. and China have no shortage of differences,' Kerry said. 'But on climate, cooperation is the only way to get this job done.' The disparity between rich and poor nations is clearer than ever. COP26 highlighted the stark divide between rich and poor nations, both in terms of who bears the brunt of the climate crisis and what their responses could feasibly look like. Many developing countries, such as India, still rely on coal-fired power, even as the United States and Europe responsible for the bulk of historical emissions urge a rapid shift to cleaner fuels. At COP26 There was also the question of compensation. Although the global south is responsible for just 10 percent[33] of cumulative global emissions, it is often on the front lines of the climate crisis[34]. 'It is a matter of life and survival for many of us,' said[35] Tuvalu's climate minister, Seve Paeniu, who noted that the small island country was 'literally sinking.' To cope with these costs, many such countries hoped to secure funds for 'loss and damage[36]' at Glasgow but to no avail. After forceful resistance from the United States and European Union, the final pact did not include funding to compensate developing countries for the losses they are already incurring and that they will continue to incur. Ultimately, whether COP26 is, as Kerry said, the closest the world has come to progress or whether it's just another lost year remains to be seen. Combating climate change hinges on whether world leaders stick to their promises, especially when there are no formal mechanisms[37] in place to ensure they meet their goals.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA36","Global Resilience Partnership: COP26 Resilience Hub Report Out Now","December 14, 2021 Tuesday 10:17 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRep) -- The Global Resilience Partnership issued the following news: The report synthesises the key overarching messages from the activities at the Hub and aims to help set the direction for future actions towards COP27. The first edition of the Resilience Hub, the home of UNFCCC's Race to Resilience at COP26 , sought to advance action on adaptation and resilience at COP26 and beyond. It also provided a strong collective voice on resilience for all those globally who are working to build a more resilient world. The Resilience Hub ran alongside COP26 from 31 October to 12 November 2021. Nigel Topping, High level Champion for Climate Action at COP26 , said, ""We're delighted that the Resilience Hub has been a real success and we hope that it goes from strength to strength to draw more attention and direct more resources to resilience solutions."" The report synthesises the key overarching messages that emerged from the activities of the Resilience Hub. Five overarching messages: 1. Locally Led Adaptation is essential for transformative and equitable adaptation and is ripe for scaling, subject to finance access. 2. There is an urgent need to increase the overall availability of quality finance for adaptation and resilience, as well as diversify financial instruments through emphasising grant-based rather than loan-based models. 3. Transformative adaptation and resilience require bridging the gaps between knowledge and implementation through knowledge brokering and advancing measurement and learning. 4. Nature based Solutions are key to transforming risk into resilience through integrated urban, coastal, and rural climate actions. 5. Pragmatic and equitable adaptation and resilience action requires women, youth, disabled, displaced, and Indigenous peoples to be at the heart of design, decision-making, and implementation. Besides summarising the key overarching messages, the synthesis report also presents findings and insights from the three pillars of Race to Resilience: rural, urban, and coastal. The pillars shaped the programming of the Resilience Hub activities. The report also includes findings and insights from the ten themes explored during the Hub. Lastly, it aims to help set the direction for future actions towards COP27.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA37","COP26 ACHIEVES INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR SUSTAINABILITY","November 18, 2021 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: The COP26 UN Climate Summit has received international recognition for delivering a sustainable event. This included demonstrating the positive impacts of the summit on local communities and leaving a positive legacy From: Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP Published 18 November 2021 COP26 has achieved independent international recognition for its approach to delivering a sustainable event, attaining the ISO20121 certificate. ISO20121 is an international standard which sets out the requirements to establish, maintain and continually improve an event sustainability management system. It requires event organisers to demonstrate consideration to all key financial, economic, social and environmental factors related to planning and operations. Organisations adopting ISO20121 are required to demonstrate that they are minimising potential negative impacts on the environment, communities and local economy - maximising the positive impacts and leaving a legacy to be proud of. COP26 President Alok Sharma said: ""Sustainability was at the core of COP26 and I am proud that the UK has added yet another impressive standard of environmental compliance to the event with the ISO2021 certification. ""To build on our work with ISO20121, COP26 will also be a carbon neutral event and become the first COP to have achieved PAS2060 validation on carbon neutrality. This will make good on our priority to reduce and avoid emissions at the highest level."" COP26 was able to illustrate, using the ISO20121 framework, its commitment to sustainability and that the event was managed in a sustainable way. To attain the certification, the UK Government appointed Arup and Crowberry as technical sustainability advisors. BSI, British Standards Institution, provided an independent audit for certification of compliance. COP26 , through the adoption and integration of the COP26 seven Sustainability Governing Principles: Actively manage potential impacts on the environment and local community and identify opportunities to deliver environmental and social value Provide an accessible and inclusive setting for all Encourage healthy living Ensure a safe and secure atmosphere Encourage more sustainable behaviour Promote the use of responsible sources and responsible use of resources throughout the supply chain Leave a positive legacy Additionally, the COP26 Unit has worked collaboratively with HMG teams, delivery partners and other stakeholders to embed and demonstrate how they have robustly considered all dimensions of sustainability. This includes a detailed assessment within all the operational delivery areas of the event including the Blue Zone and Green Zone Venues, Transport, Security, Suppliers, Catering and Health and Safety. Notes for editors More information on the actions taken to deliver a more sustainable event under our seven principles is provided on the COP26 Sustainability website, these include: Prioritising low carbon alternative energy sources such as electric and low emission vehicles, solar energy for temporary traffic lights and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) in generators, instead of diesel. Prioritising sustainability by including explicit requirements in our supplier procurements and with partners. Encouraging delegates to use active travel such as walking and cycling or public transport where possible. Catering that prioritises locally sourced, healthy and in season food items to minimise mileage for transportation and supporting local business. You can find out more about catering in our press release here. COP26 . Repurposing the furniture, which was provided by Ikea UK to furnish the conference, will involve working closely with Glasgow City Council to ensure the furniture is given a second life at charity organisations and local community projects across the city. Other legacy examples include distributing the conference carpets in the temporary structures to low-income families, sending MDF sheets and cotton roof panels from the Hydro installations to wood recycling and men's shed projects in the city and turning the hundreds of metres of black backed fabric graphics into bags, pencil cases, laptop bags, and boxes. Employing local people for specific event roles. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA39","POV: TAKEAWAYS, HOPES, AND DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM COP26","November 22, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Boston University: Four BU grad students who attended the Glasgow conference virtually reflect on what they learned November 22, 2021 Lucila Houttuijn Bloemendaal Jessica Wright Emma Conrad-Rooney Anita Tendler Millions of people around the world watched with a mix of excitement, aspiration, disappointment, and cautious optimism as negotiations unfolded at the United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, which ended earlier this month. Policymakers, multi-sector representatives, scientists, and young people spent two weeks refocusing global action to keep Earth's warming under 1.5 degree C by implementing the Paris Climate Agreement adopted at the COP21 meeting. Their efforts resulted in bold pledges and announcements, including the Global Methane Pledge, alongside less ambitious formal negotiations that will succeed only through immediate and robust implementation. As PhD trainees in Boston University's URBAN Program in Biogeoscience and Environmental Health, we had the opportunity to attend COP26 events virtually as civil society observers. Even virtually, the weight of the summit was not missed as we felt the pressure for party delegates to draft resolutions addressing climate change, and witnessed negotiators debating pathways to meet the 1.5 degree C goal. Here, we offer our takeaways from COP26 as a group of students whose research interests address a diverse range of topics centered on energy and the environment. Like many attendees, we returned to the United States with mixed feelings. Jessica Wright, whose research focuses on climate policy, left weary of climate policies that fail to include concrete implementation plans. Pledges and pacts can promise to reduce emissions and change old habits, but rarely outline how to do so on a large scale. At COP26 , many conversations lacked the importance or urgency of determining how to reach the climate goals equitably or efficiently. For example, the finalized Glasgow Climate Pact included a phase down"" of coal instead of ""phase out."" However, emerging research highlighted throughout the conference offered opportunities for hope, especially regarding reducing emissions, utilizing nature-based solutions, reimagining urban systems, and ensuring the safety and health of communities. Lucila Houttuijn Bloemendaal, whose research in coastlines and fellowship at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has attuned her to the importance of coastal and marine work in climate policy, found a refreshing focus on oceans at COP26 . As Ambassador Peter Thomson, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for the Ocean, succinctly noted, climate is the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, and a healthy planet requires a healthy ocean. At COP26 , participants touted a deeper understanding of the ocean and a well-managed, sustainable blue economy as fundamental to addressing both the climate and biodiversity crises. To that end, the United States joined the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, committed to protecting 30 percent of the global ocean by 2030, in line with larger initiatives, and more. The momentum for ocean conservation and ocean-based solutions to climate change is growing and promises more progress, with upcoming meetings such as the One Ocean Summit, Our Ocean Conference, and the UN Ocean Conference. Another focal point addressed at COP26 was the transition to clean energy, which is instrumental to meeting the 1.5 degree C goal. President Biden detailed the US goals in ramping up clean energy at a Presidency Event on Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment. Anita Tendler's research focuses on how electricity generated from clean energy, like solar, has become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel alternatives on a global scale. Governmental support and strategic collaboration will ensure this transition is accelerated to meet carbon emission reduction goals, a point President Biden emphasized. Complementary educational events at COP26 brought innovators together to establish a holistic energy transition framework. This would address the high-level obstacles to major transitional change, particularly to ensure that the clean energy transition is accomplished in an equitable and ethical way. While high-level officials and leaders dominated most events at COP26 , Emma Conrad-Rooney found youth-driven programming to be the most powerful. In these sessions, young people directed the conversation, created a space for youth voices, and managed the prominence and level of engagement of adults. In the Presidency Event in Partnership with YOUNGO: Unifying for Change: The Global Youth Voice at COP26 , young people introduced the Global Youth Statement, a youth-written document outlining young people's climate policy demands. The youth presenters prompted high-level panelists to comment on the Global Youth Statement and to discuss their plans to bring forward a youth paragraph in negotiations. These efforts were successfulparagraph 92 of the Glasgow Climate Pact ""urges Parties and stakeholders to ensure meaningful youth participation and representation in multilateral, national, and local decision-making processes, including under the Paris Agreement."" Although the promising strides in ocean policy, clean energy, and youth engagement inspired us, we are anxious to see how these declarations will actually be implemented to generate meaningful change in the coming months and years. The strong presence of the United States at COP26 signals our country's commitment to mitigating climate change and we look forward to seeing the steps that our administration takes to follow through. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA40","COP26: MEPs Debate the Glasgow Climate Pact","November 24, 2021 Wednesday 8:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Parliament issued the following news release: Many MEPs described COP26 as an important step, while stressing for the urgency of more global climate action to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday morning, MEPs debated with Commission Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans, and the Council Presidency, the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). Vice-President Timmermans said the EU helped deliver clear progress at COP26 that kept the Paris Agreement targets alive. He said the progress gave the world a chance to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as countries that do not have targets in line with this objective will have to come back with more ambitious national plans in 2022. Mr Timmermans also called for the EU to adopt the ""Fit for 55 in 2030"" package before the COP27 scheduled for late 2022, in order to continue to demonstrate European leadership in the fight against climate change. Before the start of COP26 , Parliament had called for higher global ambitions to achieve a strong outcome at the meeting. While some MEPs described COP26 's outcome as a failure most, however, labelled it an important step in the right direction. They said more action against climate change is needed across the globe, not least in the short run until 2030 where only the EU has a Climate Law and concrete plans to reach the targets. A number of MEPs said too many countries are not ambitious enough in their plans to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, with several specifically highlighting China. There were also calls during the debate for the EU to further increase its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target, as some MEPs do not believe the current target is in line with this ambition.

In June 2021, the European Climate Law was adopted by Parliament. It transforms the European Green Deal's political commitment to EU climate neutrality by 2050 into a binding obligation for the EU and its member states. It also increases the EU's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels.

Six years later, COP26 in Glasgow will aim to deliver on the promises of the Paris Agreement. World leaders and national delegations, representatives from businesses, civil society and youth are gathering for two weeks to accelerate progress. What's at stake? The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in August 2021, was a code red for the planet: with dangerous and irreversible tipping points coming closer. : unchecked, it will push 132 million people into poverty over the next 10 years, undoing hard-won development gains. And according to the World Bank's most recent research, climate change impacts could drive 216 million people to migrate within their own countries by 2050. A core goal of COP26 is to keep ""1.5 alive"", that is to limit temperature rise to the 1.5-degree Celsius limit agreed in Paris. COP26 is also particularly critical because it marks the moment when countries are supposed to update their original climate pledges (the national targets or NDCs that were submitted ahead of COP21) and make these more ambitious. As of October 27, 2021, 116 countries plus the EU 27 have submitted new NDCs. Alok Sharma, COP26 Reducing emissions, including by setting more ambitious national targets (NDCs and LTSs), getting out of coal and halting deforestation Boosting adaptation efforts, particularly for the world's poorest and most vulnerable Mobilizing finance, including meeting previous commitments and supporting efforts to transform global financial flows Working together to finalize Paris Agreement rules and make Glasgow a success The World Bank Group at COP26 For instance: In December 2020, the Bank Group announced a new ambitious climate finance target: 35% of financing will support climate on average over the next five years; and at least 50% of IDA/IBRD climate finance will support adaptation. In April 2021, the Bank Group announced it would align its financing flows with the Paris Agreement: World Bank will align all new operations starting July 1, 2023. For IFC and MIGA, 85 percent of Board approved real sector operations will be aligned starting July 1, 2023, and 100 percent of these operations starting July 1, 2025, two fiscal years later. In June 2021, the Bank Group released its Climate Change Action Plan, 2021-25, which laid out how the Bank will support climate action and development challenges together for developing countries and the private sector, over the coming 5 years. In October 2021, the Bank Group hosted a public event, Making Climate Action Count, during the 2021 Annual Meetings, bringing together leaders from government and businesses, as well as people from the frontlines of climate solutions in Vietnam, India, Jordan, Niger, Kenya, Poland, Uganda and Brazil. Just ahead of COP26 , the Bank Group issued a series of COP26 Climate Briefs highlighting how climate and development can be integrated and growing inequalities addressed. Climate action will also be an integral part of support for the poorest countries as they recover from the pandemic. The Bank is also strengthening local capital markets and greening domestic financial sectors to help private capital flow for both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Besides delivering on finance, a strong theme of the Bank Group's participation at COP26 will be its effort to ramp up support for green, resilient, and inclusive recoveries from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as low-carbon transitions that put people at the center. Watch live-streamed events and participate in the conversation The Bank Group will take part in key discussions during the two weeks of COP26 focusing on financing, energy, nature and sustainable land use, climate change adaptation, transport and cities. Several events on such topics as the green recovery, roadmaps for the energy transition, investment in climate-smart agriculture, and the value of nature will be streamed live from COP26 .

The world's top business and political figures are gathered in Glasgow this week for COP26 , which is aimed at forging an ambitious new climate agreement. But Mexico's leftist leader  also known as AMLO  dismissively compared the summit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, known for its eye-watering prices and elite chin-wagging. 'These summits resemble those in Davos,' said Lopez Obrador  among the heads of state who chose not to attend COP26  describing WEF attendees as 'technocrats and neoliberals.' The world's most powerful countries 'increase their fuel production, at the same time that they hold summits for the protection of the environment,' he said. 'And then they arrive in private planes.' 'Enough hypocrisy and fad. We must fight the massive monstrous inequality that exists in the world, that's what I will tell the UN.' Lopez Obrador, who has made only a handful of foreign trips since taking office in 2018, will travel to New York next week as Mexico takes over the presidency of the UN Security Council. 'If we want to protect the environment, we must make decisions, act, and not just talk,' he said, hailing major oil producer Mexico's decision to invest $1.3 billion a year in reforestation. The program  known as 'Sowing Life'  aims to create 15,000 jobs planting a billion trees across Mexico's 32 states.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA43","Bond Investors Can Help Hold Companies Accountable Post COP26","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 25, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com The United Nations Glasgow Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 , concluded in November with 200 nations signing the Glasgow Climate Pact (GCP), an agreement that could accelerate climate action and drive big carbon cuts. COP26 First, the good news: nations' sense of urgency, unity and commitment has increased with every COP summit. As a result, the GCP represents the most ambitious climate policy declaration to date. COP26 In addition, COP26 launched several key initiatives to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accelerate the energy transition. This could translate in 2022 into stronger Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that take the world a step closer to the 1.5C target. On the emissions front, more than 100 countries joined a coalition led by the US and the European Union (EU) to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. This initiative aligns with the recommendations of the IPCC published in its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) as a path to effectively reducing GHG emissions in the near-term. According to the IPCC, methane accounts for about half of the 1.0C rise in global average temperature since the pre-industrial age. Additional highlights include: A new focus on reducing the use of coal, albeit weakened by emphasis on phasing down rather than phasing out coal power. Coal contributes 46% of global carbon dioxide emissions and accounts for nearly three-fourths of GHG emissions from electricity production. A deal to establish a new carbon market and trading scheme for offsets, comprising a bilateral system in which countries can trade credits to meet decarbonization targets, and a centralized system for offsets, with 5% of the proceeds going toward a climate adaptation fund for developing countries. A renewed pledge for developed countries to contribute at least US$100 billion annually to developing nations for transition financing. Notably, this goal has never been met since initially agreed to in 2009 at COP15. Launch of a Breakthrough Agenda, a 10-year plan to make clean technologies and solutions for power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture more affordable by 2030. Endorsement of the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use by 120 countries spanning more than 90% of the world's forests. This declaration targets stopping and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030. A pledge by more than 100 governments, regional authorities and businesses to sell only zero-emissions cars in leading markets by 2035 and globally by 2040. The agreement lacks support from many of the largest car markets, however, including China, Germany, France and most of the US. Four of the largest carmakers did not sign. Pledges Aren't Enough While the agreements and pledges arising from COP26 are laudable, they aren't enough. For one, countries' pledges for reducing carbon emissions by 2030 fall far short of the levels needed to reach the 1.5C global warming target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Instead, these 2030 targets are equivalent to 2.3C, leaving the global climate at risk, particularly for fast-rising sea levels and extreme weather events. According to the World Resources Institute, 'global emissions must drop by half by 2030 to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.' Further, huge gaps persist between countries' more ambitious climate pledges and the tangible policy steps needed to achieve them. For instance, governments have provided little clarity abouthow they'll reach their net-zero carbon targets[1], mostly set for 2050 to 2060, that promise to take global warming projections nearer to 1.8C. So how do governments plan to close the distance between their weak 2030 commitments and their net-zero ambitions? It's hard to say. This unknown has created asignificant credibility gap[2]that requiresradical collaboration among many actors[3]to narrow. Big Polluters Must Lead the Transition Away from Fossil Fuels Much of the responsibility for closing this gap lies with some of the heaviest polluters: the transportation, utility and energy sectors. But the lines of responsibility are tangled. For example, the ability of the auto industry to help curb carbon emissions is contingent on the pace at which utilities shift to renewable energy. After all, the benefits of driving electric cars are limited if batteries are charged by coal-fired electricity. At COP26 Most regulated utilities in the US already plan to reduce their (less economical) coal generation and to build capacity in renewables (where they expect a bigger rate base). In short, these companies are generally willing to shutter coal plants. The question is, how quickly? The timeline for transition is determined in partnership with state regulators, who must consider grid reliability, the grid's ability to support electric-vehicle infrastructure and regional coal employment. Even so, 75% of US coal capacity is likely to be retired by 2050. As with utilities, integrated exploration-and-production (E&P) companies in Europe are paving the way for E&P globally, by setting ambitious and science-based carbon reduction targets and by directing a material portion of their capital budgets toward lower-carbon and renewables projects. US E&Ps are maintaining production discipline for fossil fuels and have scaled back investment in new drilling. Budgets for capital expenditure increasingly include low-carbon investments, such as biofuels, hydrogen renewables and nature-based offsets. Where Investors Can Make a Difference With companies facing mounting pressure to invest in green capex, we expect the market forgreen bonds and bonds linked to key performance indicators (KPIs)[5]to continue to surge in size and importance. But labels aren't enough. In order to fairly assess KPI-linked bonds, for example, investors must understand how companies set and achieve sustainability targets thatdecarbonize their emissions along the full value chain[6]. A forthcoming global standardization of environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting under the International Sustainability Standards Board will aid in transparency. In the meantime, responsible investors must determine whether a company's climate strategies are specific and actionable; how its emissions pathway compares to its peer group; if its plans are sufficiently ambitious relative to its emissions starting point; whether its net-zero target is science-based and how it aligns with NDCs; and how its net-zero plan breakdown between near-term (2030) and long-term (2050) goals aligns with NDCs. Lastly, active investors can and should play a critical role in climate action by tracking countries and companies to make sure they're on course to deliver on their ambitious climate goals. This often entails taking a seat at the table with a company's management team to understand the impact of ESG factors on investments, to advocate for changes in corporate behavior and practices, and to hold companies accountable as stewards of our environment.

After two weeks of frantic negotiations and a bewildering blizzard of carbon-cutting commitments, 1.5 still has a pulse. But it\' s on life support.  1.5 is still alive if we don\' t rest on our laurels and see how things go, Nigel Topping, a veteran HYPERLINK https://qz.com/re/climate-change/ economist tasked with drumming up private sector action during the COP, said in an interview on the summit\' s last day.

Delegates also finally agreed on rules for a HYPERLINK new global carbon market Overall, if countries follow through on their current commitments (admittedly a gigantic  if ), temperature rise by 2100 could be limited to 1.9\'b0C, HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-do-cop26-promises-keep-global-warming-below-2c according to Carbon Brief HYPERLINK https://qz.com/re/policy/ policies , a more likely outlook is around 2.4\'b0C. The best proof climate diplomacy is working is that before the 2015 Paris Agreement, the projection was as high as 3.7\'b0C, a truly nightmarish future that\' s now very unlikely. But now the lowest-hanging fruits for carbon abatement are plucked bending the curve all the way to 1.5\'b0C will be much harder. How to make climate goals a reality For that to happen, countries will need to ratchet up their commitments every year. Governments, the media, and civil society groups especially need to hold the private sector accountable for its net-zero commitments, and demand a climate action plan from every company. And rich countries need to finally follow through on their long-neglected promise to provide funding for clean energy and climate impact adaptation in poor countries a promise so neglected in Glasgow that the failure was condemned in the formal agreement. The Glasgow agreement also left the issue of loss and damage payments from rich countries for impacts that are too severe to adapt to, which was a key demand of developing country delegates almost entirely unfunded, and with little clarity on how to proceed. Scientific uncertainty about the atmosphere\' s exact sensitivity to greenhouse gases leaves open the possibility that 1.5 may already be in a coma. But mounting public pressure fueled by the deepening climate crisis itself could wake it up.  1.5 stretches credibility, said William Pizer, a former HYPERLINK https://qz.com/re/u-s/ US climate negotiator and current vice president for policy engagement at Resources for the Future, a think tank.

British High Commission Singapore As world leaders gather in Glasgow UK to participate in the 26th UN FCC Conference of Parties Climate Summit or COP26 , here in Singapore, two of the most iconic landmarks the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands are turning blue and green to mark the momentous occasion. From Sat 30th October 2021, Marina Bay Sands will illuminate the entire property, which spans across the three iconic hotel towers joined by the Sands SkyPark, ArtScience Museum and Sands Expo and Convention Centre, in the official COP26 colours. In addition, ArtScience Museum will also project the distinctive blue/green globe of the COP26 logo on its facade, reflecting the call for a greener, bluer world. Gardens by the Bay has come to epitomise sustainable technology and innovation not just across Southeast Asia but world over. In support of COP26 , the world-famous 18 giant Supertrees will light up in official COP26 colours from 31 Oct to 4 Nov 2021, daily from 7pm till 12am. Details are available on the Gardens by the Bay website. The COP26 Said Her Excellency Kara Owen, British High Commissioner to Singapore: As the IPPC report laid it out so starkly, our world is dangerously close to running out of time to stop a climate catastrophe. The COP26 Summit taking place in Glasgow is our chance to come together for our planet, ensuring the transition to a cleaner future is fair and inclusive. I'm delighted that Singapore landmarks such as the Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay are joining us in urging world leaders to make the right decisions, for our planet and all humanity. Gardens by the Bay Chief Operations Officer, Thomas Seow said: As a garden founded on the principles of sustainability, we are happy to support this environmental initiative by the British High Commission in Singapore. The solar-powered Supertrees at Gardens by the Bay have come to be recognised as a showcase of green technology. By lighting them up on the occasion of COP26 , we hope to encourage everyone to join in and create a more sustainable future for generations to come. Paul Town, Chief Operating Officer, Marina Bay Sands, said: Even though the Summit is taking place in Glasgow, we believe that helping the environment is a collective effort that everyone can participate in even from miles away. We hope that our light-up can ignite larger conversations about the growing threats of climate change, and spur others to take action towards a more sustainable future here in Singapore. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA46","PEATLANDS IN SPOTLIGHT AT COP26","November 25, 2021 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): Delegates at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP26 in Glasgow would have found it hard to ignore Scotland's stunning scenery: dense woodlands, dark lochs and sweeping mountain ranges. But it was the peatlands that perhaps captured their attention the most, not only for their iconic beauty but for the role they can play in combatting climate change. While peatlands take up only around 3 per cent of global land area, they store over 33 per cent of the world's soil carbon, more than the carbon stored in all other vegetation combined. Peatlands, which are found in almost every country, are wetlands also known as bogs, fens, bofedales and swamp forests. They are home to a diverse amount of wildlife, flora and fauna and provide natural flood mitigation and water storage and filtration. For example, in the UK and Ireland alone, peatlands supply 85 per cent of all drinking water. AT COP26 , the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) coordinated the Peatland Pavilion, where technology, best practice and experiences were shared. Peatlands were featured prominently as a Nature-based Solution, with close to 50 events live-streamed on the virtual platform. The Peatland Pavilion was important, as recent decades have seen peatlands damaged and degraded by drainage, agricultural conversion, burning and mining for fuel, the result of undervaluation of its ecosystem and economic contributions. ""If we are going to keep on track with the Paris Agreement goals, peatlands need to be protected and restored globally,"" said Dianna Kopansky, UNEP Global Peatlands Coordinator. ""The Peatland Pavilion at COP26 was a good start, but urgent action needs to be taken now to invest in peatlands protection and restoration so that peatlands become a tool to fight climate change, rather than a contributor to it."" When peatlands are degraded they become a contributor to emissions. Protecting and restoring peatlands can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 800 million metric tonnes per year equivalent to Germany's annual emissions according to the new report Economics of Peatlands Conservation, Restoration, and Sustainable Management"", released at COP26 by UNEP and the Global Peatlands Initiative (GPI). Restoring peatlands can be complex and challenging, however: ""We are facing a capacity challenge,"" said Professor Andrew Millar, the Scottish Government's Chief Scientific Adviser for Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture. ""That applies to the entire system, to the science, to the training of drivers who need to drive the diggers that will go into the peat to start restoring it. There's also the challenge of finding out which peatlands are emitting the most and figuring out the emissions reductions you get from each type of peat."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA47","ANS COP26 delegates spread the message in Glasgow: Net zero needs nuclear","Nuclear News"," ","ANS sponsored 10 young nuclear professionals from the Young Generation Network, a branch of the U.K.'s Nuclear Institute, to attend COP26 , the 2021 United Nations climate change conference, held in Glasgow, Scotland, where they helped deliver what was ""by all accounts nuclear's best representation at the COP ever,"" according to George Burnett, one of four U.K.-based attendees sponsored by ANS. The ANS-sponsored delegates-who hailed from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States-volunteered at the Nuclear for Climate booth to share the message #NetZeroNeedsNuclear, the premise of the Nuclear for Climate initiative's COP26 Position Paper. The booth was a hub for engagement with visitors from all over the world. The delegates also fanned out throughout the exhibits to attend events and panel sessions, ask questions, and engage in conversations about nuclear power. ""I firmly believe that having a booth at COP26 solely for nuclear was a game-changer,"" said Paris Ortiz-Wines, one of ANS's two American delegates. ""Many people were curious, excited to see us represented, and wanted to know more about why we are not included in the debate."" Ortiz-Wines described an encounter that she and her fellow American delegate, Mark Nelson, had with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). ""In our brief interaction, Mark and I explained that as millennials, we were excited about her work and that we were here representing the American Nuclear Society, to which she responded, 'That's great!'"" Nuclear for Climate and the ANS delegates were determined to draw attention to the benefits of nuclear energy. Their bright blue garb and the selfie-ready inflatable gummy bear mascot nicknamed ""Bella the Bear"" ensured success, as did a flash mob dancing to a pronuclear parody of a 1980s song in the center of Glasgow. Public buses drove down the streets of Glasgow bearing ""Net Zero Needs Nuclear"" advertisements as part of a Nuclear for Climate billboard campaign in Glasgow and nearby Edinburgh. Volunteers were quick to explain to the curious that a typical nuclear fuel pellet is about the size of a gummy bear, but a volume of uranium equal to the volume of the giant inflatable gummy bear could power Glasgow for 16 months, while it would take 40 soccer fields filled with coal to the height of a two-story building to generate the same amount of electricity. Princess ""Princy"" Mthombeni, who attended COP26 as an ANS-sponsored delegate, works in communications in South Africa's Department of Energy and is founder of Africa4Nuclear. Thanks to the work of Decouple Studios' Jesse Freeston, one day of Mthombeni's COP26 experience was memorably captured on video and edited into a must-see ""mini-documentary."" Check out ""Inside COP26 : Is African Poverty a Climate Solution? Western Hypocrisy Exposed"" (online) to watch as Mthombeni questions Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's state secretary at the Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety, on his country's decision to keep coal plants running while phasing out nuclear power plants, and at the same time encouraging African countries to phase out the coal that supports African industry. In conversation with delegates from African nations struggling with energy poverty, Mthombeni and fellow delegate Shirly Rodriguez noted considerable interest in the reliable baseload power that nuclear energy can provide. ""We had a really positive reception to what we were doing inside the conference center,"" said Alicia Dadlani, an ANS-sponsored delegate from the U.K. ""The volunteers actively listened to people's concerns and had adult, calm, well-put-together conversations. Of course, there were some antinuclear people, but everyone I spoke to inside the conference center was willing to have a conversation. Outside of the conference center, in the protests, there were stronger, more aggressive opinions."" Raquel Heredia Silva, an ANS-sponsored delegate from Mexico, said, ""People who had concerns were excited that someone was willing to address them and that they had a forum to ask questions."" Wherever they went, the Nuclear for Climate volunteers emphasized that they were attending as ""scientists, communicators, and engineers who have looked at the science and understand that nuclear is essential,"" Dadlani said. ""We were not there to lobby for a particular technology or commercial means."" Alys Gardner, another ANS-sponsored delegate from the U.K, said, ""I was encouraged to hear many positive conversations around nuclear with delegates from countries such as Uganda, Ghana, and Bangladesh. The incredible progress made by the United Arab Emirates, for example, going from no nuclear at all to four units, two of which are already connected to the grid, in just 15 years makes for a real success story. It was also encouraging to hear the pronuclear commitments made by countries such as the U.S., the U.K., and Canada."" Gardner added, ""Nuclear may have had a seat at the COP table this time, but there is still a long way to go in terms of challenging people's perceptions and cementing our position in the fight against climate change."" \"

From: Cabinet Office and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP COP President Alok Sharma visits Egypt and UAE, hosts of COP27 and COP28 First in series of engagements between countries to build on momentum from COP26 Expansion of initiative to support promising climate projects also announced by Mr Sharma in Egypt COP President Alok Sharma has today concluded a constructive visit to Egypt and will now travel to the United Arab Emirates, with the countries hosting the next two UN Climate Summits. These are Mr Sharma's first visits following COP26 in Glasgow, underlining the importance of building strong partnerships with the COP27 and COP28 hosts. This will culminate in a meeting between Egypt, UAE and UK in Abu Dhabi, the first of a series of engagements between the countries ahead of COP27 and COP28. Whilst in Cairo, Mr Sharma met a wide range of Government Ministers, including Prime Minister Madbouly and Egypt's COP President-Designate, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Together they issued a UK-Egypt Joint Statement which affirms their joint commitment to accelerating the fight against climate change during this critical decade. They also agreed to continue building a partnership in 2022 that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals, in Sharm el Sheikh at COP27. This means ensuring all parties meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance. The COP President also announced the expansion of the UK Government's 'Climate Finance Accelerator' Programme to Egypt. Already successfully operating in six countries, the initiative will provide capacity-building support to promising climate projects in Egypt so that they become more bankable and appealing to investors, and can secure funding more readily. On his final day in Egypt, Mr Sharma discussed the role of the private sector in building on COP26 to achieve success at COP27, meeting with business leaders pursuing green initiatives in Egypt. COP President Alok Sharma said: COP26 was a historic, collective achievement. We kept the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees in reach and made progress on finance for climate action, adaptation and loss and damage, which will benefit countries across both Africa and the MENA region. I look forward to working with Egypt and UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively on the climate agenda. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering an ambitious COP this November which ensures urgently delivering for those most vulnerable to climate change. We all need to make further progress in 2022 and especially on delivering the $100 billion of finance and addressing investment needs in the most climate vulnerable countries. This will build on the Glasgow Climate Pact and secure a better future for us all. An important focus for COP27 and COP28 will be the completion of the first Global Stocktake. This will be a key part of assessing progress made by nations in implementing the Paris Agreement and setting out a clear roadmap towards achieving it. This formally began at COP26 and will conclude at COP28 The UK is keen to share experiences of hosting a large international summit with Egypt and the UAE and the COP President has highlighted the COVID-19 testing procedures for providing a safe experience for all delegates at the recent COP26 gathering and collaboration with civil society. The COP President will now travel to the United Arab Emirates to see preparations for COP28 that will be staged in 2023 and will meet key government ministers, including the recently appointed Minister of Climate Change and Environment, HE Mariam Al Mheiri and UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change HE Dr. Sultan Al Jaber. Mr Sharma has been invited to take part in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, which gets underway tomorrow (Monday 17 January). The COP President will be involved in helping the UAE to illustrate its intentions for hosting COP28 and delivering on their climate commitments made over the last 12 months. Hosting the next two COPs in the Middle East and North Africa will enable the region to showcase to the world their innovative and profitable solutions which include renewable and low carbon energy, zero emissions transport, the role of nature based solutions and the role of smart agriculture. For example, the UAE continues to break records by reducing the costs of solar energy year after year and is delivering energy security through nuclear energy, all of which makes clean energy a more affordable option than fossil fuels. British Ambassador to Egypt, Gareth Bayley said: COP26 . The strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Egypt will help sustain global momentum on climate change. I am particularly pleased that Mr Sharma launched our 'Climate Finance Accelerator' programme, which I hope will generate a series of inspiring low carbon investment opportunities in Egypt. It is this combination of public and private sector action which will help us avert a climate disaster. Local delivery is central to the CFA approach and the Embassy team is looking forward to working with the local delivery partners once they have been appointed. British Ambassador to the UAE, Patrick Moody said: The visit of COP26 Together, we are already delivering solutions to achieve 'net zero' through bilateral trade and investment in clean growth and technology. Our two countries will continue to cooperate as current COP President and future hosts of this critical international forum to make sure that the global community delivers on the ambitious commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow. Notes to editors Egypt-UK Joint Statement The Egypt-UK Joint Statement following the meeting between Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President Designate H.E. Sameh Shoukry, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environment and COP27 Ministerial Coordinator and Envoy, and COP26 President Minister Alok Sharma can be found on GOV.UK. UK International Climate Finance (ICF) Mobilising finance to support the low-carbon transition is one of the four key goals for the UK's COP26 Presidency this year. Through International Climate Finance (ICF) the UK supports developing countries as they seek to mitigate against and adapt to the impacts of climate change, while reducing their emissions. It is a vital tool in the Government's commitment to tackle climate change internationally and has committed to spend at least 11.6 billion of climate finance between 2021 and 2025. Through ICF, the UK is committed to work in partnership and support the development of a high-performing and climate-resilient economy in Egypt. Further information about UK ICF can be found in this booklet. Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) The CFA is a technical assistance programme funded by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Following a pilot in Colombia, Mexico and Nigeria it launched in November 2020. The programme will work closely with eight countries, which are eligible for UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) and support them to develop a sustainable pipeline of bankable, low-carbon projects and identify suitable financing options. The programme will also contribute to embedding a permanent process in each country to identify financing for low-carbon projects. This will support countries' efforts to implement their NDCs, raise their overall climate ambition, and contribute to equity and social inclusion. The CFA programme is managed by local partners in each country. It works by building the skills of project developers and potential investors to respectively attract and supply funding for low-carbon development projects. By enabling the funding of low-carbon projects, the CFA can play a part in supporting a greener recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CFA will promote sustainable growth and green development and support those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week ADSW is hosted by Masdar annually. In 2022, ADSW intends to explore, through a series of high-level virtual events, opportunities for accelerating global collaboration and leadership, economic development, and technology and innovation. ADSW 2022 intends to follow the outcomes of COP26 , where the world will reevaluate the roadmaps required to meet the binding targets required to mitigate climate change. The week is the first global event of the year, where policy makers, business leaders and technology pioneers can come together to turn ambition into action. UK participation demonstrates our commitment to work with and support future COP Presidencies to progress the historic commitments made at COP26 . This reinforces the intent of the Memorandum of Understanding Rt Hon James Cleverly MP signed with HE Dr Sultan Al Jaber on UK-UAE Climate and Environment Collaboration in September 2021. \"

Please click here to download the CoR official delegation and key messages to COP26 . Here is our dedicated COP26 web portal. DAY 1. On 31 October, COP26 opened its doors as the world celebrated ""World Cities Day"". At a press conference in the Blue Zone, representatives of local and regional governments, which are gathered in the UN system as the Local Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) Constituency, announced the publication of the Time4MultilevelAction Roadmap: Implementing multilevel action in the age of climate emergency. The roadmap, which includes contributions from the CoR, is the occasion to call for £ new decade where multilevel collaborative action becomes the new normal as the beacon of hope to respond to the challenges of the age of climate emergency'. The European Committee of the Regions is part of the LGMA Constituency which activities are mainly concentrated in the Multilevel Action Pavilion in the COP26 Blue Zone.

We can no longer afford to ignore the fundamental role of every region, city and village in delivering climate action, or we will continue to fail our young people and our planet."" The Time4MultilevelAction Roadmap includes the following reference to the CoR Within the European region, the unique institutional nature of the European Committee of the Regions may be a source of inspiration for other UN regions aiming at having a mandatory consultation in topics affecting the subnational level."" The LGMA constituency roadmap was published ahead of world leaders travelling from Rome's G20 to the COP26 in Glasgow. It sends a strong message from local and regional governments worldwide as Heads of State kick off negotiations. COP26 COP26 platform to follow events live from Glasgow. The UK presidency publishes daily news here. You can also get daily policy insights with COP26 bulletin from Vuelio. While media monitoring will be delivered by the CoR's Press Unit (D1.) Daily Press Review (as of Wednesday 3 November), we can already share that the President's first COP26 statement was covered by Agence Belga, one of the CoR's COP26 media partners together with Polish Press Agency, Agence Europe and Europa Press, without forgetting the list of media partners the CoR is working with annually. The CoR's Unit D.1 daily press reviews are available in MyCoR. DAY 2. On 1 November 2021 Kata TUTTO (HU/PES), Deputy-Mayor of Budapest and CoR rapporteur on 'Energy Poverty ' and ' Gender equality and climate change ', was the first CoR member to take the floor at COP26 . She took part remotely in the first #Time4MultilevelAction Dialogue at the Multilevel Action Pavilion in the Blue Zone in Glasgow. The Multilevel Action Pavilion at the COP26 Blue Zone, hosted by the Scottish Government and convened by ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, is the focal point of the LGMA Constituency in Glasgow. Kata TUTTO (HU/PES), who is also a Climate Pact Ambassador and Hungarian Ambassador of the Covenant of Mayors said: ""I am honored to take the floor at COP26 as the deputy mayor of Budapest but also as the representative of the European Committee of the Regions, which is the voice of European cities and regions. It is not sufficient to set up clear climate targets. The key is on implementation. In the EU, cities and regions deliver 70 % of climate mitigation measures and 90 % of climate adaptation policies. Reinforcing multilevel collaboration and expanding the partnership principle is therefore vital. In the context of the COVID-19 recovery and energy poverty, especially looking at raising energy prices, we must place local governments and citizens on the table of this Conference of Parties. Otherwise, we put in danger the accomplishment of the ambitious climate goals we need to achieve to reverse the current climate emergency."" #Time4MultilevelAction Dialogues are designed as a global exchange through a diversity of national and regional experiences with a view to influence COP26 outcomes in order to ensure multilevel action becomes the new normal in the next phase of the Paris Climate Agreement.

DAY 3. On Tuesday 2 November 2021, CoR former President Markku MARKKULA, (FI/EPP), took the floor remotely at an EU COP26 event on regional adaptation. The Member of the Espoo City Board and President of the Helsinki Region stressed 'the need to move a systemic change forward at the city and regional level and get every stakeholder and citizen on board', recalling it is undeniable that 'everyone sees how climate change is increasing affecting our daily lives'. The CoR rapporteur on the opinion 'Forging a climate-resilient Europe - the new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change' presented the four cornerstones of Espoo's and the Helsinki region strategy towards climate neutrality, highlighting that 'the cultural and learning pillar is key and must accompany the economic, environmental and social strands of the transition'. From the New Bauhaus to the setup of innovative public-private partnerships, 'we must incentivize a change in the Entrepreneurial mindset', stressed Markkula. The President of the Helsinki region emphasized that local and regional governments are directly affected by the 12 billion annual average loses caused by climate change and called on the Parties of the Paris Agreement to give further recognition to cities and regions in the COP26 conclusions. Asked about the CoR opinion on climate adaptation, Markkula stressed that 'only 25% of the needed technology to win the battle against climate change currently exists', advocating for 'new local and regional contracts with private companies, industry and research centers to motivate collective collaboration at the practical, operational level' and referred to the new 'EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change' as a 'key enable to deliver collective climate adaptation actions.' Also on 2 November, Peter Kurz (DE/PES), Lord Mayor of Mannheim and member of the German Delegation at the European Committee of the Regions presented 'Local Green Deal - Achieving Climate Neutrality by 2030 with Mannheim's Innovative Governance Approach'. The session was the occasion to discover Mannheim's innovative Local Green Deal and how the model could be applied in other cities around Europe and the world.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA51","COP26 Goes Into Overtime","November 12, 2021 Friday","International Oil Daily","Originally scheduled to end on Friday evening, the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow have gone into overtime, with negotiators still wrangling over a new draft agreement text that was released Friday morning. A final agreement now might not come until the early hours of Saturday or later. The last \'e2\€  conference of the parties,\'e2\€ held in Madrid in 2019, dragged on until the Sunday afternoon after the event officially ended. Fossil Fuel Row Proposals to include language in the COP26 \'e2\€  cover text\'e2\€ on phasing out coal and ending fossil fuel subsidies are among the big remaining areas of disagreement. Saudi Arabia and Australia are two of the largest countries opposing those measures. If the proposals survive to the final agreement text, it would be the first time a COP decision document directly refers to the phasing out of a fossil fuel. Those proposals had already been partly watered down in the latest negotiating text, with an earlier reference to phasing out coal changed to phasing out \'e2\€  unabated\'e2\€ coal. This leaves the door open to carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology related to coal. Similarly, a proposal to end fossil fuel subsidies was changed to ending ""inefficient\'e2\€ fossil fuel subsidies. This change was criticized by climate campaigners, who argue that any country could simply say its subsides are efficient. However, others note that for some countries ending existing discounts on fuel for poorer consumers could lead to social unrest. Keeping these two measures in the final text is a high priority for the UK, which, as COP26 host, said that consigning coal to history would be a key test of success for the climate talks. Scaling Up Ambition One other major remaining area of contention is a proposal to ask countries to come back next year with new, more ambitious climate goals to keep alive hopes of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. China is among those resisting this move, arguing that this amounts to a reopening of the Paris Agreement, which sets 2025 as the next time that countries need to update their nationally determined contributions. Another big sticking point is climate finance for poorer countries to help them transition to green energy while still growing their economies and to adapt to a changing climate and compensate for the loss and damage this causes. There has been some progress on that front, however, with observers suggesting the latest negotiating text was more balanced with stronger focus on adaptation, finance and loss and damage. This could be further built on next year at COP27 in Egypt, where finance for developing countries is likely to be one of the main items on the agenda. Carbon Markets Separate to these negotiations on the COP26 cover text are ongoing talks on Article 6, which covers carbon market. New texts on Article 6, released Friday, seem to have come closer to an agreement than ever before on several areas of contention, such as accounting rules, how proceeds from carbon trading are shared and the carryover of old Kyoto-era credits into a new global trading system. However, environmental campaigners are concerned that this could introduce loopholes that would undermine climate efforts. High drama like this is the norm rather than the exception at the end of UN climate talks, and negotiators usually reach a compromise in the end, even if the talks drag on long after their scheduled end. The final text that\'e2\€  s agreed by the COP isn\'e2\€  t the only measure of success either. Progress has also been made outside of the official talks, with groups of countries and the private sector launching several new initiatives at COP26 that could help bend the emissions curve and boost energy transition momentum.

That's because the sanctimonious social engineers[1] who arrived by private jet to decide how to lower our standard of living[2] to demonstrate their reverence for the climate set a record with their gargantuan carbon footprint, doubling last year's output. The 2-week moonbatfest was estimated to emit about 102,500 tons of CO2[3]: [T]hat's the equivalent of total average annual emissions for more than 8,000 U.K. residents. Most of the emissions came from the jets our liberal rulers enjoy zipping around on. For once our moonbat ruling class has made a positive contribution. Carbon dioxide helps crops to grow. Some say it could cause the climate to warm. If this is true, maybe if we hold enough UN climate conferences, we can go back to farming on Greenland. On a tip from Ed McAninch.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA53","COP26: Key Takeaways and Action Items on Climate Change (Part I)","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 05, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com In recent weeks, there has been a lot written about the COP26 United Nations Annual Climate Change Conference, which was held in Glasgow, Scotland between October 31 and November 13, 2021. The central goal of the COP26 climate summit was to enable and encourage the parties (193 parties, including Canada, the U.S., China, and the European Union) to align on actionable steps that will put the world on a pathway towards global net zero emissions by mid-century and keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming within reach. There were many promises made at the COP26 climate summit, from countries and private-sector actors alike, but upon conclusion of the conference it remains clear that fundamentally keeping that target (1.5 degrees Celsius of warming) alive remains an uphill battle and doing so requires countries and private-sector actors to urgently put forth ambitious new climate programs and policies, including technological advances. In light of the foregoing, our expectation is that it will be critical for many players - including investors, those seeking capital, and those seeking to consummate transactions - to have strong climate change initiatives in place to seek to ensure long term sustainable growth and to seek to achieve the ambitious climate change goals set out at the COP26 climate summit. It will become increasingly imperative that business in particular take the climate change challenge to heart. As such, we will highlight, over the next series of posts, some of the key takeaways from the COP26 climate summit, including some of the significant global and multi-participant action items and frameworks that have been developing as part of the push for global alignment on climate change. Global Goals The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change. It was adopted at the COP 21 climate summit in Paris on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016. Currently, there are 193 parties to the Paris Agreement (including Canada, which ratified the Paris Agreement on October 5, 2016). Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels (the 'Global Goal'). Global Targets To achieve the Global Goal, the consensus is that global emissions must fall by 50% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and we must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 (the 'Global Targets'). Businesses from all sectors are encouraged to commit to aligning their business plans with the Global Targets. Initiatives such as the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') help drive ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling companies to set and achieve science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the Global Targets. Science Based Targets initiative[1] More than 2,000 businesses and financial institutions are working with the SBTi to reduce their emissions in line with climate science. Global Campaigns There are several global campaigns attempting to align company, city, and investor climate strategies and operations in an attempt to meet the Global Targets. Two such campaigns are the UN-backed Race to Net Zero Campaign and the UN Global Compact, both of which have received substantial support from public and private-sector actors alike. UN-backed Race to Zero Campaign[2] There are currently 5230 companies, 67 sub-national regions, 1049 cities, and 1039, educational, 441 financial, and 52 healthcare institutions in the Race to Net Zero. UNGC Business Ambition for 1.5 Degrees Celsius[3] The United Nations Global Compact ('UNGC') is a voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to align company strategies and operations with 10 universal principles[4] on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance societal goals. There are currently 164 UNGC participants in Canada. Key Takeaways and Action Items on Climate Change (Part II) In the next post we will examine the frameworks and blueprints that have been agreed to by business at and following the COP26 climate summit.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA54","NEP Group Supports Identity's Delivery of COP26 with State-of-the-Art, Sustainable Production Solutions","December 20, 2021 Monday 5:00 AM EST","Thomson Reuters ONE","End-to-end broadcast and live event solutions bring live coverage of critical climate change Summit to millions around the world LONDON, Dec. 20, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The COP26 Summit united 197 parties from around the world to accelerate action towards meeting the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention (UNFCCC) on climate change. NEP Group, the leading media technology partner for content creators around the globe, supported long-term partner Identity, the agency of choice to deliver the COP26 Summit, which took place 31st October - 13th November 2021 in Glasgow. With the world's attention focussed on COP26 , millions of people around the globe eagerly were looking for a way to watch, join the conversation, and feel part of the action. COP26 is regarded as one of the most critical climate change events of our time as world leaders reached a new global agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact. Having worked closely with Identity in delivering the visual technologies and broadcast feeds for the G7 summit, NEP was positioned to understand how best to support and deliver a project of this magnitude. Combining its global technology solutions and expertise, NEP Group can support Government events of this scale and caliber. NEP Bow Tie spent over 18 months supporting Identity in project managing the end-to-end solutions and broadcast delivery, collaborating with other divisions of NEP to deploy a wide range of live events and broadcast solutions. This support included NEP Bow Tie (specialist project management expertise), NEP UK and Ireland (broadcast and transmission), NEP Connect (connectivity), and Creative Technology (live events solutions). This unified approach across NEP's global production ecosystem provided ease of communication and collaboration in providing a seamless end-to-end solution to support Identity's production of an event and broadcast of such scale and complexity. Anna McInerney, Media & Broadcast Director, COP26 , said, ""Working with NEP Group in the planning and delivery of COP26 Broadcast Services should be considered a blueprint for collaborative and innovative agency-supplier operations. Agile and responsive to change, the team from NEP not only delivered on the initial brief but could always be relied upon to find solutions to inevitable last-minute changes in scope. The team's meticulous planning resulted in a comprehensive and robust Host Broadcast technical solution across the event sites, supportedby the beating heart of the MCR (Master Control Room) servicing broadcast clients in the International Media Centre, 24 hours a day."" Mark Bannister, COP26 Technical & Operations Director, said ""Creative Technology were the ideal partner to work with in the delivery of all video across the many meeting and negotiation rooms of COP26 . Working collaboratively with the Identity team to deal at pace, with the constantly evolving requirements and schedules the CT team delivered flawlessly to help make COP26 a true success."" COP26 was a true collaboration, featuring live events, production, and broadcast teams uniting to deliver daily live coverage of discussions, negotiations, and accomplishments. NEP collectively adapted throughout the event, supporting Identity by responding to changes in the schedule ensuring full coverage of planned and additional requirements. It was said, that walking around COP26 surrounded by representatives of every nation all there for one purpose, provided an immense feeling of pride for industry professionals who were there to support the delivery of such a momentous event. Sustainability and climate action were at the heart of the discussions, which was reflected in NEP's overall commitment to providing a sustainable production and broadcast from Glasgow. With a huge focus on the outcomes from COP, it was important for the team to do their part in showing more sustainable ways of working with regards to the technologies, the deployment, and the integration of hardware and personnel. Identity had a dedicated team focussed on delivering COP26 as the most sustainable one to date to achieve ISO 2021 accreditation.The project employed many local freelance creatives, and crew were encouraged to use public transport to the event site to reduce their carbon footprint. Identity provided electric shuttle buses on-site, and water flasks and reusable cups were provided to team members. Event Cycle worked in collaboration with Identity and NEP Group to ensure that anything used in the production of the event was then repurposed. KB trucking also used HVO fuel to reduce emissions, and to accurately measure carbon emissions, a sustainability tracker was used in collaboration with Identity to accurately track the production and event's carbon footprint. Details of NEP's support include: Creative Technology (CT) and NEP Group were on-site from the middle of October, having taken on the complex logistical challenge of delivering a huge quantity of kit across the Scottish Exhibition Campus. 70 CT crew members were in Glasgow delivering the project, including 5 project managers who were on-site for the duration of the event. With strict security measures in place, any changes or maintenance required on-site had to be managed and resolved by the crew requiring dedicated and flexible working. The Media Centre and Press Conference were operational 24 hours a day with coverage to over 200 displays. 350 IPTV boxes and 450 displays were in use across the site, with CT managing the displays throughout various hallways and viewers controlling their own displays via remote control in the IPTV Room. NEP UK provided an IP-based routing system and support equipment with nodes for all the Plenary Chambers and areas as part of the host broadcast solution. 31 HD cameras together with 6 vision mixer gallery setups were used in the 5 real and 1 virtual control rooms in the on-site media centre. Comprehensive audio and talkback matrices were also provided to facilitate the provision of the broadcast backbone for the worldwide distribution of signals. NEP Ireland provided the EVS and File Publishing expertise, masterminding the Media Management and Archiving as well as transcoding and handing off media files to international broadcasting organisations. The level of international interest meant that the amount of material distributed was the largest at any COP so far.

A statement, issued here by the ministry, said COP26 was held in a successful manner with due recognition to Pakistan, during which useful meetings of the special assistant and the state minister with various heads of delegations, heads of international organisations, with UN bodies were held as per official schedule of meetings. During the meetings, Pakistan's green agenda was appreciated and Pakistan's pavilion was one of the busiest pavilions lauded by the several heads of delegations and international organisations, the statement said. While representing Pakistan both of them individually and jointly attended various events and highlighted the prominent initiatives of the government including Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme, Glacial Lake Outburst Flood , Climate Smart Agriculture, Protected Areas Initiatives, Clean Green Pakistan, etc., held during COP26 . They maintained that they highlighted Pakistan as one of the top climate action champion countries of the world. 'The officials of MoCC attending COP26 worked day and night and were able to make COP26 a successful event for Pakistan,' said the statement. 'The success of Pakistan in COP26 can be gauged from the facts that the British government had regarded Pakistan as one of the four countries ranked as nature champions out of 196 countries in the world. Also, the UN system has declared Pakistan as one of the top three countries ranked as Forestry Leaders, among 196 countries across the Globe,' Malik Amin Aslam said while talking to Dawn. 'MNA Riaz Fityana was not part of Pakistan's official delegation and was representing a non-governmental organization without any invitation of MoCC,' said Malik Amin Aslam.

From: British Embassy Guatemala City (for Honduras) 2 November 2021 The British Ambassador for Honduras, Nick Whittingham, congratulated the Honduran delegation participating at COP26 and encouraged them to achieve a successful outcome. Ambassador Whittingham said: The most important conference of our lifetime is underway in the UK. It is a conference that will likely determine what type of world we pass on to future generations. Success will ensure our children and grandchildren can prosper. Failure could spell disaster for life as we know it. Known as COP-26 for short, the United Nations Climate Conference is one of the last opportunities countries will have to come together and solve mankind's greatest challenge a challenge for its very survival. Six years ago the world saw the birth of the Paris Agreement, which was a milestone in global efforts to address climate change. It resulted in a binding agreement, uniting all nations to a common cause. But it was just the beginning. And yesterday the world began to converge on the great city of Glasgow for the COP26 the next and very crucial step on the path to preventing irreversible and catastrophic climate change. Extreme weather can be seen across the world. This summer we have seen devastating floods in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America. A year ago, Honduras was hit by two ferocious hurricanes leaving significant economic and human damage. Honduras, as a vulnerable country, has a very important voice and its example can lead others to take important steps. Many climate-vulnerable countries are leading the way in reducing emissions. I congratulate Honduras for submitting early this year its updated NDC. Until 2030, Honduras is committed to carrying out adaptation and mitigation actions in the face of climate change. The country will aim to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 16%, restoring 1.3 million hectares of forests and reducing firewood consumption by 39%. Therefore, I congratulate the Honduran delegation, led by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is in Glasgow to join forces on all these issues. Honduras has shown important leadership in the fight against climate change and I encourage the country to work constructively with partners to achieve a successful COP26 . \"

The company, which also produced drinks such as Rubicon and its own-brand flavors range including Lemonade, Cola and Ginger Beer, previously worked with PHD for its Irn-Bru media buying, which it first appointed in 2003. The brand confirmed it will continue its long-running creative relationships with The Leith Agency on Irn-Bru and Red Brick Road on Rubicon. The appointment will see the7stars tasked with helping the brand return to its use of humor, which its advertising was famous for, to expand reach and grow relevance amongst a young audience across the U.K. Adrian Troy, chief brand officer of Barr, told Adweek that after running its first campaign outside of Scotland last summer, the brand had the ambition to grow Irn-Bru in England with further brand awareness activity to support that. On consolidating the account, Troy explained that it was taking place to allow the business to ""create scale for ourselves in the market and deliver efficiencies."" He added that the7stars, which won a pitch process led by Ebiquity, won due to its ""passion, the freshness of [its] approach and the rigor applied to [its] development process."" Troy addressed the attention Irn-Bru attracted during the environmental summit COP26 held in Glasgow last year where it was the official drink at the venue. This meant that all attendees had the drink available to them during meals, receiving a positive response through social media from the high profile delegates who tasted it. ""It was great to see,"" said Troy. ""Irn-Bru is Scottish through and through and we are really proud of our roots.

Greenwashing is the concept of corporations showcasing themselves as 'eco-friendly"" doing the exact opposite in business. Photo byAkil Mazumder /Pexels The delegation of 14 students and five faculty from the University of Connecticut that attended the 26th Conference of Parties in Glasgow, Scotland had mixed feelings about the conference after coming home this weekend. COP26 is the 26th annual Conference of Parties, where world leaders gather to make international climate goals in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Countries who signed the United Nations framework convention on climate change in 1994 attend the summit each year to negotiate international plans to address climate change. COP26 was scheduled for 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each year since 2015, the UConn Office of Sustainability has sent a delegation of 14 students to the conference to participate, according to its website. Through various events, climate activists from UConn are able to voice their concerns about international climate action on an international scale. The UConn delegation, which attended the second week of the two week conference, engaged in panels, fairs and other grassroots events, but were largely kept out of high-profile negotiations. Michio Agresta, a fifth semester natural resources major at UConn, spoke about performative events. He cites ""greenwashing,"" a term that refers to how organizations mislead the public about their environmental sustainability, as an issue from the beginning of the trip. ""The first day we showed up to the main conference where all delegates and politicians and corporations were, it was all very chaotic, political and greenwashed,"" Agresta said in a phone interview. ""People were giving big speeches on needing to work together, but that was not aligning their actions."" Sena Wazer, a fifth semester environmental studies major at UConn, spoke on the lack of representation throughout the event. Referring to her conversations with Indigenous activists from Latin America, Africa and India, Wazer addressed how there were few people speaking that are personally impacted by the issue. ""It was really powerful to hear from people who had personal experience, who were calling on COP to do more,"" Wazer said in a phone interview. ""But with layer upon layer of inequity, and rooms and conversations being closed off, in many ways the people being affected by climate change were not in the rooms where the decisions were being made."" FILE - A thermometer records just below 100 degrees in a north Seattle neighborhood Wednesday afternoon, July 29, 2009, approaching record highs. While world leaders hail the 2021 Glasgow climate pact as a good compromise that keeps a key temperature limit alive, scientists are much more skeptical. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Attendees were separated into two separate physical campuses during the conference, a ""blue zone"" and a ""green zone,"" according to Khadija Shaikh, a third semester environmental studies major at UConn. Whereas wealthier parties were in the blue zone, many grassroots organizers coalesced in the green zone. Shaikh was one of the UConn students who was restricted to the green zones for some of the trip. Preferring the green zone, she agreed with Agresta that many people were greenwashing climate issues, and asserted that real change comes from grassroots organizers. ""Organizations that have solutions were in the green zone. Everyone in the blue zone was greenwashing, making big blank compromises to make plans to talk and create working groups. But no specific actions are taken,"" said Shaikh in a phone interview. Wazer, the co-director of Sunrise CT, a branch of the national youth climate activist group, felt that the greatest effect of COP26 will be what happens when delegates come back home. "" COP26 reinforced the idea that action needs to happen at the local, state and federal level,"" said Wazer. ""Elevating climate change action to a global level is an opportunity for countries to work together, but we have to go home and keep pushing. COP isn't where we see major change happen."" \"

Key Points:  The summit resulted in the GCP -- agreed to by all participating countries -- as well as various pledges among the parties.  If followed, the commitments made to date, including those established through the GCP, the United Nations Paris Agreement's nationally determined contributions, and others, could limit the growth of atmospheric temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius.  The GCP serves as reminder, however, that commitments alone do not deliver the change necessary to limit climate change; without the appropriate policies, investment, and technologies, any agreements are likely to fail to achieve their stated aims.

Photo: Chris Pagan / Unsplash Parties agreed to the Glasgow Climate Pact after two weeks of intense negotiations during COP26 . And while much has been said about what the UN Climate Change Conference achieved and where it fell short, the real measure of success will be whether stakeholders follow through on their pledges with decisive action. The first test of post- COP26 ambition came just a few weeks later when world leaders gathered to discuss one of the highest-emitting sectors: international shipping. With the pressure on, did they deliver? Shipping's Massive Carbon Footprint Over 10 billion metric tons of cargo move around the world every year on ships that run on fossil fuels. These ships emit carbon into the atmosphere that amounts to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions more than what is produced by the aviation sector. Despite being a significant source of global emissions, shipping has largely been overlooked in international climate conversations. The leading agency responsible for regulating the shipping industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has been slow to act on climate change due to the complexity of global shipping and lack of political will. The majority of participants in IMO meetings have historically been countries that rely heavily on shipping and other industry stakeholders, such as port operators and shipping lines. In other words, people who were not incentivized to make the drastic changes necessary to curb emissions. In fact, shipping is not directly included in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, and representatives from the sector have not had a large presence at past UN Climate Change Conferences. But this year, several commitments were made that should pave the path for long overdue ambition within the shipping sector COP26 Puts Shipping in the Spotlight Through the Declaration on Zero Emission Shipping, for example, 14 countries committed to work with the IMO to place the sector on a pathway to achieving full decarbonization by 2050, finally putting it in line with the Paris Agreement targets. The Climate Vulnerable Forum (representing over 50 countries from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Pacific that are most affected by climate change) announced the Dhaka-Glasgow Declaration, which calls for a mandatory greenhouse gas tax for the shipping sector to curb carbon emissions. And 22 countries also committed to the Clydebank Declaration, which establishes at least six zero-emission shipping routes by 2025. Ambition After COP26 At the conclusion of COP26 , expectations were high that momentum to solve the climate crisis would continue at other UN conferences. And less than 10 days after COP26 concluded, all eyes turned to the 77th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 77) at the IMO. Within the IMO, the MEPC negotiates, adopts, and amends international measures related to the protection of the marine environment an ecosystem critical to addressing climate change. MEPC 77 was the first test of the international community's commitment to the ambitions set out at COP26 , and the first opportunity to put words into action to save the Paris Agreement's temperature goal of limiting global warming to 1.5o C above preindustrial levels. To align with the outcomes of COP26 , at MEPC 77, countries needed to commit to reducing shipping emissions to zero by 2050 and halving emissions by 2030. Unfortunately, members of the IMO did not deliver the level of ambition needed. MEPC 77 concluded without adopting a resolution on a new target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, devising a clear path forward on carbon pricing, or supporting an equitable transition for countries that will be affected by needed changes in the sector. Instead, the IMO's goal remains to reduce 2050 emissions by 50% from 2008 levels a goal that could put the Paris targets out of reach, and well out of alignment with COP26 and the Glasgow Climate Pact. For now, countries are invited to submit proposals on the IMO's emission strategy at MEPC 78 (2022) and will revisit emission targets in 2023. Where Do We Go From Here? First, countries must commit to more ambitious targets for reducing emissions from the shipping sector, in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact. To do so, the IMO must commit to reducing shipping emissions to zero by 2050 and halving emissions by 2030. Waiting until 2023 to set those targets risks sending a signal to industry that there is no real commitment to the kind of transition and thus investment that is needed. But if we have to wait, then the commitments made before and during COP26 by the most progressive countries, industry players, and civil society become even more important. Proving the viability of zero-emission shipping, and the commitment of government and shipping companies and cargo owners to get there, is critical, particularly in the absence of a meaningful goal at the international level. Second, wider participation at the IMO is necessary for an equitable and just transition within the shipping sector. Historically, the IMO has lacked participation from some of the most climate-vulnerable nations, including small island states. This no doubt contributes to the overall lack of ambition generally, but it also means that measures to ensure that no one is left behind by the transition to a zero-emissions world do not get the attention they need and deserve. All voices must be heard at the IMO to create sound policies that will support ambition and an equitable transition, like the proposal by the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, which invests in research and development and supports the most vulnerable through the transition. Finally, the IMO and all other UN bodies must focus on achieving climate goals. We cannot rely solely on UN Climate Change Conferences to advance the fight against climate change. Countries must bring climate momentum to every venue, including the upcoming ocean conferences, to set ambitious targets that protect the environment and people alike. This will be the real test of the commitments we heard at COP26 . \"

An official delegation from the European Parliament has been in Glasgow to take part in the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26 , which ended today. The delegation was led by Pascal Canfin (Renew, FR), with Peter Liese (EPP, DE) as Vice-Chair, who made the following comment after the agreement was announced: Pascal Canfin (Renew, FR), Chair of the delegation, said: ""The deal at COP26 presents some good steps forward on the objective to raise $100 billion for vulnerable developing countries and the coalition to stop public financing for new fossil fuel projects abroad. However, we must admit that the deal is based on the lowest common denominator. The priority now for all the biggest emitters is to share concrete and credible roadmaps towards net zero emissions."" Peter Liese (EPP, DE), Vice-Chair of the delegation, said: ""The glass is definitely more than half full, but there is still a lot to do. While it is very positive that all now accept climate neutrality, it is a big problem that there is too little ambition until 2030. It also remains problematic that a country like China does not want to be CO2-neutral before 2060, which is clearly too late. We need to act faster so that our children and grandchildren still have a chance to control climate change.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA67","Griffith University: Why COP26 Fell So Far Short of Expectations","December 1, 2021 Wednesday 8:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- Griffith University issued the following news: With negotiations at the Glasgow climate change summit complete and delegates from the 197 participating countries on their way home having signed on to the Glasgow Climate Pact, Griffith University academics have unpacked what was achieved and whether COP26 was failure. ""While there were important positive outcomes, Glasgow fell short on two big ticket goals,"" Dr Rob Hales from Griffith University's Climate Action research program and the Director of the Griffith Centre for Sustainable Enterprise said. ""There was not a sufficient increase in mitigation commitments for 2030 that will deliver limiting warming to 1.5Degre C, and no agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal."" In closing, COP26 president Alok Sharma apologised for a last-minute watering down of the Glasgow Climate Pact, in which the term ""phasing out"" coal was changed to ""phasing down"". ""His apology goes to the heart of COP26 in Glasgow,"" Dr Hales added. ""It was hoped COP26 would deliver the urgent ""code red"" action needed to achieve the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to 1.5 Degree C and that it would accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy, and the phasing out of coal."" Weak 2030 targets While COP26 ""The research shows that we're going to need reductions of 45% by 2030, relative to 2010 levels, if we're to avoid the catastrophic impacts such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters,"" said Professor Brendan Mackey Director of Griffith University's Climate Action research program. ""New projections from Climate Action Tracker show that even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is still on track to warm by 2.1 Degree C, or 2.4 Degree C if only 2030 targets are met."" Despite recent climate announcements by the government, Australia's 2030 target hasn't changed since 2015. ""If other countries adopted the same weak 2030 targets we have, average global temperatures would be on track to rise to at least 3 Degree C,"" Dr Hales said. ""Technically, the 1.5 Degree C limit is still within reach because the Glasgow pact stresses the need for countries to update 2030 targets in a year's time. But as Australia's experience shows, due to the pressures of domestic politics there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambitions in 2022."" Phase down, not out In the final days of COP26 , India, a country that relies heavily on coal and is the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, supported by the world's largest emitter China, intervened to change the final wording of the Glasgow Pact to ""phase down"" coal rather than ""phase out"". ""This was an unfortunate weakening of the agreement as it dampens the urgency to shift away from coal,"" Professor Mackey said. The US climate envoy John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further to trap and store emissions underground, a position aligned with the Australian Government. ""The potential of carbon capture and storage was questionable,"" Dr Hales stated. ""Even if it did become cost-effective, the process could not extract carbon emissions at the scale required to meet the 1.5 degree Paris Agreement target, there will always be some that escapes, making the technology an unviable solution."" ""Additionally, very few large-scale CCS underground storage locations exist around the world and with the expense of the technology and the fact that fossil fuels are already more expensive than solar PV and wind, I just can't see it being competitive with cheap renewable energy in the short term - which is the timeframe needed for action to reduce emissions."" Some positives in the washup Despite these shortcomings, there were some notable positives from COP26 . Dr Hales and Professor Mackey said on the upside the Glasgow Pact highlighted the importance of reducing the destruction of natural ecosystems and protecting forests and biodiversity, with Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030. It also urged countries to fully deliver outstanding promises of US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage. Professor Mackey pointed to the finalisation of rules around market and non-market mechanisms for carbon offsets between countries as another crucial outcome. These rules provide the framework for countries to build collaborative arrangements to offset some of their emissions. ""We will need to follow closely how these rules are implemented to ensure they increase mitigation action and don't just legitimise business-as-usual fossil fuel emissions,"" Professor Mackey said. ""While the world is not on track for the 1.5 Degree C goal, the US and China climate agreement announced in the closing days of COP26 is cause for cautious optimism."" ""The fact the pact directly addresses a reduction in coal use in the final text, shows that the changes needed are possible."" ""Whether we can succeed in the small and closing window left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7680006 MSTRUCK \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA68","COP26: Key Takeaways From the Glasgow Summit","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 24, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com The Glasgow conference was praised as a huge step forward in tackling climate change, but also drew criticism for not going far enough. Between 31 October and 12 November 2021, Glasgow hosted the 26th annual Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held under the presidency of the UK. Governments, corporations, academics, social groups, and other members of civil society converged with the aim of working together at the international level to tackle climate change. The discussions culminated in the signing of the 'Glasgow Climate Pact,' a combination of pledges, commitments, and decisions made by countries that are parties to the UNFCCC and the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The private sector, NGOs, and countries outside the context of the formal UN framework also contributed a considerable range of initiatives and pledges, in a show of commitment from actors around the globe to reduce global warming. Having been in Glasgow and attended COP26 , as well as participating in a number of the side events in the 'green room', we found it interesting to note the similarities and differences of the event to previous COPs (including COP21 in Paris) that we have attended. This blog post examines our key takeaways from being on the ground at COP26 , including those contained within the Glasgow Climate Pact and those outside that framework, and considers the possible impacts of several proposals. Glasgow Climate Pact Target Back on 1.5 Within the Glasgow Climate Pact, countries agreed to focus on the 1.5C target, recognising that limiting global warming to 1.5C requires rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in global emissions, including reducing global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 (relative to the 2010 level). Despite the UK's stated aim ahead of COP26 to 'keep 1.5C alive', the reference to 'well-below 2C' was retained in the final version of the Glasgow Climate Pact, in an example of the compromise needed to achieve a consensus amongst all of the parties. NDCs Upon signing the Glasgow Climate Pact, parties were encouraged to submit revised or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as soon as possible before COP27 (which will take place in Egypt in November 2022). NDCs outline the efforts by each party to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The timeframe for updated NDCs is shorter than envisioned under the Paris Agreement, which contemplated a new/updated NDC every five years. Parties were also requested to strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs by the end of 2022, taking into account different national circumstances. Phasedown of Coal One of the more controversial aspects of the latter days of COP26 was the change in wording in relation to coal between the draft and final version of the pact. The final document asks countries to £ccelerate efforts towards phasing down unabated coal power' (referring to coal power that operates without carbon capture and storage technology), whereas the draft issued by the UK earlier during COP26 used the expression 'phase out.' Despite this change, which caused disappointment amongst campaigners and certain politicians, the Glasgow Climate Pact is notable for being the first COP decision to specifically mention a fossil fuel by name. Loss and Damage Developing countries that have already begun to suffer the negative impacts of climate change are to begin a 'dialogue' in relation to funding the Santiago Network, a UN body that was established in 2019 to address damage caused by climate change. The Santiago Network will help provide 'technical support' to assist in avoiding and addressing the consequences of climate change. Despite requests from certain countries, a separate fund to compensate developing countries impacted by the effects of climate change was not agreed. Adaptation and Mitigation Finance A topic of discussion amongst negotiators and the media on many occasions at COP26 , the Glasgow Climate Pact noted that developed countries had missed their 2020 target of providing US$100 billion a year in climate finance to help developing countries. However, developed countries re-entered that commitment for the next five years. Their compliance will likely be closely monitored ahead of COP27, given how much publicity the issue received in Glasgow. Developed nations were also asked to £t least double' their support for climate change adaptation (as opposed to climate change mitigation) actions by 2025 relative to 2019 levels. Article 6 COP26 finally led to agreement on the rules of the international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, six years after that agreement was signed. The rules are likely to become ever more important as countries and companies aim to cut their emissions to net zero, and are likely to lead to increased interest in carbon offsetting schemes such as planting forests. Key decisions on Article 6 include the following: Confirmation (as expected by all) that corresponding adjustments are required to be made to the national determined contributions of countries when Emission Reductions issued pursuant to Article 6(4) of the Paris Agreement (A6.4ER) are sold to another country.[1][1] This rule avoids double-counting of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Certified Emission Reductions issued in 2013-2020 by the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism may be used to meet a country's first NDCs.[2][2] The share of proceeds for A6.4ER transactions has been set at 5%.[3][3] 2% of all A6.4ER issued will be retired automatically to create net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.[4][4] Beyond the Glasgow Climate Pact Outside the framework of the Glasgow Climate Pact, the US, the EU, and a number of other countries launched the Global Methane Pledge, committing to a 30% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 (from 2020 levels). More than 100 countries have now signed the pledge, which aims to limit the particularly potent greenhouse gas. Some of the world's key methane emitters (including China, Russia, and Australia) did not commit to the pledge, which may limit its influence in impacting short-term methane emissions. Pledge to Phase Out Coal Alongside the commitment in the Glasgow Climate Pact to phase down coal (discussed above), 190 countries committed to transition away from unabated coal power generation by signing the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement on 4 November 2021. The statement requires signatories to, amongst other things, (i) rapidly scale up clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, (ii) stop issuing permits and providing government support for new unabated coal-fired power generation projects, and (iii) scale up technologies and policies during the 2020s to achieve a transition away from unabated coal power generation in the 2030s (or as soon as possible thereafter) for major economies, and in the 2040s (or as soon as possible thereafter) globally. Activists have cast doubt over the influence of the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, given the flexibility of the timelines involved and the fact that some countries qualified their pledges to avoid committing to all of the matters raised above. International Sustainability Standards Board As discussed in this Latham blog post[5], the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation launched the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The ISSB intends to issue globally recognised environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting standards for companies in 2022, which will assist with the current fragmentation of a market that is seeing rapidly increasing demand. Conclusion Initial reaction to COP26 has been mixed. Patricia Espinosa, Chief Secretary of the UNFCCC, described the results of COP26 as a 'huge step forward' in ending reliance on coal and recognised the achievements of the parties in relation to climate adaptation funding. And US climate envoy John Kerry described the Glasgow Climate Pact as a 'powerful statement' and stated that the US will take the lead in relation to certain controversial topics, such as loss and damage. On the other hand, climate activists have criticised the results of COP26 for not going far enough, and pointed to the lack of action in relation to a loss and damage fund as evidence that developed countries were not willing to commit the required financial resources to combatting climate change. The nature of multilateral negotiations such as those undertaken at COP26 means reaching a compromise that suited all stakeholders was always going to be challenging. Whilst many key topics were advanced in Glasgow, climate change will clearly continue to be a major topic for governments, companies, and the rest of the population. Latham & Watkins will continue to monitor developments in this area ahead of COP27.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA69","PRESIDENT MACRON ATTENDS COP26 IN GLASGOW","November 1, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the French Embassy in the United Kingdom: France, a major actor in the fight against climate change and guarantor of the spirit of Paris Agreement, will champion, with the European Union, strong actions on several priorities. The 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or COP26 will take place from 31 October to 12 November in Glasgow, UK. France, a major actor in the fight against climate change and guarantor of the spirit of Paris Agreement, will champion, with the European Union, strong actions on several priorities. The most recent work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the urgent need to take action and to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to remain on the pathway of a rise of 1.5C in global temperature as set out in the Paris Agreement. The pledges made by the States Parties within the framework of COP26 will be decisive for the future of the planet. COP26 challenges and priorities Against this backdrop, the four priorities of COP26 are: The fifth conference since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, COP26 is the first opportunity to take stock of progress made on the ambition set out in the Agreement. Each Party to the Agreement must increase its climate commitments every five years and submit a new nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC. The European Union has fulfilled its goal, committing to reduce by at least 55% its net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. 2. Drawing up the Paris Agreement rulebook At COP26 , negotiations are continuing on the rules of application of the Paris Agreement, particularly Article 6 which provides for mechanisms of emissions exchanges and concerning transparency. France and the European Union hope that discussions can be finalized in Glasgow. 3. Mobilizing finance for developing countries COP26 on the amounts that they will mobilize by 2025. This plan was published on 25 October 2021. France has determined this goal to meet expectations of the most vulnerable countries. President Macron is committed to: increase climate finance mobilized by France to 6 billion per year from 2021 to 2025; devote a third of it to adaptation (2 billion). That represents an increase compared to the COP21 commitment of 5 billion in 2020, including 1.5 billion for adaptation. In 2020, that commitment was fulfilled, with a total of 5.05 billion in finance, including 1.96 billion for adaptation, and was even exceeded in 2019, with 6 billion. France has doubled its commitment to the Green Climate Fund for the period 2020-2023, bringing it to 1.5 billion. This momentum is in line with EU action: climate finance of the European Union and its 27 Member States reached 21.9 billion in 2019, making the European Union the main contributor of public climate finance. 4. Highlighting and strengthening the Action Agenda The climate Action Agenda was created so that non-state actors could conduct climate action that works. It was one of the key elements for the COP21's success and the adoption of the Paris Agreement. France would like to see Paris' inclusive spirit continue by pursuing the mobilization of actors (local and regional authorities, researchers, civil society, NGOs, youth representatives, businesses) and multi-actor coalitions so that they can develop tangible solutions for tackling climate change in different sectors (energy, transport, construction, water, oceans). At COP26 , France will provide a place for these actors to express themselves at events in its pavilion. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA71","COP26: call for more global climate action","New Europe","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 26, 2021( New Europe: HYPERLINK https://www.neweurope.eu https://www.neweurope.eu On November 24, Members of the European Parliament debated with Commission Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans, and the Council Presidency, the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). COP26 Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said the EU helped deliver clear progress at COP26 that kept the Paris Agreement targets alive. He said the progress gave the world a chance to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as countries that do not have targets in line with this objective will have to come back with more ambitious national plans in 2022. Mr Timmermans also called for the EU to adopt the 'Fit for 55 in 2030' package before the COP27 scheduled for late 2022, to continue to demonstrate European leadership in the fight against climate change. Before the start of COP26 , Parliament had called for higher global ambitions to achieve a strong outcome at the meeting. While some MEPs described COP26 's outcome as a failure most, however, labelled it an important step in the right direction. They said more action against climate change is needed across the globe, not least in the short run until 2030 where only the EU has a Climate Law and concrete plans to reach the targets. Several MEPs said too many countries are not ambitious enough in their plans to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, with several specifically highlighting China. There were also calls during the debate for the EU to further increase its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target, as some MEPs do not believe the current target is in line with this ambition. The European Parliament has been pushing for more ambitious EU climate legislation, and declared a climate emergency on 28 November 2019.

We now need to see nations implement actions to match pledges to reduce use of coal, to provide greater support for countries on the front line of the climate crisis, and to keep 1.5C within reach. I am particularly pleased that nature has been at the forefront of the COP26 talks, as we cannot tackle climate change without addressing nature depletion. ""But we must not be complacent. The time for warm words and sentiment is over: we must make sure the Glasgow Climate Pact leads to lasting change. Every country must now review its domestic policies to keep emissions down and embed environmental improvement. From how we generate energy to decarbonising transport, our consumption habits to heating and insulating our homes: the opportunities are endless to embrace innovation and deliver a prosperous decarbonised economy. The Glasgow Pact may be seen as a tipping point for governments around the globe to get real on the need to tackle climate change. ""The Environmental Audit Committee will be poring over details of the pact in coming weeks and months. We will continue to hold the Government to account to ensure it meets the many commitments made in Glasgow over the last fortnight."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA74","IN THE VIRTUAL FRONT ROW, CORNELL STUDENTS SAW COP26 UNFOLD","November 18, 2021 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by Cornell University: By Blaine Friedlander | November 18, 2021 During the two weeks of the COP26 (Conference of the Parties) international climate change conference's talks and negotiations, 45 undergraduate and graduate Cornell students plugged in from Ithaca through select channels, listened and held digital front row seats to environmental history. Students from the capstone course ""Global Climate Change Science and Policy,"" (EAS 4443/5443/4441) taught by Natalie Mahowald, the Irving Porter Church Professor in Engineering, and Allison Chatrchyan, a senior research associate in the departments of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, and Global Development, heard a steady stream of high-level country statements and negotiations from Glasgow, Scotland, to keep our blue planet ecologically viable. ""These students have been working hard all semester to prepare for COP26 ,"" Chatrchyan said. ""They know the COP26 topics cold."" Since August, students have been researching key issues that might seem obscure to a general audience, such as Article 6 of the 2015 Paris climate agreement or specific national commitments to reduce climate change. Alana Becker '23 teamed with master's degree graduate student Homari Aoki and Isabella Kong '22 to research Action for Climate Empowerment, or ACE, which promotes climate change literacy, public outreach and awareness, to focus on uplifting world communities and the next generation of climate change leaders. For years, developed countries have been under pressure to give developing countries $100 billion annually in climate financing, said Arden Podpora '23. ""Progress made at COP26 brought us closer to seeing this pledge become a reality,"" she said, but $1 trillion annually may be required. ""That level of financing is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. The conversation on climate finance is ongoing, challenging and critically important."" Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Cornell regularly sent a contingent of class participants annually to the COP meeting, travel funding courtesy of Cornell's David M. Einhorn Center for Community Engagement, and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. Once travel restrictions are lifted, that is expected to resume. Notably, the five-year-old course continues to have impact, as recent young Cornell alumni returned to work at the COP26 meeting: - Daryna Kulaga, M.P.A. '20, part of Cornell's COP24 delegation in Katowice, Poland (2018). She is now the head of emissions management in the private sector, and is part of the COP26 Ukrainian delegation; - Stefano Sarris '16, is now a policy officer and climate diplomat at the European Commission and a COP26 - Alice Soewito '21, from the Cornell delegation to COP25 in Madrid, is now a climate program associate at The Nature Conservancy and delegate to COP26 ; and COP26 , was a Cornell delegate at COP25. Cornell students from around the world have a keen stake in the COP process. Alejandra Plaza Limon, master's degree graduate student, conducted research on Mexico, her home country. ""It was interesting to see my country's ambitious plan in adaptation to climate change, using firsthand research and the most recent science."" Up to 77% of South Africa's primary energy needs are provided by coal, according to master's degree graduate student Nick Hamp-Adams, who studied his home country. ""One successful outcome of COP26 was the commitment of $8 billion to South Africa from the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union to accelerate South Africa's transition from coal to renewables,"" he said. Joyce Kabui, master's degree graduate student, examined the potential of developing and using green hydrogen in Kenya, her home country. She was buoyed after the COP26 meeting, as Kenya committed to implement clean, resilient energy systems that helps to attain the country's development agenda. She said: ""I am optimistic that Kenya's energy sector will undergo significant growth owing to its vast renewable energy potential."" The students will present their work in a symposium on Dec. 15. The course is supported by the Environment and Sustainability major at Cornell, which is managed by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), and the College of Arts and Sciences. The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences is managed by both CALS and the College of Engineering. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA75","COP26 MADE CLEAR THAT THE WORLD IS READY FOR GREEN HYDROGEN","November 23, 2021 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI): By Cato Koole Thomas Koch Blank After the recent COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, COP26 President Alok Sharma said that we have kept 1.5C within reach, but its pulse is weak."" The progress of green hydrogen is one of the developments keeping that pulse alive. Green hydrogen is an innovation that is essential for decarbonization of need-to-abate sectors like steelmaking, shipping, and aviation. And at COP26 , all sides of the systemfrom governments to hydrogen producers to industrial consumersclearly signaled that the world is ready for it. Supply Is Not the Bottleneck Most spectacularly, the production side of the green hydrogen value chain made clear at COP26 that supply won't be the bottleneck this decade. The Green Hydrogen Catapult, a private-sector coalition convened with the support of the UN High-Level Climate Action Champions and hosted by RMI, announced a joint commitment to develop 45 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2027. (Electrolyzers produce hydrogen and oxygen from water using electricity, which is sourced from renewables to generate ""green"" hydrogen.) Combined with what's already deployed, and the announced projects in the pipeline as tracked by BloombergNEF, this commitment places us close to the green hydrogen production capacity needed for a 1.5C pathway as outlined in the International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 roadmap. Furthermore, this development will also help drive green hydrogen costs below $2 per kilogram, making it competitive with blue and in some cases gray hydrogen, both of which are produced from fossil fuels. (Blue hydrogen is distinguished from gray hydrogen by the use of carbon capture and storage to reduce the greenhouse emissions from hydrogen production.) On its own, mere supply of green hydrogen cannot put the world on a 1.5\'cbC-aligned pathway, but fortunately end-use sectors have also sent demand signals that they need green hydrogen for decarbonization. Just ahead of COP26 , a group of companies represented in the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV) committed to only purchase ocean freight services powered by scalable zero-carbon fuels from 2040 onward. During COP26 , the US delegation launched the First Movers Coalition, mobilizing demand sectors to set green hydrogen targets. Furthermore, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Markets Initiative announced supply, demand, and support pledges, including from finance, infrastructure, and certification organizations. More concretely, as laid out by Gonzalo Saenz de Miera, director of climate change of Iberdrola, the demand is already there for the next decade, considering that the existing hydrogen market (currently for gray hydrogen) is forecast to exceed 200 million metric tons by 2028. Governments Are Setting Targets and Implementing Policy The Green Hydrogen Policy Dashboard, which launched at COP26 , shows that governments are starting to set ambitious targets, implement policy, and supply funding for green hydrogen. European countries are leading the way for now. However, countries such as Mauretania, Morocco, Namibia, and Chile have exceptionally high-quality resources for renewable power generation and are increasingly expressing interest in green hydrogen. Securing the Promise of Recent Developments These are very promising developments. But more is needed to fast-track the transition and ensure that the momentum out of COP26 leads to a resilient market of sufficient scale. The green hydrogen sector is asking governments to: Support and incentivize adoption of green hydrogen in priority industry sectors Develop clear and accelerated approval pathways and legislation for green hydrogen projects, including required power grid upgrades and interconnections Set ambitious near-term targets Create a fair market environment by aligning support for green hydrogen with existing subsidies Meanwhile, the Green Hydrogen Catapult will continue building out green hydrogen production capacity; mobilizing value chain projects in priority sectors like shipping, fertilizer, and steelmaking; and supporting and leading the establishment of policy to enable a green hydrogen economy, including voluntary mechanisms such as emissions certifications. As COP26 showed, the world is ready for this critical decarbonization solution, and we don't have a moment to lose in putting it to use. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA76","India's standout COP26 moment","The ASPI Strategist","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 05, 2021( The ASPI Strategist: HYPERLINK http://www.aspistrategist.org.au http://www.aspistrategist.org.au World leaders have now departed Glasgow after delivering, with a few notable exceptions, underwhelming climate announcements. If COP26 was the planet's last best chance, leaders for the most part didn't rise to the occasion. But the conference is not over from now through 12 November, officials and negotiators will be working around the clock to flesh out and perhaps improve on the commitments made by the heads of state. There is much for them to build on. In the lead-up to Glasgow, almost 70 countries had committed to net-zero emissions targets, including China, the world's largest carbon emitter. The standout announcement at COP26 was from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He committed his country to net zero by 2070 the first time[1] India has committed to an emissions-reduction target. This means that India may be able to peak emissions by 2030, but it's difficult to be definitive on that in the absence of an official baseline prediction of its future emissions. According to some estimates[2], hitting the 2070 target means India's emissions will have to decrease by 15% overall. Even more ambitious was Modi's pledge[3] to increase the country's non-fossil-fuel energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 and increase the share of renewables from 40% to 50% by 2030. That's really big news because, if these efforts are successful, 70% of India's installed electricity capacity will be non-fossil-fuel based. The 50% renewables target goes much further than the 38% that could be achieved[4] in India by market forces alone, according to the Energy Policy Simulator. Right now, all of this looks difficult to pull off. But for Modi the political wins are obvious. The announcements transmit a clear signal intended to attract more of the global finance massing behind the transition away from fossil fuels. India can only benefit from the jobs and sustainable growth that this will bring. And India's government-driven electrification of transport and industry will be hugely popular domestically if it results in a drop in energy and fuel costs across the board and a steep improvement in the extremely poor air quality in India's major cities. Modi's targets will require a massive investment in a new green supergrid for India, which the UK will partner with India to build. This was part of a signature UK-India proposal[5] to spearhead green supergrids across the planet to offset local renewable intermittency. The geopolitics and regulatory requirements of this proposal will be interesting, but India is a great place to start. Fossil-fuel producers have hoped that they can replace declining revenues from developed economies by selling into emerging markets like India. But with government-backed renewable targets like the ones Modi just announced, the risks for fossil-fuel investment will only grow and might also help divert investment from fossil fuels to renewables elsewhere in the developing world. India's new commitments, combined with the net-zero pledges made by countries prior to COP26 , represent a big improvement over the Paris climate agreement. If these commitments are actually implemented, we will have a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.9C[6], compared to the 2-4 degrees of warming anticipated just five years ago at the conclusion of the Paris agreement. The private sector, reflected in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero[7], is also contributing significantly to the momentum. Timed to coincide with COP26 , the alliance announced that it was adding a number of major banks and pension funds to its membership, which now represents US$130 trillion[8] of assets under management committed to achieve net zero by 2050. And the US$8.5 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership[9] that France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU signed with South Africa could be a model for other energy-transition partnerships with big emitting emerging economies in regions such as Southeast Asia. Other wins were new agreements to halt deforestation[10] and reduce methane emissions[11], and the commitment of 20 economies,[12] including the UK, US and EU, to halt financing for all overseas fossil-fuel projects. The International Energy Agency's relatively conservative 2021 report on limiting global warming to 1.5C argues that most coal needs to be phased out by 2030[15], with gas and oil not far behind, to achieve 90% renewable electricity by 2050. This means that the credibility of post- COP26 carbon roadmaps, especially from the big coal producers and users such as the US, India, China, Japan, South Korea and Australia, really hinges on how they can demonstrate this phaseout. Or, if not, they need to explain to their citizens why temperature rises over 2C the probable amount of warming if these phaseouts don't happen rapidly is acceptable. For those countries, including Australia, that privilege technology over fossil-fuel reduction, it's important to note that the IEA report has a role for technology like carbon capture and storage, but only in addition to, not instead of, steep cuts in fossil fuels. The carbon budget is tight, and with every year of insufficient action there's less room to manoeuvre. The frustration of many global south countries was voiced by Belize[16] this week. 'For every dollar that my country invests in climate action, G20 countries undo multiple times over with billions of dollars in oil and gas investment,' Prime Minister Johnny Briceno said. Overall, this first stage of COP26 demonstrates that governments are still lagging behind markets, civil society and public opinion[17] on climate action. The heightened ambition on display still doesn't match up to the science. We are getting close, but too many G20 nations are still acting as if climate science is an opening gambit that can be bargained with through incrementalism.

Attendees to the meeting were among presidents and public figures, Ivan Duque, President of Colombia, former United States President, Bill Clinton, the Minister of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition, Gustavo Manrique and national authorities of the tourism and fishing sectors respectively. The newly created marine reserve adds 60,000 square kilometers to the Galapagos Marine Reserve. The marine reserve is divided into two halves, the first 30,000 square kilometers set a strict prohibition to any fishing activities; the other 30,000 is where longline fishing is strictly forbidden. The marine reserve is located at the northwest corner of the archipelago and protects the biological corridor which lies between the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, Cocos Island in Costa Rica, and other islands of neighboring countries like Coiba, Panama, and Malpelo, Colombia, which are part of The Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor which is used by numerous species like sea turtles, stingrays, whales and sharks during their migration routes. Minister Gustavo Manrique added that the reserve was called ""Brotherhood"" (Hermandad in Spanish) for being the result of joint efforts of diverse sectors of the society like artisanal and large-scale fishermen, tourism, environmentalists, among others. He further added: ""In our government, we promote open dialogue and reaching agreements. This marine reserve is proof of our commitment to reconciliation. During the COP26 summit we announced the creation of this marine reserve and we have delivered."" The ribbon-cutting ceremony had a special touch because the ribbon that was cut by the president of Ecuador and minister Manrique, was created by Galapagos' craftsmen using recycled materials.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA79","Learning Coming to Life: Students Reflect on Attending the COP26 Summit","December 2, 2021 Thursday","Swarthmore Phoenix: Swarthmore College","Instead of attending class with the rest of Swarthmore students from October 31 to November 12, five students, Daniel Balauro '23, Alicia Contrera '22, Olivia Stoetzer '23, Kyra Hall '22, and Tyler White '22, along with professor Ayse Kaya, Sustainability Program Manager Claire Hyre, and PhD student and Swarthmore Alum Melissa Tier '14 attended the United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland as observers. The eight students and faculty were split into two groups of four with Balauro, Contrera, Hyre, and Tier attending the conference from Oct. 31 to Nov. 5 and Stoetzer, Hall, White, and Kaya attending the conference from Nov. 6 to Nov. 12. They went to COP26 in order to observe the ongoing negotiations between countries on how to mitigate the climate crisis. Back in Spring 2021, students were allowed to apply to be a part of this trip. The selected students then took the UNFCCC COP and the International Climate Regime class taught by Professor Kaya to prepare for their time at COP26 . Swarthmore students are able to attend these yearly conferences because the college received non-governmental organization observer status for COP in 2013. They have since sent a delegation each year, except in 2020 when the conference was canceled due to COVID-19. This year, COP26 COP26 was an incredible experience. In their reflections, the students kept emphasising how enlightening it was to see the ways in which countries negotiate with one another. ""To see countries' [leaders] actually speaking and sharing their positions while you're sitting right there was absolutely crazy. It was amazing,"" said Stoetzer reflecting on her time in Scotland. It was a learning experience for students unlike any other. While the days were long and busy, students found it rewarding to see in real-time all the things they read about in their classes. ""It was a mind-blowing experience,"" said Hall. ""There was nothing about that week that mimicked my life at home. Everything was a learning moment, and everything you saw made you question how the world is governed. The conversations we have here at Swat were just manifested there."" Since there were so many speakers to see, events to attend, and negotiations to watch, students were able to split up and decide themselves what they wanted to do at COP26 that catered to their own interests. This meant that the students had different experiences at COP26 . COP26 was essentially divided into two main events for students to attend: side panels which were held by academics, activists, and organizations, and the actual negotiations among state leaders. While the panels were open to everyone, the students on this trip quickly learned that most negotiations happen behind closed doors that not even Swarthmore's status of NGO observer opened. Only the negotiation on climate finance was open to everyone, and Stoetzer, along with Professor Kaya, attended it. The negotiation involved debate over how much money countries would raise to deal with the climate crisis. ""In 2009, developed countries said they would mobilize $100 billion in climate finance by 2020. And they haven't gotten to that. Everyone has a different definition of what counts towards that amount, so the US thinks we're like 99% there. Whereas I've seen other countries say we have $40 billion,"" Stoetzer explained. States debated over how private finance, loans, and grants factor into climate finance, and if climate finance should be monitored by a bottom-up approach, where countries would define climate finance themselves, or a top-down approach, where there would be one overarching set of criteria for all countries to define climate finance. After watching days of negotiations on climate finance, Stoezter reports that there are still a lot of questions up in the air. ""The outcome was to table it. Or ask another institution to define it. That's kind of what we saw there. There was a lot of tabling until next year because people couldn't reach an agreement,"" she said. Instead of attending the climate finance negotiations, Hall was much more interested in the actual climate science. She attended panels held by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which were centered around states' efforts to meet the goal of only 1.5\'b0C of warming. ""This was supposed to be the COP where we got our shit together. That's what the narrative was, like it is now or never if we're going to actually hit a 1.5 or even 2\'b0C target,"" said Hall. As of now, the world is on track to warm about 2.7\'b0C by the end of the century, but that prediction gets higher with each passing year. On Wednesday, November 10, draft texts of resolutions to meet that goal of 1.5\'b0C were passed out and by midmorning, states, NGO groups, and union and trade organizations were able to ask for parts of the draft to be changed and edited. The next morning, a new draft was released with the proposed edits and the groups met again to discuss what else they wanted changed. For Hall, this was an opportunity to see what really went into climate change negotiations. ""It was really interesting to see the same countries saying similar things or similar things continuing to be a concern because they haven't been addressed because they're really not that fixable when there's not enough funding for all of this,"" she said. Hall and Stoezter spent a lot of time attending organized negotiations while other students who attended the COP26 trip spent their time meeting with activists and leaders representing other communities. Balauro, who attended the first week of COP26 , was especially interested in exploring the power imbalances between different nations, so he dedicated much time to hearing perspectives that were off the main stage. He participated in sessions led by people like UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Victoria Tauli-Corpuz and Secretary of State Tony Blinken. On the last day he was at the conference, Balauro attended the Fridays for the Future protest led by Greta Thunberg that demanded leaders at COP26 do more to mitigate climate change. ""I'm from American Samoa - a Pacific island deeply impacted by the climate crisis, and is also under the jurisdiction of one of the second largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said in an email to The Phoenix, ""I wanted to take this unique opportunity to not only learn more about the complexities of international climate regimes, but to connect with community leaders and activists from around the world."" White, too, found his time attending protests at COP26 to be an important experience for him. ""I attended one protest in Glasgow that featured a myriad of indigenous folks from the Amazon to South Dakota to environmental justice communities in the Bay Area. The organized goal was to get JP Morgan Chase to divest from funding new and existing pipelines,"" he said in an email to the Phoenix. But White considers his most enlightening experience to be watching delegates from Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Ethiopia speak freely together about how to bargain for the best deals from the U.S. and the E.U. COP26 were privy to many important discussions held by state leaders, indigenous activists, and academics. They witnessed both the positive and negative things that came out of the conference. On one hand, there were things at the conference that students felt needed to change. Stoetzer reflected on the idea of equity and who was able to have the loudest voice in any given room. ""The US delegation had about 300 people, and a lot of like LDCs, least developed countries, had like, five, or something like that,"" she pointed out. Balauro and Hall also were very critical about the lack of accessibility and equitable representation at COP26 . ""Due to VISA accessibility, lack of badges, and inability to finance representatives to even attend, many frontline communities were not able to attend - and it was this vast lack of representation that really stuck out to me,"" Balauro said in his email. Hall agreed that the structure of COP26 needs to be amended. ""At the end of the day, poor countries are not represented in the way they need to be and those are the countries that have the most to say and their voices should be amplified the most and some of them can't even get there,"" she said. White found that the experience truly showed the problems with how the international system deals with climate change. ""I left further harmed by and further pessimistic of the capacity of this kind of a system to genuinely address the issues at hand,"" he wrote. On the other hand, this was a space where countries and activist groups came together to focus solely on the looming climate crisis. ""I think the first day we were there Kyra [Hall] pointed out that this was the first time she'd been in a room where everyone actually cared about climate change. There were a lot of like minded people all trying to get to that 1.5\'b0C warming,"" said Stoetzer. Students left COP26 cautiously optimistic about what they had seen there. ""Something that was a success was the Paris agreement rule book which was a way to figure out how to track a country's emissions and how to hold people accountable,"" said Hall. ""I always say progress is progress. I'm a huge fan of celebrating successes while also being critical of where we fall short."" Balauro, while optimistic, is also holding out to see what will happen in the future. ""I think there were a lot of ambitious statements made by all nations, but given that many of [the statements] are not legally binding, we have yet to see how these statements turn into action in the next couple of months. Looking forward, I still think that there is a lot of work left to do especially for climate reparations,"" he said. Overall, though, for the students who attended COP26 , this was an opportunity to see the things they read in class play out in real life on the international stage and meet and speak with other leaders, activists, and people passionate about climate change . ""Even if this isn't something you feel super interested in, it's an amazing learning experience. I would encourage anyone to apply for it,"" said Hall.\~ \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA82","COP26 Roundup: India's Pledge, Methane Observatory","November 1, 2021 Monday","International Oil Daily","Opening Statements World leaders staked their claim to climate leadership in a series of short addresses that opened the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The opening statements illustrated key divisions among nations, including those between fossil fuel producers and major consumers, and between developed and developing countries. Many of the short opening statements seemed more focused on domestic audiences as leaders sought to appeal to a global audience as well as constituents at home. US President Joe Biden characterized the fight against climate change as a moral and economic imperative as he tries to shepherd key climate and infrastructure legislation through the US Congress. There were several important no-shows. Russia's Vladimir Putin spoke at the G20 summit but did not attend the COP26 meeting in person, delivering a recorded video message instead. China's Xi Jinping delivered a written statement to the summit \'e2\€ the only major world leader to do so. Calamitous Temperature Rise During the COP26 opening ceremony UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world is on track for a ""calamitous"" 2.7\'c2\'b0C temperature rise. Calling for a price on carbon, an end to fossil subsidies and the phase-out of coal, Guterres also suggested that countries should revise their national climate plans every year, rather than every five years. Noting the importance of net-zero emissions pledges, the UN chief said there was often confusion about what those pledges actually mean. To help overcome this, Guterres said he would establish a new group of experts to propose clear standards to measure and analyze net-zero commitments from non-state actors. India Pledges Net Zero ... in 2070 India will meet a target of net-zero emissions by 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the COP26 summit. He said India will increase its non-fossil power generation capacity to 500 GW by 2030, by which time half of its energy will come from renewable resources versus 38% last year. India will reduce its projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tons between now and 2030 and reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45%, he said. Methane Observatory The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has launched a new International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) to drive action to reduce methane emissions. Beginning with the fossil fuel sector, the observatory will produce a global public dataset of verified methane emissions. UNEP said the observatory will provide the means to prioritize actions and monitor commitments made by state actors in the Global Methane Pledge \'e2\€ a US/EU-led effort by over 30 countries to slash methane emissions 30% by 2030. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, but its atmospheric lifespan is relatively short, making it a focus of attention at COP26 as a way to achieve significant near-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Majors' COP26 Wish List Ahead of the COP26 summit Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden called on governments to ""set change in motion"" essentially by agreeing on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Calling for robust carbon pricing and a way to trade carbon credits globally, he suggested governments must play a role in helping to shape fossil fuel demand as well as supply ""using mandates where needed."" The Shell boss also flagged the importance of more ambitious and effective policies to regulate the energy sector, including clear frameworks and timelines for phasing out cars and vans that run on gasoline and diesel and phasing in battery electric and hydrogen vehicles. Van Beurden said last week that as oil and gas companies, ""we were told that we were not welcome"" at COP26 . \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA83","COP26: A SNAPSHOT OF THE AGREEMENT","November 15, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Regional Information Center for Western Europe (UNRIC): After extending the COP26 climate negotiations an extra day, nearly 200 countries meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, adopted on Saturday an outcome document that, according to the UN Secretary-General, ""reflects the interests, the contradictions, and the state of political will in the world today"". The outcome document, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, calls on 197 countries to report their progress towards more climate ambition next year, at COP27, set to take place in Egypt. The outcome also firms up the global agreement to accelerate action on climate this decade. However, COP26 Mr. Sharma apologized for ""the way the process has unfolded"" and added that he understood some delegations would be ""deeply disappointed"" that the stronger language had not made it into the final agreement. By other terms of the wide-ranging set of decisions, resolutions and statements that make up the outcome of COP26 , governments were, among other things, asked to provide tighter deadlines for updating their plans to reduce emissions. On the thorny question of financing from developed countries in support of climate action in developing countries, the text emphasizes the need to mobilize climate finance ""from all sources to reach the level needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, including significantly increasing support for developing country Parties, beyond $100 billion per year"". Other key COP26 Beyond the political negotiations and the Leaders' Summit, COP26 brought together about 50,000 participants online and in-person to share innovative ideas, solutions, attend cultural events and build partnerships and coalitions. The conference heard many encouraging announcements. One of the biggest was that leaders from over 120 countries, representing about 90 per cent of the world's forests, pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, the date by which the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to curb poverty and secure the planet's future are supposed to have been achieved. There was also a methane pledge, led by the United States and the European Union, by which more than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of this greenhouse gas by 2030. Meanwhile, more than 40 countries including major coal-users such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile agreed to shift away from coal, one of the biggest generators CO2 emissions. The private sector also showed strong engagement with nearly 500 global financial services firms agreeing to align $130 trillion some 40 per cent of the world's financial assets with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, including limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Also, in a surprise for many, the United States and China pledged to boost climate cooperation over the next decade. In a joint declaration they said they had agreed to take steps on a range of issues, including methane emissions, transition to clean energy and decarbonization. They also reiterated their commitment to keep the 1.5C goal alive. Regarding green transport, more than 100 national governments, cities, states and major car companies signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans to end the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in leading markets, and by 2040 worldwide. At least 13 nations also committed to end the sale of fossil fuel powered heavy duty vehicles by 2040. Many 'smaller' but equally inspiring commitments were made over the past two weeks, including one by 11 countries which created the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA). Ireland, France, Denmark, and Costa Rica among others, as well as some subnational governments, launched this first-of-its kind alliance to set an end date for national oil and gas exploration and extraction. A quick refresher on how we got here To keep it simple, COP26 was the latest and one of the most important steps in the decades long, UN-facilitated effort to help stave off what has been called a looming climate emergency. In this treaty, nations agreed to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere"" to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories. Since 1994, when the treaty entered into force, every year the UN has been bringing together almost every country on earth for global climate summits or ""COPs"", which stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. This year should have been the 27th annual summit, but thanks to COVID-19, we've fallen a year behind due to last year's postponement hence, COP26 . \"

The crucial role of private investment in efforts to achieve net zero will be set out by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later today (Wednesday) as part of Finance Day at COP26 . The First Minister will join the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan at the opening session of a Green Investment Showcase to detail how private investors can help drive the green industries of the future. The First Minister will emphasise Scotland's role as a world leader in sustainable industries and highlight the associated investment opportunities that exist, including through Scotland's Green Investment Portfolio now valued at 2 billion and which is expected to reach 3 billion in 2022. The Showcase, hosted by Scottish Enterprise, will be attended by international and UK-based institutional investors, along with climate and clean tech companies seeking investment. The First Minister said: COP26 provides what is possibly our best chance to advance the societal and economic change that is demanded by the climate emergency, delivering lasting action towards net zero and a climate-resilient future. ""By grasping the opportunities provided by green industries and supply chains, we can create the good green jobs of the future and secure a just transition away from fossil fuels. ""The role of private capital is fundamental to achieving this and governments must do what they can to channel investment into areas supporting transformational change.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA85","Hunger for Sustainable Food Systems Was Unstated at COP26, Despite Plant-Based Campaign","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 20, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com by Harco Leertouwer While 20,000 delegates at COP26 tucked into dishes from menus that contained 40 per cent plant-based dishes, one butcher was keeping a watchful eye. Founder of The Vegetarian Butcher[1], Jaap Korteweg, launched a campaign in the run-up to the Conference of Parties, in the hope of highlighting the environmental impact that animal meat consumption inflicts on the planet. The 'Elephant in the Room' campaign was designed to raise awareness and generate action from leaders and policymakers in a bid to encourage more consumers to choose a plant-based diet and reduce methane emissions. Animal agriculture plays a significant role in the fight against climate change, with the livestock industry contributing between 14.5 per cent and 18 per cent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide), according to the United Nations and University of Oxford. As a result, scientists and policy advisors worldwide have recommended that animal meat consumption is significantly reduced, although a firm policy in supporting this is limited. According to the campaign, the animal meat consumption issue is lacking in European policy and was notably absent from the COP26 agenda, despite sustainable food systems playing a vital role in lowering emissions. The Vegetarian Butcher brand was created to be as close to meat as the real thing. Jaap Korteweg was a meat lover and butcher but became disillusioned with the meat industry and has set about delivering vegetarian alternatives that focus on taste and texture to produce an innovative vegetarian meat product. He said: 'We think it is important that our products are an ode to animal meat. It is a misunderstanding that vegetarians don't like meat. If people didn't like meat that much, there would be a lot more vegetarians.' COP26 , but the organisation has said it was disappointed that animal agriculture and meat consumption wasn't given the airtime it requires. Nick Palmer, Head of the UK CIWF office, said: 'Following pressure from us and other campaigning organisations, agriculture was given more prominence at COP26 , particularly on Nature Day, but it wasn't enough."" 'Diets are a key piece of the puzzle in solving the climate catastrophe but were largely ignored in COP26 discussions."" 'We are extremely proud of the impact we were able to have at COP26 , thanks to backing from our wonderful supporters. Our stand had a constant stream of delegates visiting each day, enabling us to drive home our message which was reinforced by our powerful new report. Our press ads were positively received, and our joint statement gained media traction across Europe and beyond. Whilst global leaders have failed to emphasise the need to reduce meat consumption and the huge impact animal agriculture plays in climate change, the media certainly haven't."" 'Over the coming months, we will continue our work to influence UN bodies to ensure animal agriculture is on the agenda at COP27, in Egypt, next year, and in other key UN processes such as the United Nations Environment Assembly and the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.' Harco Leertouwer, Managing Director of Acre's European business commented: 'To say that I'm discouraged by the absence of animal meat consumption from the COP26 agenda would be an understatement, but that's not to suggest that I'm not hopeful. By casting a spotlight on the vital role that sustainable food systems can play in lowering emissions, we're also continuing to acknowledge the fact that we don't need everyone to be perfectly sustainable."" ""As someone who has spent the better part of his life consciously opting into a more sustainable diet, I know first-hand how enriching plant-based options can be. It's a small change to the way I eat that makes an invaluable contribution to our climate - and that's the kind of thinking plant-based campaigns promote. That's the kind of thinking we need to capitalise on - whether it's on the COP agenda or not.' Operating globally from our hubs in London, New York and Amsterdam, Acre is supporting the world's leading organisations, along with the most innovative start-ups, to build resilience, adapt and manage the risks involved with taking pragmatic action to tackle climate change.

For some present, it was a continuation of their commitment towards a cleaner future through global and local activism efforts. The COP26 Earth and Atmospheric Sciences 4443: Global Climate Change Science and Policy typically travels to see the event in person, but COVID-19 related travel restrictions prevented the trip this year. Alejandra Plaza Lim\'f3n, grad, was one of the students who watched the negotiations virtually. Watching the negotiations in class, according to Lim\'f3n, was meaningful due to her experience as a climate activist. In 2019, Lim\'f3n participated in the annual One Young World Summit as a representative of Mexico, where she previously worked to promote clean energy. While visiting the Mexican senate in 2018, Lim\'f3n experienced the vulnerability felt by climate activists around the world. Leaderboard 2 ""We feared individually naming ourselves,"" Lim\'f3n said. In light of recent reports about progressively worsening climate conditions by reputable figures such as NASA, ecoactivism has seen a steady rise. Unfortunately, violence against activists has also been growing. According to a Global Witness report, 2020 was the most dangerous year for climate activists on record, with over 200 climate activists killed. ""Individual activists are definitely targets of violence,"" Lim\'f3n said. ""There is an unbearable level of corruption, of impunity, of violence."" Newsletter Signup \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA87","A New Idea Emerges at COP26","December 3, 2021 Friday","American Institute For Economic Research","In November, 2021, 180 world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland for COP26 , the United Nations' annual climate summit. But once the wheels of their private jets had touched down on domestic tarmac, it was unclear what exactly this fortnight of doomsday lecturing had accomplished. Professional truant Greta Thunberg eloquently summarized the event as ""blah, blah, blah,"" and advised we ""shove [the] climate crisis"" in a place where the Sun won't be warming it. Though Thunberg's criticisms are neither principled nor practical - instead predicated on a catch-all blame game of ""colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression"" - her insults ring true. For sensible solutions to take the place of big state spending, a fair-trade, energy-independent focused conservatism must set the agenda for climate and national security conversations at COP27. Commitments from past conferences have been vague utopian visions of abolishing emissions, which avoid amounting to actual solutions, and are unilaterally enforced. The Paris Accords didn't penalize China for neglecting to meet targets, and weren't necessary for President Trump to make America simultaneously energy independent, and the leading nation in reducing emissions by 2019. COP26 was a chance to correct the record with binding resolutions which put market solutions to the forefront of international conservation efforts. One of these new approaches was the pledge to end global deforestation by 2030 which was signed by more than 100 countries. While the pledge itself is more a signalled intention than prescribed path, the recognition of the importance of forests as natural carbon sinks was significant. Trees sequester carbon when alive, but also release it when cut down; with deforestation accounting for 8 to 10 percent of carbon emissions globally.\~ Unfortunately, deforestation is expediently profitable in the countries with the richest forests. Countries like Brazil don't have the enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with top-down mandates, so illegal logging runs rampant. And who can blame them? With the government short of a stick, farmers and loggers would refuse to comply with regulations that would rot the carrot of improved living conditions. Indonesia - which has one of the world's highest deforestation rates - backed out of this pledge just a few days after they signed it, citing its ""unfair[ness]."" At the Global Conservative Climate Summit, the Honorable Werani Chilenga, MP from Malawi, reiterated how infeasible forestry policies dictated to developing nations are, when energy infrastructure in Malawi isn't sufficient to get the population to move from charcoal to coal, let alone wind and solar. We can't expect the poor to sacrifice their lives and livelihoods for our politicians' sudden apocalyptic obsession.\~ Markets are the solution to the impotence of centralised state edicts, specifically carbon markets. Significant progress was made at COP26 , where politicians ratified Article 6 of the Paris Accords and established a framework for a global carbon market. Governments and private entities can trade carbon globally by allocating ownership and property rights to carbon usage. This enables compensation to be made available for farmers for protecting carbon sinks like the Amazon Rainforest. If these markets remain free from eco-authoritarianism - like intentions to cap consumer choice according to an individual's carbon footprint - they will provide politicians and businesses new trade tools to lower our environmental footprint while raising economic output. As the Kuznets curve and every socialist state demonstrate, no nation got more eco-friendly by being poorer. Predictably, the presence of market solutions to conservation challenges wasn't well-received by environmental activists. Thunberg called the concept ""a dangerous climate lie"" that ""??give(s) polluters a free pass to keep polluting."" It's hard to take the Swedish schoolgirl seriously, though, when Rwanda's environmental minister called these markets ""economically vital"" to the future of developing nations. Paradoxically, Greta has lost faith in top-down climate action - releasing a video with the New York Times titled ""Greta Thunberg Has Given Up On Politicians."" Fortunately, the market solutions she baselessly hates will work in practice while she marches unproductively in the streets, and can give her an alternative cause to pin her hopes on. Chronic hostilities between climate activists and capitalism remain barriers to instituting actionable market solutions. Eco-socialism has dominated the debate for so long, conceptualising the Earth as one big worker, turning while man extracts profit from it until it is barren and burned. But if this conference was any indication, that might be coming to an end. Centre-right politicians and private innovators showed up to COP26 in an unprecedented way. A delegation of five Republican representatives attended the conference, building on the momentum of the creation of the Conservative Climate Caucus just a few months ago in the House of Representatives. Fringe events like the Youth Environment Summit and Global Conservative Climate Summit platformed market perspectives, despite being excluded from the UN's Glasgow ""Green Zone."" In the case of the latter, conservatives elected from five different continents gathered to discuss the future of climate policy. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero was also announced at COP26 , gathering 150 global financial corporations to mobilize $130 trillion in investment for clean energy and climate projects. By reframing the debate as an imperative to empower state-level community-based conservation and to ensure energy independence during the gas and battery Cold War with China and Russia, there is enough market activity and political will on the right to ensure socialism isn't smuggled in under the guise of a climate crisis. Most Republicans recognize that the market always provides the best solutions to the challenges humans have faced. Pollution, deforestation, and moving from fossil fuels sold by America's enemies are no different. This is why it is so crucial that believers in the market confidently take a seat at the table to champion solutions rooted in economic freedom.\~ The primary impediments to sensible climate action are political gridlock by ideological Democrats, and counterproductive activism from indoctrinated schoolkids. Conservatives showed up at COP26 to indicate that a constructive alternative to alarmist rhetoric exists. At COP27, it's time that we attended in full force, and told the UN to let the adults do the talking. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA88","Cornell's Chatrchyan Represents Armenia at COP26 Talks","November 5, 2021 Friday 1:17 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- Cornell University issued the following news: By Blaine Friedlander At the COP26 international climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Cornell researcher Allison Chatrchyan gets a front row seat. ""Armenia begins with an 'A,' so for the large plenary meetings with all countries, Armenia is always in the first row,"" said Chatrchyan, a senior research associate in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, and Global Development. ""It's an amazing experience to sit up front at this critical global conference."" But Chatrchyan more than sits. She works to shape United Nations policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing carbon sequestration and adaptation through the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA), a U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) workstream formally established in Bonn, Germany, at COP23 in 2017. Chatrchyan was one of seven Cornell researchers and partners attending the conference this week; eight more faculty will go next week. COP26 is the annual U.N. conference striving to forge ambitious agreements to avert further climate change. At the KJWA sessions, part of COP26 , delegates from every country that is party to the 2015 Paris Agreement are sharing information on how to scale up agricultural climate change mitigation and adaptation to protect food security. ""The work that I'm doing in the KJWA process on behalf of Armenia is to make sure that their needs related to soil carbon sequestration, livestock management, agroforestry, food security, and climate change adaptation are heard at the global level,"" said Chatrchyan, who gave a presentation at a KJWA workshop in December 2020 on key socioeconomic barriers that limit agricultural transformation. ""And these are issues about which Cornell can provide some of the best research in the world."" Chatrchyan's expertise with climate change and agriculture stems from her work at Cornell, where she leads the Cornell Climate Smart Farming ( HYPERLINK http://climatesmartfarming.org/ For several years, Chatrchyan and Natalie Mahowald, the Irving Porter Church Professor in Engineering, have taught Global Climate Change Science and Policy (EAS 4443/5443), a capstone course for environmental sciences majors and graduate students. Students in the class prepared in-depth policy briefs on key issues at COP26 , and are following COP26 live remotely via a Cornell observer badge. Mahowald served as a lead author of the U.N. ""Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius"" ( https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/10/un-climate-report-author-ambitious-actions-needed-slow-global-warming https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/10/un-climate-report-author-ambitious-actions-needed-slow-global-warming ) in 2018; Chatrchyan is involved in global negotiations to keep the world from climbing above that 1.5 C. In the class, Cornell students learn firsthand from Mahowald and Chatrchyan about how science figures into global policymaking. As for Armenia, the small mountainous nation that Chatrchyan represents, it is the fourth most-vulnerable country to climate change in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It has already registered a 1.3 C increase in average temperature, and a 9% reduction in precipitation, according to Armenian government. Reaching climate neutrality is at the core of Armenia's energy independence, energy security and green-growth policies, President Armen Sarkissian, a physicist, said at the COP26 plenary session on Nov. 2. Chatrchyan is taking the Armenian president's climate commitments to heart. ""When I met my Armenian colleagues at COP21 in Paris in 2015,"" she said, ""there were only four negotiators from the country, and it was very difficult for them to cover all the key issues being discussed."" By working with the Cornell delegation at COP26 , she is helping ensure that Armenia is at the table for critical agricultural negotiations. ""I am very proud to represent Armenia at COP26 ,"" she said, ""and provide this amazing country with as much support as I can.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA89","Priorities for Africa at COP26 and beyond","Africa Renewal"," ","Jean-Paul Adam, from Seychelles, is the director of Technology, Climate Change and Natural Resources Division at the UN Economic Commission for Africa. He spoke to Wanjohi Kabukuru for Africa Renewal about Africa's priorities at the global climate talks ( COP26 ) taking place in Glasgow during 31 October to 12 November 2021: Africa Renewal: What are Africa's priorities at the COP26 and why? Jean-Paul Adam: Climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building are indeed the priorities that are being put forward to COP26 . The finance conversation is a big one because it is, in a sense, the prerequisite for many of the other things to happen, including technology transfer. The mobilisation of finance to tackle climate change, particularly for adaptation, is as urgent as ever. African advocacy to ensure that previous commitments are honoured will be critical. Ultimately, we cannot divorce the climate resilience agenda from the development agenda. We cannot have one without the other. However, the biggest missing piece in the puzzle is up-front financing. Developed countries pledged US$100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. Where are we on this? It is frankly absurd that we have trillions of dollars being mobilized in pandemic-related stimulus but the $100 billion is yet to be paid, and yet as a percentage of the $20 trillion mobilised by developed countries to tackle COVID-19 it is frankly negligible. The $100 billion is only a portion of what is needed to deal with climate change, and it should be reviewed urgently to match the extent of the financing gap. Even with more innovative financing models being undertaken, the new financing instruments should not replace the promised $100 billion per year. We must also use this moment in history to redefine how we look at development - where look beyond GDP per capita, and address the underlying factors that affect vulnerability of countries. This is particularly relevant for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). African countries are taking proactive stances and committing to move to renewable energy pathways and invest in their own resilience. Many countries are already net positive and absorb more emissions than they create. African countries are ambitious in terms of the low carbon development models they wish to adopt. What is missing is the investment to unlock this opportunity. One of the key elements of COP26 is that Africa remains excluded from a lot of the financing available under climate change. Private markets are insufficiently developed to channel much needed investment into African climate resilience projects, and this would be a key part of the solution. Given African countries' debt burden, what other options are there to boost financing? Debt issues are a challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic context where fiscal space for all African countries continues to be constrained, and countries are unable to service their debt with diminishing revenues. However, opportunities are emerging for innovative finance. There is a need to have private sector investments as part of the solution bringing in innovative financial mechanisms such as blended finance, green and blue bonds, and debt swaps, which can leverage limited public resources to mobilize huge investments needed for climate action. For instance, we welcome the recent comments from the World Bank indicating interest in developing frameworks for debt-for-climate adaptation swaps [debt relief in exchange for countries taking climate action]. Africa's economy of the future must be resilient to risks of further climate change and ecological damage. By prioritizing nature-based solutions and advocating for a fair developmental price for carbon at COP26 in Glasgow, there is opportunity to mobilise further resources for Africa's green and blue economy. Can you speak more about the green and blue bonds? Green and blue bonds are opportunities that have been used in developed markets for many years but unfortunately, Africa today has less than 1% of the green and blue bond market globally. Properly tapping into this opportunity for market-based investments can turn billions into trillions. Some countries have successfully issued green and blue bonds. Egypt issued a bond in renewable energy in 2020 and Seychelles issued a blue bond in 2018. The idea is to provide financing at cheaper rates linked to investment in climate resilience. Blue bonds are associated with the blue economy and oceans. How are they linked to climate change action and sustainable development? Climate change has taught us great lessons about the oceans. We cannot just say 'let us take everything and exploit it'. Many countries have experienced coral bleaching which has immediate impact on fish stocks. A warming ocean affects the migration of key species such as tuna. The sea is not just a space for exploitation, it is a space for development. It is a space to connect countries, it is about trade routes, connectivity, environmental protection, tourism, natural resources, fisheries and the entire ocean view. This is the blue economy. The concepts of a green economy or a blue economy are precisely aimed at ensuring that the health of the natural eco-system is properly factored into the economic activities which generate wealth. For us, the blue economy is about creating a new economic paradigm for African countries - beyond extraction for export - and rather about sustainably building value chains that are grounded in astute management of the oceanic natural resources. There are many opportunities in the sea and the blue economy is a key part of sustainability. In a sense, the blue economy approach allows Africa to reclaim its oceans. The race to net-zero places emphasis on a 'just transition'. What does this mean and how it will affect Africa? The 'just transition' simply means that we have to recognize that Africa is starting from a lower base in terms of the move towards the low-carbon economy. Africa is not yet industrialised, meaning that the changes that are needed may actually see more disruptions in society. We should not make the most vulnerable people pay. We have to take an approach that is pro-development, pro-poor and which ultimately allows the maximum number of people to be able to exit poverty and have a good quality of life. The priority for Africa's industrialisation is access to electricity. The good news is that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy generation available and therefore it makes sense for Africa to invest in renewables. Nevertheless, we must recognize that in certain circumstances, improving base generation capacity may require additional investment in fossil fuels to allow increased renewables or be brought online. A 'just transition' means we deal with poverty as number one priority. By dealing with poverty, we will provide the solution for low carbon development. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA90","Green Climate Fund: Scaling Up CoP Event Outlines COP26 Outcomes and Ways Forward","December 3, 2021 Friday 8:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Green Climate Fund issued the following news release: To reflect upon COP26 outcomes and scale up climate innovation and investments, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Brookings Institute hosted the Climate Change Working Group workshop on 17 November 2021 during the 6th Annual Workshop of the Scaling Up Community of Practice (Scaling Up CoP). In the two-session meeting, panellists and participants engaged in discussions that reviewed COP26 proceedings and suggested ways forward to scale up climate finance and investments for delivering the targets of the Paris Agreement. 'Looking at COP26 , we can say that there was progress in recognising that climate change is happening, thus the need for increased finance for adaptation,' said Yannick Glemarec, GCF Executive Director. 'The scale up must be enormous and supported by a variety of financial instruments in addition to grants. Moreover, it will be necessary to get very close to the USD 100 billion goal before COP27 to prevent a trust gap between the parties.' Glemarec pointed out the COP26 challenges: emission gap, adaptation gap, and finance gap. A fourth at risk of emerging was a credibility gap between developed and developing countries due to the USD 100 billion climate finance goal that is yet to be met. He also noted the risk of credibility gap towards the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. Lord Nicholas Stern, Professor of Economics and Government and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE), remarked the status of scale regarding the climate agenda. He emphasised the deepening in its general understanding since the Paris Agreement in 2015 that has now led to net-zero commitments. 'We see an enriched understanding that goes beyond emissions and takes into consideration biodiversity and protection of ecosystems - and that is directly linked with a breakthrough in technologies,' Stern noted. 'Moreover, the scale up of people was evident at COP26 . It saw massive participation from the private sector and the presence of several prime ministers and heads of states, which was not always the case with previous COPs.' Amal-lee Amin, Director of Climate Change at CDC Group, stressed three dimensions gleaned from COP26 The link between the climate agenda and scaling up climate finance was highlighted by Amar Bhattacharya, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute. Bhattacharya outlined four dimensions of scaling up: cooperation around ambition which points to addressing and managing the limited carbon budget; investments and innovation, highlighting how to do things differently and get ahead of the game, noting that the Technology Breakthrough Agenda was a relevant point from COP26 ; centrality of policy concerns which refers to the capacity of countries to design and implement a system transformation and carbon pricing; and necessity of finance as scaling up can come through the engagement of the private sector and partnerships with multilateral funds and institutions. Following the launch of GCF's innovation Working Paper at COP26 , Glemarec also highlighted GCF's four-pronged approach for green market creation and development. He identified the main barriers to climate innovation in developing countries, many of which are related to the policy and regulatory environment as well as to technical and macro-economic constraints. GCF's four-pronged approach to overcome these barriers and to accelerate and scale up climate innovation in developing countries aims to help nurture a supportive regulatory environment and public support in developing countries; deploy GCF resources to accelerate innovation; de-risk investment to deploy new climate solutions at commercial scale; and strengthen domestic financial institutionsth to support the widespread adoption of commercially proven new climate solutions. Moderated by Bhattacharya and George Zedginidze, Head of Knowledge and Change Management at GCF, the workshop was attended by over 130 participants.

Concern Worldwide, which was at COP26 in Glasgow to highlight the impact that climate change is already having on the lives of the poorest, said the leaders of wealthy countries had failed the most vulnerable. ""As usual, national economic growth has been prioritised by political leaders over sustainable economies and livelihoods. The existential threat to the planet and the immediate threat to the lives and livelihoods of the world's most vulnerable people have not been given the urgency they demand,"" said Connell Foley, Concern's Director of Advocacy. ""The $100 billion a year promised by high income countries in 2009 to help people in poorer countries adapt to the ever increasing droughts, floods and extreme weather events that come with climate change has never been delivered, and now it's been further pushed down the line to 2023,"" he added. ""People in these countries are being forgotten, they don't have the luxury of delaying how they feed themselves, keep shelter over their heads, keep their families safe."" ""The countries least responsible for climate change are being driven into debt trying to deal with the impacts of climate change and related crises."" Concern also said that the commitment to climate finance, to help people adapt to their changing environments, needs to be in addition to overseas development budgets, which are already overstretched. ""What failed to be addressed at COP26 was finance for the losses and damages already caused by climate impacts in developing countries. The outcome committed to more dialogue, rather than action on this issue of critical importance for the most vulnerable countries"" said Mr Foley. ""While some progress was made at COP26 , it is worlds away from what is needed. There is always a lag time between commitments and their implementation in terms of actions, so the lack of urgency and ambitious targets is extremely worrying. But we will continue to push world leaders for immediate action and will work with the most vulnerable to make sure that their voices are heard louder than ever"".

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA92","COP26: A CLEAR AND POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR BUSINESS","December 15, 2021 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI): Having been an observer on the last day of COP26 , industry expert Nick Murry of Asesoria Group takes us a deep dive into what happened in Glasgow and considers what it means for your business. 15 Dec 2021, 9 min read With COP26 done and dusted, the Glasgow Climate Pact was supposed to mark the next 'leap forward' to follow the Paris Agreement of 2015. However, based on where it leaves us somewhere between 1.9C and 2.5C of warming it would be easy to conclude that COP26 was a failure. The agreement is undoubtedly an unsatisfactory compromise that reflects vested and short-term political interests. But does it give us a better chance of avoiding a climate catastrophe? Is limiting global heating below 2C now more possible, or was it just more ""blah, blah, blah?"" And given that the UNFCCC was established with the aim of ""stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations...at a level that will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,"" has the UN process itself failed to deliver what's required? Before reflecting further, it's worth revisiting the context. The fact is global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have risen continuously since the industrial revolution, and continue to accumulate at about 50 billion tonnes of CO2e per year (despite a slight reduction as a result of the pandemic). This has already led to a global mean temperature rise of 1.1-1.2 degrees, which the IPCC estimates could pass 1.5C by the mid-2030s unless drastic action is taken. Crucially, the IPCC warned that exceeding 1.5 degrees would be much more dangerous than previously thought, and emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 to hit net zero by 2050. Yet despite this, the Paris pledges and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) were set to increase global emissions by 16% by 2030, according to the UNFCCC's recent synthesis report, equating to a temperature rise of 2.7C. Given the above, and the world's economic disparities and dependence on fossil fuels, it is questionable whether COP26 ever had any real chance of success. So how far did the COP get? The Glasgow Climate Pact reaffirmed the Paris goal of limiting global temperature rise to ""well below 2C and if possible, under 1.5C above pre-industrial levels,"" and made moves towards ""keeping 1.5 alive"" by stating that signatories would ""pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C,"" including ""reducing global carbon dioxide (only) emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century,"" as well as calling for ""deep reductions in other greenhouse gases."" Nevertheless, one of the key tasks for COP26 was to raise ambition by way of national targets, the UNFCCC Synthesis Report on NDCs having concluded in February that these were not on track to meet the Paris goal. It was disappointing then, that less than half of countries submitted five-year updates in time for the COP, only increasing to around three quarters by its end. On the plus side, signatories agreed to strengthen their 2030 targets in 2022 (instead of five years' time) and there is to be an annual ministerial round table on pre-2030 ambition from COP27 on, adding more urgency and giving room for optimism. Also positive, was finalising Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which clarifies the rules around carbon markets and should support international cooperation on NDCs, as well as helping drive investment in mitigation activity, including new technology. Much was made by the UK Government of COP26 securing ""the end of coal"", and whilst the Pact included action on coal for the first time, the wording of the agreement was watered down in the final stages from 'phasing out' to 'phasing down' unabated coal, and from phasing out fossil fuel subsidies to phasing out inefficient ones. There were commitments to significantly increase financial support from developed to developing countries, including via the Adaptation Fund, despite richer nations having thus far failed to channel the US$100 billion per year agreed at COP15 in Copenhagen. This is important because the world won't limit heating to less than 2C without these countries fully on board. COP26 also established a dialogue on so-called ""loss and damage"" from the current impacts of climate change, though funding was not forthcoming for this from the US or EU. The Pact also makes reference to the Climate Finance Delivery Plan led by Canada and Germany. There were also many initiatives alongside COP, including an agreement to cut methane emissions by 30%, which nearly 100 countries signed up to; a commitment by 130 countries to end and reverse deforestation by 2030; a cement and steel industry carbon emissions reduction agreement; a pledge to accelerate the adoption of green hydrogen; and the setting up of a new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), tasked with producing global reporting standards, with a focus on carbon. At the COP's Finance Day, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced plans for the UK to become the world's first net zero aligned financial centre and to set up a Transition Plan Taskforce to support the new requirement for net-zero transition plans, which all UK financial institutions and public listed companies will be required to publish. This follows the UK Government's Net Zero Strategy and a series of UK policy announcements made in the run-up to COP. There were also new commitments announced from coalitions such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which brought together around 450 institutions in 45 countries, aiming to align $130 trillion of financial assets with decarbonisation goals. At the same time, we're seeing market signals such as Shell's decision to pull out of the Cambo oil field development, based on the economic case no longer being strong enough, and Ford's stock price soaring on announcing its $30bn investment in EV. The number of businesses signing up to the Race to Zero Campaign and associated science-based targets commitments to near-term targets and Scope 3 emissions reporting, is also cause for optimism. So whilst the nations of the world collectively drag their feet, the institutional investment community would seem to be moving forward apace and has the potential to drive real change. In the words of Mark Carney, ""the architecture of the global financial system"" is being ""transformed to deliver net zero,"" so that ""every financial decision takes climate change into account."" Whether this, coupled with an era of greater business purpose and transparency, will result in emissions coming down fast enough, only time will tell. What are the implications for business? Despite COP's failings, the commitments made and the associated public and private sector initiatives, make the direction of travel crystal clear. Quite simply, those businesses not planning for net zero will find themselves under more pressure, become increasingly unsustainable and face challenges on multiple fronts, including legislative, investment, competition and in terms of social licence to operate. This will be partly driven by what some are calling a new era of transparency. As mentioned, UK listed companies will not only need to report emissions, but they will have to publish their plans for net zero. And as the emphasis moves to science-based, near-term targets, and reporting Scope 3 emissions, suppliers will come under greater pressure to report and reduce their emissions if they want to retain business. Companies will also find their ""carbon credentials"" coming under greater scrutiny when seeking finance or investment. Importantly, it is business and industry that will have to deliver the change that governments have agreed they need to happen, ultimately transforming investment into a net zero economy and society. The need to speed up this delivery between now and 2030 came through loud and clear in Glasgow and will be felt more acutely going forward. And whilst interventions in the economy will be needed to make this happen, delivery will increasingly become the focus. For businesses then, climate change is fast becoming the biggest risk and biggest commercial opportunity. COP26 is one key part of the jigsaw but the investment markets, and the companies they invest in, may turn out to be the most significant driver of change from here on out. For those businesses that haven't, now is the time to re-assess climate risk and invest and innovate to benefit from the inevitable transition that's coming whether in new products, new market opportunities or completely new business models. What to do now Despite its painfully slow progress, COP26 should be seen as a watershed moment. And a justification, if another were needed, for step-change as opposed to incremental and immediate action as opposed to long term goals. My advice to businesses, post COP26 would be: Take a science-based approach. Establish short-term targets. Invest strategically to achieve them. Measure and communicate progress. Expect your carbon reduction commitments to be ahead of your current capacity to deliver them. Now is the time to catch up. Think about leadership and governance: the best-laid plans will fail if not incentivised from the top down and supported from the bottom up. C-suite leadership, carbon reduction integrated into the business strategy, incentivised delivery. Learn from, educate and collaborate. With staff, customers and suppliers. Engage in pre-competitive collaboration within your industry. The transition to net zero will take place across the value chain but it will be brought about by individuals playing their part within it. Grasp the opportunities. Think of your business as part of the emerging future economy. Act strategically to develop new market opportunities. Examine the potential for a more sustainable business model. Start investing in the transformation to a net zero business and embedding future value. Keep a watching brief. Change is happening and likely to speed up don't get left behind! Expect to see more announcements from the government and potentially on the international stage as the UK continues its COP presidency until November 2022. Seek help! Making a successful transition can be a steep learning curve for many businesses but there's no need to re-invent the wheel. And not all companies will have the right skills in-house. A focus on getting it right in terms of strategy, performance and communication is key. It's not all straight forward but with appropriate expert support, net zero is achievable. COP26 was a global 'staging post' and a gathering point for government, business and civil society. We must hope it will also be a historical turning point. The challenge for all of us is to keep up the momentum and transition to net zero as quickly and equitably as possible. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA93","COP26 and the Global Race to Net Zero","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 05, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com World leaders and delegates are meeting in Glasgow for the next round of climate change negotiations at the twenty sixth Conference of the Parties ("" COP26 "") being held from 31 October to 12 November, following a year-long postponement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. COP26 serves as the vital next step in the process for the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (""UNFCCC"") to implement the legally binding international climate treaty - the Paris Agreement - which was adopted at COP21 in Paris on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016.1 Its goal is to limit global warming such that the global average temperature rises by no more than 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels or, failing that, by no more than 2C (3.6F),2 in order to prevent the catastrophic and irreversible anthropogenic climate change that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") projects will occur if this is not achieved.3 In July 2020, COP26 President Alok Sharma set out five key areas of focus in the run-up to COP26 : the first was energy, followed by transport, nature-based solutions, adaptation and resilience and, tying it all together, finance.4 There is widespread consensus that an energy transition grounded in reliable sources and technologies is the only realistic way to meet the Paris Agreement goals. WEO-2021: The Guidebook for COP26 The International Energy Agency published its World Energy Outlook Report in October 2021,5 a month earlier than usual so as to be in circulation ahead of COP26 (the ""WEO-2021""); it self-proclaims to serve ""as an essential guidebook to COP26 "". This COP, short for the ""Conference of the Parties"", the main decision-making body of the UNFCCC, is particularly significant. It falls five years after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and is arguably the first critical opportunity to test the readiness of countries to submit new and more ambitious carbon reduction commitments, by way of updates to their Nationally Determined Contributions, previously agreed to under the 2015 Paris Agreement. It is also an opportunity, as the WEO-2021 states, to provide an ""unmistakeable signal"" that accelerates investment in a sustainable future and the transition to clean energy worldwide. According to the WEO-2021, the energy sector accounts for three-quarters of the greenhouse gas emissions globally that have already caused global average temperatures to rise 1.1C higher than pre-industrial levels, with visible impacts on weather and climate extremes. The energy sector therefore has to be at the heart of the solution to tackling the climate crisis. It is widely recognised that a new global energy economy is emerging, but the transformation still has a long way to go. The baseload of energy in the early stages of the transition will be provided by gas, wind and nuclear, and the ultimate long-term objective is an efficient mix of energy sources that can provide secure and affordable renewable energy at scale. The WEO-2021 warns that the rapid but uneven economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession is putting major strains on parts of today's energy system, sparking sharp price rises in natural gas, coal and electricity markets and, for all the advances being made by renewables and electric mobility, 2021 is seeing a large rebound in coal and oil use. As a result, according to WEO-2021, 2021 has seen the second largest annual increase in CO2 emissions in history. In the run up to COP26 , increasingly ambitious carbon emission reduction pledges have been made by some governments, municipalities, companies and financial institutions. The WEO-2021 suggests that countries pledging to reach net zero emissions now account for 60 - 70 per cent of today's global GDP and energy-related CO2 emissions, and around one-third of energy-related methane emissions; a promising step in the right direction on the journey to net zero. A Rapid, Just and Secure Energy Transition It is widely acknowledged that the pace of transition away from fossil fuel-powered assets to cleaner and renewable generation assets needs to accelerate. Predictions suggest a four-fold acceleration over the next decade is required if the Paris Agreement targets of reducing global temperature rises to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels and the shift to net zero are to be achieved. The barriers and challenges to the energy transition are no doubt different for developed countries and developing countries. Developing countries that have historically contributed a small proportion of global greenhouse emissions are in many cases trying to industrialise (often reliant on carbon intensive industries) so that, amongst other things, their citizens have universal energy access, and yet are being expected to transition at the same pace as developed countries, without the financial and technical resources needed to get there. For example, excluding South Africa, the remaining 1 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa are serviced by a power generating capacity of around 80 gigawatts and have contributed less than 1 per cent of cumulative CO2 emissions. This is roughly the same capacity consumed by a single European country such as Germany.6 It is widely accepted that a rapid and just transition to clean energy, at both international and national scales, is vital. The WEO-2021 emphasises that countries' transitions have to be ""secure, affordable and fair for all citizens"", and in this vein, the UK recognises that the energy transition should be undertaken in a manner that is fair and equitable to those currently working in and supporting the carbon-intensive oil and gas industries. According to the WEO-2021, current investment levels in the global energy sector are inadequate - both to meet near-term energy needs and long-term transition goals. It warns that the dangers inherent in today's shortfall in spending on the clean energy transition globally, compared to the levels required, cannot be understated; and the shortfall is most pronounced in developing economies. An acceleration of capital flows in support of the energy transition, and particularly in developing economies, is needed. It is recognised that such investment will need to come from private developers, consumers and financiers responding to market signals and policies set by governments. Powering Past Coal In most markets, the cost of renewable energy such as solar PV and wind is now cheaper than coal and there is increasing pressure to phase out coal worldwide. COP President Alok Sharma has called for COP26 to ""consign coal to history"" and the Powering Past Coal Alliance (""PPCA"") is one of the primary vehicles that is facilitating achievement of this goal at COP26 and beyond.7 Initially created by the governments of the United Kingdom and Canada in 2017, the PPCA is today a coalition of more than 130 members including countries,cities, banks and utilities committed to phasing out unabated coal power, and to ending the international financing of new coal plants, and the PPCA-led momentum has gained apace in 2021. The UK has also launched the COP26 Energy Transition Council (""ETC"") as part of its COP26 presidency, which aims to bring global leadership together to accelerate the transition to clean power. In its first statement in December 2020,8 the ETC confirmed its plans to seek opportunities, inter alia, (i) to make clean power technologies the preferred option for countries investing in new power generation, with the aim of doubling the rate of investment in clean power by 2030, and (ii) to develop policy and regulatory frameworks to attract the private sector to help deliver and finance these investment needs. The Evolving Role of the Oil & Gas Industry: Investment and Accountability The oil and gas industry increasingly recognises that, in order to survive long term, it must reimagine how it will fit into the energy mix going forward. Oil and gas majors, including BP9and Shell,10are increasingly announcing their net zero emission pledges at a company level and are becoming ever more central players in the clean energy and transport markets as they explore investment opportunities to diversify their portfolios and reposition themselves in the energy industry. Globally, the oil and gas industry is central to actively driving the transition to a cleaner and broader energy mix, with a pivotal role at the forefront of developing and investing in much needed new carbon abatement technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage (""CCUS""), that other industries can deploy whilst keeping the lights on. CCUS represents a game changer for the oil and gas industry, allowing oil and gas majors to keep producing oil, albeit with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and oil and gas majors are well positioned to drive developments in hydrogen given their expertise in transporting and selling gas.11 As more oil and gas majors declare their plans and strategies to achieving net zero, accountability - to regulators around the world, to other oil and gas companies, to shareholders and investors, to the workforce and to the general population in the societies in which they operate - will be critical, as these stakeholders become ever more concerned about the environmental impact of their own investments, the industry within which they work, and/or the energy they consume. Decommissioning Responsibly As the pace of transition increases and the dominance of fossil fuels in the global energy mix declines, it can be expected that the pace of decommissioning of oil and gas production platforms and assets will necessarily increase. Decommissioning activities will need to be carried out in a manner that supports the journey to net zero. Ensuring decommissioning is undertaken in both an economically efficient and low-carbon way will be a delicate balancing act in which the oil and gas industry will play an integral and fundamental part. Opportunities for Businesses and Governments: COP26 and beyond Collaboration between all stakeholders at COP26 and beyond will be key. The Paris Rulebook, the rules needed to implement the Paris Agreement, is set to be finalised at COP26 (negotiations at COP25 in Madrid in 2019 failed to resolve the rules, inter alia, for carbon market mechanisms), and there is a focus on accelerating action through collaboration between governments, businesses and civil society.12 It is widely recognised that the shift to net zero presents a significant opportunity for a number of businesses. Collaboration between historically disparate industries, such as the existing oil and gas and power andrenewables industries, which each have their own regulatory requirements to comply with, and who are likely familiar with certain industry-standard contracting structures, will be fundamental to achieving net zero as efficiently and reliably as possible. Significant interaction with Governments will also be required, especially in terms of implementing updates to legislative or regulatory frameworks. The new emerging energy economy also has the potential to create millions of jobs across a host of new and cleaner supply chains and to improve people's livelihoods at a global scale. To make this a reality, government leaders meeting at COP26 in Glasgow must play their part and seize the opportunity that COP26 presents firmly with both hands and make stronger and more ambitious commitments than previously - they must be more than a drop in a rapidly warming ocean. Governments are ultimately in the driving seat with unparalleled capacity to direct the decarbonisation of energy systems worldwide and to ensure the 2020s is a decade of dedicated clean energy investment and deployment at scale. As COP President Alok Sharma made resoundingly clear in his opening speech: ""[T]his COP, COP26 , is our last best hope to keep 1.5 in reach"".13 1 UNFCCC ""The Paris Agreement"", available at:

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA94","Five Takeaways from the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26)","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 19, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com [co-authors: Shawn Whites and Samendra Pasad] Reflecting back on the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or ' COP26 ,' it may well become known as the 'Pledge and Commitment COP.' Governments, businesses, multilateral institutions and civil society focused their two weeks in Glasgow on how to 'get things done' to limit the planet's rising temperatures to 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. The apparent solution: pledges and commitments. Now comes the hard work: adhering to these pledges and commitments, with clearly defined milestones, in a transparent and accountable manner to ensure environmental integrity. At previous COPs business was present, yet its impact on the holistic outcomes were secondary. Historically, government negotiations over official decisions and specific nuances in the text dominated the energy and interest of businesses and civil society, who served as 'observers' to the UNFCCC process. Certainly, COP26 had its opportunities for diplomacy and single words do matter e.g., phase out vs. phase down in relation to coal power but in Glasgow, business played an outsized role inside the official 'Blue Zone,' as well as across Scotland at privately sponsored forums, roundtables and parties. There was a sense, despite the protests, that the business and environmental communities are working more in concert with governments toward common goals. Private sector driven climate action took on a life of its own with an incredible momentum irrespective of the technical outcomes that reflect clearer plans of action and a greater potential long-term success to meet the aspirations of the Paris Agreement. In our COP26 preview alert[1], we expected methane, money, markets, partnerships and nature to dominate the agenda. COP26 delivered in each of these areas, with several notable surprises. We present a snapshot of five important high-level takeaways below, and look forward to diving deeper into these issues in the weeks to come. Five Takeaways Climate finance, including accountability and 'loss and damage,' prominently figured into the negotiations Despite increased finance pledges just prior to COP26,1[2]developed countries fell short of their decade-old commitment to jointly provide $100 billion annually in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. As such, there was a heightened emphasis at COP26 on how and when developed countries will deliver on this commitment. This emphasis is reflected in the primary COP26 decision document, the Glasgow Climate Pact[3], which reaffirms developed countries' commitment to 'fully deliver' on the '100 billion goal through to 2025,' while also calling for governments to provide greater clarity on the implementation of their finance commitments. Climate finance was also a focal point of new pledges and commitments that occurred outside the context of formal negotiations. As we prognosticated, governments pledged new limitations on fossil fuel finance. The United States and 38 other countries, for example, issued a joint statement[4] committing to end new direct public support for the international 'unabated' (i.e., without carbon capture and storage) fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, 'except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5C warming limit.' New pledges and commitments on domestic and international coal financing were also announced, which we assessed here[5] and here[6]. Further, the Glasgow Climate Pact[7] 'calls upon' parties to accelerate actions toward the 'phase-out' of 'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.' While this new and caveated language elicited equal parts criticism and optimism, we note that eliminating even a small percentage of the estimated $6 trillion[8] in global fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 would represent a major step toward achieving the 1.5C limit. COP26 also saw unexpected finance commitments directed to climate adaptation, a historically underfunded slice of the climate finance pie. For example, the Adaptation Fund which finances projects and programs to help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change received a 'record-shattering' $356 million[9] in new government support, including a first-time $50 million contribution from the United States. Elsewhere on adaptation finance, 12 governments pledged $413 million[10] in new climate resilience funding for the 46 Least Developed Countries, and the U.S. Agency for International Development launched[11] a Green Recovery Investment Platform that will invest up to $250 million to mobilize $2.5 billion of private finance for adaptation and mitigation by 2027. Finally, as expected, the debate around funding for 'loss and damage' resumed with heightened intensity at COP26 . While a group of 46 Least Developed Countries most vulnerable to climate change advocated[12] for a new 'Loss and Damage Facility' to be included among the conference's final decisions, parties to the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed instead to establish a new 'Glasgow Dialogue' to discuss potential £rrangements for the funding of activities.' Parties agree to rules for market and non-market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement After years of complex negotiations, parties managed to agree on a 'rulebook' for implementing the market-based cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The rulebook is reflected in two decisions: (i) Article 6.2 guidance[13] on bottom-up, bilateral or regional approaches involving the use of 'internationally transferred mitigation outcomes;' and (ii) Article 6.4 rules, modalities and procedures[14], governing a new centralized United Nations (UN) market mechanism akin to the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).2[15] The Article 6 rulebook provides a platform for the scaling-up of carbon markets across the globe e.g., by enabling greater linkages between countries' emissions trading systems, or by creating demand for a new category of high-quality 'Article 6-compliant' carbon credits for trading in the voluntary carbon markets. For a deeper dive into key elements of the rulebook and implications for carbon markets in Singapore, see our colleagues' analysis here[16]. Transportation, including aviation and shipping, remains a key area of emphasis for mitigating emissions COP26 's 'Transport Day' centered on emission reductions from motor vehicles, including cars, vans, trucks and public transport. In the lead-up to 'Transport Day,' 154 signatories including national and local governments, automotive manufacturers, fleet owners and operators, investors and financial institutions issued[17] a Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% Zero Emission Cars and Vans. This Declaration sets a nonbinding goal to ensure that all new cars and vans sold by 2035 (in 'leading markets') or 2040 (throughout the rest of the world) are zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The next day, the Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council, a forum of governments with large automotive markets, announced[18] its 2022 priorities intended to meet the Paris Agreement's climate goals and accelerate the growth of the zero-emission automobile market. The Council's four priorities are to: Spur greater investment in ZEV charging infrastructure in collaboration with the private sector and in such a way that allows electricity grids to support increased charging demands. Support the deployment of light- and heavy-duty ZEVs through carbon dioxide or fuel efficiency standards and regulations. Reach a stronger consensus on the pace of the transition and technology choices for zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. Ensure a 'truly global' ZEV transition that includes engagement with developing countries, development assistance, and evidence-based, action-focused recommendations for strengthening international programs. Notwithstanding the attention given to motor vehicles, which account for over 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, COP26 also ended with commitments in the transportation sector's next two largest emitting categories: aviation and shipping. With respect to aviation, a group of 23 countries across all continents committed[19] to strengthening the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global market-based framework intended to keep carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation at their 2020 levels. Importantly, these countries also committed to promoting the development and deployment of (1) sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions while avoiding competition with food production; and (2) innovative low- and zero-carbon aircraft technologies that reduce aviation emissions. During the COP, the United States released its Aviation Climate Action Plan[20], applying the Biden-Harris administration's whole-of-government approach to 'put the sector on a path toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050,' emphasizing SAF and innovative technologies. As for shipping, a group of 22 countries supported[21] a goal of establishing so-called 'green shipping corridors,' defined as zero-emission maritime routes between two or more ports. These countries aim to establish at least six such corridors by the 'middle of this decade' through partnerships with ports and operators to accelerate decarbonization of the shipping sector. COP26 's aviation and shipping commitments included a number of African, Asian, European and South and North American countries, but did not include key players like China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Russia and Mexico. Nature and biodiversity garnish significant attention, but operative provisions ultimately omitted in Glasgow Climate Pact The Glasgow Climate Pact omitted any significant nature- or biodiversity-based obligations, instead merely emphasizing the importance of ecosystem protection, conservation and restoration. Still, the convention featured a number of high-level initiatives likely to push capital and financing toward efforts to protect natural capital and biodiversity without compromising climate progress, including: The United States' Global Forests Conservation Plan, which focuses[22] on halting deforestation and nature degradation in critical ecosystems like the Amazon, Congo and Southeast Asian forests. A commitment from over 30 private financial institutions to eliminate[23] agricultural commodity-driven deforestation risks in their portfolios by 2025. The Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue Roadmap for Action, a framework intended[24] to encourage supply chain sustainability, support smallholder farmers' participation in markets, and improve supply chain transparency and technological innovation. A $1.7 billion pledge from countries and philanthropy organizations to advance[25] indigenous peoples and local communities' forest tenure rights and recognize and reward their roles as guardians of forests and nature. A Joint Statement on Climate Change and Biodiversity Crises through which over 25 land management organizations including key agencies within the U.S. Departments of Interior, Agriculture and Commerce agreed[26] to champion the role of protected and conserved areas in addressing the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Private sector organizations also made noteworthy nature-focused commitments, such as Burberry's three-pronged biodiversity strategy[27] and Botanic Gardens Conservation International's new 'global biodiversity standard' that seeks[28] to recognize and promote projects that actively protect existing habitats and enhance biodiversity while halting the spread of invasive species. Although COP26 similarly lacked any formal obligations to protect oceans, the Glasgow Climate Pact formally welcomed oceans into the convention and invited further global discussion on incorporating strong, ocean-based actions into climate commitments. To push this process along, the United Kingdom continued[29] to urge countries to support a global pledge to protect at least 30 percent of the world's oceans by 2030 and committed millions of dollars to ocean-related initiatives, including development of the 'blue economy,' financing to Fiji through its first sovereign 'blue bond,' and financial contributions to the Global Fund for Coral Reefs and the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance. COP26 also seemed to further solidify the growing nexus between the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity, in recognition of their complementary symbiotic relationship. Notable new partnerships coming out of COP26 will drive climate action going forward Expanding the tradition of past COPs, governments, businesses, investors, philanthropy organizations and nonprofits announced or formally launched numerous new partnerships 'on the sidelines' of COP26 . In the United States alone, we counted over 15 new public-private or government-to-government partnerships announced by the administration during COP26 . This includes, for example, the following public-private partnerships that might be of interest to the business and investor communities: The First Movers Coalition[30], which will serve as a platform for companies to harness their purchasing power and supply chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy technologies in eight sectors: steel, trucking, shipping, aviation, cement, aluminum, chemicals and direct air capture. The USAID Business Case for Collective Landscape Action[31], which will convene the private sector, governments and local landscape actors to reduce commodity-driven deforestation, increase restoration, conserve biodiversity and improve livelihoods in tropical ecosystems, while aiming to mobilize $30 million in private finance. A Global Clean Technology Incubator Network[32] of national renewable energy labs, technical institutions, investors, corporations, governments and philanthropies working to scale-up the development, financing and adoption of low- to zero-emission energy innovations in emerging and developed markets. Meanwhile, perhaps the biggest surprise emerging from COP26 is the renewed collaboration between the United States and China on climate, memorialized in the U.S.-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s[33] ('Joint Declaration') issued November 10. The Joint Declaration reaffirms the two countries' commitment to work together to keep the Paris Agreement's 1.5 target 'within reach.' This announcement was particularly surprising because the United States and China have repeatedly clashed on issues ranging from national security and economic policy, to the COVID-19 pandemic and human rights concerns, to Taiwan and tariffs. The Joint Declaration at COP26  and a subsequent virtual meeting[34] between the two countries' presidents on November 15 may indicate that a longer term partnership is possible. However, during their public statements[35] prior to that meeting, both President Biden and President Xi alluded to complaints each side has raised in recent years, indicating that areas of 'competition' and 'conflict' between the United States and China to reference the terms often used by the Biden-Harris administration may complicate any cooperation on climate. Further, China insisted on watering down language on the elimination of coal in the Glasgow Climate Pact, indicating that there may be significant limits to China's willingness to commit to certain key climate goals. China's involvement is critical for any successful efforts to address climate concerns, and yet President Biden faces significant pressure to remain 'strong' on areas of competition and conflict with China. Any discussions or negotiations between the United States and China will undoubtedly require the two sides to balance these concerns, as we previously discussed here[36]. This is a topic to watch, as it reflects a potentially significant barrier to one of President Biden's key policy initiatives. Conclusion and Next Steps Now for the hard part: turning government and private sector commitments into concrete actions that are transparent, verifiable and measurable. And this year more than ever, attention was paid to the risk attendant to a failure to parlay commitments into action. COP26 elevated allegations of 'greenwashing' to the global stage. So much so that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres citing a 'deficit of credibility' and 'surplus of confusion' over private sector climate commitments announced[37] he will establish a 'Group of Experts to propose clear standards to measure and analyze net-zero commitments from non-state actors,' with recommendations expected next year.3[38] Expect regulators and the public to scrutinize post- COP26 climate commitments to an even greater degree. 1[39] See generally COP26 Presidency Compilation of 2021-2025 Climate Finance Commitments (2021), HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Table-of-climate-finance-commitments-November-2021.pdf https://ukcop26.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Table-of-climate-finance-commitments-November-2021.pdf . 2[40] COP26 also delivered a decision on the work program for nonmarket approaches under Article 6.8[41]. 3[42] COP26 : Promises 'ring hollow' when fossil fuels still receive trillions in subsidies; UN chief calls on negotiators to pick up the pace, UN News (Nov. 11, 2021), HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1105562 https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1105562 .

The announcement comes as world leaders gathered at COP26 , the annual climate change conference being staged this year in Glasgow, Scotland. ""We are also pushing past the Paris Agreement objectives to help address this truly global challenge,"" said IDB's president, Mauricio Claver-Carone . ""We know that if we prioritize smart investments today, the cornerstone of our global fight against climate change can mutually reinforce our pandemic recovery efforts and we can speed up our responses."" ""Aligning our work to Paris Agreement objectives furthers our commitment to limit the temperature rise to well below 2\'b0 Celsius and build climate resilience,"" he added. ""But this alone is not enough."" IDB also took the COP26 opportunity to announce another ambitious climate target - to provide $24 billion for climate and green finance over the next four years. ""We are pushing the envelope on our financing, improving our internal structure to prioritize climate action, and increasing our engagements and external partnerships,"" said Claver-Carone. ""Our role, as the region's leading development bank, is to help our 26 borrowing member countries mitigate and adapt to climate risks.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA97","Northwestern Delegates Saw Hope and Concern at COP26","December 2, 2021 Thursday 7:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- Northwestern University issued the following news release: Delegates from Northwestern University who attended the COP26 summit were inspired by the turnout but also alarmed that some groups, especially Indigenous and small island nations, were not as successful in shaping the final commitments in Glasgow last month. A cause for concern Reynaldo Morales, a faculty fellow at Northwestern Buffett who was there to assess Indigenous participation, said he is concerned with the ascendance of a narrative that makes climate action look more like ""an economic investment opportunity"" rather than one based on rights. He also fears an increasing role for NGOs and other intermediaries may blur the voices of people who have the most to lose to a changing climate. ""Many non-recognized Indigenous peoples who experience biodiversity loss due to climate change will probably not be assisted directly if not intermediated by NGOs or if they do not offer any opportunities for investors,"" Morales said. Morales is also worried that he didn't see Indigenous knowledge represented on expert panels at COP26 ""Science and its relationship with industry cannot be a neutral factor when development, infrastructure, extractive, manufacturing and transporting industries present threats to Indigenous peoples territorial, political, nature-based and human rights,"" he said. Diana Elhard, a doctoral candidate researching climate finance, said that COVID-19 widened the already large disparity in access to climate negotiations. ""Many small states, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS), were under- or unrepresented at this COP because people feared bringing COVID back to their communities when the conference was over,"" Elhard said. ""On the last day the calls from SIDS went unheeded and the commitments at Glasgow were not enough to guarantee a world limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, which is already a target that makes life for these states and communities difficult,"" she said. A reason for hope Elhard said that a source of hope was seeing how many different actors were at COP26 . ""The work of Indigenous peoples, youth activists, environmental NGOs, and other non-state actors are all additional pieces of the puzzle that can both influence the UNFCCC proceedings and continue working outside of formal COP spaces,"" Elhard said. ""Actors at many different levels are engaged in influencing the COP process, but I also know that their energy will be aimed at change beyond COP26 ."" Contrary to previous summits, ""this time the rights-based approach does have a wider recognition, and there is language approved that reflect a new era in the consideration of Indigenous Peoples' rights specifically,"" Morales said. Morales is also encouraged by the growing support for an end to deforestation. ""This is an important advance particularly for Amazonian Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous peoples living within protected areas,"" Morales said. He added that now the challenge would be to direct financial assistance to protectors of Indigenous forests. The platform of Indigenous peoples was also well-represented, Morales said, with representatives from around the world with the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP). ""We had the Facilitative Working Group (FWG) with the attendance of Indigenous leaders and members from all around the world. On top of that, we had the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC) with a pavilion that offered a meeting place and a dedicated space for presentations and conference press,"" he said.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA98","Alaska Voices: What COP26 means for Alaska","December 14, 2021","Peninsula Clarion (Kenai, Alaska)","By John Seymour and Charles Thorpe With every class in the subject on the environment, we have become more aware of climate change and its multifaceted impacts. For our generation, as well as younger generations, climate change is a major force in both our present and future. However, it falls upon the entire living population to tackle this issue. Disappointingly, as proven by the recent proceedings at the United Nations Conference of Parties 26 in Glasgow, world leaders have again fallen short of doing so. COP26 was meant to mark a paradigm shift for climate change governance, given that the 2015 Paris Agreement pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were neither ambitious enough nor being met. Indeed, COP26 is the first U.N. climate agreement to specifically mention fossil fuels and calls on countries to strengthen their climate initiatives by the end of 2022 with more aggressive emissions reductions. Yet, the resulting Glasgow Climate Pact, in contrast to the Paris Agreement, is not legally binding. The Pact also shows how ambition for net-zero emissions gets watered down, such as when the draft provision to ""phase out"" coal was opposed by India and China and ultimately diluted to the more nebulous ""phase down."" Policymakers' failures to reach meaningful climate action agreements have set a poor precedent for our and future generations. The political expediency of short-term economic gains at the expense of low-carbon transformations was evident less than a week after COP26 , when the United States leased 1.7 million acres for the purpose of offshore oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. This is predicted to lead to emissions with the annual equivalent of 130 coal-fired power plants, according to the Center of Biological Diversity. Industrial nations' reliance on fossil fuels threatens environmental sustainability and human well-being. For example, the air quality in Delhi, India, now regularly reaches a level 10 times higher than the safe level according to the National Air Quality Index, due to vehicle emissions, coal-fired power plants, and crop burning. Such harmful environmental change is quick to develop and does not wait for our environmental governance ambitions to check humanity's reckless growth. Yet policymakers continue to fall short when attempting to properly address such problems. The inadequacies of the international COP26 meeting highlight the role that local and regional entities can play in filling gaps in climate change policy. As fossil fuels continue to be phased down, we believe that Alaska, as a fossil fuel exporting state, must look at ways to adapt to the changing world economy with the prospect of becoming a leader in renewable energy innovation, design and production. For example, Alaska has the means to develop hydrogen fuel resources, which may be important during our transition towards a net-zero carbon future in which renewable energy resources such as hydropower and tidal power, play larger roles in producing electricity in our state. In addition, we need to continue to expand geothermal, wind and solar options and to consider ecological mitigation tools such as terrestrial (by way of trees) and aquatic (by way of seaweed/kelp) carbon sequestration. Alaska's sustainability success in the face of climate change is dependent on whether we grasp the urgency of the situation, adapt and become more resilient while supporting environmental and socioeconomic sustainability.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA101","AFRICA PAVILION: THE MUST-VISIT VENUE @COP26","November 4, 2021 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA): This year's ""Africa Pavilion"" at the COP26 in Glasgow, is the go-to venue in the annual UN climate negotiations summit. Tastefully designed and projecting an ambience of an emboldened continent proactively tackling the climate crisis, the African Pavilion at COP26 is serving as a platform advancing the interests of the continent. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the ""Africa Pavilion"" and the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC) has joined in sprucing up the settings including attractiveness of the pavilion, displaying Africa's green and blue mega-biodiversity straddling from the alpine montane peaks to the rich corals oceans. This year, the theme of Africa's participation at COP26 through AUC, ECA, AfDB and AUDA-NEPAD is ""Revitalizing the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the Convention at COP26 : Enabling a just transition, climate justice and a green recovery towards a resilient Africa"". ""The design of this year's Africa Pavilion aims to demonstrate to the world that the continent has ambitious plans around how to leverage finance to address the continent's adaptation, green recovery, resilience mitigation measures."" Ms. Vera Songwe, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) says. Alongside the 10th anniversary, the year 2021 is also significant as it serves as the initial year for the UN ""Decade of Action"" headlining intensive interventions on adaptation, mitigation and uptake of climate smart pathways for sustainable development. These are among the objectives that the Africa Pavilion will be advancing at the COP26 in Glasgow. Scaling up international partnerships for Africa's transition on the clean development drive, combating climate change by investing in Africa's natural carbon sinks, augmenting the benefits of green and blue economy through supplementing resilience and promotion of nature-based solutions are among the key highlights that will feature at the elaborate programme for the Africa Pavilion. Other topical issues include opportunities and challenges for the emerging carbon markets, alongside investments, launch of the baseline study for the African Financial Alliance on Climate Change, financing African nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the continent's energy transitions. Complete with conference rooms, mini-theatres, caucusing spaces, lobbying quarters, high-level summitry suites and pictorial galleries, the Africa Pavilion is envisioned as a strategic venue to advance, bolster and defend Africa's interests at COP26 magnifying the continent's short and long term climate action priorities. In February 2011, during the 16th Ordinary Session of the African Union's Heads of State and Government's Assembly, the idea of the Africa Pavilion during the UN climate summit was mooted, discussed and concept approved. African regional organisations notably the African Union Commission (AUC), African Development Bank (AfDB), UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD) and partners were tasked to implement the concept. Exactly nine months after the highest decision making organ of the AU had endorsed the idea, the first Africa Pavilion was erected at the COP17 in Durban, South Africa. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA108","The COP26 climate talks saw progress on nature","China Dialogue","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 10, 2022( China Dialogue: HYPERLINK https://chinadialogue.net https://chinadialogue.net Nature was given prominence at the UN COP26 climate talks in Glasgow. It was the focus of the first major announcement at the world leaders' summit which opened the talks, when more than 130 countries committed[1] to 'halt and reverse' deforestation by 2030. If made good, that pledge would simultaneously cut carbon emissions, increase carbon absorption, help lower temperatures and protect wildlife. Moreover, the UK presidency had scheduled one whole day of the COP around the theme of nature to try and raise the profile of 'nature-based solutions'. Nbs are £ctions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits', according to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). Recommended NbS actions have the potential to provide up to 37% of the cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed to give the world a 66% chance of keeping global warming within 2C, according to research[2] by an international group of scientists. Such actions should also help protect biodiversity in line with the post-2020 targets set through the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which will be finalised at the second session of the COP15 biodiversity talks in Kunming this spring. The final agreement of COP26 , known as the Glasgow Climate Pact[3], recognised the importance of 'protecting, conserving and restoring nature and ecosystems including through forests and other terrestrial and marine ecosystems acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases.' Participants in the UN climate negotiation process now have a broader understanding, which goes beyond forests, of how nature can help tackle carbon emissions and climate impacts, according to Xiaoting Hou-Jones, senior researcher in biodiversity and natural resources at the IIED (International Institute for Environment and Development). 'The Glasgow Pact focuses on recognising different ecosystems, which is really encouraging to see - it's not just about forests. That also gives us a stepping stone towards looking more at nature-based solutions for adaptation at the next COP as well, which is great because I think that has always been lacking,' she says. Recommended The term 'nature-based solutions' was absent from the final text, having been removed in an earlier draft version. This illustrated that political support was not yet unanimous, often due to concerns driven by some projects that described themselves as NbS turning out to be poor quality, says Will Baldwin-Cantello, director of NbS at WWF UK. The same concerns may limit explicit support for NbS at COP15 unless there is sufficient emphasis on the involvement and support of local communities and indigenous peoples, and that a wide range of funding options are appropriate, not just the carbon market, he adds. NbS projects are being brought forward through the carbon emission reduction plans of individual countries, known in UN climate negotiations as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Of NDCs submitted by 12 October 2021, 105 out of 114 countries had included NbS, according to an analysis[4] by WWF. The majority of NbS policies in those NDCs - 96 - related to cutting emissions and improving the ability of ecosystems to draw carbon from the atmosphere, while 91 contained plans to use nature to improve resilience to climate change risks. Some 85 countries had increased policies for NbS in their NDCs compared with earlier versions, though 19 had reduced them. There was also a rise in the number of NDCs that mention wetlands, mangroves and marine ecosystems. Recommended However, there is a long way to go in terms of actual projects on the ground, says Andrew Deutz, director of global policy, institutions and conservation finance at TheNature Conservancy. 'What we tend to see is pilot projects, exemplifying NbS or ecosystem-based climate adaptation, but not very many examples of where countries have a systematic strategy and plan,' he says. This is beginning to change, he believes. For example, the US Army Corps of Engineers - one of the world's largest water sector infrastructure developers - has started to use NbS alongside traditional hard engineering techniques. And last year, it produced guidelines[5] on NbS for managing flood risk. 'The practice is evolving now, and we're starting to see big infrastructure developers figure out how to do hybrid and natural infrastructure solutions as a mainstream way of doing business, rather than NGOs doing a bunch of small projects,' he says. In Uganda, the government is working to restore wetlands[6] with US$24 million from the Green Climate Fund, the body established by the UN climate negotiation process to mobilise and distribute climate change finance. The wetlands regulate flooding, remove pollutants from surface runoff and recharge groundwater. But Uganda has lost around 30% of these ecosystems due to degradation and encroachment in the last 15 years. It is now helping people living in wetland areas to find alternative sources of employment so they can move away from the wetlands to enable them to regenerate. Another project receiving money from the Green Climate Fund supports the restoration of urban wetlands and stream ecosystems in Laos to regulate water flow and reduce flood risk. The project is expected to benefit 10% of the country's population, who will see reduced flood risk and improved green spaces, decreased temperatures and more tourism opportunities, according to UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme). Recommended Despite these positive examples, the successful implementation of NbS faces several challenges. One of the greatest is finance. Currently, around $133 billion is invested in nature each year, according to a report[7] by UNEP, leaving a funding gap estimated at $500-970 billion a year[8]. Negotiators at COP26 made some progress on finance. Twelve countries, including the UK, US and Japan, put forward $12 billion[9] over five years to support developing countries to tackle deforestation. This will include actions such as supporting smallholder farmers to restore degraded land, strengthening land tenure systems and mobilising private sector investment. Meanwhile, the Bezos Earth Fund pledged $2 billion[10] to restore forest landscapes in Africa and the US. Canada announced CAD$1 billion in international support for nature-based solutions, a fifth of its climate finance. They also pledged to support governments to develop policies and investments that improve the way nature is used to benefit people, climate and wildlife, including through climate adaptation and mitigation plans, and national biodiversity strategies. 'The world's businesses and governments appear to be waking up to nature as the most fundamental form of capital,' says Baldwin-Cantello. He is encouraged by the scale of the commitments. 'It shows a growing share of climate finance going towards NbS, the long-called-for reflection of their larger share in mitigation potential. It also shows a greater role for private donations and the promise of a more coordinated package of initiatives going forward,' he says. Recommended Deutz notes that between the UN General Assembly last September, the first session of the COP15 biodiversity talks[12] in October and the COP26 climate talks in November, around $7-8 billion a year in new foreign aid commitments were made for biodiversity and NbS. 'That's almost a doubling of the foreign aid float for biodiversity, so it's significant.' However, finance for NbS is much smaller than climate finance and relies more heavily on public finance, UNEP's report noted. Private sector finance accounted for 56% of climate finance in 2020, but only 14% of NbS finance. Overall, finance for NbS needs to at least triple in real terms and increase four-fold by 2050 if the world is to meet its climate change, biodiversity and land degradation targets, UNEP said. Scaling up private finance for NbS is 'one of the central challenges of the next few years,' it concluded. COP26 has set a new tone of high ambition on addressing nature loss and climate change simultaneously. We must see that at least maintained in the biodiversity COP in Kunming.Baldwin-Cantello, director of NbS at WWF UK This year will see nature take centre stage once again at the final session of COP15 in China. Although the timing of this faces more uncertainty due to the Omicron variant of Covid-19, which has already delayed technical talks[13] scheduled for January, they represent another opportunity to ramp up action on nature. So far, negotiations on climate and nature have been somewhat siloed at the UN level, undertaken by separate government negotiating teams. However, observers believe there is work going on behind the scenes to link the two agendas. According to Hou-Jones, though discussions are not necessarily integrated through the presidencies of COP26 and COP15, there have been informal talks, for example, at side events during the first session of COP15 in October. The Chinese government hosted parallel events to look at the linkages between climate change and the protection of nature, attended by representatives from the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, academia and think tanks. Speaking at one of these events, China's special envoy for climate change affairs, Xie Zhenhua, said[14]: 'At present, the global biodiversity protection and response to climate change are showing a trend of strengthening coordination and mutual promotion.' This demonstrated the barriers that had typically existed between climate and biodiversity within the Chinese government had begun to break down, Hou-Jones believes. Baldwin-Cantello says: ' COP26 has set a new tone of high ambition on addressing nature loss and climate change simultaneously. We must see that at least maintained in the biodiversity COP in Kunming.'

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA109","WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON AT COP26","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation: Over the next two weeks, world leaders are meeting in Glasgow, Scotland for the 26th annual UN Climate Conference ( COP26 ). Against a backdrop of intensifying climate impacts such as stronger and increasingly-common hurricanes and wildfires, rising sea levels, and melting glaciers COP26 is a make-or-break moment for climate action after the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change described the climate situation as an urgent code red for humanity. And yet, there is still hope. And an intensifying need to work collectively to stabilize our climate for a more equitable, sustainable future. The moment is now for governments to come together to commit to and act on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and for philanthropy to play a catalyzing role to spur action. As COP26 A Major Pledge to Reduce Methane Emissions COP26 , while also improving public health and food production. On November 2, President Biden announced that more than 100 countries have signed onto the Global Methane Pledge, which includes a commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 and limit warming to 0.2 a by 2050. Rapid methane reductions now will bring many significant social and health benefits, including reduced asthma-related deaths and other negative outcomes that are associated with the harmful effects of climate change. These positive outcomes are especially important to minority and low-income communities, which are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. To ensure a just and equitable energy transition, more than 20 philanthropic organizations from across the globe including the Packard Foundation have committed $328 million to support countries' abilities to meet the pledge. Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities Rights-Based Climate Action Indigenous Peoples and local communities are proven forest guardians, p rotecting the diverse tropical forests that are vital to safeguarding the planet from climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemic risk. Half of the world's land is community land governed by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and by some estimates, 80 percent of the world's biodiversity is found on these lands. The need is urgent to advance tenure rights for Indigenous Peoples and local communities and scale up protections for these precious ecosystems. During the World Leaders Summit at COP26 , a joint set of commitments was announced to advance support for Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' tenure rights and their forest guardianship. The Packard Foundation joined with governmental and philanthropic funding partners to commit a collective $1.7 billion of financing from 2021-2025 to support the advancement of these rights. A coalition of Indigenous and local communities, the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities, is actively engaging at COP26 . If you'd like to stay up to date on the latest actions at the Summit, their Twitter account is a great one to follow. Ocean-Climate Action In a recent column in The Chronicle of Philanthropy, Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and vice chair of the Packard Foundation Board of Trustees , highlighted that COP26 , ""is an opportunity both to recognize the role the ocean must play in mitigating climate change and to direct significant philanthropic funding to this endeavor."" The most durable, effective, and equitable conservation outcomes that can help meet the climate challenge arise from actions led by Indigenous Peoples and local communities. As an example, she points to the Packard Foundation's support for ""the Northern Chumash Tribal Council's leadership role in the nomination of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along California's central coast"" and ICCA's Global Community Fisheries Initiative. There are growing calls for the ocean to be integrated into this year's COP26 climate negotiations, as it has greatly slowed the rate of climate change. According to the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, the ocean has the potential to reduce emissions equivalent to pollution from all coal-fired power plants world-wide. The COP26 Virtual Ocean Pavilion offers an opportunity for people from around the world to join live events, engage with experts, and learn more about ocean-climate action. A Spotlight on Grassroots Actors Although climate change impacts all of us, Indigenous Peoples and local communities are among the first and most severely affected. At the same time, they are leading the way in creating solutions using traditional knowledge and novel approaches. Efforts to confront climate change are incomplete without their inclusion. ""If Not Us Then Who?"" is an organization that highlights the role Indigenous Peoples and local communities play in protecting our planet. As part of Our Village COP26 , ""If Not Us Then Who?"" is running a series of virtual and in-person events that will explore questions at the intersection of climate change, Indigenous Peoples, and the effects of the global crisis. For another perspective on COP26 , check out climate activist Katherine Egland who is in Glasgow sharing her observations and opinions on Twitter. Katherine is a co-founder of EEECHO, a coalition based in Gulfport, Mississippi, working to safeguard frontline communities from public health and climate impacts of the wood pellet industry. Climate and Forest Finance Resources COP26 also aims to mobilize the financial support necessary to accelerate large-scale climate action this decade to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5a . To help meet this goal, the Climate and Land Use Alliance launched Climate and Forests 2030, a set of resources for funders aimed at mobilizing finance at scale to realize the power of forests to address climate change, benefit people, and protect nature. To help achieve the goal of stopping deforestation by 2030, the Packard Foundation is also providing additional funding to the Climate and Land Use Alliance for Amazon Forest conservation, ensuring the integrity of Carbon Markets and supporting Indigenous Peoples and local communities' territorial rights. All Hands on Deck The climate crisis is at an ""all hands on deck"" moment the world needs to respond to this ""code red"" decisively and collectively by catalyzing climate action for a more equitable, sustainable future . These organizations, and countless others working tirelessly to save our climate, give us hope that our global community can meet the urgency of this moment. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA110","Shoosmiths: Green for Go - COP26 Summit Round Up","November 20, 2021 Saturday 9:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Shoosmiths, a law firm, issued the following news release: This last fortnight has seen the eyes of the world fall on Glasgow as it hosted the much-anticipated global COP26 summit. Now the summit has drawn to a close, this article brings you up to speed with why it took place, the pledges that have been set, and share some of the resources Shoosmiths has created as all efforts turn to limit global warming and the impact of climate change. COP26 'Conference of the Parties number 26' was the 26th time signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty have met. The UK hosted COP26 between 1 and 12 November at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow. The two-week summit was seen as a critical moment for commitments and action, with a record number of delegates and world leaders meeting to set the global agenda on slowing climate changing and reaching a consensus on actions to keep global warming to 1.5 C. Decisions that were made: Science and urgency Previous summits have been criticised for either not taking enough action on climate change, taking action too slowly, or failing to initiate substantial enough investments into sustainable solutions. In response, the Glasgow Climate Pact captures and voices country's wishes to fully embed science and sustainable decisions into all decision-making processes. The UN is now also directed to assess climate plans every year, turning every COP into a vital moment for nations to make further commitments. Adaptation finance 'Adaptation' is used to describe funding to help poorer countries become more resilient against extreme weather caused by climate change. Investments may include new sea defences, more resilient power grids, or smarter early warning systems for wilder weather. A notable outcome of COP26 , as recorded in the Pact, is the call for ""developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country parties from 2019 levels by 2025."" Financial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back 'clean technology', such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is seen as an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. Mitigation The outcome includes a series of actions that all parties are expected to take to accelerate their efforts following the summit, these include:  A stronger commitment to limit global temperature rises to 1.5oC, and greater acknowledgement of the latest science which reflects the urgent need to take action during this critical decade  The 'phase-down of unabated coal power' and 'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies', as well as 'mid-century net zero'  Leaders from more than 100 countries, with about 85% of the world's forests, promising to stop deforestation by 2030 Finance, technology transfer and capacity-building for mitigation and adaptation Parties agreed to continue discussions on long-term finance through to 2027 and have asked the Standing Committee on Finance to prepare a report on progress towards achieving the $100bn goal. Representatives have also agreed to begin the process of setting a new collective post-2025 goal, citing that this process would be 'open, inclusive and transparent', seeking a broad range of views and inputs from across the globe. Loss and damage Loss and damage, discussed between the parties, refers to the impacts of climate change which occur beyond the limits of societies' and ecosystems' ability to adapt. It endorsed the need for a substantial amount of extra money to be provided to tackle loss and damage through existing sources. It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the greenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C. Current targets, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4 C. Implementation COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. COP26 finalised the Paris 'rulebook', resolving the outstanding political decisions needed for parties to begin implementing the agreement. Parties also agreed a number of important practical and institutional arrangements, such as on Response Measures (responding to the impacts of climate policies) and the Consultative Group of Experts (to help fulfil reporting requirements). Collaboration COP26 voiced aims to be both open and inclusive, with a greater variety of voices heard from across all corners of the world. This included responding to calls for further youth inclusion and those from low income countries. Plans have been drawn up on advancing climate education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and international cooperation as part of a new flexible framework. The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. Common time frames COP26 , a recommended plan has been put in place to allow a common time frame for commitments set forward by parties in 2025 to show what 2035 climate commitments add up to. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed, with only a few countries making their targets and pledges legally binding. Enhanced transparency framework By finalising the Enhanced Transparency Framework, an agreement was reached on how to track and communicate progress in tackling climate change as nations look to implement the Paris Agreement. This includes a series of common reporting tables that will track parties' emissions, support, and progress towards their nationally determined contributions - with nations agreeing to submit climate plans to a common five-year timeframe. So, what does this mean? Right now, the world is 1.2 C warmer than it was at the end of the 19th century. With the government drive towards carbon net zero, and a vested interest from stakeholders across the board - investors, customers, employees, suppliers and communities - it is crucial for businesses to establish, or revisit, their sustainability strategies to ensure tangible outcomes. Shoosmiths is committed to a net zero emissions future, with a target for its operations to achieve net zero emissions by 2025 and a commitment made and recently approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set science-based emissions reduction targets across the entire value chain that are consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels - further detail of which can be found here.

It is but one of many of the events planned globally during the UN climate conference.Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the Scottish city of Glasgow Saturday to demand urgent action for the climate on the sidelines of the UN-organized COP26 climate summit. Despite rainy and windy conditions, organizers and police said they expected up to 50,000 people to attend. Extinction Rebellion is among the groups expected. Delegations from nearly 200 countries hammering out a deal to curb carbon emissions. ""Many thousands of us are marching right across the world today to demand immediate and serious action,"" Scottish activist Mikaela Loach told the AFP news agency. A day of global action In Australia, Saturday's global protests for the climate kicked off in Sydney and Melbourne. Some demonstrators wore coal costumes or Prime Minister Scott Morrison masks. Protesters called Morrison, a staunch advocate for the mining industry, ""an absolute embarrassment"" and said the COP26 talks were ""a sham."" In Seoul, around 500 protesters hit the streets. Among the groups organizing the action, Climate Strike said, ""At COP26 , the expected 'blah, blah, blah' is taking place,"" echoing the criticisms of young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. COP26 enters lightning negotiations next week COP26 is taking place under tight security. Delegates to the UN conference are in the process of hammering out a deal to try and meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping temperature rises globally to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A significant study recently revealed global CO2 emissions will return to pre-pandemic levels this year. The representatives from nearly 200 countries are at about the mid-way point in negotiations. Some countries have pledged to reduce greenhouse gases while deals are also being worked out on reducing the use of coal and methane gases in the atmosphere as well as halting funding for the fossil fuels industry. On Saturday, negotiations will continue before a break Sunday. Next week will be fraught with shuttle diplomacy as ministers arrive in Glasgow to seal the deal. Country delegations have yet to elucidate how Paris climate pledges will work in practice. Rules for carbon credits, common reporting schedules and transparency initiatives still need to be worked out. The UN said that when countries arrived at COP26 with their national action plans, the result of the plans combined would have meant the earth heated up by 2.7 C in the 21st century. So far, the earth has seen 1.1 C of warming, which has already brought about extreme weather patterns from fire to drought and resulted in displaced persons and economic refugees. COP26 a failure? Activists have so far been underwhelmed by the discussions at COP26 . Thunberg, the most famous climate activist, called the conference ""a failure"" at a youth march in Glasgow on Friday. However, Michael Mann, the director of Penn State's Earth System Science Center, cautioned critics on Twitter against ""declaring it dead on arrival,"" which he said caused ""fossil fuel executives to jump for joy."" ar/nm (AFP, AP) The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the ""Newstex Authoritative Content"") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA112","""ALL HANDS ON DECK"" - COP26 DEBRIEFING AND DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHT NEED FOR CONCRETE ACTION TO ACHIEVE CLIMATE GOALS","December 9, 2021 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by UN Information Service: When the UN COP26 global climate summit ended in Glasgow on 13 November, Secretary-General Antnio Guterres was already looking ahead, telling the world to keep pushing forward and never give up. ""COP27 starts now,"" he said. United Nations Information Service (UNIS) Vienna Director Martin Nesirky echoed those sentiments when opening a virtual debriefing and discussion event "" COP26 : Keep pushing forward what comes next?"". Organized by UNIS Vienna and the Austrian NGO ""International Association for the Advancement of Innovative Approaches to Global Challenges (IAAI)"", the event focused on sharing experiences from Glasgow, how civil society engagement can contribute to keeping the 1.5-degree goal within the realm of possibility and what can be done beyond COP26 . The aim was to identify concrete actions that could help in the run-up to COP27 7-18 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. There was a panel of six speakers - Michael Spiekermann, Austrian Youth Delegate to COP26 ; Lisa Plattner, Climate Expert at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Austria; Martin Krenn, Spokesperson for the Austrian Alliance for Climate Justice; Miroslav Polzer of the International Association for the Advancement of Innovative Approaches to Global Challenges (IAAI) and The Rev. Dorothee Hahn, Vicar, Old Catholic Christuskapelle, Vienna and Representative of the Coalition of Faith-Based Organizations, as well as Angela Reithuber, Programme Manager of the Programme ""Elevating Agricultural Adaptation"" at the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens. Nesirky and Polzer opened the conference, followed by the speakers' reflections on COP26 and a lively discussion among participants, who included representatives of Permanent Missions to the UN (Vienna), civil society and experts from UN entities based in Vienna. Panellists agreed that the outcome of COP26 was rather limited, with some positive points. Nevertheless, they also stressed the need to focus on the work to strengthen climate action. Spiekermann highlighted that small steps towards a responsive climate action agreement would not be sufficient considering the climate emergency and called for a shift in society to have everyone involved in taking responsibility for climate action. He asked participants to ""raise [their] voice in the public"" by demanding concrete action. Plattner called for putting ""all hands on deck"" by fully operationalizing the Santiago Network, and explained the importance of mobilizing climate finance for the loss and damage caused by the climate emergency. She also stressed the urgent need to support those most vulnerable and affected by climate change. Krenn pointed out that every country needs to ""reach zero emissions as fast as possible"" and should produce stronger emission reduction targets. He also stated that ""it is on us to support but also to pressure our governments for them to live up to those expectations, and to pave the way for a prosperous world below 1.5 [degrees] of global warming"". Polzer underlined that civil society representatives should be included in a more substantial manner in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. He also presented the United Citizens Organization launched at COP26 which aims to advance and promote the role of civil society in climate action through digital innovation. Reverend Hahn expressed her concern about the urgency of the situation and called on the audience to educate themselves and to start engaging with climate action by changing one's own behaviour to protect the environment. She also illustrated that food waste is an issue which contributes to climate change that is often overlooked. Reithuber agreed with the other participants that the outcome of COP26 was ""modest"" and that the conference did not deliver the results that had been expected. She stressed that ""we urgently have to connect the dots between the wisdom of farmers, the knowledge of science, the responsibility of leaders, and the influential power of civil society"". Nesirky emphasized that achieving the climate goals ""can o.nly really be done in partnership"". He furthermore underlined that ""civil society is playing a crucial role"" in climate action by ""offering concrete ideas and proposals that can then feed into the process leading up to each COP and in implementing the Paris Agreement"". \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA115","Agreement Reached on International Carbon Credit Trading Rules at COP26","CLS Blue Sky Blog","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 20, 2021( CLS Blue Sky Blog: HYPERLINK http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly referred to as ' COP26 ', was held in Glasgow, Scotland last month. Among other agreements coming out of COP26 , government ministers representing nearly 200 countries reached a consensus regarding rules implementing Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which provides a framework for the creation of voluntary international carbon credit trading markets. This agreement follows six years of negotiations over the specific characteristics of such markets, and parties to the agreement have expressed the hope that this framework will lead to the establishment and growth of an international carbon credit trading market. ARTICLE 6 OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT The Paris Agreement, sometimes referred to as the Paris Accords or the Paris Climate Accords, is an international treaty on climate change mitigation.1 The Paris Agreement was negotiated and adopted by 196 countries at the United Nations' ('UN') COP21 meeting in Paris, France on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016.2 Its primary aim is to keep the rise in mean global temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels, in an effort to significantly reduce the effects of climate change.3 The Paris Agreement proposed a number of avenues through which countries can reduce their emissions, including Article 6, which sets forth a framework for the creation of a voluntary international carbon credit trading market. Article 6.4 contemplates a 'mechanism' supervised by a body designated by the parties to the Paris Agreement, which is intended to (i) 'promote the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions'; (ii) 'incentivize and facilitate [] the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by public and private entities'; (iii)'contribute to the reduction of emission levels' by each party to the agreement, including by means of mitigation activities by one party that can also be used by another party to fulfill its nationally determined contribution ('NDC', which corresponds to a country's emissions reduction commitment under the Paris Agreement); and (iv)'deliver an overall mitigation in global emissions.'4 This mechanism is intended to further the goal, articulated in Article 6.2, that countries will voluntarily engage in 'cooperative approaches' that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes ('ITMOs', emissions credits that can be traded globally) towards their NDCs.5 However, Article 6.2 also provides that, in so doing, countries must £pply robust accounting to ensure . . . the avoidance of double counting', such that an individual credit is not counted towards two countries' NDCs.6 Although Article 6 lays the foundation for the creation of a global carbon credit market, it left key implementation details to be determined at a later date. Following the Paris Agreement, disagreements over certain fundamental questions, including concerns regarding potential double counting of carbon credits and the ability to trade older carbon credits from a now-defunct trading system, had stalled progress toward definitive rules implementing Article 6.7 However, a compromise with respect to these and other issues was finally reached at COP26 . COP26 AGREEMENT On November 13, 2021, negotiators from almost 200 countries agreed on final rules implementing Article 6 as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact, ending six years of negotiations over this protocol.8 Broadly speaking, the rules implementing Article 6 provide for the creation of a UN-certified carbon credit that can be used and traded globally, thereby allowing for the standardization of carbon credits internationally.9 In so doing, the rules implementing Article 6 enable countries to use carbon credit trading mechanisms to help achieve their NDCs. They also allow for the development of a global market based on credits that satisfy uniform standards. The agreement reached at COP26 on the rules implementing Article 6 also resolves certain fundamental questions that had been stalling such an agreement since the Paris Agreement in 2015. With respect to the concern regarding double counting, the rules implementing Article 6 provide that the parties to the agreement will cooperate on the use of carbon credits, including with respect to governance and accounting. Specifically, the rules call for the application of 'corresponding adjustments' to ensure that a single credit cannot be counted towards two countries' NDCs.10 In a similar vein, with respect to the debate regarding the usage of older carbon credits, negotiators agreed to limit the use of legacy emissions credits from the UN's Clean Development Mechanism ('CDM'), initially created in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.11 Specifically, the rules implementing Article 6 state that only CDM credits registered after January 1, 2013 may be used towards the achievement of a country's NDC.12 Though the rules implementing Article 6 lay the foundation for a global emissions trading platform, even these rules will require additional interpretation for such a marketplace to come to fruition. Therefore, the rules implementing Article 6 also establish a body that will supervise the creation and maintenance of an international carbon trading marketplace (the 'Supervisory Body').13 The mandate of the Supervisory Body will be, among other things, to develop the methodologies, registration, monitoring and other processes needed for the establishment and healthy functioning of the international carbon credit trading market for use by public and private entities.14 The rules invite the nomination of members and alternate members, and request that the Supervisory Body hold at least two meetings during the calendar year 2022 to begin its work.15 IMPLICATIONS The lack of agreement on the implementation of Article 6 had stalled efforts to operationalize the carbon emissions reductions required by the Paris Agreement and to develop a functional international emissions credit trading market. Currently, a patchwork of carbon credit markets exists across the globe, including markets established and regulated by individual governments. These include the European Union's Emissions Trading System and similar markets in China, the northeastern United States and California. In these systems, a regulator sets a certain limit on emissions and issues allowances for those emissions on an annual basis, and those entities that reduce their emissions below the limit set by the regulator can sell the remainder of their allowance to other businesses that are short of allowances.16 There are also voluntary carbon markets, whereby entities can buy and sell carbon offset credits at their discretion (e.g., to fulfill a voluntary commitment to reduce emissions). However, the standards set by these mandatory and voluntary markets vary significantly, which has raised numerous concerns, including with respect to the quality and validity of offsets and the associated credits.17 The rules implementing Article 6 provide a framework for a potential global trading market operating under uniform standards. Notably, however, the rules implementing Article 6 do not contain an enforcement mechanism, and rely instead on the good faith of individual participants to adhere to the framework that they propose.18 Ultimately, while the rules implementing Article 6 lay the groundwork for a global carbon credit trading market, they also raise the fundamental question as to whether governments will follow through on the principles that they set forth.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA116","COP26 disappoints youth from developing countries","The Third Pole","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 17, 2021( The Third Pole: HYPERLINK https://www.thethirdpole.net/en https://www.thethirdpole.net/en It was a tale of contrasts at COP26 [1], the 26th edition of the UN's annual climate conference which wrapped up over the weekend in Glasgow, Scotland. While the youth on the streets staged furious protests and called for urgent action, inside the key negotiations happened behind closed doors, with important actors like the US, China and India doing more to lower ambitions[2] than raise them. Recommended As the conference came to an end, the anger and disappointment among young people - especially those from developing countries - was palpable. A lack of concrete action and the failure of rich countries to deliver on climate finance[3] were key reasons for their despair, at a time when they had managed to reach COP26 after braving many odds. Clear science, clearer failure 'For me, having come to COP26 at a time when the science is clear, the cognitive dissonance is astounding,' said Eric Njuguna, a climate activist from Kenya. He spoke of the drought in his home country, Kenya[4], affecting millions, which the government was forced to declare a national disaster. 'It is just aggravating to see that no commitments are being made.' The world needs to go net zero[5] by 2050 to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees Celsius[6]. Given that the average global temperature is already around 1.2C[7] above the pre-Industrial era, many countries are currently battling a rise in extreme weather events. What is net zero? A net-zero scenario means greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide, CO2) - the main factor in human-induced global warming - should be absorbed in the same quantities as they are being emitted. This may happen through natural means, such asthe absorption of CO2 by trees, or through technological solutions, many of which remain uncertain at scale. 'It is really so sad that we are going to go back to [our] countries very angry,' said Patience Nabukalu, a climate activist from Uganda. Nabakalu said that she was there to demand the billions of dollars[8] rich countries promised to give to developing countries to deal with the climate crisis. In 2009, when COP15 was held in Copenhagen, developed countries promised to extend USD 100 billion a year[9] in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. This has not yet happened, with some developed countries now extending that date to 2023. Maybe more important is the issue of loss and damage[10] due to the rise in extreme weather events. Poor countries, with limited infrastructure, have contributed the least to global carbon emissions, and yet have to bear the additional cost of increased disasters[11]. While the Glasgow Climate Pact finally recognised loss and damage in principle, no plans have as yet been made to deal with the finances required. Eric Njuguna (left), from Kenya, and Patience Nabukalu, from Uganda, said they were angry and disappointed at how COP26 panned out (Image: Disha Shetty)COVID restrictions, travel costs restrict voices The Covid-19 pandemic only added to feelings of inequity. Whereas less than 5% of people in low income countries have received even one dose of a vaccine, rich countries are already giving their populations booster shots and vaccinating their young people. For citizens from developing countries, this has meant reduced access as travel restrictions are in place. Additionally, there is the high cost of a COP taking place in a developed country. 'We have a delegation of 15 young people from Brazil and it was really hard to get here because the Brazilian real is so [weak] compared with [the British] pound,' said Isvilaine da Silva Conceicao, a climate activist from Brazil. Nevertheless, she stressed it was important for them to be there. 'We need to [physically] be in the spaces to pressure our government.' We are the victims, not them [the negotiators]. It's us [who have] to be given microphones, not themPatience Nabukalu, climate activist from Uganda Conceicao added that she has lots of friends from African countries who could not travel because of Covid-19 restrictions. 'It was really bad because they have a lot to say and they need to be heard. [Hosting] the COP in countries that are difficult to come to and so expensive for us from the [global] south it's really hard to have a lot of the voices heard.' Those suffering need a say Aside from the difficulties of getting to COP26 , the young activists from developing countries who spoke with The Third Pole saw the hope raised in the early days of the summit dissipate as declaration did not transform into action. As the impacts of climate change intensify, and several small island nations face the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels, the youth from developing countries said the urgency their situation demanded was not being responded to by the world leaders. There were many young activists attending COP26 as observers. But they wanted to do more than observe, and were keen to be allowed to participate in the actual negotiations. Recommended 'We are the victims, not them [the negotiators]. It's us [who have] to be given microphones, not them. They should go out of the conference rooms and let the most affected people start raising their voices and demand for climate justice,' Nabakalu added. Across the board, activists who spoke with The Third Pole felt that negotiators from developing countries were the saving grace of the summit, who were doing their best to push climate justice. They expressed disappointment that the discussions did not look at radical ways of thinking, while failure of rich countries to step up and take responsibility for their actions was another common issue the young attendees were angry about. 'Not here to defend governments, but people' For Jaciara Beatriz Sousa de Vasconcelos, who is from an indigenous community in Brazil, it was the lack of indigenous voices[12] that was concerning. She also made a distinction between the government stance and that of delegates like her. 'We are not here to defend Brazil but we are here to defend the indigenous people. And we know that forests are better when they are protected.' Isvilaine da Silva Conceicao (left) and Jaciara Beatriz Sousa de Vasconcelos, both from Brazil, said that the high costs of attending a COP in a developed country meant that many indigenous voices were left out (Image: Disha Shetty) 'We need to protect indigenous people because they are the future, they are the past, and they always stand up for the forests,' Vasconcelos added. Many of the young activists questioned why renewables were being pushed as a 'magic wand', given that some of the proposed solutions - like large-scale solar or hydro projects[13] - may displace indigenous people from their land. Greenwashing and lack of conversations on racial justice were other issues the youth felt this COP had failed to address. Recommended There was visible solidarity and cooperation from climate activists from developing and developed countries. Luisa Nuebauer from Germany criticised her government for not being bold enough. She said her country 'doesn't speak to me as if the climate crisis was my problem, and betrays Eric [Njuguna] and everyone else. You're [speaking to Eric] facing the consequences of the inaction of my government today.' What many did express was that while they did not get a seat at the negotiating table, they were able to occupy space at COP26 : by being visible, their issues were heard to some extent. This was a small win at a conference they had struggled to attend, and whose outcomes were far less than they had hoped.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA117","Not Just CO2 and Anti-climax: Tackling Methane Emissions is a Further Challenge for the Petroleum Industry in the Wake of COP26","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Feb 07, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com Energy Intelligence - February 7 2022 [ co-author: Adam Fenby] The Global Methane Pledge (GMP) was one of the few headline commitments announced at COP26 . The response to the GMP indicates that tackling methane emissions is now firmly on the agenda for the petroleum industry. Although non-binding, the GMP puts signatory governments under pressure to take action on methane ahead of COP27 in Egypt and COP28 in the UAE. The interplay between the increasing focus on reducing methane emissions, on one hand, and increasing global demand for natural gas and its role as a transition fuel, on the other, will be interesting to watch as governments look to reconcile climate ambitions with energy security policy and economic reality. But what is certain is that reducing methane emissions will be a key theme for the petroleum industry post GMP. Announced by the EU and US ahead of COP26 , signatories to the GMP pledge to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% (from 2020 levels) by 2030 and agree to more robust reporting standards. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank and the Green Climate Fund have agreed to support the GMP through technical assistance and project finance. At the time of writing, 111 countries have signed the GMP, which together represent over 70% of global GDP. Among these are significant petroleum producers - Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iraq, the UAE, Nigeria, Brazil and Norway have all signed up. Despite the rhetoric at COP26 , the GMP is still ultimately voluntary - its targets are non-binding and there is no enforcement mechanism. A number of major methane emitters have also declined to sign the GMP, including Australia, China, India, Iran and Russia. China has launched its own initiative. In addition to a bilateral agreement with the US at COP26 , 2021 saw the inauguration of the China Oil and Gas Methane Alliance, a body that includes CNPC, Sinopac and CNOOC, amongst others from the Chinese upstream and downstream sectors. This has a broader motive too of increasing Chinese influence in global climate governance. Joining the chorus of climate protestors unhappy with the outcome of COP26 , Russia's climate envoy also went as far as to suggest that western financial sanctions imposed against Gazprom, as well as trade restrictions on the provision of petroleum-related goods and services to certain projects, could hamper Russia's efforts to mitigate its methane emissions. Notably, Russia was responsible for one of the world's largest methane leaks in recent years when a pipeline owned by Gazprom released around 2.7 million cubic meters during emergency repairs in 2019. The Challenge and Opportunities UN Environment Programme figures suggest that the petroleum industry and coal mining contribute around 35% of man-made methane emissions, principally from fugitive emissions, venting, and incomplete flaring. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), most emissions occur in onshore conventional oil and gas activities (where the main source is flaring), followed by downstream gas (where the main source is fugitive emissions from pipelines). The IEA says it may be possible to reduce global methane emissions from petroleum operations by roughly 75%, using pre-existing technology and emissions could be reduced by 40%-50% just by implementing approaches that have no net cost - solutions include leak detection, repair requirements, restrictions on non-emergency flaring and venting, and reducing the use of natural gas for operations through electrification. The IEA estimates that around $13 billion of annual investment is required to implement all methane emission abatement measures in the petroleum industry and suggests (perhaps boldly) that, based on average natural gas prices from 2017 to 2021, this amount is less than the total value of the captured methane that could be sold - potentially resulting in net savings to industry. The scope and scale of the challenge is likely to vary significantly from basin to basin. Monitoring and abating emissions from hundreds of thousands of onshore wells across the US will inevitably be very different to the UK, where the vast majority of wells are located offshore and number just over 8,000 wells drilled to date (only a fraction are producing). Smaller, less well capitalized, players will inevitably face a greater challenge than large IOCs without government support, which in turn may face greater scrutiny from shareholders and other stakeholders. The GMP also builds on a succession of initiatives aimed at reducing methane emissions. These include the industry-led Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, established in 2014 to improve methane data collection and to develop and deploy methane management technology. In 2020, its membership agreed to reduce the collective average methane intensity of their aggregated upstream operations to 0.2% by 2025. Launched in 2017, the World Bank's zero routine flaring initiative also commits producers and governments to end routine flaring by 2030. And since 2017, a group of 25 IOCs, NOCs and oilfield services companies have subscribed to a set of 'Methane Guiding Principles', collaborating to share best practices, with the support of organizations including the World Bank, the IEA and trade association, Oil & Gas UK. Sticks and Carrots Although the GMP targets are non-binding, some signatory governments are introducing derivative guidelines and incentives at the national level, and even moving to introduce or supplement existing legislation. Recently announced guidelines and legislative proposals include: In the UK, as with many other signatories, existing legislation requires operators to have consents in place for flaring and venting from production Perhaps encouraged by its COP presidency, the UK has also introduced a Methane Action Plan, agreed between industry and the UK government, which includes a GMP-beating 50% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 (against a 2018 baseline), zero routine flaring by 2030, and a requirement for operators to develop individual methane action plans for each individual asset by 2023; The US administration introduced its Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan in Q4 2021. A landmark policy, $4.7 billion is allocated to a well-plugging program to remediate the estimated 1.6 million oil and 380,000 gas wells that are unplugged and estimated to be responsible for 263,000 metric tons of methane in 2019 alone. At the core of the initiative is a suite of regulations introduced by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, including guidelines that may ultimately require the implementation of leak detection and repair (LDAR) and the routing of associated gas from oil wells to sales In Q4 of 2020, the European Commission also presented an EU Methane Strategy, which proposes legislative and non-legislative measures in the petroleum (as well as agriculture and waste sectors), including compulsory measurement and reporting for all petroleum-related emissions, LDAR programs for the upstream and downstream sectors, and the elimination of routine venting and Other governments might also now look to introduce new measures with a view to reducing methane emissions at a national level. These could be legislative or non-legislative in nature, or even extend to incentives such as tax credits or other state subsidies. What's Next? Following COP26 More scrutiny and tougher requirements will inevitably encourage technological innovation, particularly in respect of methane measurement, abatement and capture, and potentially even financial upside in the case of the latter if methane can be monetized or new sources of capital tapped.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA118","The American Nuclear Society urges COP26 to recognize nuclear energy's climate role","Nuclear News"," ","At the start of the United Nations' Climate Change Conference, COP26 , ANS issued a statement urging delegates to insist that any agreement arising from COP26 include a strong role for nuclear technology in achieving carbon reduction targets. The letter, signed by ANS President Steven Nesbit and Executive Director/CEO Craig Piercy, stated, ""Deep decarbonization and electrification of the global economy will require the increased availability of firm, 'dispatchable' zero-carbon energy technologies. Nuclear energy is the only energy source with a proven track record of producing firm, zero-carbon energy at the scale needed to meet global goals. Indeed, it's increasingly clear that achieving net-zero worldwide carbon emissions is simply not feasible without a significant expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy worldwide."" The letter expressed the need for all sectors of the world economy to decarbonize as quickly as possible and noted that nuclear technology can be used in industrial processes. But in order to achieve this level of decarbonization, governments and policymakers must acknowledge the need for significant investment in research and development of advanced nuclear technologies coupled with the implementation of technology-neutral, performance-based climate and energy policies that treat all carbon-free energy sources fairly and equally. ""Nuclear must be treated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies,"" the letter stated. ""Delegates should not accept anything short of fair and equal treatment for nuclear energy vis-a-vis other zero-carbon sources, as doing so would be fundamentally incompatible with global progress on climate, economic prosperity, and energy security."" Also of note, ANS, as a recognized civil society organization with UN observer status, sponsored 10 Young Generation Network delegates from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to be on the ground in Glasgow during COP26 . As representatives of ANS and their respective countries, the pronuclear delegates attended events in the exclusive Blue Zone that were available only to UN observer organizations and national representatives. ANS's message at COP26 was clear: Carbon-free nuclear energy must be a part of the climate solution, and the time to act is now. Six years on from the Paris Agreement, our world leaders need to get serious about climate change, and that starts by preserving and expanding nuclear energy. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA119","More investors view divestment favorably post-COP26, survey finds","December 9, 2021 Thursday","Corporatesecretary.com","Thirty-six percent of investors say they support divestment as a tool against climate change, up from 30 percent before COP26 . That's according to a survey of more than 5,000 investors across the US, UK, Italy, Germany and South Africa by investment manager Ninety One in an effort to determine attitudes toward ESG issues and whether investors are willing to modify their approaches following the climate summit. Although more investors (45 percent) still say that working with high-emitting companies for a green transition remains their preference, this is a marked drop from the 55 percent that said they preferred investment managers to use their influence to support a net-zero transition over divestment in a similar poll ahead of the climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland last month. Hendrik du Toit, founder and CEO of Ninety One, is a vocal critic of divestment, instead arguing that 'responsible stewardship' and what he describes as an 'inclusive' approach to fighting climate change are essential. Despite 71 percent of investors saying they felt richer countries should be helping poorer countries to transition to net-zero, Ninety One's research also points to a lack of confidence in the outcomes of COP26 : 57 percent of respondents do not believe the agreements made at the summit will lead to global climate alignment on tackling climate change. More than two thirds (69 percent) add that a lack of high-profile leadership from China and Russia has made the COP26 goals even more difficult to achieve. ESG GONE MAINSTREAM The survey does have some positives, though. It finds that ESG considerations are already part of the daily decision-making process at most investors, with 57 percent saying they have investments with a focus on net-zero or other environmental and societal benefits. As well as finding that ESG considerations are already integrated into normal decision-making for many investors, Ninety One says these investments also have more longevity, with more than two thirds (67 percent) saying they are invested for five years or more across investments featuring a net-zero, E or S focus. 'These investors are committed to long-term environmental and societal benefits, or performance with purpose, with 70 percent agreeing that they will hold these investments for longer than those without,' the firm notes. It adds that investors expect the shift to a green economy to create appealing investments as well as helping fight climate change. 'Forty percent say they are happy for their money to influence decarbonization while also expecting a competitive financial return,' Ninety One says.

The approach advocated by its delegates will be one that respects the tremendous diversity of agricultural landscapes and ecosystems across the world. Agriculture and the role of ag biotech must be part of these talks, says the Biotechnology Industry Organization. Agriculture accounts for around 10% of greenhouse gas emissions but many biotech tools exist to reduce ag emissions. The organic sector says it stands ready to lead climate change efforts by planting the seeds for a more sustainable future right here at home.  As the threat of climate disaster grows more dire by the day, all eyes have turned to Glasgow\' s COP26 for answers, but the work has to start here first,"" says Organic Trade Association CEO and Executive Director Laura Batcha. By eliminating the use of chemical inputs like synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, organic sets the standard for climate-smart agriculture, OTA says. Organic farms emit 18% less overall greenhouse gasses than other agricultural systems and organic soil sequesters 26% more carbon than non-organic, Batcha says.  The Administration's Build Back Better framework would set the United States up for success at COP26 , positioning our nation as a standard bearer of sustainability and conscientious policy making.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA122","COP26 Roundup: Credibility Gap, Misinformation","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","International Oil Daily","Credibility Gap Climate Action Tracker (CAT) has calculated that the latest climate pledges (nationally determined contributions or NDCs) that countries submitted to COP26 will lead to an average increase of 2.4\'c2\'b0C in global temperature this century. The organization said that based on all pledges, including those made so far in Glasgow, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be around double what is necessary to limit warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. CAT's ""optimistic scenario"" \'e2\€ if all countries' net-zero pledges are implemented \'e2\€ would limit the temperature rise to 1.8\'c2\'b0C . But this estimate is ""far from positive, given the quality of the net-zero goals and the massive ambition and action gap in 2030,"" CAT said. Its country analysis shows that around 90% of global emissions are now covered by net-zero goals. Yet only a small number of those pledges \'e2\€ covering just 6% of global emissions \'e2\€ are rated ""acceptable"" and are backed up by plans to get there. The group also found that the announcements made at COP26 to reduce methane emissions and deforestation would narrow the global ""emissions gap"" only slightly, if at all. Misleading Climate Information An open letter with over 250 signatories, led by the Conscious Advertising Network (CAN), urges COP26 leaders and tech giants to play their part in addressing misleading information about climate change. The voluntary coalition said many digital platforms benefit from lucrative advertising that contains misleading climate information. But measures taken so far by tech platforms have failed to stem the flow of this kind of material. ""Such misleading content threatens to jeopardize climate negotiations and overall climate action,"" CAN said. The letter calls for: a universal definition of climate dis/misinformation, and action against climate dis/misinformation to be included in the COP26 negotiated text. It also asks for technology platforms to implement climate dis/misinformation policies and enforcement that extends to content, algorithms and advertising. ""At the onset of the pandemic, technology platforms came together \'e2\€ \£6 to combat 'fraud and misinformation about the virus.' So, we know that they can do it,"" said CAN co-founder Harriet Kingaby. Solar Investment Action The Solar Investment Action Agenda, launched at COP26 on Tuesday, will identify potential ""high-impact opportunities"" to scale up solar investment swiftly with the goal of mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030. This will be followed by a more detailed Solar Investment Roadmap to be released in 2022. The initiative is supported by the World Resources Institute in partnership with the International Solar Alliance and Bloomberg Philanthropies. ""Speeding up investment in solar power is critical to winning the battle against climate change,"" said Michael Bloomberg, who is also UN special envoy for climate ambition and solutions. ""It will also help us deliver energy to the hundreds of millions of people who still lack it without increasing carbon emissions and deadly air pollution. North Sea Transition Collaboration Trade groups representing five European countries that are targeting lower-carbon North Sea oil and gas have pledged to work together to advance the energy transition. Many oil and gas companies are already investing in renewable energy and advancing hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Industry groups from the UK, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Germany committed on Tuesday to host an annual summit to share progress to cut emissions and develop technologies that could be critical in helping other sectors of the economy reduce emissions. ""Today\'e2\€  s agreement recognizes that climate change doesn't stop at the border and commits us to work together to give millions of people access to cleaner energy and deliver a managed transition toward net zero,"" said Oil & Gas UK CEO Deirdre Michie. The head of Oil Gas Denmark, Martin Naesby, underlined the potential for ""massive"" CO2 storage. ""We have a unique understanding and expertise of the Danish subsoil which can put us at the forefront of the concerted effort.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA123","Springer Nature Launches COP26 Climate Research Campaign","October 27, 2021 Wednesday 7:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Springer Nature, a research, educational and professional publisher, issued the following news release: Ahead of the UN Climate Conference, known as COP26 , beginning on November 1 2021, Springer Nature has launched its Climate Research in Action campaign to highlight the importance of research in identifying climate solutions. The campaign, which is hosted on a dedicated microsite, includes a brand new compilation of the most important research articles related to climate from across the Nature Portfolio. The articles will be free to access during conference. In addition to the climate collection, the microsite includes a science-focused guide to COP26 and The Ozone Story: a timeline detailing how science inspired global changes in policy and behaviour after the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer - first published in Nature in 1985, leading to the most successful environmental treaty to date. The campaign will be shared with policymakers in response to a call from COP26 President Alok Sharma for academic evidence, research and rigour to make the case for climate action. Springer Nature has also partnered with Eurostar to promote the campaign microsite to COP26 delegates and activists travelling to Glasgow on the Climate Train, with the aim of getting attendees ready for energised, informed discussion at the conference. Commenting on the launch, Director of Sustainability Thea Sherer said: "" COP26 is the most important global collaboration on climate change for a generation. Research can provide policymakers from around the world with the evidence they need to make crucial climate decisions. Climate Research in Action, an anthology of leading research published by Springer Nature in this space aims to make the scientific evidence front-of-mind as we head towards COP. The campaign shines a light on insights that will inform how we will mitigate and adapt to our future world and support the world's ambition for a successful COP26 ."" ""Scientists have been sounding the alarm on climate for decades, as this new campaign shows. Policy-makers - and other key stakeholders in the fight against climate - need the support of scientists and research to continue to hold us to account and ensure that our efforts to tackle climate change measure up to the problem. ""However, researchers - like many of us in the climate community - also need to find new and engaging ways of communicating the evidence to society at large (who often have the ear of decision makers). It's important to translate technical detail into powerful storytelling that engages the general public. The Climate Research in Action campaign does exactly that, and articulates the impact research can have on climate action.""

Protesters met at Kelvingrove Park at 11:30 a.m. GMT and walked about 20 minutes to the conference center as they chanted ""We are unstoppable, another world is possible."" Though led by Thunberg, the march was organized by Fridays for Future Scotland. As COP26 COP26 a 'failure,' 'exclusionary' and £ global north green wash festival,' The Washington Post reported.[1] 'It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure,' said Thunberg. 'It should be obvious that this crisis cannot be solved with the same methods that got us into it in the first place.' Youth climate activists have called COP26 the 'most exclusionary' U.N. climate summit ever,[2] as many poor countries who will be the most affected by climate change were unable to attend[3] due to COVID restrictions. However, that is not the rhetoric some leaders are conveying.

For almost three decades, world governments havecome together at COP[2] to forge a global response to the climate emergency and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This year's event, which took place in Glasgow, couldn't have come at a more crucial time. John Kerry called the summit 'the last best hope' to keep global temperatures within the 1.5C target of the Paris Agreement. And after a year of deadly wildfires and floods in many parts of the world, there is little doubt left that climate change is here and is touching all corners of the Earth.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA127","The COP26 Parting Shot? Wait Until Next Year.","The American Prospect Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 18, 2021( The American Prospect Blogs: HYPERLINK http://prospect.org/blogs When future historians parse the great climate crisis of the 21st century, COP26 will figure prominently as a missed opportunity. As nearly 200 countries met in Scotland over 12 days to mull over their next steps, some of the signs carried by climate protesters during the Glasgow demonstrations forecast the regrettable outcome in three words: 'Blah blah blah.' The United States, China, and India set the terms of engagement, coming up with measures that nudged the fight against planetary disaster along. But they were essentially designed not to antagonize allies, upset rivals, or rouse domestic audiences coping with pandemic trauma. At the end of the Northern Hemisphere's warmest summer on record, the United Nations announced that limiting planetary temperature level increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius relies on reducing global carbon emissions 45 percent by 2030, a goal that world governments are not on track to meet. Although pledges to curb methane emissions, deforestation, and phasing down (but not phasing out) the use of coal were secured, the COP26 countries punted on stronger emissions targets, deciding to come back next year. In short, COP26 failed to pulverize the status quo. One of the major culprits was a Biden administration wanting badly to reclaim the mantle of global leadership with a show of decisive action, but dragged down by the Democratic Party's internecine feuds and the residual shock to the international system that was Donald Trump. Biden has been proclaiming that 'America is back,' presumably to summon forth some of the authority that his predecessor had sapped away. But at Glasgow, he was rendered ineffective by members of Congress operating more like the de Medicis in 15th-century Florence than legislators in a representative democracy faced with a planetary emergency. House Democrats finally passed the bipartisan infrastructure framework which only works as a climate policy if the companion Build Back Better Act passes but couldn't get it together before the president left home. More from Gabrielle Gurley[1] To circumvent interference from the Manchin-ian opposition, the U.S. watered down its stance on coal, refusing to sign an agreement early in the conference that would have ended coal use by 2030, instead opting for a wind-down during the course of the third decade. This 'phase down' rather than 'phase out' strategy raised its ugly head again midway through COP26 , thanks to an agreement between the U.S. and China. Though India got blamed for eleventh-hour maneuvering that saw the phrase 'phase down' inserted into the final agreement, the table had already been set[2] by Washington and Beijing. Whether this move tempers the goodwill the Chinese gained with a September announcement to stop building new plants is so far unclear[3]. Biden is playing a cynical and dangerous game on climate, with rhetorical flourishes followed by business-as-usual decision-making. On Wednesday, the administration announced that it would pursue the largest sale[4] of oil and gas leases ever in the Gulf of Mexico, not a week after the climate talks ended and only two days after prohibitions on new oil and gas leases near Native American cultural sites at Chaco Canyon and Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico. With the uncertainties posed by the approaching American midterms, the European Union, for its part, sees the U.S. as an unreliable partner at best. However, the EU has its own energy crisis and significant internal climate divisions. Creating a green-finance 'taxonomy[5],' a framework that spells out which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable, has split the Europeans on nuclear energy. The EU plans to decide in the coming weeks whether nuclear power is sustainable and will, under its regulations, 'do no significant harm.' The discord over this issue has split off an anti-nuclear bloc led by Germany, Austria, Denmark, Luxembourg, and Portugal and a pro-nuclear bloc led by France. Having abandoned nuclear power in the wake of Fukushima, Germany has returned to burning coal, faces[6] high energy prices, and is agonizing over an undersea natural gas pipeline that links the country to Russia and its national natural gas company Gazprom. The deal, supported by outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, is fraught, especially with Russian President Vladimir Putin stoking a migrant crisis in Belarus and provoking the EU and NATO with military maneuvers in Ukraine. The most searing takeaway from COP26 was the reaction of smaller countries collectively known as the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to the rich-nation talkathon. Punting new emissions pledges effectively into 2023, after the conclusion of COP27 in November 2022, is dereliction of the most cynical sort. The developed world did not make any firm financial commitments to emerging markets at Glasgow. At Glasgow, Biden was rendered ineffective by members of Congress operating more like the de Medicis in 15th-century Florence than legislators in a representative democracy faced with a planetary emergency. Small countries that are ill-equipped to finance energy transition projects wanted movement on the $100 billion Paris climate accords commitment (an annual 'floor' that developed countries signed on to). Only now, they want those sums doubled. They are also seeking monetary assistance, 'loss and damage[7]' in COP26 -speak, to compensate for harms already suffered from past and ongoing climate events caused by the developed world's activities. Global power brokers had little to say about adaptation funding and nixed compensation for losses, settling instead for 'dialogue,' which appears to be COP's forte. The EU, at least, appears ready to put its money where its mouth is, committing roughly $1 billion to an international fund[8] to protect and sustain forests, a portion of which will go to protect the Congo Basin, the second-largest rain forest on Earth. Indonesia and Brazil are wild cards in the quest to end deforestation by 2030, however. Indonesia's environment minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar backed away from the document, labeling it 'inappropriate and unfair.' Satellite monitoring indicates that deforestation continues to accelerate in Brazil, increasing nearly 5 percent in October compared[9] to the same period in 2020. For many, the real leader of COP26 was Simon Kofe, the minister for justice, communication and foreign affairs of Tuvalu, a nine-island Pacific Ocean nation and an AOSIS member. While standing in knee-deep Pacific Ocean waters to dramatize his country's crisis, he delivered a visually arresting recorded statement to the conference imploring the world to act[10]. Thousands of Tuvaluans have already moved to New Zealand, and plans to relocate some of the remaining 10,000 people and retain some degree of territorial integrity are in progress. Kofe's statement this week got scant coverage. Asked for his views on COP26 outcomes, Kofe noted that he would have liked to have seen 'bigger countries take bigger cuts in emissions' and singled out Australia's declaration to keep mining coal. 'I see it as a dilemma that Australia and other countries face,' he said[11]. 'You have your immediate economic interests that you have on one hand and then you have the well-being of the world.'

Today we're talking with Bill McKibben about the climate movements that continue to push for real change in spite of the dithering by world leaders, and we discuss how to stay sane, happy, and engaged even as the impacts of climate chaos increase around the world with author Trebbe Johnson. Listen here: The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, more commonly referred to as COP26 , was held in Glasgow, Scotland earlier this month, and it was largely deemed a failure[1]. Countries failed to commit to   ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets that would keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. Rather infamously, it was reported that if all of the fossil fuels lobbyists attending COP26 [2] represented a single nation, they'd be the single largest national delegation in attendance. The text of the Glasgow Climate Pact adopted by the 197 countries participating in COP26 was changed last-minute so that it spoke of a 'phase down' of coal[3] rather than a 'phase out'  which is a rather neat summary of how COP26 failed to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. There was some tentative progress made at COP26 , however. Perhaps the biggest achievement was that 127 countries signed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use[4], committing to 'halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation' by 2030 as part of their efforts to combat climate change. Russia, Brazil, and China  which rank as the #1, #2, and #6 countries in the world in terms of tree cover  signed the Declaration, which is notable since they were not signatories to the NY Declaration on Forests, which was adopted by just 39 countries in 2014. The more than 100 countries that signed the Glasgow Declaration represent 85% of Earth's forested land, and some $19.2 billion in national and private funds were committed during COP26 to support their forest protection efforts. The Declaration also recognizes the important role that Indigenous communities play in protecting forests. But there are plenty of details that must still be worked out. For instance, as Mongabay founder and CEO Rhett Butler noted[5], 'That loose definition [of deforestation] leaves a lot of room for interpretation  for example, a country could potentially claim 'net zero deforestation' by converting natural forests to monoculture plantations[6].' And as Mongabay contributor Justin Catonoso reported from Glasgow[7], many NGOs are warning that commitments to stop deforestation in the name of climate change will be undermined by the continued burning of forest biomass as a zero carbon fuel. There are plenty of climate solutions available to us, of course, and we've covered many of them here on this podcast in recent months, such as securing Indigenous and local communities' land rights[8], making our food system more sustainable through things like agroforestry[9] and agroecology[10], and restoring forests[11] to unlock their carbon storage potential. And of course another way we can keep pushing for a more sustainable, equitable future is through activism. Bill McKibben, noted environmental activist, author, and founder of 350.org[12] as well as the newly created Third Act[13] initiative, joins us today to talk about the state of the climate movement and what gives him hope that we may yet rise to the challenge and halt global warming. McKibben tells us about his response to the failures of COP26 , why he was inspired by the activism he saw at the COP, and how he sees climate activism evolving to counter the outsized influence of the industries that rely on burning fossil fuels and clearing the world's forests for profit. We're also joined today by Trebbe Johnson, author of Radical Joy for Hard Times: Finding Meaning and Making Beauty In Earth's Broken Places[14] and founder of an organization with the same name: Radical Joy for Hard Times[15]. Johnson tells us about ecological grief, how it can affect people concerned about the future of our planet, and how to deal with that grief and stay committed to working towards a better future for all life on Earth.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA131","COP26: Imperial College-London Experts Reflect on the Story So Far","November 12, 2021 Friday 9:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Imperial College London issued the following news: By Hana Amer COP26 has seen surprising net-zero pledges, methane reduction targets and climate finance announcements, but what do they mean? There are now just a few days remaining of the major UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), which is ongoing in Glasgow. COP26 is the first time, since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, when countries have been asked to update their emissions reduction pledges and set out more ambitious plans for tackling climate change. With the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report described as 'code red for humanity', hopes have been high that significant agreements will be made at COP26 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming to 1.5 C by the end of this century. However, with current pledges putting us on track for at least 2.4 C of warming, according to Climate Action Tracker, much remains to be achieved at the COP26 negotiations. Imperial staff and students reflect on some of the announcements and members of the College's COP26 COP26 so far, highlighting the need for increased ambition and collaboration, as well as the importance of details on how countries and organisations plan to meet the pledges they make. India's 2070 net zero target: India's Prime Minister announced at COP26 that the country, which is the world's third-biggest annual carbon emitter, would reach net zero emissions by 2070. Dr Joeri Rogelj, Director of Research at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment and Reader in Climate Science and Policy at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London commented: ""This is an incredibly important first step, and highlights India's willingness to pursue ambitious climate policies. India is a developing country that still needs to tackle great challenges in terms of poverty eradication, together with climate change. It is not yet clear if India's target refers to all greenhouse gases or carbon dioxide only. If it covers all greenhouse gases, the target is incredibly ambitious. If it covers CO2 only, it is still ambitious, and an important step. ""After this ambitious target, now the strategies, plans and policies are needed that will ensure that India's emissions are curbed onto a downward trajectory while ensuring sustainable development for its population. Without any doubt, developed countries should support India through finance and technology to make this formidable shift."" Global methane pledge: More than 100 countries, including the US, Japan and Canada, pledged to significantly reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Dr Paulo Ceppi, Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute said: ""Any pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions are good and welcome news, and this is a step in the right direction. It's important to keep in mind, however, that in the long run carbon dioxide is more impactful than methane, since methane has a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere. Hence, we must not forget that this pledge alone is far from sufficient to meet the 1.5 C global warming target set out by the Paris Agreement, which will require achieving net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the twenty-first century."" Dr Joeri Rogelj, Director of Research at the Grantham Institute and Reader in Climate Science and Policy at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London said: ""The global methane pledge shows global momentum towards tackling one of the second most important greenhouse gases that humans emit. If achieved, it will halt and even reduce the global warming that methane causes. ""However, an analysis of the pledges with climate models that match the latest IPCC climate assessment shows that the global warming benefit of this pledge might not be as large as thought, and levels off over time. This points to the importance of tackling carbon dioxide and methane at the same time, for example, through deep overall emissions cuts and a phase-out of coal infrastructure."" Dr Rogelj contributed to a Carbon Brief blog on what this pledge can deliver. UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney's announcement of $130 trillion in private capital climate commitments: The former Governor of the Bank of England revealed that more than 450 firms representing $130 trillion, or 40% of global financial assets, now belong to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Dr Alex Koberle, Research Associate in Mitigation Technologies at the Grantham Institute commented: ""Whilst the announcement by Mark Carney's Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero to secure $130 trillion in private capital to fund the transition to net zero is positive, it remains to be seen what it will deliver. The devil will be in the details and at this point there isn't much information on the implementation of this. But it is encouraging to see these types of initiatives emerge as they set the agenda for the outcomes of COP26 ."" Youth engagement at COP26 : The COP26 Amy Wilson, PhD student at Imperial College London and Team Lead at ClimaTalk said: ""There are very few occasions where the youth get to review discussions and decisions. We see with Fridays For Future, and other youth organisations, a consistent movement of youth towards protesting and action - why can we not increase their involvement in negotiations and bring their views to the table? We should be advocating for education, training and youth inclusion, so that all young people feel empowered to actively be involved in climate negotiations, not only at COP26 but at climate meetings and sessions throughout the year."" International climate finance: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an additional pound sterling1 billion over the next five years for international climate finance from the overseas aid budget. Mili Fomicov, Research Associate at the Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College Business School commented: ""Emerging markets are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Government and corporate flows are required to fund their transition to a lower carbon economy, but emerging markets haven't received the amount of capital required. That needs to change. Local and foreign investors, as well as governments should invest in building out renewable infrastructure in emerging markets, as well as invest in adaptation and mitigation strategies. Climate finance frameworks need to evolve, barriers on foreign investment must be addressed, and bolder government policies should be adopted. All pillars need to come together to scale clean energy in emerging economies and to achieve a sustainable future globally."" Fossil fuel industry presence at COP26 : 503 delegates with links to the fossil fuel industry have been accredited for COP26 , making it equivalent to the summit's largest delegation. With limited numbers of tickets available for delegates and concerns that fossil fuel delegates will lobby against decarbonisation, there is debate around members of the fossil fuel industry attending COP26 . COP26 . It is clear that current commitments from the oil industry are insufficient and do not align with global climate goals. The industry has been given its chance to act responsibly and they are not doing so. Therefore, they should only be attending COP26 if they are there to demonstrate how they plan to rapidly downscale the supply of fuels, in line with low-carbon 1.5 C-consistent pathways, as well as capture CO2 from those fuels that remain. ""If the industry does not embrace the transition to a net-zero carbon economy, there is a risk that the economic and financial system will suddenly end up with a significant amount of 'un-burnable' oil and therefore trillions of stranded assets."" Highlighting the role of science and innovation at COP26 Alongside following the COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, the Imperial College London delegation has hosted events for decision-makers, businesses and researchers to discuss key climate change and biodiversity-related issues at COP26 . Neil Grant, a PhD student on the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet (SSCP) Doctoral Training Partnership, who moderated the panel discussion said: """" COP26 marks another step in the move from agenda-setting to delivery. Hopefully by the end of COP26 we will have finalised the Paris Agreement rulebook, and the focus must continue to shift from designing the goals and regime of global climate action, to delivering on these goals through the implementation of climate policy across the real economy. ""The role of science as one guiding star in this most critical of journeys is only just beginning. This discussion provided valuable insights into the issues that scientists need to engage with further, including the challenges of co-production and the need to confront vested interests and power structures."" The Centre for climate change innovation (CCCI), an initiative of Imperial's Grantham Institute and the Royal Institution, hosted Climate action: how innovation can have an impact at home, on travel and food, to explore the role individuals can take in accelerating climate action, and how climate innovation can help people reduce emissions at home, in their travel and in what they eat. On the role of transport innovation, Imperial's Dr Marc Stettler stated: ""We have to think holistically about how we travel. The amount of CO2 produced by transport is the product of how much we travel, how much energy is consumed for each kilometre that we travel, and the amount of carbon emitted for each unit of energy that we use. ""These are the levers we have to reduce transport's contribution to climate change and we probably need to pull on all of them, rather than just one, to meet our climate targets."" Exploring biodiversity, climate change and mental health Imperial College London's Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment co-hosted an official side event with partners including York University in Canada, which focused on strengthening biodiversity and climate change linkages. Panellists emphasised the need to engage indigenous communities and local citizens in shaping climate and biodiversity action to ensure that nature-based solutions increase people's resilience, safety and quality of life. Imperial and Natural History Museum panellist Professor Andy Purvis said: ""I would love to see governments and the media recognise that it isn't the climate activists and the nature activists that we need to be protected from, it's the vested interests that are the climate and nature inactivists that we all need to be protected from."" Exploring the link between climate change and other societal challenges, the Climate Cares team - a collaboration between the Institute of Global Health Innovation and the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment - led an event that explored the impact climate change has on our minds and how we can use our emotions, passions, and skills to implement meaningful climate action. At the event Dr Emma Lawrance said: ""Climate change itself threatens to widen inequalities, including inequalities in mental health. And inequality itself is a cause of emotional distress and worse mental health. So, these things all join together."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7664278 MSTRUCK \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA132","Sharing Resources: Key to COP26 Success","October 28, 2021 Thursday 12:10 PM GMT","Send2Press","World leaders meet in Glasgow beginning October 31 for the United Nations COP26 Climate Change Conference, to address the conclusions of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report: that human activities have unequivocally warmed and damaged the planet. Share International attributes 80 percent of the warming to human actions, and says sharing resources to mitigate the inevitable consequences is key to solving climate change. As early as 2007, an article by a Master of Wisdom, recorded by the late British author Benjamin Creme and published in Share International magazine, gave this 80 percent figure and stated that we have a pivotal choice to make: to reap the beneficial results of immediate action, or face the destruction that would ensue from doing nothing, or too little. The article stated that the World Teacher for this age, Maitreya, who is gradually emerging into public view, \'e2\€  will advocate a simpler form of living, one more in keeping with the planet\'e2\€  s situation. When enough people are convinced that this is necessary,\'e2\€ it presaged, \'e2\€  there will be a growing movement to simplify throughout the planet.\'e2\€ It further predicted that \'e2\€  faced with the dilemma of necessary change, men will come to realize the inevitability of accepting the principle of sharing. Only sharing will make these changes practical and possible.\'e2\€ Although the effects of climate change are coming faster than scientists anticipated, the IPCC report affirms there is still time to slow or even reverse some changes by reducing CO2 emissions to at least net zero. But to accomplish this globally, the wealthier countries must not only curb their own emissions but also share resources and technology with less developed nations, to ensure that all can make the necessary rapid transition to sustainable energy sources. Three of the four goals of COP26 require potentially large financial investments: radical emissions reductions, strengthening adaptation to climate impacts, and mobilizing finances. The fourth is for countries to work together to accomplish these pressing but inescapable measures. The COP26 web site indicates, however, that developed countries have not even made good on their 2009 Copenhagen Accord pledge to mobilize by 2020 at least $100 billion in climate finance per year for developing nations. Another impediment noted by Jeffrey Sachs, president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network, is that poor countries must borrow internationally at rates of 5 to 10 percent, and many have no access to capital markets at all, while rich countries benefit from near-zero interest rates. Clearly, politicians have not yet responded to the climate crisis at levels commensurate with the danger, but COP26 offers a pivotal opportunity. To succeed at their stated goal of \'e2\€  uniting the world to tackle climate change,\'e2\€ COP26 participants will need to go beyond inequitable loan financing and fast-track unconditional sharing of the financial and technological resources necessary to bring all countries on board. This is in line with Maitreya\'e2\€  s rallying call to humanity: \'e2\€  Share and save the world.\'e2\€ Share International USA is a non-profit educational organization established to disseminate information about the presence in the world of the Masters of Wisdom, led by Maitreya.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA133","Letter COP26 won't save the world. The job is on the shoulders of grassroots climate activists.","December 12, 2021 Sunday","The Salt Lake Tribune","The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26 , ended with the adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which seeks to keep global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees, phase down coal, and mobilize developed countries to jointly commit $100 billion in climate finance per year. There's a certain irony to the amount of emissions created by gathering such a large international group to discuss climate change. Alarmingly, fossil fuel companies had over 500 people at COP26 , more than any single country. Utah Republican John Curtis was there with the Conservative Climate Caucus, which believes that free-market innovation and continued use of fossil fuels will provide the answer to our problems. They won't. We aren't going to engineer our way out of this. COP26 won't save the world. It doesn't truly treat this crisis as a crisis. At worst, it's a shiny PR campaign for the political elite, billionaires and fossil fuel executives to hide behind ""sustainability"" and ""green development."" At worst, it's further demonstration that the countries most responsible for the climate crisis are failing to meet targets that aren't anywhere close to enough in the first place. But at best, it's a forum for grassroots climate activists to connect with each other and represent the accountability and honesty that is consistently lacking from these conferences. The real climate leaders are not the big players at this summit. We are the leaders we've been looking for, as legendary activist Grace Lee Boggs would say. We know what we need to do, and unlike the players at COP26 , we aren't scared of the changes it requires. This is not sacrifice; this is healing. This is not negotiation; this is accountability. This is not an apocalypse; this is an opportunity. We are the leaders we've been looking for. Maya Kobe-Rundio, Salt Lake City Submit a letter to the editor \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA134","COP26 Host Brings Climate Talks to the Events Industry","October 27, 2021","MeetingsNet","VisitScotland\' s new podcast,  COP26 and the Journey to Change,"" provides food for thought for meeting professionals in two directions. First, there's the content itself; second, there\' s the approach: piggybacking on a high-profile event to amplify your message. Glasgow, Scotland, is the host city for COP26 , the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which begins November 1. As the countries of the world gather in hopes of agreeing to a path that will slow climate change, Scotland\' s national tourist organization has created a parallel conversation about sustainability in the business events sector. Its new 16-episode podcast looks at what the business events industry can learn from COP26 and what it can do to help achieve the goals of the conference. Four episodes are available so far, and a new one will be released on each day of the conference, aligning with themes of COP26 , such as energy, nature, and equality. Speakers include events-industry leaders Sherrif Karamat, CEO of the Professional Convention Management Association; Sven Bossu, CEO of the International Association of Convention Centres; Amy Calvert, CEO of the Events Industry Council, plus many others, as well as VisitScotland executives who moderate the episodes. In large part, the podcast content could have been delivered at any time. However, plugging into COP26 builds on the excitement of the global climate event. Could other organizations use VisitScotland\' s approach as a roadmap to engagement? Consider the 2022 Winter Olympics Games in Beijing. A wide variety of interest groups will be watching through their particular lenses epidemiologists, travel writers, human-rights activists, and sports psychologists, to name just a few. Organizations with audiences drawn to issues around the Olympics could consider a podcast, webinar series, or even a live event to run concurrently. Some other events that generate the kind of media attention that could be parlayed into increased virtual or in-person participation include CES, TED, World Economic Forum, SXS, and any major election.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA136","COP26 DEBRIEF: WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR HEALTH?","November 22, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Academy of Medical Sciences: In October the Academy launched a joint report with the Royal Society looking at the health impacts of initiatives to tackle climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. As co-Chair of the group that prepared this report, Professor Sir Andy Haines FMedSci, reflects on his time at COP26 and pulls out the key messages that came out of the conference for health. A united health community It was gratifying to see the health community mobilised in unprecedented numbers compared to previous COP events, working together to raise the profile of health in the climate agenda. Ahead of COP26 The Global Climate and Health Alliance were essential in coordinating meetings between health professionals and members of national delegations at the conference. These events helped to raise awareness of the health effects of climate change and the health benefits of climate action. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had a health pavilion which held 60 events and held a global conference on health and climate change which focussed on climate justice. The WHO also put together a COP26 special report which proposed 10 priority recommendations from the global health community to governments and policy makers, making the health case for urgent climate action. I was pleased to present the Academys recent joint report on climate change and health at an official side event put on by the InterAcademy Partnership, where I gave many win-win examples of actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that would have positive near term benefits for health. Overall: a mixed bag The overall outcomes of COP26 were a mixed bag, with a major gap between the magnitude of the action required and the commitments made by many national governments. The goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial is barely alive, but every effort must be made to keep well under 2C. There was an important focus on coal phase out and although the final wording was weakened to phase down, the direction of travel is clear. There was also a welcome commitment to methane reduction for the first time and 105 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. An initiative of UK COP26 Presidency, the UNFCCC Climate Champions Team and others, was successful in securing commitments from 51 countries to develop sustainable resilient low carbon health systems, putting them on a pathway to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Of these signatories 14 nations have specified a target date for achieving net zero emissions, ranging from 2030 to 2050. Countries file Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) reflecting their commitments to deliver the goal of the Paris Agreement, limiting global temperature rise to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. An analysis of the inclusion of health in these showed that the highest ranking countries were all low and middle income nations that have contributed little to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly exposed to climate risks. All countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their current emissions targets to 2030, as expressed in their NDCs, by 2022, offering an important opportunity to strengthen the commitment to address health in the NDCs. After six years of discussions the Paris Rulebook containing guidelines for how the Paris Agreement is delivered, was completed at COP26 . This is an essential prerequisite for achieving the goals of the Agreement and for holding countries to account, including rigorous framework for countries to exchange carbon credits through the UNFCCC. Whats needed next Without a specific COP workstream dedicated to health as there were for other sectors health did not make it to the centre of the key negotiations carried out at the conference. The health community must redouble efforts to work with decision makers in sectors responsible for large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions to get health benefits put at the heart of climate change discussions, debate, and action in the UK, and beyond. As noted in the recommendations of our report, the UK Government has a key role in promoting a stronger focus on health within the international climate narrative, and to advocate for this to be maintained. By integrating the protection and promotion of human health in all actions to address climate change in the UK and demonstrating the potential health gains of the net-zero transition, the UK can take a global leadership role ahead of the climate negotiations at COP27 next year in Egypt. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA140","A Timeline: Protests, Counter Protests and More at COP26 UN Climate\~Summit","November 8, 2021","WWD","The much-anticipated COP26 is turning out mixed feelings from young activists. Presided over by the U.K. this year, the U.N.-backed climate summit is in its final week of programming taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. But while negotiations on the main stage or ""The Blue Zone,"" where climate deal-making happens among the world's elite, the public ""The Green Zone"" and outskirts of COP26 caused more of a stir over the weekend. On Friday, the Greta Thunberg-speared youth climate organization Fridays for Future organized a 25,000-strong march in Glasgow, just a couple miles outside COP26 's Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow. On Saturday, some 100,000 people gathered to protest COP26 . Among the forefront were Indigenous climate leaders, national trade unions, Black Lives Matter protesters and Scottish independence groups. ""Behind every murder that happens in the Amazon, every killing that happens to a land defender, there is a company behind that, there is a government behind that, there is a name behind that,"" said Helena Gualinga, an environmental and Indigenous rights defender, during the protest. Gualinga criticized the lack of media attention for Amazonian youth from Brazil and Ecuador, who led the protest. COP26 Coalition, a U.K.-based civil society coalition that spans hundreds of international organizers, among them Extinction Rebellion Scotland, helped organize the events. Spokesperson Asad Rehman offered the following statement: ""We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice. This has been the least accessible climate summit ever - with so many people sidelined at the talks or not able to make it in the first place,"" adding that the protest Saturday allowed their voices to be heard. The coalition launched a counter-summit Nov. 7 to 10 called ""The People's Summit for Climate Justice"" which saw 12,000 registrations for its hybrid event meant to flip ""the colonial script,"" per the organization. COP26 's failings. ""COP is a pacifying tool that serves to bail out the existing power structure and prevent the radical change that is necessary,"" said Kyle Topfer, environmental scientist from Sydney, in a statement tweeted by Scientist Rebellion. Topfer was one of the three activists who spent the night in jail after being arrested for the bridge blockade. More demonstrations are in tow, and the city is preparing accordingly. On Monday, assistant chief constable for Police Scotland Gary Ritchie provided an update on what to expect: ""We have continued to engage with protest groups as we move into the final week of the conference and we are pleased with the positive engagement we have had. Further events are planned for this week, particularly on Wednesday which may result in some localized disruption for a short period as we look to facilitate a procession in the Govan area."" Ritchie said officers facilitated eight protests Monday ""which all passed without incident."" During COP26 COP26 . The department staffs 10,000 cops each day for the event. Also on Monday, activists like Leah Thomas, founder of Intersectional Environmentalist, and Alexandria Villase\'f1or, claimed they were shut out of relevant programming (only a couple of tickets were awarded to each constituency), especially in regard to former President Barack Obama's 45-minute speech at COP26 (which championed young people).

Delegates from nearly 200 nations are frantically seeking a resolution to the summit, which aims to keep the goal of limiting temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as global warming-driven disasters hit home around the world. ""We believe that this is existential,"" US climate enjoy John Kerry told delegates. ""For many of you it is not existential in the future, it is existential today. People are dying today. All around the world the impacts are being felt, today."" Kerry said trillions of dollars had been spent in the last five or six years on subsidising the polluting fossil fuels driving climate change: ""That is the definition of insanity."" Delegates are charged with keeping the Paris Agreement temperature goals alive even as climate-driven disasters hit countries the world over Photo: AFP / Paul ELLIS Kerry was addressing a COP26 ""stocktake"", the public hearing that allows countries to raise concerns over the texts negotiated so far. New wording on Friday called for countries to accelerate ""the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"". That was softer than a first iteration of the text, but observers said the inclusion of the fuels driving the climate crisis was an important step. ""Unabated"" coal plants are those that do not deploy carbon capture technology to offset some of their pollution. The text requests countries to come back next year with updated climate pledges. It also fleshes out other key areas of contention, including calling on developed countries to ""at least double"" their funding for adaptation -- helping at-risk nations face climate impacts -- by 2025. Climate Justice activist Vanessa Nakate addressed a plenary session at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow on November 11, 2021. COP26 President Alok Sharma said there was still an array of unfinished business at the crunch UN climate summit Photo: AFP / Paul ELLIS But a faultline remains over the failure of wealthy nations to meet their decade-old promise to provide $100 billion to help vulnerable nations green their grids and prepare for the worst impacts of climate change. Kenyan environment minister Keriako Tobiko told delegates that failure to honour the funding pledge had severely hurt confidence.

COP26 President Alok Sharma said there was still an array of unfinished business at the crunch UN climate summit Photo: AFP / Paul ELLIS The two-week summit began with a bang as world leaders descended on Glasgow armed with a string of headline announcements, from a commitment to slash methane emissions to a plan to save the rainforests. Host Britain says it wants COP26 to lead to commitments from countries to keep the 1.5C temperature cap goal of the Paris agreement within reach. However, current national emissions cutting plans, all told, would lead to 2.7C of heating. In a speech to delegates, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans held up his mobile phone with a picture of his one-year-old grandson on screen. ""If we fail -- and I mean fail now in the next few years -- he will fight with other human beings for water and food. That's the stark reality we face,"" he said. He said the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is ""about avoiding a future for our children and grandchildren that is unlivable"". Negotiations received a shot in the arm on Wednesday when the United States and China -- the two largest emitters -- unveiled a joint climate action plan, although it was light on detail. One of the main sticking points at the summit is finance, with developing nations insisting on more money for adaptation that can help them brace for future climate shocks. Countries already battered by climate disasters such as record-breaking drought and flooding are also demanding they be compensated separately for ""loss and damage"". Developed nations meanwhile favour a greater push on emissions reductions, something countries yet to fully electrify their grids -- and largely blameless for emissions -- feel is unfair. ""Rich nations treat climate finance as charity or a favour to placate developing countries into signing a compromised package of decisions,"" Harjeet Singh, senior adviser at Climate Action Network International, told AFP. Organisers said the draft texts dedicated an ""unprecedented"" section to loss and damage, but vulnerable nations said it stopped far short of their expectations. Other issues likely to delay an agreement in Glasgow include a long-simmering dispute over the rules governing carbon markets, and common reporting timeframes.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images </figcaption></figure> While addressing the 26th UN Climate Change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, during the final hours of the event, COP26 President Alok Sharma was overcome with emotion. China and India had just proposed a last-minute change to the final text of the agreement, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, so that the call to phase out unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies was watered down to phase down. Delegates from other countries, from Switzerland to Cuba, deplored the move, but ultimately adopted the text in the interest of time, as the conference was runningmore than 24 hours lateby that point.\~ I apologize for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry said Sharma, who earlier in the week had told reporters he was sometimes called No-drama Sharma. He then added: I also understand the disappointment, but, as you ve noted, it is vital we protect this package, his voice quivering towards the end of the sentence.\~ <figure> <figcaption> Britain's President for COP26 Alok Sharma pauses during his concluding remarks at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow on November 13, 2021. PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images </figcaption></figure> Specific mentions of fossil fuels had eluded previous UN climate agreements, and the Glasgow Climate Pact was meant to mark a landmark achievement despitetwo rounds of revisiondiluting and complicating the simple phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies sentence featured in the document s first draft. Sharma and the U.K. government had a clear goal for COP26 to keep the spirit of 1.5 alive, a reference to COP21 s milestone Paris agreement, which called for global action to prevent temperatures from rising above 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. To do so, it s crucial to reach net zero emissions by 2050 meaning that for every amount of greenhouse gas emissions, an equal number is removed from the atmosphere and, to be on track to reach that goal, scientists think global emissions should behalved by 2030.Earlier this year, a report from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that global temperatures have alreadyrisen by 1.1 degree Celsiuson pre-industrial levels. We have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action, Sharma said. It s a statement that doesn t hide the disappointment the conference organizers must have felt as the event that was dubbed the most important COP since Paris just couldn t fully deliveron its ambition. COP26 was neither success nor failure absolute concepts that don t reflect the complexities of high-level international negotiations but a mixed bag of progress on some issues, disappointment on others, and a whole lot of pledges.\~ COP26 s Key Agreements And Pledges The U.K. Presidency had four key objectives summarized as coal, cash, cars, and trees in other words,ending coal power generation(a pledge now endorsed by 46 countries with a deadline set at 2040), providing the long promised $100 billion annual support towards developing countries green transition (a goal that was meant to cover the period 2020-2025 but not materializing until 2023 at least, and whose future beyond 2025), supporting electric vehicles and a phase out of gasoline and diesel-poweredmotor vehicles by 2040, and reversing deforestation in an attempt to protectexisting nature-based solutionsto capturing emissions. The bilateral agreement between the U.S. and China on climate change action, including a cut in methane emissions the subject of a multilateral agreement produced at COP26 to which China refused to take part was also aremarkable development. <figure> <figcaption> 46 countries committed to the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement"" at COP26 . Sean Gallup/Getty Images </figcaption></figure> Some of these agreements are imperfect theone about deforestation, for instance, pledged to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. It appeared a success as it involved Brazil, home to the world s largest rainforest who s been losing trees atrecord pace this year,but Brazilian senatorssoon clarifiedthat their commitment would only extend to illegal deforestation. Campaigners have long indicated that the line betweenlegal and illegal deforestationin the country is often blurreddue to amnestiesaffecting illegally deforested areas.\~ Others are deprived of key players. A campaign to phase outoil and gas in the next 30 yearspromoted by Denmark and Costa Rica, for instance, lacked the support of COP26 s host country, the U.K., which is considering the development of anew coal mineand anoffshore oil field. Pledges submitted by countries to reduce their emissions remain insufficient to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius target. The most optimistic scenario drafted by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in which all nations follow through with their pledges, puts the world on course fora 1.8 degrees Celsius increasein global temperatures by 2100. The non-profit groupClimate Action Trackerconfirmed the IEA calculation, but indicated that a more realistic outcome for those pledges is a 2.4 degrees temperature rise and a 2.7 degrees on the basis of current policies. A report this week by the\~Paris Reinforce consortium, which comprises 18 research institutions,adds nuance to those figures, finding that current policies put the world on course for between 2.3 to 2.9 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, while climate pledges lead to warming of 2.2 to 2.7 degrees over the same period. <figure> <figcaption> A woman rides her scooter through floodwaters occurring around high tide in a low lying area near the airport on November 27, 2019 in Funafuti, Tuvalu. Sea water sometimes percolates up through the porous coral land in the area during high tides. Mario Tama/Getty Images </figcaption></figure> Some countries are already feeling the impact of rising global temperatures and several developing countries, some of which are already facing rising sea levels eating into their territories and extreme weather events devastating lives and livelihoods, branded a rise of 2 degrees Celsius in global temperaturesas a death sentence. Developing countries and civil society campaigners were disappointed with the failure to create a robust mechanism to disburse financial aid towards loss and damage in the face of climate change. Sir David King, chair of Climate Crisis Advisory Group\~(CCAG), an independent group of 15 experts from 11 countries thatreleased their own assessmentof COP26 s outcome this week, called the failure to reach an agreement on that front a fundamental breach of trust. He said in a press statement: What we have at hand is a fundamental breach of trust between rich and poor nations, with catastrophic consequences for the world. Without a recalibration from developed nations on how they approach their relations with poorer countries, change at the scale and pace required to ensure global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is nigh on impossible. The Path Ahead On a positive note, delegates were able to finalize a deal around carbon markets that was left unfinished in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, paving the way for building a system toprice and trade carbon globally. COP26 also saw unprecedented commitments from the private sector toreaching net zero goalsand supplying thetrillions of dollars neededto fund the transition. All actors in the financial sector have stepped on board to redirect the standards on where investments go. It sends a signal, Johan Rockstr\'f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told Forbes during COP26 . Another sign of progress Rockstr\'f6m witnessed in Glasgow is an overall agreement that limiting emissions in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement is a must. This is the first COP where we do not debate any longer the direction we're moving at, we're debating the speed, he said.\~ <figure> <figcaption> Aerial view show a deforested area of Amazonia rainforest in Labrea, Amazonas state, Brazil, in September 2021.

Forms of transportation that don t traditionally feature fuel engine combustion, such as trains or bicycles, weren t even considered in the program, which instead focused on electric vehicles, airplanes, and shipping sectors that present huge decarbonization challenges, which nonetheless shouldn t detract from discussing existinglow-carbon modes of transportation.\~\~ Overall, lacking from the discussions at COP26 was the understanding that reaching net zero emissions requires more than just a switch from one energy source to another, but a reinvention of current modes of production and consumption. This was noted by Guy Grainger, global head of sustainability services at real estate services company JLL, who would have liked more focus on the circular economy, at least in his sector. The circular economy has got a huge role to play in the built environment, but [it] actually hasn't been talked about enough yet. I'm hoping that that will come, he told Forbes . COP26 is now over, but the mission to prevent the worst consequences of climate change continues. No doubt the issues that created disappointment in Glasgow will be discussed with even more urgency next November, at COP27 in Egypt. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA143","OOH climate change campaign debuts at COP26","November 30, 2021 Tuesday 5:03 PM GMT","Digital Signage Today","Over the next two weeks, 20,000 world leaders and delegates will meet in Glasgow, Scotland for the COP26 summit to discuss solutions to the world's climate crisis. Conservation International has released a global OOH campaign with Clear Channel, ""Hear me while you can,"" to inspire world leaders, delegates and people around the world to understand the perils of climate change, according to a company press release. Over the duration of COP26 , Clear Channel digital screens will showcase Conservation International's campaign, which invites passers-by to ""stop and listen to the beautiful sounds of nature."" The digital screens will feature a QR code which, once snapped, takes the user to conservation.org/HearMe, where they can listen to nature sounds from the Amazon rainforest to South African savannah, from Southeast Asia mountains to the North Pacific Ocean, and learn more about Conservation International's work to protect nature. The campaign comes as nearly 3,000 delegates participated in the Convention on Biodiversity COP15 talks earlier this month, where governments agreed to pledge more investment to protect biodiversity. ""Nature isn't just something that is beautiful to see and hear - it is essential in the fight to slow climate change, to our very survival. The science on this is clear: if we don't invest in stopping the destruction of nature, we will fail to avert climate catastrophe - even if we get everything else right,"" Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, said in the release. ""We are working across the global south - and now, here at COP26 in Glasgow - to drive investments to nature for the benefit of people and the climate."" Nature can provide at least 30% of global action required to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change - yet solutions such as protecting, restoring and managing forests, mangroves and peatlands receive less than 3% of all global climate funding, according to the release. ""Hear Me"" gives a nod to ""Nature Is Speaking"" films that Conservation International launched with MAL\\FOR GOOD in 2014, and whose tag line, ""Nature doesn't need people. People need nature,"" drives home the point that saving nature is really about saving ourselves. Clear Channel is lending its support to the campaign by donating advertising space on digital screens across its markets, in Europe, the Americas and Asia. This global pro-bono OOH campaign builds on Clear Channel's commitment to using OOH's strengths, its mass reach and ability to build brand fame, to give a voice to one of today's most pressing issues - climate change. ""At Clear Channel, our ambition is to create a better world through the ways in which we use our out of home advertising platform,"" William Eccleshare, CEO of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, said in the release. ""This can only be achieved if we protect the future first. We're playing our part in two vital ways: first, by using the power of our medium to extend the reach and facilitate debate on important issues that often don't get the attention they deserve. This includes our pro-bono campaign with Conservation International which we're incredibly proud to be helping amplify so that people worldwide, and not just the delegates of COP26 , are invited to the conversation. ""Second, we're making tangible changes to how we operate as a business to reduce our environmental impact.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA144","The world's poorest have the strongest resilience, yet their voices remain unheard","Climate Home News","Newstex Blogs ","Apr 01, 2022( Climate Home News: HYPERLINK http://www.climatechangenews.com http://www.climatechangenews.com Historically, the UN's Conferences of the Parties (Cops) on climate change have been overwhelmingly focused on cutting emissions, but Cop26 felt different. As Cop president, the UK made adaptation a priority, establishing a two-year Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on a global adaptation goal and a target to balance adaptation financing with mitigation financing by 2025. There was substantial participation on behalf of the adaptation community, albeit largely online and outside the negotiating rooms. These conversations have carried on, for example at this week's online Gobeshona Global Conference, creating opportunities to make progress before Cop27 in Egypt. The rising significance of adaptation is underpinned by one key fact: the impacts of climate change are here now and set to escalate. However, despite feeling hopeful at times, the most recent climate negotiations still failed to match words about loss and damage, resilience, and adaptation with actions to actually protect the most affected people and areas. After US fails to pay its debt, UN's flagship climate fund warns of austerity[1] While negotiators have only belatedly started thinking about how best to create the conditions to build greater climate resilience, communities, including our own, have already been doing this for decades. In Bangladesh, we have been forced to build our resilience by enduring yearly cyclones among other natural disasters and to develop survival techniques like growing vegetables on water, rainwater harvesting, water ambulances, floating schools, and procedures for early warning and evacuation. Similarly, shack-dwellers globally have learned to build and rebuild their homes in the face of climate disasters. For many the question is not whether the roof over their heads will blow away, but rather when, and how often. They must also ensure that practical, local techniques and indigenous practices are coupled with external intervention. With only 10% of climate finance currently supporting locally-led adaptation, and just 2% reaching the most affected communities, we remain a long way from giving those experiencing the most significant climate-related disruption what they need. Yet, the voices of those with the most knowledge to contribute to the discussion on adaptation and resilience continue to be pushed to the fringes of the Cop process and often go unheard worldwide. How can negotiations about the future remain inaccessible to those with the biggest stake? A summit cannot truly deliver positive outcomes for youth, women, and indigenous people without their meaningful participation, yet at Cop26 they were outside being pushed back by police while big corporations were in the delegations. Cop26 might have had a very different result. But the UN's daily subsistence allowance for delegates from poorer countries is provided only until the official final day of negotiations, forcing many to leave before talks conclude. Covid-19 further compounds the inaccessibility of climate talks for people from the global south: most of our colleagues have yet to be vaccinated and none of us could afford to be stuck for weeks if we test positive at a conference. Canadian ex-minister Catherine McKenna named to head UN greenwash watchdog[3] While the media may have labelled Cop26 'the most inclusive Cop yet', that does not mean it was meaningfully inclusive. Recent reports[4] of Egyptian hotels raising their prices for Cop27 suggest the same mistakes risk being repeated. Finally, the lack of progress since Cop26 indicates still too little sense of urgency. The latest IPCC report[5] reinforced the need for urgent, transformative adaptive action, yet Cop26 concluded with more delay, more long-term targets, and more climate finance directed towards mitigation than adaptation efforts. We - the global south - have been forced into adapting now, not in a year or two. Delays of even one year mean more people lose their homes and livelihoods, fewer children go to school and more girls end up in child marriage. If there is one thing Covid-19 has demonstrated, it is that the world is capable of rapid and widespread change in the face of a crisis and that solutions start with the community. If we take this approach with climate change, we might just start moving forwards.

Markey: Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, released the following statement as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) concludes today after 12 days of international climate negotiations. "" COP26 COP26 agreement for the first time takes historic steps to phase out fossil fuels. I am pleased that President Biden has made historic pledges to double the United States investment in climate financing and solidified international commitments to cut methane emissions by 2030. I welcome the joint commitment from the United States and China to cooperate on efforts to combat climate change, and I look forward to our work together to enact ambitious initiatives to limit and reduce emissions. Climate commitments are a powerful tool of diplomacy. Yet, it is not enough simply to take these important steps; business as usual and the status quo are death sentences. We must push climate action by leaps and bounds. That comes from making climate central to all policymaking domestically, promoting justice for those bearing the brunt of this crisis and ensuring polluters pay, and leading by example with ambition, intersectionality, and conviction."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA146","COP26: Glasgow Talks Enter Decisive Phase","November 8, 2021 Monday","International Oil Daily","The COP26 talks in Scotland moved into a critical final phase on Monday, involving the resolution of differences that technical negotiators were unable to make progress on and decisions about the content of a potential ""Glasgow Declaration."" Issues on the table include the thorny topic of climate finance for developing countries and some final details of the rule book for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, such as Article 6 on carbon trading as well as important rules in the area of accounting and transparency. Glasgow Declaration Ministers from around the world will be asked to consider a ""cover text"" or COP summary declaration proposed by the UK that sets out the need for strong climate action while attempting to highlight some of the progress made so far. That progress includes new announcements and initiatives at COP26 in areas such as deforestation, methane emissions and limiting financing for fossil fuel projects. Many of these initiatives are not currently incorporated in countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs), but they will be crucial to deciding whether the summit can be called a success \'e2\€ even though they fall short of the measures needed to keep global warming below 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Reaching agreement on the cover text could prove challenging. Greenpeace, for example, has accused Saudi Arabia of blocking progress on this top line message, which focuses on accelerating action to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 to keep hopes of 1.5\'c2\'b0C alive. ""There are things in there that various countries hate and various countries like,"" said Jennifer Allen of the International Institute for Sustainable Development. Scaling Up Finance Money is another sticking point. Developing countries are looking for clarity on climate finance after 2025, when the current (unfulfilled) pledge by developed countries to provide $100 billion per year expires. As well as wanting the financing commitment to be scaled up significantly, developing countries are also calling for funds to be made more accessible, with many of them finding it difficult to get their hands on public or private funding. In a commentary released on Monday, investment group BlackRock noted that the high-risk nature of emerging markets is a ""major barrier for private capital."" This suggests that the only way to mobilize private capital at the scale and pace needed is for governments that can afford to do so to provide support to absorb some of the potential losses on private investment in developing countries. Article 6 Although technical negotiation on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement ended on Saturday with parties still divided on some key issues, there's still optimism that agreement can be reached this week on rules for carbon markets. The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) pointed to some incremental progress in the negotiating text, but said there's still a long way to go. ""Since nearly 90% of the updated NDCs show interest in utilizing the capabilities of Article 6 to deliver individual parties' climate ambitions, it's vital that COP26 finalizes this last part of the Paris Rulebook,"" IETA said. Climate activists, however, are urging negotiators to reject carbon trading measures. Greenpeace Executive Director Jennifer Morgan told a COP26 side-event that allowing companies to scale up the use of offsets rather than cutting their own emissions in pursuit of net-zero emissions goals would fatally undermine any hope of keeping 1.5\'c2\'b0C alive.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA147","Key business takeaways from the COP26 climate summit","December 7, 2021","accountingtoday.com","Amid what is arguably one of the most crucial times in the fight against climate change, I had the incredible opportunity to join the conversation at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It was the first time EY had an active role at COP, and we stood proudly alongside business leaders, NGOs, activists, government officials and dignitaries. The steps taken at COP26 , such as the creation of the Glasgow Climate Pact, will continue the positive momentum for change. I'm hopeful that world leaders will take future actions to limit global warming to1.5 degrees Celsius. As primatologist Jane Goodall says, ""Hope is a call to action."" Reflecting on my time in Glasgow, two things are clear: Businesses want an active role in the climate solution, and tax policy will be on the agenda. To proactively participate in climate mitigation efforts, businesses need to understand the impacts of the Glasgow Climate Pact, seek a trusted advisor to explore the carbon credit market and learn about the carbon regimes across the globe. What's in the Glasgow Climate Pact? The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first United Nations agreement that mentions fossil fuels and asks countries to reduce their use of ""coal"" and ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies."" It asks countries to improve their 2030 national climate targets by the end of next year. The agreement establishes a dialogue for a new United Nations body to help ""vulnerable countries"" address the consequences of climate change. But what I'm most excited about is that the agreement establishes new rules for assessing carbon credits. This was a sticking point in the Paris Agreement, and now it appears to have been resolved by the Glasgow negotiations. What businesses should know about carbon credit rules\~ There was substantial progress at COP26 to standardize a carbon credit market as part of theinternational carbon-tradingagreement. Under the revisedArticle 6of the Paris Agreement, the global carbon credit agreement establishes the rules around a carbon marketplace. The agreement is intended to lead to more carbon trading and renewable energy investment, and it establishes new, clearer accounting guidance for emissions trades between countries. This ""integrity framework,"" as it's being called, could result in an abundance of investments for renewable energy projects and environmental protection efforts. It could also prevent potential corporate ""greenwashing"" by establishing a more robust set of standards and accounting for carbon credits, and provide needed tools for a robust and accountable carbon market. Companies should prepare for a new carbon credit accounting and market to be established. That could impact the way they offset residual emissions. Governments need to take policy steps to implement a carbon credit market. It's prudent for businesses to partner with advisors to understand who the governing body will be and how the marketplace will be moderated. These climate-focused policies can have global and local economic impacts while also creating new investment opportunities and potential risks. Keeping pace with carbon regimes Staying on top of theevolving sustainability policy landscapeis critical for businesses that wish to take action on climate change and prepare for policy-related initiatives. Businesses need to evaluate the physical, market and regulatory impacts of climate change. Examining work practices and prioritizing long-term value and value-led sustainability are essential. Organizations are being asked to disclose their environmental, social and governance efforts. Tax departments need to be at the table when discussing longer-term strategies, since they play a key role in managing the obligations, risks and impact that increased environmental regulations introduce. Now more than ever, companies need assistance in building, implementing and reporting on global, enterprise-wide strategies that address the climate emergency. One tool that could be helpful in a business's climate change journey is ourEY Climate Cash and Tax Barometer. It reviews public and private spending to address climate change and includes interviews with sustainability officers so that others can learn best practices. To truly make their business stand out in 2022 and beyond, it's imperative that leaders embed these considerations into their mission and overall strategy. I am personally committed to the fight against climate change. And I am proud to work for an organization that is dedicated to providing the highest-level, comprehensive assistance to our clients to develop, implement, evaluate and report the strategies, methodologies, action plans and tools that are designed to reduce their carbon footprints. My hope is that COP26 will encourage more businesses to make climate change a priority so that, together, we can create a better, more sustainable working world. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA148","COP26: How Significant Is the Glasgow Pact?","November 15, 2021 Monday","International Oil Daily","The outcome of the COP26 UN climate talks is best described as mixed. Did it deliver momentum? Undoubtedly. Urgency? Possibly. Substantive progress? Less so. Finance was also largely a fail, and the Glasgow Climate Pact still leaves a long way to go to close the gap to the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. But beyond the details of what was agreed in the COP26 text, the worldwide media coverage around the event shows that the climate issue is now more front and central than ever before. Fossil Fuels It was significant that coal got its first-ever mention in an official Conference of the Parties (COP) conclusion, and fossil fuel subsidies were referred to for the first time since the 1997 Kyoto protocol, even if the language in the final text was watered down. Opposition to this was led by Australia and Saudi Arabia, while the language was strongly supported by the EU and US, among others. It was an achievement for negotiators that it survived at all, but for now, its main importance is more symbolic than practical. The pledge on coal and subsidies seems unlikely to have an immediate impact, and does not really go beyond anything countries had already promised to do. Oil and Gas Again, the impact of the Glasgow agreement will likely be more symbolic than practical, in the near term at least. That\'e2\€  s not to say it doesn\'e2\€  t matter. Perceptions can be very important, and it\'e2\€  s fair to say that this was not the best COP for the oil and gas industry's image. Activists repeatedly called out the number of \'e2\€  fossil fuel lobbyists\'e2\€ present in the halls at Glasgow. Many of these were on national delegations, and there\'e2\€  s nothing necessarily untoward about that. Likewise, it was natural for Saudi Arabia, Australia and other producers to defend their national interests. Nonetheless, a growing negative perception of the industry was evident \'e2\€ with potential implications for the interests of international oil companies (IOCs), in particular. Their greater visibility and exposure to pressure in developed countries provides an easier target for activists. Article 6 An agreement on Article 6 \'e2\€ the long-stalled clause on carbon trading from the Paris Agreement \'e2\€ represents something of a win for IOCs. This was welcomed by the International Emissions Trading Association \'e2\€ which includes oil companies among its members, has an energetic presence at these events, and has acted as a longtime champion of Article 6. Ultimately, Article 6 could prove to be Glasgow\'e2\€  s most enduring legacy. It will set up a new framework for carbon markets, and potentially provide greater legitimacy for offsets. That seems to pass some climate campaigners' sniff tests too, on things like double counting, at least on first impression. Was It a Success? The dust has barely settled and much analysis will come in the coming days. As the COP26 halls emptied, many delegates were to be found crowded in long queues at Glasgow airport. And as news of the deal being struck began to filter through on Saturday night, general sentiment seemed to be that on the whole Glasgow was a modest success. But scientists are adamant that the world still needs to do much more to have any hope of keeping the 1.5\'c2\'b0C target alive. Many climate campaigners called Glasgow a failure, while signaling a determination to keep applying pressure to boost momentum. What Next? The coming year will likely see plenty of new policies and action based on the pledges and initiatives that emerged from COP26 . This will support efforts to raise ambitions in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) \'e2\€ countries' pledges for climate action under the Paris framework \'e2\€ for the next COP in a year\'e2\€  s time in Egypt. With campaigners determined to step up pressure too, more legal cases against oil companies could also result. Activists see the courts as a key battleground \'e2\€ just as they have scored successes in corporate boardrooms and financial institutions. On a broader level, COP26 served to advance conversations about climate and the energy transition, and broadened them in wider society. Final Thoughts COP26 was never going to solve the climate crisis. Nor was it going to be clearly a success or failure \'e2\€ with the outcome instead lying on a spectrum between the two, determined by the sum of agreements and setbacks at the event and on its sidelines. The Glasgow meeting did show that the world can come together in agreement, even if it represented a lowest common denominator. This will continue to be reviewed and built on, which essentially was the Paris Agreement's intention. Ronan Kavanagh \"

Joining CEO Ellie Cohen in Glasgow were long-time The Climate Center supporter Alex Gilchrist and chair of our Board of Directors Susan Thomas. While the negotiations between world leaders at COP26 yielded mixed results and few firm commitments, there was a lot to learn behind the scenes in Glasgow. I sat down recently with Alex and Susan to discuss their experiences. Q: Let's start on a positive note. What are you most hopeful about coming out of COP26 ? Susan: What is amazing about these convenings is that 200 countries come together and organizations like us get to see what's happening. What was happening outside is as important as what's going on inside. I think a ton of good work is being done. Q: At the same time, there's been a lot of criticism in the media that COP26 did not achieve enough. What's your take? Alex: Failure is what sells papers. Am I disappointed? Sure I am. But I don't compare it to past COPs and there's plenty to be hopeful about. One of the underlying themes was cooperation and collaboration. Susan: I've seen the negative press and they're not wrong. It [ COP26 ] fell far short of expectations of people attending and far short of what's needed. But there's no other organization in the world other than the United Nations that can convene 200 countries to come together for two weeks to try to advance commitments on climate change. What that means, though, is that any agreement that comes out of the conference is going to be a compromise document. Q: Focusing on California, Governor Newsom did not make the trip to Glasgow but Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon was there. He said during the conference that California is not leading on climate anymore. What's your response? Alex: I like that he's rattling cages. Go and encourage the masses to do better. It's great. Very motivational. Susan: California is no longer a leader in climate change policy. This is very distressing to a number of officials in the state legislature, and it should be. We are the fifth-largest economy in the world and we have outsized influence, so for us not to be lagging behind is unconscionable. I do feel hope that our current legislators can do more, but the oil and gas lobby is very powerful in California. We all need to hold elected officials accountable for their action or inaction on climate. Q: How did being at COP26 change the way you think about The Climate Center's work and the Climate-Safe California campaign? Alex: It [Climate-Safe California] goes past where the groupthink is. We have to go past carbon neutral to net negative emissions. I think it's a very comprehensive approach and I like the fact that it's aggressive. A lot of people are missing the ability to use natural lands to sequester carbon. I think it's absolutely the right approach. Susan: I think what we're doing at The Climate Center to affect state policy is really important and necessary. The fundamental strategy is the right thing to do because it's the fastest way to affect change. We're very focused. Legislation is the fastest way to change behavior and that's our thing. Q: How has your time in Glasgow changed the way you see yourself within the climate movement? Alex: I stopped seeing myself as just part of the masses in the protest movement. I'll continue to protest, but I'm going to educate myself further. I learned what I didn't know in Glasgow. Now I need to be more outspoken in my circles. As a consumer, when I walk into a business, I'll ask about their supply chain to be sure it's carbon neutral. I'm part of a faith community with more than 200 members. There's a spiritual dimension to this. We want to care for the planet that we all live on. It is our home and nurtures all of us in so many ways. Forty percent of the United States is still anchored to a faith community, so it's a big chunk of us who can have influence. Susan: COP26 Q: What about COP26 or anything you learned at the conference surprised you? Alex: As far as £ha' moments, the natural world's role in sequestering carbon is what surprised me most. Of course, we know the ocean is a carbon sink, but things like peatlands. I happen to enjoy whiskey every now and again and of course, whiskey is flavored with peat. I wondered what the difference is between peatlands and wetlands. It turns out there's a huge difference and peatlands are actually more important for sequestering carbon. That was hugely educational for me. Susan: Being there energized me to make sure that I enlist people to get involved. I sent a lot of info back to people I know. That kind of energy is what I came away with -- not just a base of knowledge, but passion. Susan: There were NGOs and university students there every day who, in real-time with the simplest of equipment, were reporting on the conference. This helps with accountability. Anyone can document climate change and voice opinions. I found that really inspirational. Artists and filmmakers with the barest of equipment can talk about climate. It doesn't actually take that much to do this! [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7702160 MSTRUCK \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA153","Climate Action Pretense At COP26 \u8211  OpEd","November 18, 2021 Thursday","Eurasia Review","Joe Biden's presence at COP26 was a photo opportunity giving the impression that he is fighting the climate crisis. But the U.S. and other governments continue carbon production while pretending to take action and ignore the needs of the Global South who suffer at the hands of the rich nations The 26th Conference of the Parties, COP26 , climate summit ended with its president fighting back tears. Alok Sharma came to Glasgow, Scotland hoping for an agreement to end the extraction of coal. Instead he said this, ""I apologize for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry."" The international climate conferences are a perennial disappointment to anyone who understands the depth of the world wide catastrophe. Every year the rich capitalist nations find a way to undermine the process and consign millions of people to misery and devastation. Activists from all over the world gather in an effort to have an impact on the process, but they are literally outnumbered by fossil fuel lobbyists who always get what they want. This conference ended with an agreement to ""phase down"" the use of coal instead of phasing it out altogether. Phasing down is deliberately ambiguous and makes a mockery of the 2015 Paris meeting which ended with an agreement to allow a temperature increase of no more than 1.5 C. The fact that climate agreements allow world temperatures to rise is but one indication that the process falls far short from what the world needs. Yet the seemingly small 1.5 C will have devastating consequences, with droughts and storms bringing catastrophe to millions of people. The can is always kicked down the road and the final agreement is a sham. It doesn't matter if democrats show up at COP26 if they refuse to respond to elephants in the room. The United States military is the world's biggest polluter but its carbon production, and that of other nations' forces, are exempt from climate goals. When a journalist asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders about military spending and its role in climate change, it was clear they had never considered the issue at all. They were shocked to be asked a question which showed a direct relationship between their actions and global warming and then responded with nonsense. They said the military, which contributes to climate change, needs money to respond to the climate change it causes by its very existence. Why does it matter that George W. Bush and Donald Trump withdrew from previous climate agreements if democrats follow in their footsteps and ignore even the flimsy goals it asked the U.S. to meet? Joe Biden appeared in Glasgow but no one should be impressed. Like his predecessors he has opened public lands to oil drilling. Keeping temperature rise to 1.5 C requires that carbon emissions be cut in half. If the United States were serious there would be no fossil fuel extraction on public lands. It would have to end altogether. The U.S. is not the only nation keeping the status quo as the world heads toward a cliff. Brazil and Indonesia continue massive deforestation for logging and cash crop production but claim they will adhere to the agreement requiring the practice to end by 2030. Apparently they plan to destroy all of their forests before that time and then pat themselves on the back because they are no longer killing trees. India insisted on watering the coal extraction language, but if other nations had been serious they would have spoken up and demanded an end to the world wide coal industry. India agreed to be the bad cop in this story. The G20 nations have subsidized fossil fuel production to the tune of $3 trillion just since 2015. Clearly the U.S. is not alone in its subterfuge. Meanwhile the need to compensate the Global South for environmental damage is placed on the back burner of priorities. In 2009 rich nations promised to pay $100 billion per year for five years beginning in 2020. There is no mechanism to do this and the final COP26 agreement only includes a promise to continue discussing a problem which is already clearly understood. The movement needed to fight for climate justice must be massive and international in scope. The first order of business is to understand the manipulations and duplicity that COP26 and prior agreements have engendered. Kyoto, Paris and now Glasgow are not the saviors they pretended to be. They are in fact the obstacles. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA154","OUR PLANET IS ON THE TABLE AT COP26","November 1, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Elders: As world leaders gather in Glasgow for the most important climate summit of the decade, Ricardo Lagos reflects on what is at stake, and reiterates The Elders' calls for ambitious leadership at COP26 . Right now, world leaders, civil society and business representatives are gathered in Glasgow for COP26 As Elders, we are guided by the vision of Nelson Mandela: to build a better world for all. The climate crisis is now threatening that world and hitting hardest those most vulnerable and those who have done the least to put us in this increasingly desperate situation. Leaders need to make concrete plans at COP26 With every new scientific report, the signs are more alarming. To limit global warming to 1.5C, we need concrete plans to halve emissions by 2030 and thus reach a carbon-neutral world by 2050, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This will be a challenge at COP26 and require major political efforts, particularly from the leaders of the major emitting countries. Our Chair Mary Robinson is present in Glasgow making the case for climate justice, and I encourage you to follow The Elders on social media for real-time updates on our activities. On behalf of The Elders, she will push for bold leadership to avert catastrophe, protect the vulnerable and build climate resilience. As former world leaders, we Elders are hopeful this can be achieved. But hope alone is not enough hope needs to be backed by decisive action. The Elders call on all leaders to put aside their political differences and to act now in the interests of our common humanity. I am pleased that climate change has become a mainstream issue, warranting the attention of leaders worldwide. While I welcome the increased focus on tackling the climate crisis, heightened by youth activism and civil society's efforts, the rest of the world does not stop even during the most important climate summit of this decade. Ethical leadership: vital to ensure a safe future Ethical leadership, at COP26 and beyond, is not just the right thing to do, it is the only viable option to ensure a safe, fair and healthy future for all. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA155","Preliminary Reflections on COP26 and the Glasgow Climate Pact, Part 2","ABlawg","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 17, 2021( ABlawg: http://ablawg.ca http://ablawg.ca Delivered by Newstex) By: David V. Wright[1] PDF Version:Preliminary Reflections on COP26 Matter Commented On: COP26 [3] (Twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the Glasgow Climate Pact[4] (Decision -/CMA.3) Developments in UNFCCC & Paris Agreement Implementation This post is Part 2 of two posts presenting preliminary reflections soon after the conclusion of COP26 in Glasgow. In this part, I present and briefly discuss notable developments (or lack of) within the formal negotiations process with respect to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). A key objective for this particular conference was to finalize the rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement (see this helpful background document[5] on the Paris Agreement and rulebook). This did indeed happen, and most would agree that this constitutes a success even if there is discontent with some of the final features. It is a particularly significant step forward as there was a risk that Parties would not reach an agreement on the rulebook entirely, resulting in further delay in implementation (on top of losing a year due to a pandemic-induced postponement last year) and loss of confidence in the basic structure and approach of the Paris Agreement. The following discusses several of the notable developments on the rulebook front, as well as several other (but not all) matters. Mitigation Ambition Earlier this year, well before COP26 but formally within the ongoing Paris Agreement process to raise ambition in parties' respective 'Nationally Determined Contributions' to reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, Canada announced an updated emission reduction target[6] of 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030. There was worry in the lead-up to COP26 that too few parties had taken a similar step. That amplified long-standing concerns around the persistent 'emissions gap' between commitments under the Paris Agreement, most specifically to keep warming to 1.5 degrees, and actual measures that parties would take at the domestic level to implement Paris commitments (see this year's annual Emissions Gap Report[7] by the United Nations Environment Programme). Many were watching to see whether fresh rounds of higher ambition pledges before and during COP26 would add up to emission reductions in line with the 1.5-degree goal. In the end, that did not happen. However, during COP26 a number of parties did indeed announce more ambitious reductions commitments, and the Glasgow Climate Pact does reiterate the overarching goal of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels' (at 20). The Pact also recognizes the need for 'rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century' (at 22). Viewed at a high level, this was unofficially the 'Net-Zero COP', where much of the focus was on Parties making long-term commitments to net-zero emissions several decades from now. On that front, most developed countries have now committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, and other countries, including high-emitting states such as China, Brazil, Russia, and India, have also set a net-zero target, even though time horizons are further out. For example, India[8] committed to net-zero by 2070, China[9] by 2060, and Russia[10] also by 2060. To be clear, these announcements will not close the gap between Party commitments and the 1.5-degree objective, let alone the gap between party commitments and party action, sometimes referred to as the 'credibility gap[11].' As noted in a COP26 side event presentation[12] by authors of the 2021 Emissions Gap Report, if all Parties follow through on their most recent commitments, the world would still be on track to 1.8 degrees warming (see also this report[13] released partway through COP26 by Climate Action Tracker, which is more pessimistic). However, commitments announced at COP26 were steps in the right direction and the process remains open to parties increasing their ambition. On that specific point, the Glasgow Climate Pact 'requests' that Parties 'revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022' (at 29). This is primarily directed to Parties who did not submit such updated commitments at COP26 or in the lead-up to COP, and it is a significant acceleration beyond the five-year cycles agreed to in the Paris Agreement, which now seems too slow and too out of line with staying on a 1.5 degrees pathway. From a broader Paris Agreement implementation perspective, these are significant developments as Parties to the Paris Agreement essentially doubled down on the regime's international peer pressure, trust-based approach to compliance (also sometimes called a 'managerial model' for international treaty design - see detailed discussion here[14]). In practical terms, that approach means the more contact between parties the better, and commitments and interactions at COP26 suggest that parties are on-board with frequent contact and stock-taking with their peers. Put conversely, there is and will always be a risk that Parties stall or reduce their ambition in isolation, risking a breakdown of the Paris Agreement architecture. Finance The perennially contentious issue of financial assistance to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation activities was very much alive at COP26 . In a context where developed countries had fallen short on implementing finance commitments for many years, the latest episode has seen developed countries miss the annual $100 billion by 2020 that was pledged in Paris. As such, trust was low going into COP26 . Concern with this inadequacy is explicitly included in the Pact's final text (at 14) and in the long-term climate finance decision document (Decision -/CP.26[15] at 4). More notably, the final text 'urges' developed countries to at least double the funding to developing countries for adaptation (Pact at 18). Parties did not, however, reach an agreement on financing beyond 2025. As such, expect this aspect of the negotiations to be front and center in COP27 next year in Egypt. Loss and Damage Another long-standing contentious issue is how states most affected by climate change impacts will receive support from other states, particularly those countries with high historical and current emissions levels. As explained in this excellent overview video[16] by Lind Siegele, this dimension has been developing for decades, particularly through the persistence of small island developing states. In short, parties to the UNFCCC process have never reached an agreement on the thorny issues of responsibility for historical emissions and the flip side of that issue, liability for associated damages caused by those emissions. As previously quipped[17] by Professor Saleemul Huq, 'loss and damage'' has become a euphemism for 'liability and compensation.' In the COP26 COP26 . Though parties did take one more small step in further formalizing and flowing technical assistance under what is called the 'Santiago Network on Loss and Damage' (at 66 and 67), this is distinct and different from the 'Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility' that many parties were calling for. The latter is envisioned as a new funding mechanism for loss and damage, but after COP26 it remains non-existent. Instead, the Pact only '[d]ecides to establish the Glasgow Dialogue' (at 73). So the only commitment at the moment is to more dialogue. In short, though vocal throughout the COP26 , states most vulnerable to climate change impacts will be forced to pursue the issue in future negotiations, notwithstanding this being a multi-decade campaign in a context where impacts are intensifying. Article 6 Reaching agreement on the rules for implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement was one of the highest stakes issues at COP26 . Article 6, which has the somewhat uninformative title of 'Voluntary Cooperation', contains provisions that provide for states to use market mechanisms such as emissions trading and offsets to achieve emission reduction commitments. The logic here, notwithstanding caveats and nuances, is that these market mechanisms will assist Parties in reaching emissions reduction commitments in a cost-effective manner. However, Article 6 provisions contain 'constructive ambiguity' that left parties much more work to do, and left much potential for double-counting of emission reductions (see this explainer[18] for context). Specifically, parties needed to wrestle long-standing technical issues such as those pertaining to baselines (i.e. starting point for calculating what constitutes an avoided emission in the future), ghg accounting (e.g. no double-counting of emission credits), environmental integrity (i.e. reductions on paper are actually reductions in the atmosphere and do not unduly harm other elements of the environment) and continuation of existing emission reduction credits. Additionally, parties were under increasing pressure to include explicit consideration of human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples in an effort to ensure that emission-reducing projects are not at the expense of populations already most vulnerable to climate change impacts. In the end, Parties did indeed manage to finalize these rules at COP26 . Comprehensive coverage and analysis is beyond the scope of this post as complexities will take time to parse and understand; however, in short, the following are initial high-level takeaways. The focus here is on Articles 6.2 and 6.4, which are of the highest consequence. Rules of implementation are now in place for Article 6.2, which provides for Parties to use 'internationally transferred mitigation outcomes' (ITMOs) toward achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs - i.e. ghg emission reduction commitments). This is essentially a way for Parties' emissions trading systems to link and to do so within the Paris Agreement system, complete with ghg accounting requirements. In addition to detailed rules on calculating and reporting ITMOs, notable features in the final text include safeguards against double-counting and net increases in emissions (primarily implemented through what are called 'corresponding adjustments'), explicit requirements for Parties to ensure environmental integrity, and explicit requirements to consider and report on human rights, the rights of Indigenous peoples, gender equality, and intergenerational equity. The Article 6.2 guidance also strongly encourages Parties using ITMOs to 'contribute resources for adaptation' with particular attention to Parties that are most vulnerable to climate impacts; however, there is no 'share of proceeds' requirement for 6.2 as there now is for Article 6.4. Details are all set out exhaustively (and exhaustingly) in Decision -/CMA.3 - Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement[19]. Rules of implementation are now in place for Article 6.4, which provides for a new centralized UN mechanism that facilitates the trading of emission reduction credits generated by specific projects. This is the Paris Agreement's iteration of the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation market mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. Many of the Article 6.2 safeguards and requirements summarized above are also present in the 6.4 rules agreed to at COP26 (though there are fewer requirements for emission reductions that will not be used toward achieving an NDC), all of which is overseen by a Supervisory Body with formal membership rules and rules of procedure. Unlike 6.2, any transactions under the mechanism in 6.4 requires that a 'share of proceeds' of 5% go to vulnerable nations. Details are all set out exhaustively in Decision -/CMA.3 - Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement.[20] Phasing 'down' of Coal Throughout the final stages of COP26 there was tension regarding the text in the cover decision, particularly with respect to whether and how to include explicit reference to fossil fuels, and attention to coal specifically. In the end, this aspect survived text-level negotiations but it was significantly watered down through one small change. On the last day (actually the additional overtime day), in the very final hours of COP proceedings, India led a forceful and eventually successful push to change text referring to a 'phase-out' of unabated coal power to a 'phasedown' (at 36). While in the long term this may have minimal impact on emission reduction trajectories and the actual time horizons for complete phase-out of coal, particularly given that India, China, and other coal-dependent nations have pledged net-zero commitments later this century, it was significant at this COP in two ways. First, on the process front, this was a very late text change to a provision that had been on the table for days prior and there was no longer any time or opportunity for consultation on the change. Allowing this type of significant, extremely late intervention disrupts the existing process and norms of COP proceedings, and could set a destabilizing precedent from a negotiations process perspective into the future. What if many more Parties were to do similar in future COPs? Second, and further to the above point that the Paris Agreement is structured on international peer pressure and trust, this change is likely to have a demoralizing effect on Parties most vulnerable to climate change impacts, for whom the phasing out of coal represents a key part of avoiding the existential threats posed by climate change. Time will tell whether this text change has any material impact on achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, but an intuitive interpretation of this change suggests it envisions a slower and incomplete path away from coal-fired electricity generation. Having said this, the Pact does still have explicit reference to coal, and it did ultimately include reference to the 'phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies' (at 36) which represent the first-ever explicit reference to fossil fuels. As such, this will be viewed by many as a step forward, even if the relatively weak wording will be disappointing for many others. Concluding Reflections One need only look at the horrific extreme weather catastrophe unfolding in British Columbia at the moment to appreciate the importance of urgent, multilateral, global action to respond to the collective action problem that is climate change. Such action is particularly important from a nation like Canada who is a major current and historical ghg emitter that enjoys wealth accumulated through decades of disproportionate exploitation of the planet's atmospheric carrying capacity. If Canada doesn't do its fair share, no country can be expected to (see this helpful explainer[21] for context on this point). And if too few countries act, then the collapse of the Coquihalla, incineration of Lytton, Calgary flooding, and Fort McMurray wildfires will be dwarfed around the world for decades to come. This is not alarmism. It is reality, no matter how hard that is to fathom, especially in Alberta. In this context, the stakes were high for Canada and the rest of the world going into COP26 . From my perspective, and notwithstanding the reality that no Parties or observers are completely content with the final outcomes, COP26 represents a qualified success. The summit was never going to accomplish everything. Finalizing the rulebook, strengthening the system for increased ambition, concerted steps on emission reduction initiatives, open discussion about the phasing out of fossil fuels, and a flurry of net-zero commitments from major emitters are all steps in the right direction. While tenuous, most would agree that the outcomes of COP26 keep the goal of 1.5 degrees warming within reach, even if just barely. That is very significant. What's more, COP26 saw all parties meaningfully engage within the Paris Agreement paradigm, as opposed to stepping away in a fundamentally different or subversive direction. In this way, from my perspective COP26 had a net positive impact on trust in the system. And that is no small matter in a regime that has trust and international peer pressure at its core. However, shortfalls on financial assistance, unresolved issues on loss and damage, persisting ambition and credibility gaps, devilish market mechanism implementation details, and ever delicate trust in the process, especially from major emitting developing countries and the most vulnerable Parties, means that the work is far from over. The hard work is really just beginning, finally. Everywhere at the COP26 venue in Glasgow was signage with big block letters saying, 'The Time Is Now.' The time to act was actually decades ago. Now will have to do, but now will only do if all Parties to the Paris Agreement get moving quickly to make up for lost time and inaction. The Glasgow Climate Pact and COP26 outcomes are steps in the right direction, but the pace needs to quicken dramatically.

Now, you can probably tell from my accent that I'm ""from around here."" I was born and raised in the West of Scotland, in a town called Dumbarton on the banks of the Clyde. I still live there now, when I'm not carrying out my duties from the Woolsack in the House of Lords. Dumbarton is about 20 minutes' drive from here, or (much more appropriately for this audience at COP26 So, I'm proud to welcome you all to this part of the world, my home, for this crucial COP26 meeting. My family and I often visit this museum. In fact, two of my grandchildren are here today with me. I'm sure you'll agree that it's a truly inspiring place for our gathering. The exhibitions that surround us now are reminder of our amazing planet and all that is at stake during our discussions. It reminds us of the natural and technological precious assets that we could lose forever. It reminds us of the cultures that could be wiped away, if we don't take action. And it reminds us of the duty we have as parliamentarians in the battle against climate change. Even when the global economy shut down as a result of the pandemic, our emissions only dropped by 6%. This illustrates the enormity of the challenge ahead of us if we are to maintain the necessary pace for lasting change. So we have to find real, radical and alternative solutions to reduce the global temperatures, and that's the challenge we've got ahead of us. As parliamentarians we have a real responsibility. We have a duty to speak for all the people of this planet, including those whose voices are not always heard, and yet are the most affected. As Pope Francis has said: ""We have to realize that a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."" This brings me on to the reason why we are gathered in this room, which is to reflect on our roles and how we can make a difference. As we know, this COP26 summit only lasts 2 weeks. But when we depart and the cameras go away, what are the risks if the dialogue suddenly stops after that? Where, then, will these important conversations about the emergency that faces our planet, continue? It is, of course, in our Parliaments. It is in these institutions from which these issues can be debated, and more importantly, actioned, through legislation. Daniel Greenberg, a parliamentary lawyer, captured this idea very well when he recently said. I quote ""rhetoric is not always as empty as it may appear on the surface. In Government and Parliament, one sees all the time how apparently endless dialogue suddenly emerges into real world change."" He went on to give the example of the Parliamentary debates over the Good Friday Agreement, and how ultimately that dialogue directly led to peace for the people of Northern Ireland. The success of the Good Friday Agreement was down to many years of face-to-face engagement and dialogue which helped to foster and repair relationships. The lesson for us here is that to achieve our agreed climate goals, our engagement must continue beyond these two weeks. And so, such dialogue, the lifeblood of our Parliaments, can lead to change. As Lord Speaker, I am aware that the House of Lords plays an influential role on the climate change debate in this country. I count myself fortunate to be sharing the Chamber with some of the leading thinkers on climate change. The red benches of the House of Lords and the green benches of the House of Commons are well-known around the world, but I would contend the House of Lords is, in terms of our expertise and contribution in this area, impressively green! Let me give you just a few examples. In the House of Lords we have our own Committee on the Environment and Climate Change, set up this year, and chaired by Baroness Parminter. Its remit is to hold the Government to account on issues like biodiversity and ensure that climate change action is embedded into all areas of government policy. We have in our ranks the current Chairman of the Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben. As well as having the Peers for the Planet group, chaired by Baroness Hayman who do excellent work. Both Lord Stern and Astronomer Royal Lord Rees of Ludlow are renowned globally for their work on climate change and related fields. When the Environment Bill comes back to the Lords next week, we will see Green Peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb fighting for local support to our transition to a zero-carbon economy. You'll see the Duke of Wellington continuing his campaign for sewage-free rivers. And you'll see Baroness Hayman of Ullock fighting for cleaner air. These examples are just a few to demonstrate that The House of Lords is a place of dialogue, scrutiny and concrete action. So, I want to end by thanking you again for your participation, and most importantly your future action and commitment. Let's never forget the crucial role that Parliaments will play in the conversation on climate change long after COP26 has ended. And I hope that when my grandchildren, sat just here, return to this museum, in years to come, they know that their Grandfather and you, my colleagues chose to do the right thing for our planet using the important Parliamentary platform we have been given. Thank you."" \"

COP26 ). The event has been underway in Scotland since the end of October, wrapping up this week. However, while both leaders unveiled new, tougher commitments on climate, they held back from joining some of the more ambitious pledges unveiled at the summit ahead of talks officially drawing to a close. This includes the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which was launched with an aim to end oil and gas production globally. While the alliance does not include any major oil and gas producers, it has been joined by the State of California. Biden also came under fire from critics that do not believe he is going far enough with his climate-related commitments, including not joining in with a pledge to end coal mining. Trudeau, by contrast, announced that Canada would support the coal phase-out, with his office describing ending coal power emissions as ""one of the single most important steps the world must take in the fight against climate change"". Canadian commitments Additionally, Trudeau pledged to cap and reduce emissions from Canada's oil and gas industry to net zero by 2050. The move is in line with 2050 net-zero targets set by various Canadian energy companies, including an alliance of the country's top oil sands producers. ""Canada is the first major oil-producing country moving to capping and reducing pollution from the oil and gas sector to net zero by 2050,"" a statement from Trudeau's office said. ""To help do this at a pace and scale needed to achieve the shared goal of net zero by 2050, the government will set five-year targets, and will also ensure that the sector makes a meaningful contribution to meeting Canada's 2030 climate goals."" The statement added that the Canadian government was seeking the advice of the Net-Zero Advisory Body on how best to move forward with these plans. Separately, the government also committed to cutting subsidies to oil and gas companies for overseas operations by the end of 2022. A broader push to include a phase-out of all fossil fuel subsidies in the final COP26 deal appeared to be in the process of being watered down by the end of this week, however. Biden's challenge For Biden, a big challenge is reversing course from former US President Donald Trump, who did not make any moves to pursue decarbonisation during his time in office, and indeed withdrew his country from the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels. Biden was quick to bring the US back into the Paris Agreement, and has sought to reverse a number of Trump's other positions related to the environment and climate change. However, critics have said the Biden administration's rhetoric on the subject has yet to be matched with sufficient action. Additionally, concerns remain over a Republican president and Congress undoing Biden's moves at a future date. COP26 saw Biden proceed cautiously, though, with his administration declining to set an end date for the sale of gasoline and diesel cars, unlike the European Union, Canada and a number of other countries at the summit. This came on top of the US' absence from the pledge to end coal mining - which comes as no surprise given that resistance to any moves to further reduce coal output is strong in regions of the country that are major producers of the fuel. However, the US did unveil an unexpected agreement to deepen its co-operation with China on climate change issues over the next decade. The two countries' joint declaration said that they would work together to achieve the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming. However, China has refused to join the Global Methane Pledge - an initiative led by the US and EU that was first unveiled in September and formally launched last week at COP26 . Countries joining the pledge have committed to reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Over 100 countries have now signed up to the pledge. Biden told COP26 delegates that the US would also seek to become a ""net-zero emissions economy"" by no later than 2050. However, the country has a long way to go if it is to achieve this goal, or that of cutting emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, which Biden also reiterated. What next? In both Biden and Trudeau's cases, there is a risk that words will not necessarily be matched by actions over the coming years. Canada has already missed previous emissions targets, including falling short of its 2020 goal by around 99%. While Trudeau is increasingly taking a more aggressive approach, which will be aided by Canada's rising carbon tax, achieving even more ambitious emissions cuts than those that have already been missed poses a major challenge. Likewise\~for Biden, meeting both targets and more vaguely stated long-term aims looks difficult. The fact that the support of Democrats in Congress cannot be guaranteed depending on the regions and interests they represent further complicates the picture. \"

Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow: COP26 , new commitments made mean that we are heading toward closer to around 2 degrees. Glasgow was an important step in keeping open the possibility of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. ""Whether COP26 COP26 has provided the political signal, building blocks, and the solutions to do just that. ""The successful finalization of the guidelines to fully implement the Paris Agreement including in relation to transparency and carbon markets is a welcome achievement and lays a solid foundation to further raise climate ambition over time."" Statement of Nathaniel Keohane President, Center for Climate and Energy Solutions On the U.S. role at COP26 : ""The United States came to this conference needing to demonstrate renewed global leadership on climate. The importance of that role was on display in Glasgow, where American leadership helped secure a range of commitments including the Global Methane Pledge among more than 100 countries to cut emissions of methane by 30 percent by 2030, and where Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry's dogged diplomacy paid off in the US-China announcement as well as a strong 2030 target from India. ""But the most important test of U.S. leadership will be in Washington, DC. For America to regain the trust of the world on climate, and persuade others to follow its lead, President Biden and Congress must build on the important, but initial, down payment in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and show that we are serious about delivering on our commitments. That means passing the Build Back Better framework, with its $555 billion investment in climate, clean energy, and resilience an investment that will create good jobs throughout the country, supercharge America's competitiveness in the global clean energy economy, and demonstrate that the leadership we saw in Glasgow is backed up by action at home."" On Article 6 ""Importantly, negotiators also reached agreement on the so-called 'Paris rulebook,' including guidance on Article 6. In the Paris Agreement, Article 6 is the engine of international cooperation. It is what enables countries to work together to achieve faster, deeper cuts in emissions than they could on their own, while channeling finance to promote truly sustainable green growth in developing countries. But markets are only a force for good when there are guardrails in place to ensure environmental and social integrity. ""While the agreed Article 6 guidance is not perfect, it is strong on the critical issue of avoiding double-counting, and it gives countries the clarity and direction they need to begin working together to raise ambition. To ensure environmental integrity, countries should refuse to use pre-2020 credits from the Clean Development Mechanism to meet their NDCs instead focusing on new emissions reductions. Civil society will be watching.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA162","COP26 - Where to Go From Here","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 02, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com Like so many others in the wake of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (or COP26 as we know it), I'm doing my best to digest the outcomes. The 'should haves' and'could haves'need to be put on hold for now, in favour of facing the future head-on and focusing on what we can do to mitigate further damage to the planet. I attended COP26 On the one hand, I'm wondering if reversibility is even a realistic goal. On the other, can we adopt a robust adaptability approach in time? The largest political gathering ever held in the UK overran, as predicted, until an agreement was finally thrashed out on the table. The new Glasgow Climate Pact is born out of the COP26 climate summit, a universal agreement that while 1.5C is the required goal, reaching it will vary in importance from nation to nation. Still, it did not come without controversy. China and India's decision to wade in at the last second, watering down the term 'phase-outs' to a weaker sounding and more ambiguous 'phase down' when talking about 'unabated' coal, left most feeling discouraged. And somehow, animal agriculture wasn't given a high status as a topic for discussion despite the global food system being responsible for nearly a third of emissions. But it isn't all doom and gloom. Even in the face of China and India's request for a last-minute change and lack of solid progress surrounding climate finance and adaptation, loss and damage, 190 nations have supported the Glasgow Climate Pact. Moreover, we should be immensely proud of what has been achieved by Alok Sharma ( COP26 president) and his team. Sharma had to put his tears, frustrations and deep sorrow by the wayside over the negotiation outcome for the unfortunate new phrasing for coal power, to ensure the deal was protected with the developing countries and vulnerable island nations in mind. The new pact requests that countries update their current national plans to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, known as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), to the Paris Agreement by COP27, hosted in Egypt next year. Only India managed to produce a new NDC at the talks, but a new roadmap was designed for NDC revisions which I hope will hasten the pace somewhat. Time will tell. The Glasgow Climate Pact has called for countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance to developing nations. This is a historic commitment, but countries now need to delve deeper into their pockets to support the climate crisis already devastating many countries. Adaptation strategies to reduce the negative impact of climate change, whether they are reactive or anticipatory, will need to ensure nobody is abandoned and everyone will benefit from a climate-resilient future. So now, we must all collectively work towards the future and remain optimistic. Progress is being made - albeit slowly - towards COP27, which I hope will bring a little less drama and a lot more stability.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA163","What the world is saying about Cop26","The Week UK","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 27, 2021( The Week UK: HYPERLINK http://www.theweek.co.uk http://www.theweek.co.uk Boris Johnson has admitted he is 'very worried' that Cop26 'might go wrong' as the clock ticks down until the UK-hosted climate summit gets under way. Answering questions from schoolchildren at a specialDowning Street news conference[1] this week, the prime minister said it would be'touch and go' whether world leaders could achieve the necessary agreements to protect the planet. But he added: 'I think it can be done.' Here is what the rest of the world is saying. Scottish setting 'It was once dubbed Europe's murder capital, but this year it was voted the world's friendliest city,' saidAl Jazeera[2]. Glasgow, 'home to one of the most bitter football rivalries', has rarely lacked drama and from Sunday will 'take centre stage as the host of a highly anticipated summit seen by many as the last chance to avert a global climate catastrophe'. The news site, which is part-fundedby the Qatari government, predicted that this 'city of contrasts' will either be 'hailed as the scene of a spectacular success or lamented as the place where dreams of a better tomorrow were extinguished'. Temperature talk The activists and delegates heading to the Scottish city from across the world 'have reason to be anxious', wrote climate campaigner Eleanor Salter inThe New York Times[3]. The summit represents 'perhaps one of the world's last chances' to limit the rise in global average temperature to less than 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Johnson has generally displayed 'bombastic optimism' that other countries will step up, said Salter, but Britain is 'far from a climate hero'.A 'glance' behind Johnson's speeches 'reveals hypocrisy everywhere'. Cop26 , she continued. And ultimately, 'warm words won't stop a warming world'. Pressing agendas The negotiations £re likely to be fraught', saidFrance24[4]. The 'rulebook' on how climate goals are measured is yet to be finalised, 'long-festering disputes' over the governance of carbon markets persist, and poorer nations are calling on wealthier ones to make good on funding promises. Wealthy nations have yet to meet a target set at Cop15toprovide $100bn a year in funding to help developing nations tackle the front-line effects of global warming. The UK government's newly publishedClimate Finance Delivery Plan[5]said the goal is unlikely to be achieved until 2023. In an article for the Financial Times[6], the Democratic Republic of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi wrote that Africa is 'tired of waiting' for financial support and 'must be a priority' at Cop26 . The continent 'contributes so little global warming' yet faces £ cruel fate', said Tshisekedi, who is chair of the African Union. A 'clear plan' is needed on how resources to fight climate change will be deployed, he argued, adding: 'It is time for Africa to be compensated- for the good of the continent and the planet. We have waited long enough.' Contentious conversations Cop26 President Alok Sharma has admitted that the absence of some leading global figures will be a stumbling block in achieving the summit goals. The no-shows will include Vladimir Putin, owing to the coronavirus situation in Russia. However, Kremlin-owned news agencyTASS[7]said that the Russian president and Johnson haddiscussed 'climate problems' together 'in detail' this week, in their first joint telephone call since May last year. The British leader 'welcomed' Russia's commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2060, the agency added - although this target date is a decade later that that set by most other developed nations. Although the 'leaders of most of the world's biggest greenhouse emitters will gather in Scotland', said The Japan Times[8], 'the man running the biggest of them all', China's President Xi Jinping, also 'likely won't be there'. Ultimately, 'if the rich world fails to demonstrate solidarity and leadership, it will have no moral standing to criticise China', wrote Sam Geall, a specialist in Chinese climate policy and politics,inThe Sydney Morning Herald[9]. Eyes will also be on other major fossil fuel emitters including Australia. The country's Prime MinisterScott Morrison has this week adopted the 2050 target, but 'sadly', that's where the 'good news begins and ends', said The Guardian Australia[10]columnist Katherine Murphy. No strategy or legislation for achieving this goal has been put forward by Morrison so far, Murphy noted. In fact, the 'pre-Glasgow crescendo' has left us with a so-called new plan that is simply 'the status quo' served up with 'some new speculative graphs'. Covid complications The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the summit by a year and could yet cause further disruption. A cartoon by Liu Rui in China'sGlobal Times[11]English-language paper portrays theUK as a 'dangerous climate' for the summit, as Britain battles one of the highest case rates in western Europe[12]. The UK has made coronavirus vaccines available to Cop26 delegates, but in an article forThe Guardian[13], an unnamed negotiator from a developing nation wrote that 'I'm not sure this will be enough to enable the participation we need to see' from NGOs and observers in such countries. These delegates 'play a very important role at Cop, by creating pressure and a sense of urgency', said the insider, but the expense of hotel quarantines for visitors from red-list countries, as well as accommodation costs in Glasgow during the conference[14], might prove prohibitive. Kenyan climate campaigner Kevin Mtai also emphasised the importance of representatives from 'the most affected areas' speaking at Cop26 . 'It's very important for people from the global south to speak for themselves, not other parts of the globe to speak on their behalf,' he told the BBC[15]. Words of advice Cop26 organisers might learn a thing or two from previous UNsummit organisers such as Costa Rican diplomat ChristianaFigueres, who helped run Cop21, at which the history-making 2015 climate agreement was signed. Figueres told The Guardian's Today in Focus[16] podcast that to'survive' these conferences takes 'quite a bit'. 'You have to be able to have about 1,323 balls in the air at the same time,' she said. Cop26 chief Sharma would be wise to mull over the seating plan, she warned, because the conference rooms should be arranged 'to have the best chances of success for each individual piece of the negotiations'. Figueres explained: 'If you walk into a room that has been set up with a round table, that immediately gives you one impression of the conversation.' On the other hand, £ square, or even worse, a rectangular table gives you a very different impression'. Protecting high-profile delegates also poses challenges. A Spanish official involved in organising the Cop25 summit in Madrid two years ago told Politico[17] that Greta Thunberg's security had been a 'true nightmare scenario'. The Swedish climate activist's team 'refused to agree to an itinerary so we could protect her' from the crowds who followed 'everywhere she went', the unnamed official claimed. Thunberg has confirmed that she will be taking part in a climate strike in Glasgow on 5 November. She told the BBC that she hoped world leaders would 'be honest' at Cop26 and address 'how you have been failing, how you're still failing us'. 'In my view,' she said, 'success would be that people finally start to realise the urgency of the situation and realise that we are facing an existential crisis, and that we are going to need big changes, that we're going to need to uproot the system.'

EXPERT ADVISORY Follow the U-M team's COP26 updates on Twitter at @ClimateBlue Thirteen University of Michigan graduate students and their faculty adviser are attending the two-week COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. The students will observe the negotiations, attend side events and interact with various experts. U-M has sent student delegations to U.N. climate change conferences since 2009. Lauren Balotin is a dual-degree master's student at the School of Public Health and the School for Environment and Sustainability. She has interned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in its Adaptation division, and she worked with the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners on its forthcoming climate action plan. Balotin also works with peers on a climate-focused podcast called ""AmpliFIRE: Raising Voices Against Rising Temperatures."" Her academic interests focus on helping communities adapt to the health impacts of climate change. ""Climate change is one of the biggest public health crises of our generation. It will have direct impacts on physical health conditions, such as heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases, as well as mental and psychosocial health,"" she said. ""At the same time, it could threaten health care infrastructure and increase stress on health systems. These are very real implications for health and health equity, and we need to be prepared to adapt. ""I first attended the U.N. climate negotiations at COP23, just a few months after the U.S. announced that it would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. It was clear that this decision affected the trajectory of the negotiations, as other parties reacted and subnational U.S. leaders had to step up in the absence of a national climate commitment. A lot has changed now that the U.S. is back in the Paris Agreement, and I'm excited to see how this contributes to momentum for climate action.""

""While I'm convinced nuclear energy has a crucial role to play in decarbonizing our energy grids, I recognize that technological solutions are only part of the battle that remains,"" she said. ""Even with all of the work that activists have done to convince the world that a climate crisis exists, we need smart public policy options from all nations to address climate change and make sure that the world is habitable for everyone. ""This is an exciting and crucial time to be fighting for climate change, as Congress is on the brink of spending billions of dollars to expand clean energy, and the White House is floating a carbon tax.

She is also the communication coordinator for the student-led club Climate Blue, which organizes the annual U-M delegation to the UNFCCC COP. ""Collectively as policymakers, leaders, scientists and changemakers, we must remember that the most vulnerable among us will be the most affected by climate change,"" she said. ""Moving forward with this knowledge, we must push for policies that protect these vulnerable populations to achieve an equitable and sustainable future. I am excited to see at COP26 how human-centered environmental policies such as justice, poverty alleviation, food security and gender are placed into the core of the climate commitments going forward. ""While climate action has increased in recent years, world leaders have been failing to keep up with the pressing demands. Urgent and rapid action is needed from world leaders to address the climate crisis, as the negative effects will be felt by the current generation of young people and generations to come.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA165","Activists march through campus as part of Bay Area COP26 March","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","Daily Californian: University of California - Berkeley","The Bay Area March for COP26 was held Nov. 6 in an effort to draw attention to COP26 , the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and address activist demands for the conference.\~ According to Nik Evasco, youth climate organizer and program manager for 350 Bay Area, a climate activism organization, their youth mobilization team led the organization of the march along with other environmental justice, youth-focused and UC Berkeley organizations. At its height, there were 450 people at the march, which was followed by a rally with speakers and performances where there were 100 people, according to Evasco. The march was initiated at Sproul Plaza where activists then walked through the south of campus, concluding at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, where the rally was held. ""For COP26 The Bay Area March for COP26 was one of the hundreds of youth marches happening around the world to support youth activists at the conference, Evasco added. The march's main aim was to focus on the need for these international climate change conferences, such as COP26 , to set up policies and protocols to ensure the climate crisis is addressed. According to campus economics professor Clair Brown, who spoke at the rally, youth activists at COP26 ""There is this tension between the older business and government leaders making the decisions and the young, climate activists who care a great deal about justice outside who explain to them that they are burning up the earth and what they're doing is so far away from what needs to be done,"" Brown said. Evasco said although the march focused on international environmental justice, as other marches did worldwide, youth activists part of the Bay Area march also focused on California-specific climate issues. These issues include protecting rooftop solar, preventing the expansion of gas capacity and working to influence the Democratic Party's climate policies in the state. Brown noted she believes today's climate leaders are the youth, and added it is important for them to be in that role. ""All the UC Berkeley students should be involved and they should be learning about what is happening about the climate, what needs to be done, and what policies we need,"" Brown said. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA166","The Soapbox: COP26 climate summit edition","November 5, 2021 Friday","Washington Square News: New York University","In Glasgow, negotiators are left to figure out the nitty-gritty of the climate crisis The ""high-level segment"" of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) has ended, and major leaders have departed Glasgow, Scotland, leaving behind diplomatic teams who will negotiate the details of international responses to the climate crisis. The goal of COP26 World leaders, civil society organizations and climate justice activists descended on Glasgow for the conference, which started Oct. 31, including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden.\~ Notably, though, Russia's Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro were all absent, despite the fact that China and Russia are now among the top five carbon-emitting countries. Additionally, Bolsonaro's presidency has seen widespread wildfires and deforestation devastating the Amazon rainforest, parts of which are now emitting carbon dioxide faster than they are sequestering it.\~ More than 40 countries, including Indonesia, Poland and Vietnam, pledged on Nov. 4 to phase out the use of coal-fired power generation, which is the single largest contributor to global temperature increase. But some of the world's biggest coal users - including Australia, India, China and the United States - did not sign on to the pledge, and have not signaled that they will change their plans to build new coal-based plants. Holding a massive climate summit during a global pandemic is no easy feat The summit was canceled at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and later postponed for a year. Even then, despite a range of vaccines now being administered around the world, the pandemic barred many from attending. Reuters reported that, of the 14 Pacific island nations usually present at the conference, only three were able to make it this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. Tiny islands like Fiji and Tuvalu have reported extremely low levels of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic and are attempting to keep it that way, even as they lobby for climate action to save their low-lying environments. Meanwhile, outside the conference, thousands of delegates and grassroots attendees have been forced to wait in long security lines for more than an hour at a time due to COVID-19 capacity limits and social distancing requirements. ""I have to point out that this is the environment that the COP26 negotiations [are] swimming in,"" 16-year-old climate activist Alexandria Villase\'f1or, who travelled to Glasgow for the summit, wrote on Twitter. ""An exclusionary, racist, ableist, classist environment directly informs the decision making process that is placed in it! The negotiating space that we create, as a planet, is one of the most important aspects of these talks and can ultimately set it up for failure or success."" Outside the conference, activists report police repression An estimated 100,000 grassroots climate activists - from Samoa to Kenya - have converged in Glasgow to compel leaders to take urgent action on the climate crisis. The U.K.-based COP26 Coalition penned an open letter to the First Minister of Scotland on Nov. 4, saying they've been subjected to ""heavy-handed and highly disproportionate"" crackdowns by Scottish police while protesting outside the forum. COP26 - which they have described as the largest and longest deployment of police officers in the history of the United Kingdom - would be ""welcoming, friendly, and proportionate."" Corporate involvement in COP26 draws suspicion and ire More than 450 financial firms from around the world, who are calling themselves the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, said they would contribute $130 trillion in private capital toward reaching net-zero in the next three decades. Rishi Sunak, Britain's treasury chief, praised the commitment as a ""historic wall of capital for the net-zero transition."" Others, however, are more skeptical. When governments and corporations say they aim to reach net zero or climate neutrality, they are not committing to end the use of fossil fuels, but simply to balance harmful carbon emissions with equal levels of carbon absorption. Climate scientists have warned that net-zero emissions targets are simply too vague. This has led climate-focused non-governmental organizations and activists to lose faith in these commitments, which they say will fail to fix the root causes of global climate change. ""Big Polluters and the governments that do their bidding have begun to tout commitments to achieve 'net zero' emissions as solutions to the crisis they have caused,"" the international nonprofit Corporate Accountability wrote in a recent report. ""Big Polluters' idea of 'net zero' is part of their continued plan to protect deeply unjust global systems, distract from taking the real action needed, and to evade responsibility for the climate crisis and to continue to pollute."" The prominent Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who arrived in Glasgow on Oct. 30, expressed her frustration over weak climate commitments and widespread corporate involvement in COP26 , calling the conference a ""Global North greenwash festival.""

We need to be taking actions on how we\' re going to assess the risks of the physical impact and how we\' re going to protect and help those people so they\' re not just rebuilding and rebuilding but can withstand the shocks, Chatterjee added. OCEAN RISK AND RESILIENCE An investment into the resilience of coastal communities was also announced on Adaptation, Loss and Damage Day, the eighth day of COP26 . The UK\' s Blue Planet Fund and Swiss Re announced they will put over $500,000 (368,042 pounds) into the Ocean Resilience Innovation Challenge, an initiative investing in and supporting locally led projects designed to build resilience in coastal communities adapting to climate change. The project is run by Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance, which aims to drive $500 million of investment to ocean nature-based solutions, establish at least 50 novel finance products and build the resilience of 250 million climate-vulnerable coastal people by 2030.\~  The UK and Swiss Re Foundation\' s backing of the Ocean Resilience Innovation Challenge comes amid a growing urgency for private and public finance leaders to increase ocean finance commitments and build resilience in some of the Earth\' s most valuable ecosystems and most exposed communities, said Karen Sack, ORRAA executive director and co-chair.  This is about how we nurture and scale locally-led solutions to some of the most serious challenges we face. FUNDING ADAPTATION Elsewhere at the conference in Glasgow, contributing governments and fund stakeholders discussed the Adaptation Fund, with the U.S. making its first donation of $50 million. Since 2010, the fund has had over $850 million allocated for climate adaptation projects in developing countries.  There has been a shift in thinking under the Biden administration about the criticality of adaptation, said https://www.state.gov/biographies/john-kerry John Kerry, U.S. special envoy for climate. Qatar also made its first donation of $500,000, and a host of other countries made renewed pledges. OBAMA CALLS FOR URGENCY Also Monday, former U.S. President Barack Obama addressed COP26 delegates in Glasgow. Speaking at the event Partnerships for Island Resilience, he said island states were the  canary in the coal mine when it came to the HYPERLINK https://www.investmentnews.com/climate-change-u-n-report-advisers-210050 climate crisis. In a later address to the conference, Obama encouraged young people to stay angry about the climate crisis and to channel their frustration in to politics and addressing the challenges older generations have created but failed to solve. He also said it was  discouraging that Russia and China\' s leaders were not attending COP26 .  It was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the world\' s largest emitters, China and Russia, declined to even attend the proceedings, and their plans so far reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency \- a willingness to maintain the status quo, on behalf of those governments, Obama said.

Teresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator at ActionAid International, says: ""This package of pledges is a mish-mash of announcements directed at food and forests but with no overarching standard for real transformation. ""The initiative fails to call out the big agribusinesses and industrial farming responsible for soaring greenhouse gas emissions from farming. Nor does it raise the bar for a shift to agroecological practices, which work with nature, tackle climate change, build climate resilience and protect the rights of women farmers. ""We're getting tired of COP26 being a succession of glossy announcements designed to distract from the fact that rich, polluting countries are stalling on both the action and finance needed to limit warming to 1.5C. It's time for governments get on with the hard work of making change not noise."" The announcement comes just hours after COP26 wrapped up the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture negotiations with text that for the first time included a reference to agroecology. Ms Anderson adds: ""Governments at COP26 including the Least Developed Countries, the Africa Group and the European Union fought hard for agroecology to be recognised as vital for strengthening resilience and reducing emissions in farming. ""Despite opposition from some countries, including the US, this outcome shows that change is on its way, and that agricultural solutions to the climate crisis should be entrusted to smallholders and women farmers instead of corporate agribusiness."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA172","California's climate accomplishment missed at COP26","CalMatters","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 26, 2021( CalMatters: HYPERLINK https://calmatters.org https://calmatters.org In summary Just two days into COP26 , the state sold its first ever climate-certified bond for more than $465 million. By Michael Paparian, Special to CalMatters Michael Paparian is a former deputy state Treasurer and serves as senior adviser to the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative[1], a nonprofit that provides climate certifications to bonds worldwide. If you're a fan of platitudes, promises and pledges, you weren't disappointed in the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. But at least one significant positive action by the state of California went largely unnoticed. In fairness, COP26 [2] overall was viewed as a modest success, but it fell well short of what we need to do to combat climate change, making positive actions taken by governments such as California even more important to not only showcase but to emulate elsewhere. I was among the 30,000 in attendance, and California was well represented. The state is treated in many circles like a major country. Though Gov. Gavin Newsom cancelled his trip at the last minute, the lieutenant governor and dozens of other California administration officials, legislators, scientists, activists and others were there. Keep tabs on the latest California policy and politics news California has much to be proud of in accomplishments and planned actions. During COP26 , California pledged to stop selling gas cars by 2035, joined a coalition pledging to phase out fossil fuels and touted the many policies and programs that make California a climate leader. But most of the California leaders at COP26 missed one of the most significant accomplishments of Newsom's administration. Just two days into COP26 , the state sold its first ever climate-certified bond for more than $465 million. In doing so, the state confirmed that a major infrastructure project is fully aligned with the climate goals of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade or less. The certification is hard to come by and is backed by scientifically credible analyses that a project is climate friendly and consistent with the infrastructure we need in the climate-challenged world. Bonds are used to fund infrastructure projects, from water and wastewater facilities to transportation systems to schools, hospitals, buildings and much more. However only a small, but growing fraction of the $450 billion in annual state and local bonds in the U.S. are labelled green. And an even smaller fraction is climate certified. The project financed by the recent climate certified bond is the new California Natural Resources Agency building. Not only will it be among the greenest office buildings ever built, it will use 'zero net energy.' In other words, through an agreement with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District to use solar energy, the building will produce as much renewable energy as it uses. Investors recognize that, for term stability, they need to steer their funds toward climate friendly projects. Green bonds verified by an independent third party provide one signal of climate friendliness. A green bond that is also climate-certified shows investors that the project has been fully and rigorously vetted for climate impacts. By joining this growing list of climate-certified bond issuers, including LA Metro, BART, Stanford University, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and others, the state is demonstrating one more commitment to climate solutions. Given the seriousness of the climate threat, at some point soon all infrastructure projects should be climate friendly and all bonds used to finance those projects should be climate certified. The state is the largest issuer of government bonds in the country. Municipalities and other states look to California for indications of what they should do in the marketplace. By issuing a climate certified bond, California is showing that everyone should integrate their infrastructure, climate and financial policies. For many, bonds are a boring topic. But as society moves toward climate solutions, we should be sure that, when we finance infrastructure, those projects should contribute to a healthier climate. Newsom deserves credit for doing so with the recent bond issuance and has set the precedent for stronger linkage between climate and finance in the future. Hopefully Newsom will build on this financial precedent. As state Treasurer Fiona Ma said, the Natural Resources Agency bond 'puts a public face on California's efforts to lead the discussion on climate change through innovative public finance.'

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA175","Australia sets itself up as the laughing stock of COP26","TheNextWeb.com","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 03, 2021( TheNextWeb.com: HYPERLINK http://thenextweb.com http://thenextweb.com It's that time again, the UN conference on climate change COP26 [1], is on again in Glasgow. Attendees arrive by train, ride indouble-decker electric buses[2], and receive escort by police riding modified electric Harley-Davidson LiveWire motorcycles[3]. But don't get too excited  those motorbikes are loaners only. Let's talk about the big fat elephant in the room at COP26 - transport and specifically the energy that powers transport and how one country has managed to fuck things up so spectacularly  Australia. HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.com/news/ HYPERLINK cop26 #The conference floor at COP26Australia: The embarrassment of COP26 I'm going to tell you a bit about Australia, my country of birth. Australia is the world'sfourth-largest producer of coal[4]. It's also the world's largest coal exporter and second-largest gas exporter, exporting 80% of its coal to other countries. HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.com/news/cop26#Australian https://thenextweb.com/news/ HYPERLINK cop26 #Australian bushfires get worse every year, and climate change is a contributing factor. But every year, Australia is subject to significant drought, rising temperatures, devastating bushfires, and floods. There was a mouse plague this year if you want to get biblical. You'd think with this kind of landscape sustainability would be a pretty big priority. Instead, we have a federal government led by Prime Minister Morrison, who in 2017took a lump of coal to parliament[5]. The United NationsSustainable Development Report 2021[6]positions Australia as having done the least out of 193 countries to combat climate change. Anyone thinking the Australian government (who has had seven Prime Ministers in 10 years) has any real will to act is sadly deluded. The sponsor for the Australian booth at COP26 is a gas company  you can't make this stuff up! Day 3 of # COP26 Turns out being sponsored by the gas industry isn't as cool as @AngusTaylorMP[9]@ScottMorrisonMP[10] thought. #auspol[11]pic.twitter .com/5S97Ja7RSM[12];  Michael Poland (@michaelpoland_) November 3, 2021[13] Like with any gathering of politicians, there's plenty of sleeping on the job. Guess the speaker# COP26 [14]pic.twitter .com/CjwjyfsL7Z[15]; For example,in Victoria[20], owners of plug-in hybrid vehicle incur a charge for an indexed fee of 2 cents per kilometer. The charge for any other electric vehicles is an indexed fee of 2.5 cents per kilometer. It's like taxing people who give up Coca-Cola for not bringing in income from the sugar lobby. Never mind the other benefits of carbon reduction, like reduced health costs from improved air quality. If this astonishing move isn't bad enough, breathe in, it gets worse. COP this: you can subsidize a gas-guzzling ute Back in March 2020, the Australian federal government unveiled a stimulus package worth $17.6 billion. Included is the ability to write off the cost of a ute (aka utility truck or pickup truck) up to the top $150,000 threshold value, as long as they have a one-tonne payload or more. HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.com https://thenextweb.com cop26 #The Murdoch-owned Australian media celebrates the ute tax write-off. So you can buy a gas-guzzling ute, but have to pay a tax if you buy an electric vehicle. No wonder utes areAustralia's top-selling cars[21].; This kinda thing passes through parliament using rhetoric about 'saving Australian jobs.' But let's be clear, Australia's automotive industry started dying decades ago, with the last car made in the country in 2017[22]. Australia's top-selling utes aren't even madein Australia[23].  I mention this deliberately as the biggest innovation in auto manufacturing in Australia right now are probably theH2X Global[24]powered by hydrogen HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.com/news/are-hydrogen-fuel-cells-the-future-of-green-transport-sortaand https://thenextweb.com/news/are-hydrogen-fuel-cells-the-future-of-green-transport-sortaand theAce Yewt[25] EV ute. Startups are the creators of these vehicles. HYPERLINK https://thenextweb.com/news/cop26#Attending https://thenextweb.com/news/ HYPERLINK cop26 #Attending COP26 , the Australian Warragal Hydrogen Fuel Ute has more than $50m in pre-orders. COP26 reveals a pivot intro green hydrogen for Australia's second-richest man I've long believed auto OEMs and traditional industries can change faster than politicians. An example of a radical industry pivot is Fortescue Future Industries[26] (FFI). FFI is the green arm of Australian coal   Fortescue Metals Group. The company's founder is Australia's second-richest person, the infamous Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest. Their focus is green hydrogen andto achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. It's part of a gradual transition from an iron ore producer to a green renewables and resources company. Just before COP26 , the company shared a deal to become the biggest supplier of green hydrogen[27]to the UK and previously signed an MOU to deliverhydrogen into Japan[28]. Look, I'm not under any illusion that business tax credits aren't a heavily contributing factor.I don't think that we'll ever see the demise of the parent coal company. I also would like countries to produce their own green hydrogen rather than importing it. But for a country like Australia that's so very addicted to coal, it's a good start.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA176","UK MINISTER FOR THE PACIFIC AND ENVIRONMENT VISITS COSTA RICA IN FIRST OVERSEAS VISIT AFTER COP26","January 28, 2022 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: UK and Costa Rica continue to work together in this year of the COP26 Presidency. From: Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Published 28 January 2022 Lord Goldsmith concluded his visit to Costa Rica on 27 January celebrating their pioneering leadership on climate and the environment, and developing the close partnership between the two countries just a few weeks after the UK hosted the UN climate conference. Environment Minister Andrea Meza and Lord Goldsmith travelled across the country, to see some of the scalable work that is underway. Together, they visited indigenous peoples, national parks, research centres and farms and saw how Costa Rica's Earthshot Prize-winning programme is paying people for the benefits they can provide by managing land sustainably. They saw the positive impacts of bringing Costa Rica's decarbonisation plan to life with an ambitious transport electrification plan building on the success of running the country on over 98% renewable energy for seven consecutive years. And Lord Goldsmith heard about Costa Rica's Natural Asset Company initiative, an innovative financial mechanism that will incentivise conservation and sustainable land use. Over a quarter of Costa Rica's land is protected. The country contains 5% of the planet's biodiversity in just 0.03% of the earth's landmass, and more than half of Costa Rica is under canopy the result of a national campaign to double the rainforest in a generation. During his visit, Lord Goldsmith commended President Alvarado on the expansion of the Cocos Island National Park, making Costa Rica one of the first countries in the world to protect 30% of their waters. And alongside Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, Costa Rica made headlines at COP26 when the four countries announced that they are now working together to protect some of the world's most important and biodiverse environments in the Eastern Pacific Tropical Marine Corridor set to become the largest transboundary marine protected area in the world. Lord Goldsmith praised their leadership and announced that the UK will provide an initial 2m as part of the newly established Blue Planet Fund financed through UK Aid, and drawing on decades of experience gained through the Blue Belt that protects an area of ocean larger than India around the UK Overseas Territories. Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado thanked the UK for their support and said: We must move ahead with actions to protect our planet, and in this particular case, the oceans. Protecting nature is a fundamental step in combatting climate change. Healthy oceans are vital to protecting hundreds of marine species that are important for ecosystems and for the people in our region. Costa Rica continues to work hand in hand with the UK in this year of the COP26 Presidency building on months of cooperation ahead of the conference in Glasgow, and during negotiations behind the scenes. And ahead of the CBD COP15, the UN biodiversity conference, the UK and Costa Rica are asking the world to sign up to ambitious targets that will put the natural world on the road to recovery during this decade. The UK and Costa Rica co-lead global alliances committed to significantly increasing protection of the world's land and ocean that now represent 120 countries and counting, over 40% of global GDP, and almost a third of the world's population. And together with France, the UK and Costa Rica lead the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People campaigning for the protection of at least 30% of the planet's land and ocean by 2030. UK Minister for the Pacific and Environment, Zac Goldsmith, said: From the Osa Peninsula to Sarapiqu, it has been a privilege to see Costa Rica's immense natural beauty first-hand. It is rightly a huge source of national pride. At COP26 in Glasgow, it was the leadership of nature-rich countries like Costa Rica that helped the UK presidency bring nature from the margins of the conversation on climate change into the heart of our response. And I am delighted that the Glasgow commitment to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 was signed by 141 countries representing over 90% of the world's forest cover including Costa Rica. The UK committed 1.5 billion to support countries in their efforts to protect and restore their forests, and empower the indigenous people and local communities for whom they are home. Costa Rica is set to tap into the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance coalition that has already mobilised $1billion, including an initial 200m from the UK. And through our new Blue Planet Fund, the UK will provide an initial 2m of scientific and technical assistance to help Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama expand and connect marine protection covering over 500,000 km2 of ocean in the Eastern Tropical Marine Corridor, including key migratory routes for sea turtles, whales, sharks, and rays. Reconciling our lives and our economies with the natural world around us is the defining challenge of our age and I am pleased that the UK is working ever more closely with leading countries like Costa Rica to make that happen. Costa Rican Environment Minister, Andrea Meza, said: Visits like Minister Goldsmith's have allowed us to show what Costa Rica is doing to make nature part of our development model as well as the significance of protected areas. Visiting indigenous peoples helps us understand the role of these communities, how we can benefit when we protect nature, and what the critical needs are that we need to address. Similarly, we can demonstrate what we're doing with the Payment for Environmental Services programme, and how important this resource mobilisation is for these families to be able to continue implementing strategies to diversify their income, and adopt more sustainable productive practices. We are really grateful to have a strategic partner like the UK. Speaking at a meeting of the Forum of Ministers for Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean in San Jose on 27 January, Lord Goldsmith and Minister Meza urged leaders from across government, sectors, and society to work together to make sure that everyone feels the benefits of accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised, net-zero, nature-positive global economy. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA177","Gasbagging in Glasgow: COP26 and Phasing Down Coal","Dissident Voice","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 15, 2021( Dissident Voice: HYPERLINK http://www.dissidentvoice.org http://www.dissidentvoice.org Words can provide sharp traps, fettering language and caging definitions. They can also speak to freedom of action and permissiveness. At COP26 , that permissiveness was all the more present in the haggling ahead of what would become the Glasgow Climate Pact. COP26 COP26 president Alok Sharma called the outcome[2] £ fragile win', the outcome of 'hard work' and 'great cooperation' from the parties. The Pact is a flurry of words[3], acknowledging, for instance 'the importance of the best available science for effective climate action and policymaking.' Alarm and utmost concern is expressed by the parties at the fact 'that human activities have caused around 1.1 C of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region'. There is a stress on 'the urgency of enhancing ambition and acting in relation to mitigation adaptation and finance in this critical decade to address gaps between current efforts and pathways in pursuit of the ultimate objective of the Convention and its long-term global goal'. The pact had gone through a few iterations, stirring interest, sparking hope, even inducing, at points, a giddy optimism. The first draft[4] had called upon the Parties 'to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil-fuels'. Its appearance was considered[5] by The New Scientist to be 'remarkable' for explicitly mentioning fossil fuels, while Ed King of the European Climate Foundation suggested[6] that it was 'the first time fossil fuels have been called out in a draft UN climate decision text'. But in the final statement, an exit for countries still keen to keep the heart of coal alive, was carved. The parties might well ensure that technologies and policies would be adopted 'to transition towards low-emission energy systems', scale up the 'deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures' but this would also entail £ccelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies'. As this was undertaken, 'targeted support' would be directed towards 'the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards a just transition'. And there were those words slipped in with conspiratorial deftness: 'phasing down'. Elastic, open, accommodating to the emitters and the vendors. A world left to the beholder. The change of language had been encouraged by India, with the support of other coal-dependent states. The Indian environment and climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, had been less than impressed with the singling out of coal, given the previous text's deafening silence on natural gas and oil. The reasons for such omissions were clear enough: countries such as the United States continue to nourish their interest in oil and gas investment. On November 17, the Biden administration will hold the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale[7] in US history, covering 80 million acres off the Gulf of Mexico. Again, President Joe Biden shows that anything his predecessor, Donald Trump, did, he can do several times better. After the conclusion of COP26 , Yadav merrily declared[8] the summit a success for India, as 'we articulated and put across the concerns and ideas of the developing world quite succinctly and unequivocally.' His country had a lesson for the developed world, fattened by a certain lifestyle that required modification to cope with the climate crisis. It was the hook upon which the Modi government could fasten a new, lecturing mantra: LIFE, or Lifestyle for Environment, one that valued 'moderation over excess.' 'Today,' stated Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the summit, 'it's needed that all of us come together and take forward LIFE as a movement.' Presumably a phasing down movement. Indian voices in the climate action sector did not shy away from approving the dilution of the language on coal. Their targets were the misdeeds of the United States and the European Union, who had, according to[9] Aarti Khosla of Climate Trends, failed 'to deliver on the promised $100 billion in climate finance'. Kamal Narayan, CEO of the Integrated Health and Well Being Council, suggested[10] that the use of 'phasing down' coal instead of 'phasing out' should not be a source of concern, given 'the kind of commitment and leadership India has shown in building renewable energy infrastructure'. While not quite music, the softening approach in the final text was melodious enough for former Australian resources minister Matt Canavan to claim that the coal industry had been victorious in Scotland. Proudly visible before him in an interview[11] with the Today program was a screen with an unequivocal message: 'Glasgow: A Huge Win for Coal.' An adventurous reading of the Glasgow text was in order. The agreement had provided 'wiggle room' for countries. 'Given the fact that the agreement did not say that coal needs to be phased down or taken out, it is a green light for us to build more coal mines.' For a delightedly cynical Canavan, no country was really taking the agreement seriously, and the likes of India, China and those in South-East Asia were insatiably hungry for coal, with a 'demand' that £lmost has no limit'. On Twitter, he reiterated the theme[12] with a call to rent the earth with urgent, patriotic enthusiasm. 'Let's get digging then and sell more of the best coal in the world to others, and bring millions more people out of poverty.' Pacific Island states were resigned, disappointed and despairing. Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama could only entertain some frail optimism, praising[13] the 'heroic effort' of the Pacific negotiators at COP26 . 'The 1.5-degree target leaves Glasgow battered, bruised, but alive.' Other states were angrily baffled by the subversion evident in the final text. Mexico's envoy, Camila Isabel Zepeda Lizama, expressed anger[14] at her country being 'sidelined' in a 'non-transparent and non-inclusive process'. 'We all have remaining concerns but were told we could not reopen the text while others can still ask to water down their promises.' A cabal of powers had done its trick. For activists, there was no death knell to coal, as the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, confidently claimed. 'This is no longer a climate conference,' lamented[15] climate change activist Greta Thunberg, the tenured voice of climate change catastrophism. 'This is now a global greenwashing festival.' And with greenwashing shall come the vanishing, but not before a few more, gasbagging efforts. The post Gasbagging in Glasgow: COP26 and Phasing Down Coal[16] first appeared on Dissident Voice[17].

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA178","Leeds at COP26: Our Climate Experts Address Global Leaders","October 29, 2021 Friday 10:15 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- The University of Leeds issued the following news: Leeds climate researchers working to tackle the environmental crisis and help the world achieve net zero carbon emissions are preparing to address 200 world leaders at COP26 . This event is widely considered the last best chance for leaders to negotiate the way forward in tackling the climate crisis. The conference, which starts at the weekend in Glasgow, presents an opportunity to steer our path away from a dangerous temperature rise towards the agreed target of limiting global heating to 1.5 C, and with it, a shift to a fairer, cleaner, healthier world in which to live. Research and innovation from the Leeds is contributing to important discussions and negotiations taking place in the run up to, and at, COP26 . The conference is divided into two zones: Blue and Green. The Blue Zone is open only to government officials and accredited organisations and individuals, including 13 Leeds researchers. Key negotiations will take place in the Blue Zone, as well as a range of events, talks and presentations from governments, businesses and institutions including Leeds on their work to tackle climate change. The Green Zone is open to the public, where organisations can showcase their efforts to address the climate crisis. Here Leeds delegates will take part in a range of public-facing activities, and will lead a number of fringe events. Professor Dame Jane Francis, British Antarctic Survey Director and Chancellor of the University, will lead a panel discussion on Empowering policymakers with informed scientific knowledge, exploring how lessons from the pandemic can be applied to help address the climate crisis. The event is on Wednesday 10 November at 10-11.30am GMT and will be live-streamed online. Places can be booked via eventbrite. Several other Leeds events will be live-streamed online. Members of the public can register to attend via the University website. HYPERLINK https://climate.leeds.ac.uk/ HYPERLINK cop26 /events/ Leeds at COP26 Leeds' COP26 Piers Forster, Professor of Climate Physics and Director of Leeds' Priestley International Centre for Climate, will represent the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to brief high level negotiations. He will also showcase the latest climate science through the Leeds-led CONSTRAIN EU research project, and will meet with other national climate council representatives on behalf of the UK Climate Change Committee to share and learn best practice. This year the IPCC produced a report observing that changes in the Earth's climate caused by human activity are being observed in every region and across the whole climate system. Professor Forster, co-ordinating lead author of the report, said: ""The bad news is that a low level of future warming can now be ruled out. ""But the good news is that if the world can substantially reduce emissions in the 2020s and get to net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, temperature rise can still be limited to 1.5 C."" COP26 Research Fellow Harriet Thew will take part in discussions around climate education and youth empowerment in the Blue Zone, as well as several Green Zone events on education and youth participation. These include the world premiere of the Ripple Effect film, which was made by young people from the UK and South Africa about how climate change affects their lives now. Postgraduate researcher Heather Selley will address Blue Zone delegates, speaking about her research into fast flowing glaciers in the Getz region of West Antarctica. Heather's 2021 paper showed that 14 glaciers in the Getz region are thinning and flowing more quickly into the ocean, adding to rising sea levels. Stephen Whitfield, Associate Professor of Climate Change and Food Security, and COP26 Research Fellow, will speak in the Blue Zone on developing climate-resilient food systems, using his research on approaches in sub-Saharan Africa. Dom Spracklen, Professor of Biosphere-Atmosphere Interactions, will address Blue Zone attendees on the environmental impact of peatland fires. Professor Spracklen is currently working on a project to restore 1,200 hectares of land in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, which will see the restoration of peatlands and the expansion of native woodland and scrub to remove and store carbon, helping to tackle the climate crisis. More information about all the delegates attending COP26 from the University is available on the Priestley Centre website.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA179","Global Resilience Partnership: Resilience in Focus at COP26","November 25, 2021 Thursday 9:30 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- The Global Resilience Partnership issued the following agency statement:    At the Global Resilience Partnership, we are taking forward the momentum and collaborations from COP26 into action to build a resilient future. The 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) Climate Summit took place over two weeks from 31 October to 12 November. Thousands of people attended, organisations held hundreds of side of events, and a number of initiatives and plans were announced. But what does it all lead to? At the Global Resilience Partnership, we are taking forward the momentum and collaborations from COP26 into action to build a resilient future. This COP saw much more attention and funding being driven into resilience and adaptation from governments, the private sector, and communities. We are calling for resilience and adaptation to be equally supported alongside mitigation, and we are using our eight years of experience in resilience to help shape and support new initiatives and activities. Below are the key numbers, announcements, and actions that we as a Partnership were involved with at COP26 and will take forward in the coming months. Resilience Hub  With over 154 events from 80 event partners featuring 176 participating organisations, the first ever COP Resilience Hub brought together a community of state and non-state actors in an unprecedented collaboration.  We heard from voices from across the globe, and had virtual hubs in South Asia, Latin America, Africa, South East and East Asia, and the Pacific.  In a High-level Plenary session at the end of week 2, Nigel Topping, High level Champion for Climate Action at COP26 , said, ""We're delighted that the Resilience Hub has been a real success here and we hope that it goes from strength to strength to draw more attention and direct more resources to resilience solutions"". Innovating for Climate Resilience Fund  We launched the Innovating for Climate Resilience Fund in partnership with the Global Innovation Fund and the Adaptation Research Alliance. The fund has seed funding from UK's Foreign Commonwealth, and Development Office.  Through the fund, we will invest in innovations that aim to support people living on less than $5 per day to build resilience and adaptation to shocks and stresses. Resilience Knowledge Coalition  GRP, CDKN and ICCCAD launched the Voices for the Frontline digibook.  The coalition amplified voices from grassroots leaders from South Asia and Africa who are acting as knowledge catalysts between grassroots communities and best practices to facilitate resilience among the communities at the frontlines of nested challenges like COVID-19 and climate change. Race to Resilience  The Resilience Knowledge Coalition was also launched as a Transformation Knowledge Partner to the Race to Resilience at the Resilience Hub.  The Race to Resilience has set a bold goal of reaching four billion people with resilience and adaptation solutions by 2030. Already R2R partners have made commitment to build the resilience of 2.4 billion people. We are proud that Resilience Knowledge Coalition is part of this solution-oriented network.  The coalition's contribution to the Race to Resilience Metrics Framework with knowledge brokering, capacity exchange and the members' collective expertise on resilience measurements was highlighted at an event by the Race to Resilience High Level Champions team and at the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action event on Adaptation and Resilience. The Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA)  The Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau confirmed a $9m commitment to ORRAA to support the Alliance's ongoing work in Small Island Developing States and coastal developing countries.  Google announced a US$2 m commitment on behalf of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to ORRAA for its work with partners to develop an innovative risk assessment tool to help insurers combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.  The UK reaffirmed its investment into ORRAA through the Blue Planet Fund and announced that part of its contribution will be investing into ORRAA's Ocean Resilience Innovation Challenge (ORIC), which seeks to surface new, locally-led finance products that can be scaled to benefit coastal communities across the world.  The Swiss Re Foundation announced that it will also be contributing to the Ocean Resilience Innovation Challenge. Together with the UK's financial contribution, Swiss Re Foundation and UK's Blue Planet Fund (BPF) will provide over half a million dollars in support to the challenge over the coming two years.  AXA committed US1.1m in support of ocean risk research as part of the UN Decade of Ocean Science.  The Commonwealth Blue Charter, Asia Development Bank, BNP Paribas, Palladium, Van Oord, and the Insurance Development Forum all announced they are joining ORRAA. Adaptation Research Alliance  The UK COP26 Presidency, the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, and partners officially launched the Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) at COP26 . The Adaptation Research Alliance is a global, collaborative effort to increase investment and opportunities for action research to develop and inform effective adaptation solutions. Locally-led Adaptation Principles  Danida, Sida, USAID and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced their endorsement of the eight principles for locally-led adaptation at the Resilience Hub. The principles were developed to help ensure that local communities are empowered to lead sustainable and effective adaptation to climate change at the local level. Development & Climate Days  This year's D&C Days was the most inclusive ever and accessible to all through an online platform.  The D&C Days had a record number of participants - 1,152 people registered.  GRP co-led Resilience Food and Agriculture stream of D&C Programme and co-created an event What are the critical actions needed to build climate resilient food systems in vulnerable and fragile regions? Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action (MPCGA)  This year's MPGCA Adaptation and Resilience high level event was closely curated together with Race to Resilience High Level Champions team and with 7 sectoral teams under MPGCA.  This event featured a launched of revised Adaptation and Resilience Pathway (v 2.0) and discussion on how to operationalize the common 9 suite of AR interventions across sectors to build a resilient future.  The event was highly attended by physical and virtual audiences - being the second most viewed event amid MPGCA action zone events.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA180","COP26: MORE THAN EXPECTED, LESS THAN HOPED","November 15, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Greenpeace: The gavel has come down at COP26 , officially ending this year's UN Conference on Climate Change. The 1.5 C goal stays alive, and the new Glasgow Agreement recognises the need for deep emissions cuts in this decade but the new climate deal is a long way from the action we need now. Week one was about setting expectations, exposing greenwashing scams, and naming the countries Saudi Arabia, Australia, Brazil, USA most responsible for blocking progress. Week two was about the negotiations themselves pushing the UK COP Presidency to strengthen the text, ensure that countries would not have five years to strengthen their targets and exposing attempts by offsets scammers to weaken the carbon text even further. COP26 was a big one, as countries had promised to do more by the Glasgow talks, and from the start, Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5C. That didn't happen, a clear betrayal of the millions of people suffering from the climate crisis, which means in 2022, countries will need to come back with stronger targets. While COP26 Main outcomes from COP26 Frontline Activism Firstly, let's give credit where credit is overwhelmingly overdue: without the Indigenous Leaders, youth activists, and the countries on the frontlines of the climate emergency fighting for the urgency needed, the climate talks would have failed. Both inside and outside the COP conference centre, voices from countries and communities most affected by the impacts of the climate crisis demanded action from world leaders. In the days leading up to the opening of COP26 , young activists from Namibia, Uganda, Bangladesh and Mexico sailed into COP on board Greenpeace's ship, the Rainbow Warrior, to tell leaders to 'stop failing us.' Days later, activists including Greta Thunberg and Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan, challenged Mark Carney, the UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance at a side event on voluntary offsets, calling it greenwash. These actions, amongst the daily relentless demands from frontline activists, highlighted inaction and the insufficiency of early drafts, forcing country negotiators to redeliver. These groups will no longer, nor should they have to, tolerate many more outcomes like this. Why should they, when they are fighting for their futures when they are the least responsible for creating the crisis? Climate vulnerable countries are suffering real loss and damage from the climate crisis today but what was promised in the final discussion text is nothing close to what's needed on the ground. Much more ambition is still needed as well as transparency about the nature of different countries' current commitments. Expectations that COP26 would finally deliver real support for communities needing to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of climate disasters were high but the outcome ""is an insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis"", as said by Teresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator at ActionAid International. Although rich countries finally did begin to respond to the calls of more climate-vulnerable countries for funding and resources to cope with rising temperatures, acknowledgement is not enough. The world's nations who are disproportionately responsible for rising temperatures need to commit what they already promised and even more. Phasing-out fossil fuels The compromise in the Glasgow Climate Pact on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies is weak but it is the first time a call for coal reduction appears on a COP final text. The call for emissions reductions of 45% by the end of this decade is still in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5C and keeps the science in this deal. But countries need to specify how much and by when they will cut emissions. And a focus on a just transition will be essential. Nevertheless, the signal that the era of coal is ending has been sent. Offsets Disappointingly, the offsets scam got a boost in Glasgow. The creation of new loopholes endangers nature, Indigenous Peoples, and the 1.5C goal itself. Although the UN Secretary-General announced a new Group of Experts to scrutinize the role of offsets, much work still needs to be done to stop the cheating giving big emitters and corporations a pass. What happens next Our climate is now breaking down around us, you see it every day in wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, and melting ice. There is no time to lose and it's in the interests of all countries, including those who still burn coal, to transition to clean renewable energy, and richer countries need to do more to support that shift. Our future depends on it. COP27 will reconvene next year in Egypt where climate justice activists will intensify raising awareness about the severe climate impacts facing the continent and securing more support for adaptation and loss and damage. In the meantime, we must continue to mobilise and urgently create irrepressible pressure that finally ends the era of all fossil fuels. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA181","UN\u8216 s COP26 is wrong climate strategy","January 18, 2022 Tuesday","Arizona Capitol Times","President Biden and the Democrats have a problem. For the second time in six years, a Democratic president has negotiated an international agreement that will never be presented to the U.S. Senate for consent and will never be voted on by any of America\' s elected officials. They have negotiated an international agreement that will likely be overturned by the next Republican president, and emissions will continue to fall regardless. The problem for the Democrats is that their supposed climate leadership isn\' t real. The Democrats don\' t want to solve the climate crisis. Their true goal is to destroy the fossil fuels industry and, by extension, destroy the communities supported by that industry. The Democrats pretend to care about the climate crisis, yet continually introduce unrealistic proposals that have less than a zero percent chance of being passed, shove climate boondoggles and unsound tax breaks into multi-trillion-dollar, omnibus bills that, if passed at all, would be done so on the smallest partisan margins in a generation. That isn\' t leadership. Going to international forums to make promises that hold no authority isn\' t leadership. Blowing out the deficit on wishful policies and unsound theories isn\' t leadership. Supporting a degrowth plan for the climate crisis isn\' t leadership. Focusing on making the transition to a clean economy as painful as possible isn\' t leadership. I just spent the week atCOP26 and the Global Conservative Climate Summitthat transpired at the same time as COP 26, a United Nations climate change conference. At those events, I found true climate leadership. We heard from conservative and liberal politicians from around the world, as well as from innovators, engineers, economists, and scientists. Outside of COP26 was where real leadership and ideas could be found. In conservative climate circles, the focus was not on rushing the transition to clean energy as Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm seems dead-set on doing, but instead as an opportunity to refocus our economy toward serving individuals and communities, and decoupling from China. In conservative climate circles, we see the climate challenge as an opportunity to spearhead American and Western leadership in manufacturing, automobiles, energy policy, land conservation, and water management. In conservative climate circles, the market is an ally, not a foe. At the same time across Glasgow, former President Obama, President Biden, and myriad other world leaders, one right after another, lectured the world about how we are failing to meet the current crisis with the veracity needed. In the world they described, we must regress to the Middle Ages, give up our technological advances, and pray that maybe, just maybe, the Chinese Communist Party would shut down a couple of their coal plants. Needless to say, most of those supposed  leaders arrived at COP26 in multi-vehicle armored motorcades after flying across the world in private jets. While one side is projecting optimism about our ability to meet our present challenge, the other side finds it fit to lecture us about how horrible we are. What makes all of this lecturing, hectoring, and hypocrisy even better is that one major industrial economy stands apart from the rest, not for its emissions increase, but rather its emissions decrease. The United States, much-maligned following President Trump\' s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords, is the only major industrial economy to actually see its net emissions drop. That drop wasn\' t facilitated by White House dictate, but rather market mechanisms in which technological innovations in natural gas production made transitions away from more carbon-intensive coal easier reducing our emissions while also embracing the economic prosperity that often comes with innovation. This brings us back to where we began. Under President Trump, the United States was a global leader in emissions reduction. Under President Biden, the United States has halted or greatly restricted the expansion of natural gas as an energy source, canceled or halted major oil pipelines that are safer than trucks when it comes to delivering oil to cities, shuttered nuclear plants, and generally backtracked on its emissions reductions. Under President Biden and the Democrats, the United States isn\' t progressing in meeting our climate challenge, we\' re regressing. Instead of leading with cleaner American oil, we beg Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, and Russia to increase their output. Instead of lowering the cost of electric vehicles, we make gas prohibitively expensive and provide tax breaks for only union-made electric vehicles. Instead of building and deploying modern, and clean, nuclear power plants, we shutter our existing ones because it makes us feel good. If you want to see true climate leadership, don\' t look to those who want to remake America and send us back to the Middle Ages. Instead, look to those who want to use America\' s innate greatness and meet the challenge head-on. Look to those who want America to be strong, and to lead from the front. We can face the challenge that climate change poses. We\' ve faced great challenges before and come out the victor. The Democrats just won\' t lead the way.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA182","FACT SHEET: COP26 - CHILDREN AND CLIMATE CHANGE","November 1, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF): UNICEF will be at COP26 to ensure that the climate crisis is recognized as a crisis for children and their rights, to promote approaches to decrease climate risk for those who are most vulnerable, and to support children and young people's participation in COP26 as part of efforts to support children and young people's participation in climate-related decision-making. "" COP26 COP26 have a significant, time-sensitive opportunity to redirect the terrible path we are on. They can do so by committing to strengthening the resilience of services that children depend upon, and by cutting emissions faster and deeper. The futures of billions of children depend on it."" Key Messages : The climate crisis is a child rights crisis. Climate change poses a major threat to children and young people's health, nutrition, education, development, survival and future potential. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors. Critically, current and future generations of children will have to navigate an uncertain future where the current model of growth that links economic development to environmental exploitation is no longer viable. An August UNICEF report, The Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), found almost every child on earth is exposed to at least one climate and environmental hazard, such as heatwaves, cyclones, air pollution, flooding and water scarcity. Approximately 1 billion children nearly half the world's children - live in 33 countries classified in the Index as ""extremely high-risk"". These children face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education. An estimated 850 million children over one third of all children live in areas where at least four of climate and environmental shocks overlap, and as many as 330 million children live in areas affected by a staggering five major climate shocks. Children from countries that contribute the least to climate change suffer the greatest consequences. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit 9 per cent of CO2 emissions. The 10 highest-risk countries collectively emit only 0.5 per cent of global emissions. Improving the resilience of key services that children depend upon is often the best investment to reduce the risks they face. Access to resilient water, sanitation and hygiene services reduces risks for 415 million children. Climate-smart health services reduce risks for 460 million children. Resilient schools and education systems reduce risks for 275 million children. And climate-responsive social safety nets reduce risks for 310 million children. Action at COP26 Increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience. UNICEF urges developed countries to exceed their 2009 promise to mobilize $US100 billion annually in climate finance in light of evidence that these sums are insufficient to address the scale of climate impacts. UNICEF urges a greater emphasis on funding to build climate resilience and adaptive capacity. Mitigation efforts will take decades to reverse the impacts of climate change, and for the children of today, this will be too late. Unless we invest heavily in adaptation and resilience of social services for the 4.2 billion children born over the next 30 years, these children will face increasingly high risks to their survival and well-being. Critical services must be adapted, such as water, sanitation and hygiene systems, health and education services. It is imperative that, at COP26 , countries commit to increasing investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children, prioritising the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. The decisions made at COP26 will shape the lives of every child in every nation on earth, now and in the future. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. UNICEF is urging countries to cut their emissions by at least 45 per cent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2030 to keep warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. The number of children that UNICEF estimates to be at 'extremely high-risk' of the impacts of climate change will likely increase as the impacts of climate change accelerate. Include young people in all climate negotiations and decisions. UNICEF supports young people's calls for governments to end the consistent omission of young people, especially those from the most affected places. Young people continue to demand comprehensive, bold climate action from decision makers. As yet, the action demanded has not materialized to the levels required. Children and young people are underrepresented in policies and policy discussions despite being the major stakeholder in their outcomes. They are therefore limited in their ability to influence decisions that are critical to their future. Children's rights and voices must be reflected and included in the implementation of the Paris Agreement at national, regional and international levels. COP26 presents a critical opportunity to formalise this. 2022 will mark 30 years since the UNFCCC Convention was drafted and yet in that time, there has never been a decision focused on children and young people in climate action taken under the UNFCCC. Every government must provide climate education for children and young people so that they can meaningfully contribute to and participate in climate policy and action. # # # # # Notes to Editors Spokespeople in Glasgow: Gautam Narasimhan, 1-6 November (UNICEF Global Lead on Climate, Energy and Environment Silvia Gaya, 1-8 November (UNICEF senior adviser on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) Valentina Otmacic, 9-12 November (UNICEF Deputy Director of Advocacy) We are also working with more than 20 youth climate advocates/activists including from countries worst affected by climate change.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA184","The effect of the Glasgow COP26 meeting continues to grow and is now propelling the carbon-trading market.","Global Finance Magazine"," ","The effect of the Glasgow COP26 meeting continues to grow and is now propelling the carbon-trading market. Early in November eight titans of 21st-century industry-including Amazon, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft and Netfl ix-formed the Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions, or BASCS. The setting, at the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, was more than symbolic. Despite prevailing skepticism about such all-world jawfests, COP26 did achieve something of note in its 23rd hour and after five numbing years of negotiation: a global protocol for trading carbon credits and offsets, known to the climate cognoscenti as Article 6.4. That's a big deal, or could be, for a wide range of industries and financial investors. The carbon dioxide (CO2) spewed in order to power, say, an Amazon server in the US could hypothetically be neutralized by forests the company pays to plant in Central Africa or solar energy it finances in India. The same goes for a Delta Airlines flight from Paris to New York, oil that Shell extracts from the Gulf of Mexico or fumes from a Cemex cement plant in Mexico-to cite a few companies that have set ambitious carbon-cutting targets. An added refinement to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, Article 6.4 lays out an accounting system, a set of international accounting standards (IAS) or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in embryo, for a private-sector market that has been ad hoc until now. The key principle is a ban on socalled double counting: The seller of a carbon-cutting project can't use it toward its own climate targets. ""It's a huge breakthrough,"" says Pedro Martins Barata, senior director of climate policy at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). ""The voluntary carbon market has been exploding, but exploding without any type of norms."" How huge in dollar terms? The voluntary carbon-credit market amounts to a measly $1 billion now. That could expand ""10- to 20-fold"" over the next decade, says Romina Graiver, a Londonbased partner at asset manager William Blair. That could accelerate to $200 billion by 2050, predicts Elena Belletti, Madrid-based head of carbon at energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. Sooner or later, we're talking real money. VOLUNTEERS AND DRAFTEES Companies feel pressure to cut their carbon counts right now, though, for one of two broad reasons: They have to, or they want to. In the have-to column are cuts required by governments, what insiders call the compliance market. The European Union is leading the way here. The price of carbon credits on the EU's internal exchange tripled last year as the commission in Brussels moved toward tighter targets. ""Prices were driven by climate policy fundamentals,"" Belletti says. Other polities, from China to California (which often acts as a sovereign state on environmental issues), are also tightening the noose. Carbon-credit prices in the Golden State, which runs a joint market with Quebec, doubled in 2021. COP26 laid down a mechanism for credit trading between governments (Article 6.2, for those keeping score). But the real excitement centers on the voluntary market- emissions that companies want to cut without a government requirement. The voluntary epicenter is the US, which has yet to enforce carbon caps or taxes except in California. Ripples reach from Mexico, where Cemex is pushing to be a global climate beacon, to Russia, where steelmakers like NLMK, Evraz and Severstal are mulling carbon diets. The Russians are motivated by their large exports to Western Europe, where standards are high. ""We will be subject to the EU's carbon import tax by 2026,"" notes Boris Sinitsyn, head of metals and mining research at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. The US-based giants are reacting to increasingly sustainability- minded investors, consumers and employees. Focus widened in recent years from resource extractors and exhaust belchers to Big Tech and the massive real-world energy sucked up to power the virtual economy. Netflix alone consumed up to 15% of the internet's energy at its peak, EDF's Barata reports. The New Economy powers are responding, and that response will include carbon offsets. Microsoft bought 1.3 million tons worth of CO2 removal in 2020, or about 10% of annual emissions, chasing its goal of being ""carbon-negative"" by 2030. ""Our members are moving from ambition to action on living in line with their values,"" says Ameer Azim of Business for Social Responsibility, the San Francisco-based consultantcy that helped organize BASCS. ""They have clear confidence that Article 6 can work as a backstop."" BUT IS THERE ENOUGH? Growing demand for carbon offsets looks secure. Supply is a different story. Carbon-offset legitimacy is a moving target. Wind power in China, for example, might have qualified under Article 6's distant ancestor, the late-1990s Kyoto Protocol, the EDF's Barata says. Today it wouldn't, because the market supports Chinese wind power anyway. (The Kyoto Protocol was torpedoed in 2001, when President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the agreement.) The low-hanging fruit these days is planting or protecting forests in developing countries. Brazil's International Chamber of Commerce projects that maintaining the Amazon jungle could earn the country up to $100 billion by 2030. That figure looks optimistic. Still, the global volume of forestry offsets more than tripled last year, Wood Mackenzie's Belletti estimates. The problem with forests is there are not nearly enough of them to soak up modern society's carbon output. ""At current rates, it would take five Earths' worth of forested land to absorb annual carbon emissions,"" Belletti points out. Nor is every forestry project a slam dunk, offsetwise. ""Just planting a tree doesn't mean the right tree has been planted in the right place,"" says Ursula Finsterwald, head of Group Sustainability Management at LGT, the private bank controlled by Liechtenstein's princely family. Faraway forestry management may also impinge on the rights of native peoples, creating a PR headache rather than solving one. Microsoft's 2020 tender for carbon-offset projects, which others are studying as an example, indicates how arduous sourcing will be. The software pioneer received 189 proposals, which it winnowed down to 15 over half a year. ""The types of project presented was very varied, and the quality very diverse,"" William Blair's Graiver comments. Microsoft ended up relying on forestry for 1.1 million of its 1.3 million tons in declared offsets. The firm's stated takeaway: ""The market lacks clear carbon-removal accounting standards, particularly around the key criteria of additionality, durability and leakage."" STIMULATING INNOVATION Optimists foresee that growing demand for carbon credits will lift the price per metric ton of C02. That will make a wider range of offset projects economical-particularly in carbon capture, which costs more than reforestation. LGT is investing in this theory. It lately entered a 10-year agreement with Climeworks, a Swiss company that will remove 9,000 metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere and permanently store it beneath volcanic soil in Iceland. ""This is a business decision for us,"" Finsterwald explains. ""We pay them for the certificates."" An LGT partner company also owns 10% of South Pole, a Zurich-based offsets creator whose projects range from improved cooking stoves in rural China to ""regenerative farming"" in France and Belgium. Finnish startup Puro.earth in Helsinki focuses on offset projects involving biochar. This ubiquitous substance, formed by decaying trees and grasses, can boost the carbon absorbency of agricultural soil. That could mitigate up to 660 million tons of CO2 a year by 2050, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report estimates. Biochar is much cheaper than Climeworks-style atmospheric carbon capture, Puro.earth CEO Antti Vihavainen argues. And buyers don't need to manage offsets at the ends of the earth. Puro.earth's projects, three of which made the cut for Microsoft funding, are concentrated in Australia and Germany, along with Finland. ""Carbon removal is a bit of a cottage industry now,"" Vihavainen says. ""We're working with our suppliers to scale them 50 or 100 times."" For that, or anything like it, to happen, those clear carbonremoval accounting standards of which Microsoft speaks will have to evolve from the framework laid down at COP26 . Formally, this task falls to the United Nations, which organizes the global climate summits. UN technocrats will move at their own stately pace, William Blair's Graiver predicts. ""There are still a lot of hurdles to making this operational,"" she says. ""It should take one to three years."" The good news is that a plethora of NGO and industry organizations are pushing the pace of change. Airlines may be leading the way, with their (government-imposed) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or Corsia. This now requires carriers to offset emissions from international flights, with the goal of freezing pollution at 2020 levels. Unchecked, airlines' carbon footprint would increase another 50%, or 300 million tons a year, by 2035, the International Air Transport Association estimates. The COP26 More good news is that everybody around the world, or a critical mass, now understands the urgency of checking carbon emissions: industry, government, investors and consumers. Oil companies themselves are looking to molt into green pioneers, at least rhetorically. ""Our clients realize the world is heading toward an energy transition,"" Wood Mackenzie's Belletti says. ""They're looking for how they can provide decarbonization solutions in carbon capture and storage. They are also looking at diversifying into renewables."" The burning question now is how fast companies and nations can produce these solutions-and at what cost, in both value and emissions. Carbon markets and offsets have a role to play. One day, the Article 6 agreements from COP26 may be looked back upon as a Magna Carta for the multibillion-dollar trade to come-hopefully not too late. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA185","Faculty Reflect On The COP26 Climate Summit","December 8, 2021 Wednesday","The Outlook: Monmouth University","Monmouth University hosted a virtual discussion panel with Tony MacDonald and Randall Abate to explore their impressions of the UN's COP26 climate change summit on Thursday, Dec. 2. MacDonald, Director of Monmouth University's Urban Coast Institute , and Abate, Rechnitz Family/UCI Endowed Chair in Marine and Environmental Law, attended the conference in Glasgow as observers in the ""Blue Zone."" ""They reduced the number of people they could send this year because of the COVID protocols,"" explained MacDonald. ""We were a little bit skeptical with everything going on, but when we got reassured that the meeting was being organized well we made plans and were fortunate enough to go. It was really a great experience."" Abate described the intensive COVID testing protocols that were in place at the convention, which required everyone to conduct daily self tests and produce a negative result before entering the venue. ""We were tested to death, but it was all for a good purpose,"" he joked. ""More specific to the experience at the actual event, the Covid protocols just delayed things and restricted access in a way that was frustrating,"" he continued. ""The number of people allowed in the rooms was severely restricted. I had at least three or four sessions that I really wanted to attend but the door was shut and I was on a wait list that I was not able to get off of. I was literally running from event to event trying to avoid that, and it was unavoidable."" Many developing countries were unable to send representatives to Glasgow to attend the conference in-person due to COVID travel restrictions. Participation was further hindered due to technical difficulties experienced during the first few days of the convention that limited their ability to participate remotely. MacDonald described COP26 as ""a big convention for climate nerds"" and admired the networking opportunities it presented. Abate, however, had a very different networking experience and expressed that he often felt that the environment was overwhelming. ""It was a landscape that was very different for me, having primarily attended academic conferences in my career,"" he said. MacDonald and Abate also had different perspectives about the successes and shortcomings of the conference, with Abate tending to have more pessimistic views about what he felt was unsubstantial progress. ""I'll try to say this with as little cynicism as I can - I would characterize the positive outcomes as seizing the low-hanging fruit. They're far better than not moving forward on these issues, but they are baby steps in the grand scheme of things,"" said Abate. Specifically, he referenced agreements among over 100 nations to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and commitments from countries with 90 percent of the world's forests to halt and reverse deforestation in that same time frame. According to Abate, these agreements were already being discussed prior to COP26 and were merely confirmed during the conference. ""I'm a little bit less cynical than Randy even though I agree with everything he said,"" commented MacDonald. He went on to explain general changes in attitude and high ambitions he observed at the conference that he believed were indicative of progress, specifically noting increased engagement from the private sector and commitments made by the U.S. to decarbonize the shipping industry and electrify vehicles. Adding to the conversation about U.S. involvement, Abate commented on the nation's recent role in the climate crisis and the influence politics has had on climate engagement. ""One thing to take away from the U.S. and its engagement on climate change for the past three decades is that regardless of whether we've had a Republican or a Democratic administration, it's been well below where it needs to be,"" he explained. ""The U.S. needs to be the leader that it was on international environment issues in the 80's. We were a leader, and then we became part of the problem for the next three decades."" Still, the U.S. has taken steps in the right direction to better address the climate crisis. Notable progress has been made since the Trump administration, reengagement in the COP process being one of the most prominent improvements thus far. Still, Abate pointed out that the Biden administration can only make so much progress without Congressional support, which has remained largely divided when it comes to implementing climate legislation. Youth engagement was also cited as another avenue of progress at COP26 . Abate noted the importance of involving youth activists in climate change regulation because ""it's the future they're going to inherit,"" but was still critical of what he described as participation opportunities that were ""better than nothing, but certainly not at the level that it should be."" Upon their return to Monmouth, Abate and MacDonald have been looking for ways to keep the conversation about climate change moving and incorporate it into different curriculums on campus. ""I think there are more opportunities than people recognize,"" said MacDonald. ""This is really an issue that will affect everybody, so there's a role for anyone at Monmouth who's interested in this whether it's their career or not."" \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA187","COP26 is performative climate activism","November 18, 2021 Thursday","Pipe Dream: SUNY at Binghamton","Close From Oct. 31 to Nov. 12, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) was held to address the issue of climate change. Those present included leaders such as President Joe Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Included also in attendance was Jeff Bezos. Although the stated purpose of the event was to combat climate change, many people have been less than confident in those who attended. This skepticism took the form of protests across the world, which accused COP26 of greenwashing, or behaving in a performative manner without putting forth real solutions. This skepticism is understandable, considering the presence of Bezos, CEO of Amazon and the second richest man in the world. Bezos, having recently returned from space, claimed that having seen Earth from above has given him a new perspective on its fragility and our need to conserve it. This is a nice sentiment. It would be more credible if not for the fact that Amazon increased its carbon footprint by 19 percent over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and that the majority of people threatened by climate change are able to understand its significance without a multibillion-dollar space flight. This reality was made apparent to millions of Americans as they suffered droughts, which resulted in wildfires in California just last year. It is ironic to hear someone like Bezos suddenly claim to be a climate activist, especially when considering that the rise of capitalism and the drive for profit is responsible. Carbon emissions began as much of the Western world began to industrialize. It is also worth noting that climate change was observed for the first time in the 1930s, and began to be discussed on the U.N. agenda in the 1970s. There has been increased awareness since, but for Bezos to present himself as having recently been enlightened after a $5.5 billion space flight - which cost more than the $2 billion he promised to contribute to battling climate change at the event - is damning. But the problematic nature of his being allowed to speak goes beyond incidents of hypocrisy. These contradictions are dwarfed by the ultimate contradiction of his attendance: he should have been a subject of discussion, rather than a guest. A serious examination of climate change should put at its focus the regulation of corporations like Amazon. Global warming is correlated with America's emergence as a capitalistic industrial powerhouse, and environmental conservation and the capitalist drive for resources are diametrically opposed. Positively, the nations present at the COP26 were able to come to an agreement. However, there were ways in which the results were insufficient. An agreement was reached to reduce gas emissions by over one gigaton by 2030, which is certainly an improvement, but this is still not enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Objections to the demand that coal use be eliminated were raised primarily by China and India, two countries that have only recently industrialized, along with the United States. Even this issue can be traced to the industrial capitalism that has given Bezos power. Industrialization is the only means for China and India, both of which suffered under imperialist intervention historically, to remain competitive and essentially hold onto their autonomy. It is worth noting as well that many of the products sold on Amazon are manufactured in China. This further ties carbon emissions to the profit drive. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that very little was done in helping developing countries adapt to more environmentally sustainable practices. In 2009, the developed world promised ""$100 billion a year by 2020"" to underdeveloped countries to help them adapt, according to bbc.com. However, this goal has not been achieved. Those present at the event discussed setting $100 billion as a goal for 2023, but experts are skeptical that that will be enough. It is understandable that among those who protested around the world included Indigenous activists from Brazil and Ecuador - areas which, like the rest of the Global South, will be affected drastically by climate change despite their low rates of emissions. Alina Averchenkova of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment has stated that ""we need to move trillions in both public and private money."" Thus far, we have fallen short of both what is needed and what we can afford. COP26 discussed issues that didn't seem to get resolved. It saw money promised that fails to address issues sufficiently. Those in attendance were those who have been in power as we have come closer and closer to an ecological collapse, and who have, for the most part, allowed us to continue on this track. It is little wonder that Greta Thunberg derided the event as ""people in power pretending to take our future seriously."" Desmond Keuper is a sophomore majoring in philosophy. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA188","COP26: WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?","November 15, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Chatham House: Analysing a crucial opportunity for enhancing ambitions on climate finance, adaptation, and 'loss and damage', and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Key findings Raising the ambition of national emission reduction targets (nationally determined contributions NDCs) was a critical task for COP26 . On this front, governments fell short: although over 120 parties have submitted new or updated NDCs, the new targets only narrow the gap to 1.5C by 1517 per cent, and are, if fully implemented (and this is far from certain), projected to result in warming of 2.4C by the end of the century. If warming is to be limited to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, additional emissions reductions before 2030, over and above current NDC pledges, will need to equate to reducing emissions by the equivalent of two years of current annual emissions. To keep warming to 2C, the equivalent reductions would be needed of one year's total emissions. The Glasgow Climate Pact the main political outcome of COP26 requests governments to revisit and strengthen their NDCs before the end of 2022 to bring these in line with the Paris Agreement's temperature goal. To keep 1.5C within reach, it will be absolutely essential that governments return to the table with significantly enhanced offers ahead of COP27, which will take place at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in 2022. Another key feature of the Glasgow Climate Pact is the reference to £ccelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies'. Although the language was watered down over the course of the negotiations, COP26 marks the first time ever reducing fossil fuels is mentioned in a COP decision. Discussions around climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage were centre stage in Glasgow, and were critical points of contention. Although the Glasgow Climate Pact urges developed countries to 'fully' deliver on the $100 billion annual climate finance pledge through to 2025, it remains unclear when this sum will actually be raised in full and if a total of $500 billion will be mobilized between 2020 and 2025 to make up for initial shortfalls. And while the Pact urges developed countries to double their adaptation finance by 2025, and establishes a dialogue on loss and damage finance, much more will need to be done to address the needs of climate-vulnerable developing countries. COP26 saw a flurry of plurilateral deals on key issues such as phasing out various forms of fossil fuels and ending deforestation. These initiatives have the potential to accelerate decarbonization, but monitoring their implementation and holding governments and other institutions to account will be critical. Future COPs provide a platform for doing this, and governments should seek to incorporate the pledges made outside the formal remits of the UNFCCC process in their NDCs. While some progress was made at COP26 , the next 12 months will be crucial in determining if the formal agreements reached in Glasgow provide grounds for optimism that 1.5C remains firmly in sight, and are sufficient to build trust between countries and between citizens and governments. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA189","COP26 and Article 6: Where Did Singapore End Up?","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 17, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com As COP26 Finally, on Saturday evening, the 'Glasgow Climate Pact' (the 'Pact') was announced, a deal agreed by almost 200 nations, including Singapore. The Pact has resolved a series of outstanding issues relating to the Paris Agreement and includes, crucially, terms for the implementation of Article 6, which have the potential to, in theory, provide a platform for the scaling up of carbon markets around the globe. As we highlighted last week (Singapore: COP26 and Creating a Center for Carbon Trading[1]), the specific issues relating to Article 6 that needed to be resolved were, essentially: Whether Article 6.2 should contribute to generating revenue for the 'Adaptation Fund' (the fund is designed to finance climate change adaptation projects and programs based on the priorities of eligible developing nations and is financed by a share of the proceeds arising from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) developed under the Kyoto Protocol). Concerns around the potential double-counting of credits from emissions reductions under Article 6.4. The eligibility of pre-2020 carbon credits for post-2020 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) (this was favored by emerging economies who are currently carrying significant volumes of credits from reductions in industrial emissions and forest conservation work). The means by which Article 6 could support adaptation action through generating finance for added adaptation via Article 6.28. The key terms of the Pact, insofar as they relate to Article 6, can be summarized as follows: Share of proceeds - a fixed tariff on emissions trading, set at 5 percent, has been agreed with a view to generating funding for climate adaption in developing nations. However, it should be noted that, in order to reach agreement, negotiators resolved to determine that the tariff would only apply to the trade of voluntary emissions but not national transfers made under Article 6.2. Countries seeking to apply Article 6.2 will instead be encouraged to contribute towards the Adaption Fund. Limitations on the use of pre-2020 credits - Negotiators have agreed to limit the use of pre-2020 credits from the United Nations' CDM, with the rationale being to avoid a wholesale flooding of the carbon credits market which could have sent prices cratering. The final text of the Pact provides that only CDM credits registered post-January 1, 2013, may be utilized for the purpose of national targets. The debate around the use of pre-2020 credits was a major sticking point in the negotiations, particularly for large emerging economies (such as Brazil, India and China) who dominated the CDM market from the outset. Corresponding adjustments - Countries hosting an emissions reduction project will now have the ability to determine whether the reductions will be allocated towards meeting its own national emissions target, or be sold elsewhere for other purposes. If the latter, the country is required to notify a UN supervisory board. Furthermore, Article 6.4 states that voluntary emissions reductions may only be used towards a country's NDC if they are so authorized by the UN and the host country must apply a corresponding adjustment for units which are ultimately sold abroad this is geared towards avoiding 'double-counting' by two countries in determining emissions reductions. Critically for Singapore, agreement on the terms and application of Article 6 helps to provide the island nation with a foundation to build on as it seeks to achieve its ambition of establishing itself as a global center for carbon trading. Falling under the 'Green Economy' pillar of the Green Plan (Energy in ASEAN: Singapore and Hydrogen[2]), the creation of a carbon trading and services hub will encompass 'green finance, sustainability, verification, credits trading and risk management.' Following the announcement that the Pact had been finalized, Grace Fu, Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and leader of the nation's delegation at COP26 , commented that the agreement was a 'big win for the multilateral approach to addressing climate change' and that 'while the work is not quite done yet, COP26 has laid a firm foundation for future progress, and is a positive step forward for raising climate ambition.1[3]' While the Pact has done much to provide clarity around the application of Article 6, there are two key concerns that need to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the compromise made to permit transfer of some credits from the CDM is likely to create an initial glut of credits in the future market and, in addition to the possibility of credit prices plummeting, there are also concerns related to the quality of certain legacy carbon credits. Secondly, implementation of the rules relating to corresponding adjustments will need to be strictly monitored and national governments will be required to devise regulations in order to ensure that they are applied appropriately.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with Alexandre Soares of UN News, Martina Donlon acknowledged that after two weeks of tough negotiations, the text that serves as the conference's outcome is  a compromise that it is not enough , especially for small island States and other vulnerable countries. However, it does provide some  positive steps forward . Indeed, she said, with the agreement by negotiators at COP26 to begin moving away from fossil fuels,  we will see more electric cars and they will become more affordable, and increasingly powered by wind and solar energy . Phasing down coal Ms. Donlon pointed out that at the conclusion of the conference, countries agreed to accelerate action during  this decisive decade to cut global emissions in half, to reach the temperature goal of 1.5C, as outlined in the landmark 2015 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement . The COP26 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021/outcomes-of-the-glasgow-climate-change-conference Glasgow Climate Pact Moreover, Ms. Donlon noted that the pact calls for a phase down of coal and a phase out of fossil fuel subsidies,  two key issues that had never been explicitly mentioned in a decision at climate talks before \- despite coal, oil and gas being the key drivers of global warming . According to the UN official, Glasgow signaled  an accelerated shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy . Doubling financial support The second most impactful outcome of the Glasgow pact is its call for the doubling of finance to support developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change.  Although this will not provide all of the funding needed by poorer countries, the fact that developed countries agreed to double their collective funds for adaptation is a major improvement, Ms. Donlon underscored. She stressed that the UN Secretary-General has been pushing for increased financing to protect lives and livelihoods, and said that this would  especially benefit least developed countries and small island States.

And COP26  So, these changes will have an impact on our lives, and probably sooner than we think, she said. Glasgow\' s ripple effects The phasing out of coal means people in heavily polluted cities will have cleaner air to breath and fewer respiratory illnesses, the UN official explained.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA193","COP26: DON'T FORGET THE SUCCESSES - OXFORD EXPERTS","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of Oxford: When the history of COP26 and the battle to reduce emissions is written, last minute manoeuvrings in Glasgow will be a feature. But the very real successes of this year's Conference of the Parties will also be writ large: years of negotiations over core issues resolved and the completion of the Paris rule book as well as a substantial package on mitigation. Years of negotiations over core issues [have been] resolved, the completion of the Paris rule book [has been achieved] as well as a substantial package on mitigation COP26 successes To some extent, these have been overwhelmed by the disappointments, but the achievements need to be differentiated and highlighted, according to Professor Benito Muller, Managing Director of Oxford Climate Policy and Convener of International Climate Policy Research at Oxford's Environmental Change Institute. He insists, 'When judging the outcome of COP 26...it is important to distinguish between the core business...concerning the multilateral climate regime and the announcements of heads of state/government...The latter has become much more prominent and is attracting many more people than the former.' Meanwhile, Professor Lavanya Rajamani, professor of international environmental law, says, ' COP26 delivered, against all odds, a substantial package on mitigation. 1.5C might be on its last gasp but it still has a fighting chance. The outcome on mitigation, including the work programme on mitigation, is a remarkable achievement, the credit for which should go to those developing countries like India that agreed to enhanced mitigation action in the face of decades of breached promises on finance and support, and rapidly diminishing fairness in these negotiations.' The outcome on mitigation, including the work programme on mitigation, is a remarkable achievement Professor Lavanya Rajamani Professor Muller explains the importance of the COP26 achievements, 'One of the key core-business objective of the UK COP Presidency was to finalise the rule book of the Paris Agreement...There were three outstanding issues which have been languishing in the negotiation without resolution ever since 2015: Article 6, transparency, and common time frames (CTF).' In his latest blog post, he explains:, 'I have had the honour of being part of a group of stakeholders that has been working tirelessly and doggedly over the past seven years to bring about the agreement on a common (5-year) time frame...under the Paris Agreement. Even though the odds were 4:1 stacked against us. 'It is difficult to say when the balance tipped towards the five-year frequency of NDC end-years but it was an uphill struggle.' I have had the honour of being part of a group...that has been working tirelessly and doggedly over the past seven years to bring about the agreement on a common (5-year) time frame...under the Paris Agreement. Even though the odds were 4:1 stacked against us Professor Benito Muller He continues, 'There is still something missing. It may sound complex, but it is important - the Glasgow Common Time Frame (CTF) decision does not include the request for regular (5-yearly) synchronised ambition updating. Revisiting and strengthening the ambition of NDCs that have been communicated earlier is key to harnessing much needed additional overall ambition; but to maximise the additional ambition, the process needs a time table for regular (5-yearly) synchronised updating.' \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA194","COP26: CARBON-FREE ENERGY TRANSITION QANDA WITH MATT CROZAT","October 28, 2021 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Nuclear Energy Institute: COP26 begins next week, and leaders across the world will be gathering in Glasgow to discuss climate change. A top line priority at COP26 is to secure global net zero carbon emissions by mid-century and limit global warming. This goal relies heavily on decarbonizing the electricity sector. Matt Crozat, NEIs Senior Director of Policy Development, answers a few of our questions about a carbon-free energy transition and how we can ensure job creation while making this move. COP26 will be a forum for countries to make commitments to reduce carbon emissions. Were seeing commitments to accelerate the transition from coal to carbon-free power. As we move to reduce carbon emissions, how does nuclear power fit into the mix? Nuclear energy is the largest source of carbon-free electricity in advanced economies and is playing a growing role in developing countries. The ability of nuclear plants to run every hour of the day and every day of the year makes nuclear energy a valuable foundation of a carbon-free economy. Nuclear energy works alongside wind and solar to enable a reliable electricity system without emitting greenhouse gases or air pollution. COP26 will delve into green growth, the idea that economies can grow while cutting emissions. How can nuclear energy advance economic growth while protecting the environment? Reliable electricity is necessary for economies to improve public health, enhance standards of living and develop industry. The ability of nuclear plants to provide large amounts of reliable, carbon-free power make them a vital part of a growing economic infrastructure. Their ability to do that without contributing to climate change makes them even more valuable. These plants also become economic engines for local communities by providing hundreds of well-paying jobs for decades. These plants create opportunities for the people who work there to have full careers that allow them to be permanent members of their communities. Countries at COP26 The first thing is for countries with operating nuclear plants to make sure they remain a foundation of the clean electricity system. Allowing nuclear plants to close makes the challenge of reaching a carbon-free target even more daunting. Next, demonstrate and commercialize new nuclear technologies. We are in the midst of realizing a new generation of reactor designs that build upon decades of experience. Finally, create the business environment to enable investment in new nuclear plants. This means establishing confidence that we will make long-term investments into this transition to a low-carbon economy. \"

They have come up with a design for such a skyscraper called the Urban Sequoia in homage to the famous redwood trees. In their presentation[1], representatives for SOM noted that urban areas[2] are the primary emitters of carbon dioxide[3], accounting for approximately a third of all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. And the problem is only going to grow worse as the population of the world grows. They suggest that one way to reduce emissions is to change the way large buildings are designed instead of being huge emitters, they claim, the buildings could actually be huge collectors. The team at SOM envisions skyscrapers incorporating technology that either sequesters carbon[4] pulled from the air or stores it for sale to manufacturers. They see buildings made of materials that absorb carbon, serving as a carbon sink over the course of their lifetimes. They also see buildings with areas dedicated to growing plants and algae both of which could be used to capture carbon and to provide fuel for the building. And they also suggest that the building itself could be designed in a way that captures carbon from the air using what they describe as a ""stack effect."" In such a design[5], air would be drawn into a central part of the building, where carbon-extraction devices could be put to work 24 hours a day. They suggest such a building would have a lifetime of approximately 60 years during which it would absorb up to four times as much carbon as was released. Credit: SOM The team[6] at SOM point out that carbon extracted from a building could be used to create road paving materials, pipes or other parts of urban structures. And they suggest that if all new buildings were made to collect more carbon than they emit, urban greenhouse gas emissions could be greatly reduced perhaps by as much as 1.6 billion tons a year.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA197","Reasons to Be Hopeful About Climate Action After COP26","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 15, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com On the face of it, COP26 - the climate meeting in Glasgow - has failed, with the world still heading for 2.4C warming this century. This would be catastrophic for humans and nature. So why am I hopeful? The short answer is that the decarbonisation of our global society, and the economic system that underpins it, has become inevitable and unstoppable. What's more, COP26 , despite the painful process of disappointing compromises of UN negotiations, has indisputably accelerated the pace. My conclusion is based on an understanding of the science of complex, living systems and how they change. This analysis, which is further elaborated in my book, Thriving[1], applies three tests to determine whether we are moving rapidly in the direction of regeneration rather than decline. The tests ask: are we increasing or decreasing complex coherence, creative convergence, and cyclical continuity? If they are all increasing, we stand a good chance that the forces of breakthrough will outpace the forces of breakdown. Test 1: Complex coherence The first test recognises that all living systems - from forests to families, oceans to organisations, cities to economies - are made up of complex networks of relationships, joined together by a coherent function or purpose. The more connections there are and the more aligned their common purpose, the more the system thrives. So, did COP26 help or hinder the emergence of complex coherence? The meeting reached a consensus agreement among nearly 200 countries to take bolder action to tackle climate change. Strategic alliances of hundreds of countries, companies and NGOs emerged around phasing out fossil fuels, cutting methane, reversing deforestation and scaling clean energy. Key points of coherence emerged around keeping the 1.5C target alive, making the 2020s the decade of bold action, funding a just transition. The race to zero has turned from an elite sport to a global movement. Test 2: Creative convergence The second test recognises that change in living systems happens when there is a convergence of factors that reinforce one another. The scientists call these positive feedback loops. The industrial revolution, for example, happened because of a convergence of changes in technologies, transport, and energy, resulting in a boom of innovation that improved our quality of life dramatically. So, did COP26 strengthen or weaken creative convergence? We have seen a convergence of bolder government policy positions, increased levels of finance, more active commitments by business and rising pressure from civil society. We have also seen convergence through a swath of unprecedented agreements among businesses, banks, philanthropists, and NGOs, to scale up innovation (like the Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda) and to support the transition with finance (like the $130tn of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero). This has set off a chain of self-reinforcing effects - a virtuous spiral. Cyclical continuity The third test recognises that the balance and continuity of life is ensured through cycles and flows, where growth is moderated through counteracting forces, which scientists call balancing feedback loops. For a living system to survive and thrive, it must constantly moderate, constrain, repair and renew itself. So, did COP26 enhance or erode cyclical continuity? The jury is still out on this one. We have upset the balance of the Earth, already exceeding four of the nine planetary boundaries (climate change, biosphere integrity, land system change, and biochemical flows), pushing us into the danger zone of systems collapse. Keeping 1.5 alive at COP26 , together with the agreements on deforestation, cutting fossil fuels and increasing renewable energy, can help to put us back on a path of healing and regeneration. We are giving ourselves and the billions of organisms we share the planet with a fighting chance to survive. A breakthrough movement of hope COP26 convincingly passes two of the three tests for ensuring thriving systems, with the third test a borderline pass/fail. This perspective requires that we do not judge Glasgow as a make-or-break moment in time, but rather as a crucial step in a remarkable journey of global transformation. To use a film metaphor, we should not get stuck focusing on an isolated movie-still; we need to consider the larger movie plot that is unfolding. My hope is not blind optimism or wishful thinking. Hope is planted in the fertile soil of the possibility for change, and nurtured by urgent, bold action. We are in a fight for our lives. And yet we know from studying the science of systems that change can happen remarkably quickly when there is an alignment of the forces of complexity, coherence, creativity, convergence, circularity, and continuity. This should be the key takeaway message from Glasgow: We have not yet solved the climate crisis. We have not yet aligned with the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C. We are not yet acting according to the science. But we have made real progress. The International Energy Agency has calculated that, if we factor in all the agreements announced at COP26 , and if they are met in full and on time, they would be enough to hold the rise in global temperatures to 1.8 C. I draw hope from this, but even more from the fact that COP26 has successfully created a virtuous cycle of reinforcing, enabling conditions for systems change to accelerate. Now we need to go out and make it happen. --- Highlights from COP26 More than 100 countries have agreed to reverse deforestation by 2030, backed by $19.2bn. More than 90 countries have agreed to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% from current levels by 2030. More than 40 countries have agreed to end their investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. More than 10 countries have agreed to phase out oil and gas production. India has committed to reach net zero by 2070, including reaching 50% renewable energy by 2030. China and the US have agreed to work together to increase the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles and to cut methane in the 2020s The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) is aiming to unlock $100bn to ensure access to clean affordable energy everywhere by everyone. The Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda is bringing innovation to the hard-to-decarbonise sectors of power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) represents 450 firms across 45 countries and over $130tn of private capital that is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero. --- This article draws on themes from the book Thriving: The Breakthrough Movement to Regenerate Nature, Society and the Economy[2] (Fast Company Press, February 2022), available for pre-ordering.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA200","COP26: Participants Praise US, China Climate Agreement","November 11, 2021 Thursday","Oil Daily","The US-China climate cooperation agreement announced late Wednesday has been welcomed by participants and observers of the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, who suggest it has helped to improve the mood as the conference enters its final and most difficult phase. COP26 President Alok Sharma told a press conference on Thursday that the deal between the world\'e2\€  s two biggest carbon emitters was \'e2\€  good news,\'e2\€ and that he hoped the spirit of cooperation in that agreement helps to \'e2\€  drive forward\'e2\€ the negotiations in their last few days. \'e2\€  I think it does help to provide some momentum,\'e2\€ Sharma said. Building Consensus \'e2\€  It's an opportunity for China and the US within their respective negotiating groups, and talking to other parties, to encourage them as well,\'e2\€ Sharma said. However, Sharma acknowledged that a positive negotiated outcome at COP26 remains contingent on reaching a consensus between almost 200 countries, which will not be easily achieved. EU Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans agreed that the agreement has \'e2\€  huge political significance.\'e2\€ The agreement is particularly important because it shows that despite \'e2\€  many areas of conflicting views,\'e2\€ the US and China have declared that climate is an issue that \'e2\€  transcends all differences,\'e2\€ he said. And while there are still many areas of disagreement between countries at the summit, Timmermans agreed that the declaration could help move the negotiations forward. Practical Help Along with describing the climate crisis \'e2\€  in more serious language than before,\'e2\€ the declaration also offers some practical help for the Glasgow talks, Bernice Lee, the research director for UK-based policy institute Chatham House, told a press huddle. This includes cooperation on tackling methane emissions as well as working on enhancing climate action in the near term, with both the US and China saying they will come forward with new, more ambitious nationally determined contributions in 2025, which could be key to keeping hopes of achieving the 1.5\'c2\'b0C Paris goal alive. Article 6 The International Emissions Trading Association noted that the US and China pledged to work cooperatively to complete the rulebook for Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement, which covers carbon markets. This could help push those negotiations across the finishing line, with some progress having already been made this week. Environmental campaigners also welcomed the US-China announcement, with Greenpeace\'e2\€  s Li Shou suggesting that it could help \'e2\€  calm down the temperature in the rooms at COP26\'e2\€ as negotiations become more heated in their final days. However it is still far from saving the planet, he added. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the global climate and energy leader at the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), commended the US-China cooperation as well. Having the two countries, which together represent around 40% of global emissions, talking about the need to raise climate ambitions sends a strong political signal, he told a press briefing. Echoes of Paris The US-China climate cooperation agreement represents a step toward detoxifying the relationship between the countries. Prior cooperation between the two nations was very important in securing the Paris Agreement in 2015, said Pulgar-Vidal. However, he also noted that this political signal will need to be \'e2\€  well-grounded in domestic actions\'e2\€ in both countries, which WWF will be watching for. COP26 is due to end at 6 p.m. UK time on Friday, but there are still many areas of disagreement and the talks are widely expected to run into overtime, with negotiators working through the night and into Saturday. At the COP25 summit in Madrid in 2019, an agreement wasn\'e2\€  t reached until the early hours of Sunday morning. Ronan Kavanagh \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA201","COP26 Final Hours: Don't forget people caught up in crisis","ASEAN Tribune"," ","13 November 2021 (International Rescue Committee) With the final hours of negotiations at COP26 underway, the IRC is urging world leaders to prevent catastrophic levels of emissions and to support the poorest countries to adapt to the immediate consequences of climate change, already playing out in places where the IRC works. The draft text from COP26 which was released yesterday lays out important, but insufficient, steps to meet this double challenge. Despite new and updated emissions pledges, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees C average temperature rise, far beyond the goal of remaining below 1.5 degrees C. Climate finance and vital support for adaptation remains a critical sticking point for the ongoing negotiations. It is a terrible symbol of neglect that the original pledge for developing countries of $100 billion in climate finance by 2020 will not be met until the end of 2022. Climate finance for adaptation to least-developed countries currently stands at $15 billion per year, out of the $80 billion in climate finance currently mobilized. This is a fraction of what is needed for people living with the climate crisis now. The IRC welcomes new pledges for climate adaptation made at COP26 , including President Biden's $3 billion in adaptation finance annually until 2024 and the EU's pledge of $100 million to the COP26 adaptation fund, which raised over $350 million in total at COP26 . The UN however estimates that $300 billion will be needed by 2030 for climate adaptation alone. The IRC is warning that the massive financial void will leave vulnerable, specially fragile and conflict-affected countries, with little support. These are places where climate change is already an extreme and everyday reality: Drought across 80% of Afghanistan is driving acute hunger and food insecurity; In Ethiopia, already one of the sites of the devastating 2012 famine in the Horn of Africa and an unprecedented locust outbreak last year, 11 million people are already facing crisis levels of food insecurity as conflict rages in the Tigray region. Last year, we witnessed over 1.4 million people displaced in Northern Central America due to the deadly combination of ongoing conflict and multiple natural disasters. The impact is already being felt as rising temperatures, drought and extreme weather conditions contribute to food shortages and spiralling hunger. Women and girls are suffering the most from climate change. The UK's COP26 Presidency signalled a commitment to women and girls by launching new, dedicated funding to advance gender equality in climate action, however its scale and geographical reach is too limited to meet the global challenge; commitments to support women and girls disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis must not end here. David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said: ' COP26 needs to remember the poorest and most vulnerable in its final hours. This was billed as a critical moment for the international community to come together and make much-needed progress in tackling the climate crisis before it's too late. But for IRC's clients around the world already facing emergency climate conditions, time has already run out. In these critical final hours of negotiations, global leaders must keep the devastating implications for the lives of the most vulnerable people at the forefront of their minds - and ensure they are made part of the final agreement. ""It is crucial that both tests set at this year's conference are met: to prevent the catastrophic breach of 1.5 degrees C rise in temperature, and step up to help the most at-risk communities adapt to the climate change already underway. ""The US-China agreement for further cooperation is significant, a sign that the shared dangers of the climate crisis cannot be ignored. But the impact of the existential threat posed by climate change is spread unevenly - and thus far, vulnerable populations are being all but assured that they will continue to bear the brunt. With climate finance and adaptation funding woefully insufficient, large swathes of the global population will be left defenseless against a problem they did not cause. ""The climate crisis speaks to a gross mismanagement of the global commons and a collective failure by countries to live up to their responsibilities. The great injustice is that these failures will be felt most deeply by people already mired in humanitarian catastrophe, and who contributed the least. The world, especially the world's most vulnerable, cannot afford for these negotiations to fail.' \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA202","Bringing COP26 to people everywhere","Google Public Policy Blog","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 26, 2021( Google Public Policy Blog: https://blog.google/topics/public-policy/ Delivered by Newstex) This November at COP26 , global leaders will meet in Glasgow to discuss how to jointly address the challenge of climate change. Recent research has found that more than 70% of the global population is concerned or fearful about climate change. So we're focused on making this year's conference accessible to everyone. In partnership with the COP26 Presidency, we'll livestream the activities through YouTube and Google Arts and Culture, helping COP26 expand the reach of its digital channels. YouTube creators at the conference will create content[1] to share with their global audiences, and we'll publish video, imagery and artworks from 'the green zone'  the center of COP26 activity  via a new page on Google Arts and Culture[2], inviting people everywhere to learn about the discussions and activities taking place. ""I'm delighted COP26 is partnering with Google to help bring the Green Zone of COP26 to the world in a few days' time,' COP President-Designate Alok Sharma said. 'With more than 200 captivating and diverse events on offer we want everyone to have the opportunity to learn more about climate action and help protect our planet."" Our work at COP26 How we're leading at Google At Google, our goal is to achieve net zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We aim to reduce the majority of our emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We were the first major company to operate as carbon neutral in 2007, and have matched our energy use with 100 percent renewable energy for four years in a row[4]. Last year we set a moonshot goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy[5] by 2030 for all of our data centers and campuses. That means that by the end of the decade, we aim to deliver every search, every email, and every YouTube video without emitting carbon. We're making strong progress  in 2020 we achieved 67% carbon-free energy on an hourly basis across our data centers, up from 61% in 2019. Five of our data centers, including those in Denmark and Finland, are at or near 90% carbon-free energy. On our campuses we're investing in sustainable energy innovations, like dragonscale solar[6] and geothermal pilings, to get us closer to our goal to be carbon-free by 2030. We hope these new technologies will inspire similar projects from others that advance sustainability without compromising design and aesthetics. How we're enabling our partners Urban areas are currently responsible for 70% of the world's carbon emissions. Last year we pledged to help more than 500 cities[7] reduce one gigaton of carbon emissions per year by 2030 via Google's Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE). EIE is helping major cities, including Amsterdam, Birmingham UK and Copenhagen, map their emissions data, solar potential, and air quality[8] for their remediation plans. Technology can also help cities decarbonize in more direct ways. We recently shared an early research project that is deploying AI to help cities make their traffic lights more efficient, and we have a pilot program in Israel accomplishing this. So far, we have seen a 10-20% reduction in fuel consumption and delay time[9] at intersections. We're excited to expand this pilot to Rio de Janeiro and beyond. Finally, we're helping business customers like Whirlpool, Etsy, HSBC, Unilever and Salesforce develop solutions for the specific climate change challenges they face. Unilever is working with the power of Google Cloud and satellite imagery through Google Earth Engine to help avoid deforestation in their supply chain. At Cloud Next, we launched Carbon Footprint[10], a tool that helps large and small businesses understand their gross carbon emissions associated with the electricity of their Google Cloud Platform usage. This new information will help companies track progress toward their own climate targets. How we're aiming to empower everyone In addition to businesses, increasingly individuals are focused on what more they can do to help the planet. That's why we committed to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022 through Google's products and services. Recently, we shared several new ways people can use Google's products to make sustainable choices[11]  from choosing eco-friendly routes[12] and searching for greener flights[13], hotels[14], and appliances to supporting clean energy from home with Nest[15] and surfacing authoritative information on climate change from sources like the United Nations. Google's goal is to make the sustainable choice an easier choice  for governments, businesses, and individuals. We look forward to a carbon-free future and are excited to continue the conversation at COP26 .

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA203","ANS URGES COP26 TO RECOGNIZE NUCLEAR ENERGY'S CLIMATE ROLE","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the American Nuclear Society (ANS): On behalf of over 10,000 nuclear engineers, scientists, and technologists, the American Nuclear Society urges COP 26 delegates to insist that any agreement arising from COP26 include a strong role for nuclear technology in achieving carbon reduction targets. Deep decarbonization and electrification of the global economy will require the increased availability of firm, ""dispatchable"" zero-carbon energy technologies. Nuclear energy is the only energy source with a proven track record of producing firm, zero-carbon energy at the scale needed to meet global goals. Indeed, it's increasingly clear that achieving net-zero worldwide carbon emissions is simply not feasible without a significant expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy worldwide. Specifically, we urge the delegates to assume that a significant commercial deployment of new reactor designs and advanced nuclear fuel will occur in the 2030 timeframe and to acknowledge that such a scale-up will require a significant investment in research and development funding for advanced nuclear technologies. Deep decarbonization requires action in all sectors of the world economy, not just electricity generation. As such, we urge delegates to recognize the inherent advantages of employing nuclear technology for industrial process heat, hydrogen production, district heating, and desalination. To achieve decarbonization as rapidly and efficiently as possible, governments and policymakers must implement technology-neutral, performance-based climate and energy policies that treat all carbon-free energy sources fairly and equally. Nuclear must be treated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies. Delegates should not accept anything short of fair and equal treatment for nuclear energy vis-a-vis other zero-carbon sources, as doing so would be fundamentally incompatible with global progress on climate, economic prosperity and energy security. As a recognized civil society organization with UN observer status, ANS will be on the ground in Glasgow during COP26 where we are sponsoring ten delegates from the Young Generation Network. As representatives of ANS, the pro-nuclear delegates will be attending events in the exclusive bluezone during the next two weeks. ANS's social media channels will be resharing photos, videos, and observations from our COP26 delegates who hail from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. ANS is also taking our message directly to COP26 attendees by participating in Nuclear For Climate's booth where ANS's logo and images will be on display. Our message at COP26 is clear: Carbon-free nuclear energy must be a part of our climate solution and the time to act is now. Six years on from the Paris Agreement, our world leaders need to get serious about climate change and that starts by preserving and expanding nuclear energy. Sincerely, Craig H. Piercy, Executive Director and CEO of the American Nuclear Society Steven P. Nesbit, President of the American Nuclear Society \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA204","#COP26: Where's the incentive?","The Finanser by Chris Skinner","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 03, 2021( The Finanser by Chris Skinner: HYPERLINK https://thefinanser.com https://thefinanser.com The discussions of today's COP26 interested me, as it's all about the money[1]. Ambitious plans to create a huge pool of money to invest in a green future will turn the UK into 'the world's firstnet zero[4]-aligned financial centre', with companies managing $130 trillion of assets committing to the goal of holding global warming below 1.5C,Rishi Sunak[5]has said. I love this idea but like the Queen I wonder if they're just talking and not doing. Everyone can say they are dedicated to climate change and then just not bother. It's like me saying that by 2030 I will have dieted, given up smoking and no longer drink wine. It's a New Year's Resolution, and how many of us keep our New Year's Resolutions? It's blah-blah-blah[6]. So, what's the answer? Well Kate Mackenzie touched on this in her article I discussed yesterday[7], but my focus is three-fold: We need countries that are rich to invest in countries that are poor to manage climate issues We need to encourage countries with rare wildlife to create eco-tourism We need the world to move from greed to inclusion First, there are many countries who rely on industries that destroy the planet. People who dig for coal, cut down trees and farming with cattle. There are millions, or over a billion, of these people. You cannot just end their jobs and industries overnight. Banks can help to do that but have no incentives. The governments of the world need to change this if we are to meet net-zero emissions, but governmental economies rely on these industries. You have a viscous circle of reliance on destroying the planet through industries that don't care. How do you change that? Second, biodiversity is at huge risk. Over half of the world's species have disappeared in the last century. We need to get countries to move from hunting with guns to hunting with cameras and selfies. That one seems to be working quite well. When I saw gorillas in Rwanda, we had to pay a fee for access that was quite high. I didn't mind paying the fee as it funds the biodiversity and protection of the environment for these species. Third, to move from greed to inclusion relates to the two points above. The incentive for inclusion is to save the world, but why would I want to save the world if there is no incentive. The incentive for seeing gorillas in Rwanda is the experience. The incentive for saving the world is the experience. If governments actively incentivised industries, business, commerce and consumers to have better experiences, they would convert. So, what's the answer? The answer is not cash or investment, although that is a part of it. The answer is experience or, more pedantically, it's about experiential marketing. If governments could offer tax incentives, support programmes and budget reallocations for carbon offsets every time a consumer or business used renewable energy and stopped planet destroying activities, maybe things would change. And yes, they do some of this already but if I have a family dependent upon deforestation, digging for fossil fuel or moving people from A to B, what are you offering me to stop doing that? That's the question and there's the rub. I don't have all the answers, but I know the one big one is that I'm happy to change if there's a reward. What are the rewards for stopping flying, driving electric and heating with sunshine?

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA208","Sharing Resources: Key to COP26 Success, says SHARE International","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","CaliforniaNewswire","In its push to control runaway climate change, the 26th Conference of the Parties must assist developing nations BERKELEY, Calif. /California Newswire/ - World leaders meet in Glasgow beginning October 31 for the United Nations COP26 Climate Change Conference, to address the conclusions of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report: that human activities have unequivocally warmed and damaged the planet. Share International attributes 80 percent of the warming to human actions, and says sharing resources to mitigate the inevitable consequences is key to solving climate change. As early as 2007, an article by a Master of Wisdom, recorded by the late British author Benjamin Creme and published in Share International magazine, gave this 80 percent figure and stated that we have a pivotal choice to make: to reap the beneficial results of immediate action, or face the destruction that would ensue from doing nothing, or too little. The article stated that the World Teacher for this age, Maitreya, who is gradually emerging into public view, ""will advocate a simpler form of living, one more in keeping with the planet's situation. When enough people are convinced that this is necessary,"" it presaged, ""there will be a growing movement to simplify throughout the planet."" It further predicted that ""faced with the dilemma of necessary change, men will come to realize the inevitability of accepting the principle of sharing. Only sharing will make these changes practical and possible."" Although the effects of climate change are coming faster than scientists anticipated, the IPCC report affirms there is still time to slow or even reverse some changes by reducing CO2 emissions to at least net zero. But to accomplish this globally, the wealthier countries must not only curb their own emissions but also share resources and technology with less developed nations, to ensure that all can make the necessary rapid transition to sustainable energy sources. Three of the four goals of COP26 require potentially large financial investments: radical emissions reductions, strengthening adaptation to climate impacts, and mobilizing finances. The fourth is for countries to work together to accomplish these pressing but inescapable measures. The COP26 web site indicates, however, that developed countries have not even made good on their 2009 Copenhagen Accord pledge to mobilize by 2020 at least $100 billion in climate finance per year for developing nations. Another impediment noted by Jeffrey Sachs, president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network, is that poor countries must borrow internationally at rates of 5 to 10 percent, and many have no access to capital markets at all, while rich countries benefit from near-zero interest rates. Clearly, politicians have not yet responded to the climate crisis at levels commensurate with the danger, but COP26 offers a pivotal opportunity. To succeed at their stated goal of ""uniting the world to tackle climate change,"" COP26 participants will need to go beyond inequitable loan financing and fast-track unconditional sharing of the financial and technological resources necessary to bring all countries on board. This is in line with Maitreya's rallying call to humanity: ""Share and save the world."" Share International USA is a non-profit educational organization established to disseminate information about the presence in the world of the Masters of Wisdom, led by Maitreya.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA209","COP26 THROUGH THE EYES OF THREE TUCK STUDENTS","November 23, 2021 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth: by Kirk Kardashian For students who attend, it's an experience that stays with them and builds upon the many climate-related courses and programs available at Tuck. This year, COP26 was held in Glasgow, Scotland, and it generated more than the usual amount of attention, due to a year of catastrophic climate-change-related weather disasters, including record heat waves, droughts, flooding and forest fires. Through sponsorship and organization provided by the Center for Business, Government and Society (CBGS) and the Revers Center for Energy, Tuck sent a delegation of six T'22s to COP26 , where they had observer status and could sit in on negotiations and panel discussions, and network with professionals at the intersection of climate change, business, and public policy. They were led by Hannah Payson, executive director for the Center for Business, Government and Society, and Tracy Bach, a law professor, experienced climate change law and policy analyst, international negotiations advisor, researcher, and social entrepreneur who has been attending COP for years. ""It's critical that our students have a front-row seat as they prepare to tackle these challenges as business leaders,"" says Payson. ""Exposing Tuck students to the mechanics of decision-making in a real-world context is at the heart of how Centers amplify the MBA curriculum with transformational learning experiences,"" adds April Salas, the executive director of the Revers Center for Energy. Three of the students who attended COP26 from Tuck are Abigail Gary, Kaitlin Horan, and Sam Gant. Here's a bit about their backgrounds, why they went to Glasgow, and what they got out of it. Abigail Gary T'22 Abigail Gary came to Tuck with five years of experience working with governments in Chile and Peru on public-private partnerships in the education sector. She came back to the U.S. a little disenchanted about working in government, and curious about the role businesses can play in making change. Before enrolling at Tuck, Gary worked with a foundation that does CSR consulting for large Chilean multinational firms, and that solidified her interest in not only attending business school, but also getting a master's degree in public policy. She's currently a dual-degree student at Tuck and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. ""I thought it would be really important to be able to speak the business language, not just the impact policy language,"" she says. ""I wanted to be able to make the business case for these public policy programs."" At Tuck, Gary is a fellow at the CBGS, a director of the Tuck ESG (environmental, social and governance) Funda student-led fund that invests in equities with an ESG negative and positive screenand a director of the Tuck Social Venture Fund, which does impact investing in early-stage companies. Those experiences have taught her a lot about the importance of proper measurement in impact-related endeavors. ""Right now is an interesting time for ESG metrics,"" she says, ""because people are starting to measure, standardize, and audit it. That was my main reason for attending COP26 ."" Gary left Glasgow more motivated and energized than she expected. Previous COPs have made little progress on a binding global agreement to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and this version didn't produce many breakthroughs. Still, Gary is optimistic because of the massive collaborative effort every country is making towards reducing climate change. ""Seeing everyone working on the problem, that was powerful,"" she says. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA210","UNICEF Fact Sheet: COP26 - Children and Climate Change","November 2, 2021 Tuesday 10:15 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRep) -- UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) issued the following fact sheet: UNICEF will be at COP26 to ensure that the climate crisis is recognized as a crisis for children and their rights, to promote approaches to decrease climate risk for those who are most vulnerable, and to support children and young people's participation in COP26 as part of efforts to support children and young people's participation in climate-related decision-making. "" COP26 COP26 have a significant, time-sensitive opportunity to redirect the terrible path we are on. They can do so by committing to strengthening the resilience of services that children depend upon, and by cutting emissions faster and deeper. The futures of billions of children depend on it."" Key Messages: The climate crisis is a child rights crisis.  Climate change poses a major threat to children and young people's health, nutrition, education, development, survival and future potential. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors.  Critically, current and future generations of children will have to navigate an uncertain future where the current model of growth that links economic development to environmental exploitation is no longer viable.  An August UNICEF report, The Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), found almost every child on earth is exposed to at least one climate and environmental hazard, such as heatwaves, cyclones, air pollution, flooding and water scarcity.  Approximately 1 billion children - nearly half the world's children - live in 33 countries classified in the Index as ""extremely high-risk"". These children face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education.  An estimated 850 million children - over one third of all children - live in areas where at least four of climate and environmental shocks overlap, and as many as 330 million children live in areas affected by a staggering five major climate shocks.  Children from countries that contribute the least to climate change suffer the greatest consequences. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit 9 per cent of CO2 emissions. The 10 highest-risk countries collectively emit only 0.5 per cent of global emissions.  Improving the resilience of key services that children depend upon is often the best investment to reduce the risks they face.  Access to resilient water, sanitation and hygiene services reduces risks for 415 million children.  Climate-smart health services reduce risks for 460 million children.  Resilient schools and education systems reduce risks for 275 million children.  And climate-responsive social safety nets reduce risks for 310 million children. Action at COP26  Increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience.  UNICEF urges developed countries to exceed their 2009 promise to mobilize $US100 billion annually in climate finance in light of evidence that these sums are insufficient to address the scale of climate impacts. UNICEF urges a greater emphasis on funding to build climate resilience and adaptive capacity.  Mitigation efforts will take decades to reverse the impacts of climate change, and for the children of today, this will be too late. Unless we invest heavily in adaptation and resilience of social services for the 4.2 billion children born over the next 30 years, these children will face increasingly high risks to their survival and well-being.  Critical services must be adapted, such as water, sanitation and hygiene systems, health and education services.  It is imperative that, at COP26 , countries commit to increasing investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children, prioritising the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. The decisions made at COP26 will shape the lives of every child in every nation on earth, now and in the future.  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  UNICEF is urging countries to cut their emissions by at least 45 per cent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2030 to keep warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The number of children that UNICEF estimates to be at 'extremely high-risk' of the impacts of climate change will likely increase as the impacts of climate change accelerate.  Include young people in all climate negotiations and decisions.  UNICEF supports young people's calls for governments to end the consistent omission of young people, especially those from the most affected places.  Young people continue to demand comprehensive, bold climate action from decision makers. As yet, the action demanded has not materialized to the levels required.  Children and young people are underrepresented in policies and policy discussions despite being the major stakeholder in their outcomes. They are therefore limited in their ability to influence decisions that are critical to their future.  Children's rights and voices must be reflected and included in the implementation of the Paris Agreement at national, regional and international levels. COP26 presents a critical opportunity to formalise this. 2022 will mark 30 years since the UNFCCC Convention was drafted and yet in that time, there has never been a decision focused on children and young people in climate action taken under the UNFCCC.  Every government must provide climate education for children and young people so that they can meaningfully contribute to and participate in climate policy and action.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA211","American Society of Heating & Refrigerating Addresses Climate Change Solutions at U.N.'s COP26","November 12, 2021 Friday 9:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSOps) -- The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers issued the following news release on Nov. 11, 2021: ASHRAE was represented at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, held from October 31-November 12. ASHRAE formally participated as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and an official COP observer. The United Nations granted permission for select organizations to participate in COP26 activities. More than 60 of the largest and most influential international architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, planning, and construction firms, along with two dozen organizations representing over one million building industry professionals worldwide, issued a Communique to government leaders headed to COP26 challenging them to step up their emissions reduction targets for the built environment. The firms and organizations are signatories of the 1.5 C COP26 Communique -- an open letter to sovereign governments demonstrating the firms' and organizations' commitment to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5 C carbon budget and demanding governments do the same. ASHRAE's focus at COP26 was to emphasize the importance of the building community's participation in addressing the climate crisis. Architecture 2030 and ASHRAE hosted a COP26 Official Side Event on November 10 featuring the 1.5 C COP26 Communique and its signatories. The event titled 65% by 2030 / ZERO by 2040: Top 200 Global Firms and Organizations Lead With 1.5 C Climate Actions highlighted ways in which the signatories are responding to the urgency of the climate crisis and specific actions to decarbonize the built world and meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5 C carbon budget. At the side event, 2021-22 ASHRAE Treasurer Ginger Scoggins, P.E., Fellow ASHRAE, CEM, CxA, highlighted the world's growing building stock and the role of built environment organizations, such as ASHRAE, in assisting both policymakers and industry leaders in better understanding their impact on our climate change solutions. ""ASHRAE signed onto the 1.5 C COP26 Communique and we are here today because engineers and scientists involved with HVACR and building systems have been and will continue to be advancing solutions to address climate change,"" said Scoggins. ""We are here because we recognize that the built environment is a key source contributing to the world's greenhouse gas emissions and with the building stock continuing to expand and doubling by 2050, solutions from the buildings community is ever more critical."" Additionally, Scoggins spoke about the credibility of ASHRAE's technical resources and global standing in the development of consensus-based standards. ""ASHRAE's flagship Energy Conservation Standard 90.1 is the benchmark for commercial building energy codes in the United States and has been a key basis for codes and standards around the world for more than 45 years, reducing energy consumption by 50%, yet only 38 countries have specifically named building standards and codes in their Nationally Determined Contributions,"" said Scoggins. ""Many of the countries where the building stock is expected to grow do not require energy standards for buildings. ASHRAE signed the buildings industry's communique, and we are ready to help policy makers and the buildings industry around the world transform our building stock into one that is sustainable, resilient, and healthy. We are here to be part of the solution and we are up to the challenge."" In a separate statement, 2021-21 ASHRAE President Mick Schwedler, P.E., Fellow ASHRAE, LEED AP, commented on ASHRAE's participation at COP26 and shared additional ways that the Society is addressing climate change. ""ASHRAE's climate action efforts exemplify the Society's core dedication to engineering excellence in environmental stewardship,"" said Schwedler. ""The ASHRAE Global Headquarters building renovation project demonstrates that existing buildings can be transformed into net-zero-energy structures cost-effectively, using current off-the shelf technologies. Our Advanced Energy Design Guides, developed with our partners, provide zero energy K-12 schools and office buildings guides to equip designers in achieving zero energy and significantly reducing carbon. ASHRAE is proud to work with other world leaders to not only raise awareness of the issues surrounding climate change, but collectively seek to redefine the built environment for the times and continually explore what is possible through industry leading innovation.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA212","Glass Half Full: Cornell's COP26 Delegation Returns Informed, Inspired","December 17, 2021 Friday 9:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSRes) -- Cornell University issued the following news: By Jana Wiegand Last month, 10 Cornell faculty traveled to Glasgow, Scotland to participate in the United Nations' climate summit, COP26 , where they met with policy-makers, business representatives, researchers and activists from around the world -- all trying to finesse the finer details of the Paris Accord and refine global commitments to combating climate change. While governments discussed the billions of dollars they were allocating to meet existing commitments, advocates called for even more urgent action -- citing the trillions of dollars needed every year to keep global warming from surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius. They put the heat on negotiators, trying to convince parties from all sectors to make up the gap. Glen Dowell, the Henrietta Johnson Louis Professor of Management, noticed a clear shift in corporate conversations compared to COP23, which he also attended in 2017. ""In prior years, the discussion focused on whether there was a business case to take climate action,"" he said. ""Now, in many companies -- even the large emitters -- the conversations are around how to accomplish the goals, how to report and how to get to the scale we need."" Investors are paying closer attention to firms' carbon commitments, Dowell said, and after a standardized accountability system is in place, then they can put even more pressure on companies whose efforts are falling short. In 2020, the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, took a public stance. CEO Larry Fink spoke publicly about how the risks from climate change presented a clear threat to business growth everywhere. As a holder of $9.5 trillion in assets, BlackRock said they intended to drive change from the top-down in the companies in which they invest. This move sparked larger conversations about what systemic actions need to happen, as well as how operating more sustainably is becoming less of a risk and more of an opportunity. ""What investors consider to be a reward is undergoing a change [too],"" said Mark Milstein, faculty director of the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise in the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management. ""In the investment community, the money is going to come from the adoption and diffusion of decarbonization technologies, which are ultimately going to become the products and services that fuel growth in business and address climate change simultaneously."" In Glasgow, Mike Hoffmann noted another key player: McDonald's. ""They are the largest restaurant chain in the world and operate in more than 100 countries,"" he said. Hoffmann is a professor emeritus of entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the lead author of ""Our Changing Menu: Climate Change and the Foods We Love and Need."" He met McDonald's chief global impact officer, who spoke about their commitment to changing the way that they source and serve meals to 65 million customers per day. With a shared interest in driving social and environmental change through food, Hoffmann said that this kind of individual organization shows enormous potential for partnership. ""We have to be reaching out to these major corporations because they're the game-changers in climate change, along with government action,"" he said. ""But corporations move a lot faster than governments."" Danielle Eiseman, visiting lecturer in the Department of Communication and co-author of ""Our Changing Menu,"" agreed with the need to work with organizations who have more agency to act on their own. ""The most important groups to reach now for concrete action are those that can create the most significant and rapid change in terms of emissions reductions,"" she said. Energy and transportation are fields that will see a boost from the international community's commitments to green technology, broad policy reform and additional investments in sustainability. ""Investors see future growth in non-fossil fuel-based energy and power sources,"" Milstein said. ""For the most part, international development and investment banks have moved money to solar, wind, geothermal, battery, and emerging low- to no-carbon technologies."" However, that's where Buz Barstow, assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences, noticed some significant hurdles that future COPs will have to confront. ""We're going to have to rebuild the 100-year-old energy system that we already have. We're going to have to replace that by 2050. And then we're going to have to replace that four or five times over [by 2100] to account for the growing riches of the developing world,"" he said. ""I didn't get a sense that policymakers had any conception of that."" Such explosive innovation and widespread adoption will take decades, and much like the rise of the Internet, the clean energy revolution doesn't come with a roadmap. But Barstow said that being at COP26 , talking with different delegations and seeing the rise of the youth movement helped underscore the importance and urgency of doubling down on climate efforts across sectors. ""For most of our history, we've been a small perturbation on the biosphere. What we are becoming now is a force of nature,"" he said. ""And by the end of the century, we will be the force of nature on earth."" Outside of energy, to drive long-lasting, global change, Eiseman said that broad communication strategies need to adopt people-centered models and humanize the challenges that so many communities are facing. In Glasgow, billboards, buses and local businesses made it part of their mission to share messages about climate change. Yet, in parts of the world where those facts are less welcome and environmental activists experience high rates of persecution and violence, the formal policies developed at COP26 are essential in protecting vulnerable voices.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA213","COP26 Roundup: Article 6, Climate Accounting, ADB","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","International Oil Daily","Article 6 Technical talks are now in full swing at COP26 after the conclusion of the two-day leaders' summit. A key area of focus is Article 6 of the Paris Agreement which provides a framework for cooperation on carbon pricing, linkage of carbon markets and international offsets. Article 6 has been one of the most difficult parts of the agreement to get over the finishing line, but the early signs in Glasgow are encouraging. Negotiators are working on a new draft text and hopes of a breakthrough were bolstered after China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhehua, said he believed an agreement is in reach, with the remaining differences more technical than political in nature. Financiers Target Net Zero Over 450 financial institutions controlling $130 trillion in private capital have pledged to align their portfolios with the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which is made up of institutions from 45 countries, has committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and to work toward a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. ""They\'e2\€  re using the most stringent \'e2\€ \£6 science-based scenarios to set out detailed five-year emissions reduction plans and every member will report their progress annually,\'e2\€ said UN Climate Envoy Mark Carney, who formed the coalition. \'e2\€  We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account.\'e2\€ An estimated $100 trillion of investment is needed over the next three decades. That will require a massive increase in private capital, Carney told the COP26 conference. Greening the UK's Financial System UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is putting in place plans that from 2023 will require UK financial institutions and listed companies to publish net-zero transition plans detailing how they will adapt and decarbonize by 2050. An independent task force will be established to develop a \'e2\€  science-based gold standard\'e2\€ to define what's required and prevent ""greenwashing,"" Sunak told the COP26 summit. The plans will include interim goals and list actions to be taken to hit those targets. But there will be no ban on investments in carbon-intensive activities. It will be up to investors to determine if these plans are adequate or credible, the UK Treasury said. Climate Accounting The International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) and other bodies are launching a new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop consistent climate and sustainability disclosure standards for financial markets. The ISSB will aim to replace the existing fragmented voluntary standard setting for sustainability with a ""comprehensive baseline"" of standards to help inform investors how companies are responding to climate issues. The IFRS expects the ISSB to issue the first set of climate standards in the second half of 2022. Asian Development Bank Tackles Coal The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced a plan at COP26 to accelerate the closure of aging coal-fired power plants in Indonesia and the Philippines. The ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) is a public-private finance vehicle that aims to speed up the closure of coal plants and replace them with clean power capacity where possible. During a two to three year pilot phase, the ADB will work with the two governments to help raise the funding to retire up to seven coal-fired plants and funnel investments into clean power generation, storage and grid upgrades. Fink's Transition Fears BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for a rethink of the energy transition to consider undesirable outcomes such as ownership of oil and gas assets simply being transferred to less transparent actors and the developing world getting left behind because of a lack of funding. ""There's more movement away from hydrocarbon assets into private hands than anytime ever,"" Fink said at an event this week during COP26 . ""That's window dressing, that's greenwashing,"" he said. Fink called for the creation of new vehicles to hold divested hydrocarbon assets, with 100% of the proceeds then committed to investment in green assets. Deb Kelly, Ronan Kavanagh \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA216","Climate Denial Campaigner Attempts to Discredit COP26 With False Diesel Power Claims","DeSmogBlog","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 10, 2021( DeSmogBlog: HYPERLINK http://desmogblog.com http://desmogblog.com GLASGOW, SCOTLAND &8212; The head of policy at the UK&8217;s principal climate science denial group has been criticised for spreading false rumours about the use of diesel-powered generators at COP26 , with environmental experts branding his viral tweet &8220;desperate&8221;. Harry Wilkinson, one of several climate science deniers at the Glasgow summit[1], suggested that the conference was relying on polluting diesel generators in an effort to highlight the supposed hypocrisy of the event. The tweet[2], which has been shared and liked over 10,000 times, echoes a scene in a documentary released last year by Michael Moore[3] in which the filmmakers do the same at an environmentalist musical festival. The government&8217;s COP26 unit has said all generators on site are in fact powered by batteries, vegetable oil and solar. Wilkinson is an employee at the MP-backed Net Zero Watch pressure group, the new name for the Global Warming Policy Forum[4], campaign wing of the UK charity established by former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson. He is attending the UN summit as part of a delegation sent by the US-based Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow[5] (CFACT), which has a long history of rejecting mainstream climate science and has previously taken funding from oil giant ExxonMobil. Diesel Rumours On Tuesday, the tenth day of the talks, Wilkinson posted pictures on Twitter showing several large blue and white machines, branded with Aggreko, the name of a generator company based in Glasgow. &8220;Are these diesel generators at # COP26 ? They seem to be behind black screens,&8221; he asked. But the COP26 COP26 ,&8221; a COP26 spokesperson said, adding that the summit was being powered by the National Grid, with contingencies in place &8220;in the unlikely event they are required&8221;, powered using &8220;battery, hydrogenated vegetable oil or solar&8221;. &8216;Cheap Shot&8217; Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University, said the machines pictured were heat pumps, heaters and air conditioners.&160;&160; &8220;This is classic diversion and perfectionism,&8221; he told DeSmog. &8220;These meetings are crucial for global agreement on how we are going to collectively solve this problem. The Scottish government, the event organizers, and the attendees can do all we can to reduce the energy and waste of meeting, but for now there will still be emissions associated with doing so.&160; &8220;This is a very cheap shot, really a sign of desperate grasping for something to criticise,&8221; he said. Professor Hywel Williams, an associate professor in data science at the Exeter University who studies how environmental issues are discussed on social media, said: &8220;It seems to me that this is just a distraction tactic by Harry Wilkinson &8211; trying to get people talking about something inconsequential rather than the more substantive issues being discussed inside&8203; the tent.&8221;&160; &8220;If indeed there is that much strategic thought behind it. If that is the best GWPF have got, then I am not concerned,&8221; he added. Wilkinson has been contacted for a comment.

The Conference of the Parties ('COP') is the annual gathering sponsored by the United Nations (this is the 26th) of world leaders in public, private and social sectors, coming together to debate and decide on the future path of the global society's efforts to address climate change challenges. Almost 200 nations are officially parties to the 'Paris Agreement' -- the accord reached at COP21 in Paris in December 2015. This is a legally binding global treaty for most nations and called for: substantially reducing GHG emissions to limit global temperature rise to 2C, while striving to limit to 1.5C (2.7F) within this century. reviewing countries' commitments every five years (and here we are in Glasgow doing that, with 'Nationally Determined Contributions' or NDCs in focus). providing financing by developed economies to developing countries to help these smaller economies develop 'resilience' to the effects of climate change. The UN explains that the Paris Agreement 'provided a durable framework to guide the global effort by all sectors in all nations in the decades leading out to the end of the 21st Century and is a marker for the intended shift toward a 'net zero emissions' world.' The Agreement also is essential, says the UN, for the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their 167 underlying targets. These have target dates of 2030 - just eight years in the future. As you read this, we are expecting to see the final communique coming out of COP26 that will help to explain £greements reached' by official participants. Meanwhile, there is abundant news for you in many media channels about what has been happening in Scotland as the world leaders in public, private and social sectors gathered and exchanged views. Among the headlines of course is that the United States is back at the table, and President Joseph Biden, former Secretary of State John Kerry (the special envoy for climate change action in the U.S.), and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are among the many representatives of the nation at the talks.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA218","COP26: Nuclear Plays a Central Role ...","NEI","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 16, 2021( NEI: https://www.nei.org/news https://www.nei.org/news Delivered by Newstex) The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) wrapped up last Friday, but headlines continue to highlight nuclear energy as central to tackling the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report[1] in August stating that global warming is happening quicker than previously thought, making COP more important than ever. Decarbonization is critical, and nuclear, which provides more than a quarter of the world's clean power, is central to the clean energy transition. The bipartisan momentum around nuclear's role in combatting climate change was evident at COP. Nuclear energy will play an important role in decarbonizing the energy sector in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, France and China, as well as countries transitioning away from coal like Romania and developing countries such as Ghana. In fact, nuclear and wind provided over 76 percent of Glasgow's energy during the conference a testament to its real-life application in the fight for net zero. Nuclear power provided around 70%[2] of the electricity when wind was down, emphasizing the importance of clean, reliable energy to compliment intermittent renewable energy sources. Source: HYPERLINK www.carbonintensity.org.uk Throughout the two weeks, many voices chimed in on the benefits of nuclear, such as International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol: ""Nuclear power generation needs to double if we are to reach our energy and climate goals.' This year's conference in Glasgow solidified that nuclear holds an integral and unmistakable role in the world's decarbonization goals. U.S. Leadership in Global Initiatives It is in the spirit of cooperation that nations at COP sought to find ways they can work together to reduce emissions globally. Commitments to expand nuclear power both at home and abroad was an important outcome of this year's conference. On November 2, the UN launched the 24/7 Carbon Free Energy Compact[3] at COP26 . NEI, along with 39 other companies, policymakers, investors, and organizations have signed on as supporters of the compact, which will advance around-the-clock carbon-free energy as we seek to decarbonize electricity generation globally. As a firm source of carbon-free electricity, nuclear energy will play an important role. NuScale, an American small modular reactor (SMR) developer, and Nuclearelectrica, a Romanian nuclear energy producer, announced an agreement to initiate the deployment of the first SMR in Europe. 'This historic announcement is a critical step forward in our fight against the global climate crisis. Through this partnership, nuclear energy will continue to play a vital role in our carbon-free future, while positioning the United States as a leader in advanced nuclear technology developments,' said Korsnick. In an interview[4] at the conference, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm emphasized the desire to build new nuclear reactors in the United States. 'We are very bullish on these advanced nuclear reactors,' she said. 'We have, in fact, invested a lot of money in the research and development of those.' The U.S. also announced a $25 million pledge in support of expanding access to clean nuclear energy the 'Nuclear Futures Package.' The funding will advance modern nuclear power generation and innovative new designs, as well as establish partnerships with other countries to support progress on nuclear energy goals abroad and the world's climate targets. NEI at COP President and Chief Executive Officer Maria Korsnick attended the conference in Glasgow. She spoke about the coal to nuclear transition[5], sharing how siting small modular reactors (SMRs) at retired coal plants could utilize existing infrastructure and talent to accelerate the clean energy transition. 'The good-paying jobs nuclear supports can revitalize local economies abandoned by a dying fossil fuel industry,' she said. 'And it can improve public health, bringing reliable electricity without the localized air pollution.' She participated in other panels focused on climate finance, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects of nuclear energy, and investments in carbon-free technologies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) lead by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi organized several events[6] at COP26 , encouraging conversations about nuclear power and its vast applications. 'To achieve net zero we need more nuclear power. That's the scientific consensus from the IPCC and other leading climate experts. Governments are starting to converge around this consensus, but we must act faster,' said[7] Grossi. The climate crisis is a global problem that requires a global solution. It is important for the United States to honor its decarbonization commitments at home, while also leading technological advancements abroad. We need an all hands-on deck approach to the carbon-free energy mix to make change and discussions at COP26 demonstrated that while we still have a long way to go to address the climate crisis, nuclear has proven it will be a crucial part of the solution.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA219","Student Activists Demand Climate Action during COP26","The People's Vanguard of Davis","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 19, 2021( The People's Vanguard of Davis: HYPERLINK http://davisvanguard.org http://davisvanguard.org By Reuben Sam BERKELEY, CA - On November 10th, 2021, students gathered on the steps of UC Berkeley's Sproul Hall, demanding immediate action to mitigate the impacts of climate change and transition towards a green-based economy. The rally-and hundreds of other international demonstrations on 'Call to Earth Day'#8212;occurred amid the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, otherwise known as ' COP26 .' Over the past two weeks, global leaders have gathered to explore solutions to combat climate change as the world continues to warm at an unprecedented rate. Rowen Kliethermes, one of the organizers of the UC Berkeley demonstration, noted that, while the summit is a step in the right direction, many global powers have yet to adequately address consumerism and large corporations' reliance on fossil fuels, some of the root causes of global warming. COP26 culminated on November 13th, 2021 with the Glasgow Pact, a historic agreement explicitly mentioning the need to 'phase down' coal among the international community. However, the pact has received mixed reactions from observers[1]. Critics of the agreement argue that the language used in the document and the negotiations does not go far enough to minimize the catastrophic effects of global warming in a reasonable timeframe. Demonstrations such as UC Berkeley's exemplify public support for increased action regarding climate change. The California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG), a student-run grassroots organization focused on environmental activism, organized the rally at Berkeley. According to their figures, around 70 students attended the event. The crowd was fully receptive to the speakers' remarks, remaining energetic throughout the rally and chanting slogans. The first speaker at the event was CALPIRG's Renewable Campaign Grassroots Coordinator, Jose Luongo, who called for immediate action from policymakers in the continued fight against the devastating impacts of global warming. 'Especially in California, we have seen more record-breaking wildfires each year,' Luongo said in reference to pursuing more assertive climate policy. In recent years, California's spate of worsening fires has been linked to the effects of climate change.[2] The next speaker at the event was Professor David Romps, who explained the scientific consensus on the negative externalities of global warming and the university's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. 'That [plant] right next to Eucalyptus Grove is putting out 3 tons of carbon dioxide every year for every student, every undergraduate student on campus,' Romps stated in regards to the Cogeneration Plant owned by the university. Professor Romps remarked how the university could move to 'electrify our campus' to reduce UC Berkeley's reliance on fossil fuels. Finally, environmental activists Jakob Evan and Varsha Madapoosi took the podium. They explained how the university had made nothing but empty promises in enacting meaningful changes to their climate policy directives. 'UC Berkeley has no real plan. They are basically just greenwashing,' said Madapoosi. Amidst drastically underpaid lecturers and plans to build on People's Park, Madapoosi's statement supports many students' views of UC Berkeley as an institution purporting to be on the frontier of social justice activism, but reluctant to engage in tangible action. According to the Climate Action Tracker[3] (CAT), the measures that arose out of COP26 remain well over the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping the temperature under 1.5 C. Despite these bleak numbers, many climate activists-including Berkeley students-have yet to lose hope.

From: British Embassy Guatemala City (for Honduras) 15 March 2022 Local organization Sustenta Honduras developed the Climate Empowerment Forums, a space for the co-creation of climate proposals aimed at Honduran youth, within the framework of COP26 . Honduras was considered in 2017 the most vulnerable country to climate change in the world, according to the climate vulnerability index. After being hit by two storms Eta and Iota in a space of two weeks in 2021, the weakness of the country's infrastructure in the face of extreme weather events was evident. Sustenta raised the voice in representation of young people and the future generations who will inherit the greatest effects of the decisions made today in regard of climate change. The forums had the participation of 500 young people who interacted in the development of capacities and co-creation of proposals to foster climate action. Almost 65% of the participants were young women, seeking to provide a gender perspective to regional situations. Throughout this process, Sustenta compiled the proposals in a document entitled ""Proposals for the Inclusion of Honduran Youth in Climate Action"", which was presented to the authorities of the Ministry of Environment. The project also helped Honduras to adhere to the Declaration of Girls, Boys and Youth in Climate Action as part of the COP26 commitments. Sustenta will follow up with the authorities on next steps to keep youngsters included in this dialogue and with the support of the British Embassy. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA223","UK's net zero pledge met with scepticism """" COP26","November 2021","Global Investor","The United Kingdom's\~pledge to become\~the first net zero financial hub may be ambitious in nature but industry experts have said those countries most affected by climate change want more than just promises. The UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, spoke at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) on Wednesday morning, pledging that the UK would become the first 'Net Zero Aligned Financial Centre'. ""This means we are going to move towards making it mandatory for firms to publish a clear, deliverable plan, setting out how they will decarbonise and transition to net zero - with an independent Taskforce to define what's required,"" said the UK Chancellor. Andy Pitts-Tucker, managing director, Apex Group ESG Ratings & Advisory, told Global Investor that the fund administration firm welcomes such a significant commitment to climate finance. ""However, on the ground at COP26 , the sentiment we are hearing is more cautious. It has become clear in discussions this week that many have been burnt by previous hollow promises and feel that voluntary pledges with no regulatory imperative are no longer enough. ""Many of the most climate vulnerable nations are growing despondent and distrustful as rich nations fail to meet their previous promises - for example, previous commitments to fund $100 billion (\£373.2 billion) a year by 2020 of climate measures in poorer countries, is set to only be met in 2023,"" said Pitts-Tucker. Apex sees the Chancellor's pledge as an emphatic step in the right direction, but the firm expects the global community to hold the Government to account to put these initiatives into action sooner rather than later. ""While the plan published today is a strong step forward, what is urgently needed is action."" Carazzo added that regulated financial entities must rapidly undergo a structured process to understand their current financed emissions, and develop appropriate metrics and targets for the future, as well as develop an appropriate decarbonisation strategy\~which should be reported on regularly.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA224","COP26 Roundup: Moving Beyond Oil, Urban Climate Action","November 11, 2021 Thursday","International Oil Daily","Moving Beyond Oil and Gas At COP26 on Thursday, 11 national and subnational governments led by Costa Rica and Denmark formally launched the Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA). Initially revealed in August , this alliance aims to set an end date for oil and natural gas exploration and extraction and curtail new licensing. Core Members include Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Greenland, Ireland, Quebec, Sweden and Wales; California and New Zealand are associate members, and Italy is a \'e2\€  friend\'e2\€ of the alliance. The founding members have all signed the BOGA Declaration pledging to support a \'e2\€  socially just and equitable global transition to align oil and gas production with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\'e2\€ Core members are committed to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds and to set a Paris-aligned date for ending oil and gas production. While the group does not contain any major producers, Danish Climate Minister Dan Jorgensen said he hoped it would grow in time as more countries recognize the urgency of ending fossil fuel production if the world is to meet the 1.5\'c2\'b0C Paris goal. The UK has been criticized by environmental campaigners for not joining this alliance. However, COP26 COP26 summit, \'e2\€  Even some of our member states only a couple of years ago were saying coal is forever. And now every member state in the EU knows that there is no future for coal. That happened over a couple of years. So I think the sense of urgency has increased.\'e2\€ However, Timmermans, who was an architect of the European Green Deal, also said it was now vital to invest in pre-fitting the infrastructure needed for natural gas to be able to transport green gases as well. \'e2\€  If you pre-fit your new infrastructure for hydrogen, ammonia and other gases that could be created through renewable energy, you really invest in a carbon-free future in Europe. \'e2\€ \£6 That is why in this transitional period we will have to continue to invest in natural gas infrastructure. ... I think this is a justified investment.\'e2\€ Timmermans also insisted that EU language included in an earlier COP26 draft agreement on phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels must remain in the final version. ""That has to be part of the conclusion here today \'e2\€ \£6 Removing it would be an extremely, extremely bad signal,"" he said. Fossil Fuel Tracker Financial think tank Carbon Tracker and US-based NGO Global Energy Monitor (GEM) launched a prototype of the first open-source, independent fossil fuel database at COP26 on Thursday. The Global Registry of Fossil Fuels will be a concrete policy tool to measure what is being dug out of the ground, the associated emissions, and how those relate to a 1.5\'c2\'b0C-compatible pathway, Carbon Tracker said. Founder Mark Campanale said the registry would drive greater transparency about the plans of governments\'e2\€  and companies for oil, gas and coal in the future, enabling users to link fossil fuel production with national climate policies. \'e2\€  We see one of the key user groups \'e2\€ \£6 being the finance sector: it will enable investors much more effectively to assess stranded asset risk,\'e2\€ said Campanale. The registry will be refined and finalized over the coming months for a full open-access public launch. Interested stakeholders are invited to reach out to Carbon Tracker for initial access to the registry. Urban Climate Action The new Urban Climate Action Programme launched at COP26 will help at least 15 cities in developing countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America become more resilient to climate change and deliver on net-zero targets. Backed with \'c2\£327.5 million of new UK government funding, the joint initiative is supported by C40 Cities, a network of mayors from 97 megacities around the world focused on climate action, and German development agency GIZ. The program will help selected cities, including Nairobi, Kuala Lumpur, Bogota and Lagos, develop low-emission public transport systems, renewable energy generation, sustainable waste management, new climate-smart building codes and climate risk planning. ""By 2050, urban areas will be home to two-thirds of the world population, with the speed and scale of urbanization set to lock in high-carbon infrastructure and inequality if we do not act now,\'e2\€ said UK Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Hands.

Week one was about setting expectations, exposing greenwashing scams, and naming the countries Saudi Arabia, Australia, Brazil, USA most responsible for blocking progress. Week two was about the negotiations themselves pushing the UK COP Presidency to strengthen the text, ensure that countries would not have five years to strengthen their targets and exposing attempts by offsets scammers to weaken the carbon text even further.

And that matters."" @climatemorgan # COP26 HYPERLINK https://t.co/vrw45z64Vo Greenpeace PressDesk (@greenpeacepress) November 13, 2021 COP26 was a big one, as countries had promised to do more by the Glasgow talks, and from the start, Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5C. That didn't happen, a clear betrayal of the millions of people already suffering from the climate crisis. at COP27, to be held in Egypt in 2022, countries will need to come back with much stronger targets and clearly defined pathways. While COP26 Volunteers in Glasgow take part in the Global Day of Action for COP26 , calling on the UK Government and world leaders to stop failing us on the climate crisis. Main outcomes from COP26 Frontline Activism Firstly, let's give credit where credit is overwhelmingly overdue: without Indigenous Leaders, youth activists, and countries on the frontlines of the climate emergency fighting for our future, the climate talks would have failed. Fridays For Future school climate strike, coinciding with the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26 , currently being held in Glasgow, Scotland, on 5 November 2021., 20211105_Glasgow Both inside and outside the COP conference center, voices from countries and communities most affected by the impacts of the climate crisis demanded action from world leaders. In the days leading up to the opening of COP26 , young activists from Namibia, Uganda, Bangladesh and Mexico sailed into COP on board Greenpeace's ship, the Rainbow Warrior, to tell leaders to ""Stop Failing Us."" Indigenous Peoples protest against carbon offsetting outside COP26 . They are members of of the Indigenous Environmental Network and Indigenous Climate Action. Days later, activists including Greta Thunberg and Greenpeace International Executive Director, Jennifer Morgan, challenged Mark Carney, the UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance at a side event on voluntary offsets, calling it 'greenwash.' These actions, amid the daily relentless demands from frontline activists, highlighted inaction and the insufficiency of early drafts, forcing country negotiators to redeliver. These groups will no longer tolerate outcomes like this. Why should they, when they are the least responsible for creating the crisis? Fridays For Future MAPA protest outside plenary room at COP26 . Activists shouting ""Keep it in the text!"", referring to the first mention of Fossil Fuels in a COP draft. Adaptation Climate vulnerable countries are suffering real loss and damage from the climate crisis today but what was promised in the final discussion text is nothing close to what's needed on the ground. Much more ambition is still needed as well as transparency about the nature of different countries' current commitments. Expectations that COP26 would finally deliver real support for communities needing to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of climate disasters were high but the outcome ""is an insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis"", as said by Teresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator at ActionAid International. 'PRESS RELEASE: ""Today's decision from # COP26 is a clear betrayal of the millions of people suffering from the #ClimateCrisis"" after rich countries blocked finance for #LossandDamage poorer nations so desperately need and demand. #PayUp4LossandDamage https://t.co/2GsvSA34wt https://t.co/2GsvSA34wt Climate Action Network International (CAN) (@CANIntl) November 13, 2021 Although rich countries finally did begin to respond to the calls of more climate-vulnerable countries for funding and resources to cope with rising temperatures, acknowledgement is not enough. The world's nations who are disproportionately responsible for rising temperatures must deliver what they already promised and even more. The Rainbow Warrior heads to COP26 with a banner 'Stop Failing Us' Phasing-out fossil fuels The compromise in the Glasgow Climate Pact on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies is weak, but it is the first time a call for coal reduction appears on a COP final text. The call for emissions reductions of 45% by the end of this decade is still in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5C and keeps the science in this deal. But countries need to specify how much and by when they will cut emissions. And a focus on a just transition will be essential. Nevertheless, the signal that the era of coal is ending has been sent. Offsets Disappointingly, the offsets scam got a boost in Glasgow. The creation of new loopholes endangers nature, Indigenous Peoples, and the 1.5C goal itself. Although the UN Secretary-General announced a new Group of Experts to scrutinize the role of offsets, much work still needs to be done to stop the cheating that gives big emitters and corporations a pass. Offset Taskforce hit by protests at COP26 Greenpeace chief challenges Carney's taskforce at greenwash event. What happens after COP26 ? Our climate is now breaking down around us. We see it every day in wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, and melting ice. There is no time to waste. It's in the interests of all countries, including those who still burn coal, to transition to clean renewable energy. And richer countries must to do more to support that shift. Our future depends on it. COP27 will reconvene next year in Egypt, where climate justice activists will intensify efforts to raise awareness about the severe climate impacts and to secure more support for adaptation, loss, and damage. In the meantime, we must continue to mobilize and urgently create irrepressible pressure that finally ends the era of all fossil fuels.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA226","The Future(s) of Emissions Trading """" COP26 and the Market for Voluntary Carbon Offsets","February 2022","Institutional Investor (America's Edition)","By Gregor Spilker, CME GroupAT A GLANCEFor years, pricing for voluntary carbon offsets has been highly variable, but there is broad acceptance that carbon offset credits must be part of transferring to a low carbon economyEarly adoption of carbon offset futures has helped bring standardization to the market Voluntary carbon markets are coming of age. With more than $1 billion notional value traded, the market hit a special milestone this past year. While carbon offset credits remain """" by their very nature - bespoke instruments, benchmark prices and futures are emerging, bringing a highly welcome measure of standardization to the market. During COP26 , the UN Climate Change Conference held at the end of 2021, countries agreed on a common approach to the Paris Agreement's Article 6, which deals with international carbon markets. This should provide the market with fresh impetus and a higher level of legal certainty as the international community moves towards a low-carbon future.The Offset Marketplace The idea behind voluntary carbon offsets is simple. Entities develop projects that have a CO2 reducing impact on the environment. This CO2 reduction is certified by a third-party registry which will check that this is a real, permanent, additional reduction. The marketplace evolves around project developers and buyers financing these projects via the purchase of project-backed offset credits. Buyers may seek to net off their own emissions against these offset credits. While the underlying idea is straightforward, carbon offset credits come in many shapes and forms. Broadly speaking, the market can be separated in nature-based and technology-based projects. ""Nature-based"" includes projects that incorporate natural carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands, or other ecosystems. In contrast, ""technology-based"" projects may involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, methane capture from landfills, the deployment of efficient cookstoves in rural communities, etc. Some projects will qualify for additional co-benefits in addition to the reduction in emissions """" a wetland restoration project will not only sequester CO2, but it may also promote biodiversity and help the local community. Different registries may apply slightly divergent criteria to their certification process. Finally, corporate buyers may have preferences for different geographic locations, project types and vintage years.Clarity Comes to the Carbon Market The result is that for a number of years, pricing for voluntary carbon offsets has been highly variable, with nature-based projects with co-benefits typically attracting the higher prices. At the same time, governments around the globe are recognizing the urgent need to transfer to a low-carbon economy """" and there is broad acceptance that carbon offset credits must be part of solution. Some researchers estimate that nature-based solutions alone could provide up to 1/3 of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global temperature increases under two degrees. A number of public-private initiatives are pushing forward and recommending frameworks for the voluntary carbon market to grow """" most notably the 'Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets' (TSVCM) sponsored by the Institute of International Finance. The successful Article 6 negotiations that took place during COP26 have also brought further clarity to the market. The implementation of the agreement will take time, and a number of questions remain open. But overall, the agreement was welcomed by market participants. It provides clarity to what extent legacy offset credits generated under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) will be allowed for futures emission reductions. It also deals with a thorny issue that plagued the voluntary carbon market for years: the problem of double counting emission reductions. In the past, an emission reduction outcome may be accounted more than once when it is claimed by the country in which the project was based, and, at the same time, by the entity which ultimately bought the certified offset. This issue is being addressed by the introduction of Corresponding Adjustments (CAs). Once implemented, that mechanism should ensure that offset credits can only be claimed once.Carbon Offset Futures Acceptance CME Group entered the voluntary carbon market in 2021. The exchange launched two offset futures in partnership with CBL Xpansiv, a marketplace for spot trading of environmental commodities. The contracts are physically delivered and based on CBL's Global Emission Offset (GEO) and its Nature-Based Global Emission Offset contract (N-GEO). GEO reflects the market price of CORSIA-eligible carbon offsets. CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, is a framework to support reducing emissions offsets from the international aviation sector. While the contract is designed to comply with CORSIA, its user base is not restricted to airlines only """" other entities may simply adopt the same requirements and use CORSIA credits for their own purposes. N-GEO is a product that reflects the price of nature-based offsets with additional co-benefits (Verra Climate, Community, and Biodiversity standards). Both contracts have found quick acceptance, with volumes growing in both spot and futures markets. On CBL Xpansiv, carbon-offset volume transacted on its platform exceeded 120 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (mt CO2e), a 288% increase from 2020 levels. On CME Group, annual volumes across GEO and N-GEO futures amounted to 47 million mtCO2e, with N-GEO accounting for two-thirds of that volume. This is despite the contracts only launching in March (GEO) and August (N-GEO) 2021, respectively. Prior to the December delivery cycle, open interest in the two contracts peaked at more than 15 million mt CO2e. Because carbon budgets tend to be managed on an annual basis, December contract months are typically the most widely traded contracts. When the December contract expired, participants made full use of the contracts' physical delivery: 5.9 million mt CO2e were exchanged between buyers and sellers, with every delivered contract backed by qualifying carbon offset projects. In all, more than 6.5 million offsets were delivered between the two contracts in 2021.Embracing Standardized Products COP26 has further solidified the view that voluntary carbon markets can play a meaningful part as the world transitions to a low carbon environment. Once the Article 6 rulebook is fully implemented, the role of corresponding adjustment and legacy CDM projects should provide further clarity to project developers, offset buyers, and traders alike. Spot and futures exchanges are helping the voluntary carbon market along in its path towards transparency and standardization. Volumes are on the ascendency and market participants are embracing standardized products to access the voluntary carbon market.\~ Read more articles like this at OpenMarkets \"

At the event, TransAlta and 27 new members joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance (the Alliance ) where the new members were announced by the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom, Co-Chairs of the Alliance. The Alliance is a global organization of governmental and private sector organizations working to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and accelerate the energy transition. TransAlta's President and CEO, John Kousinioris, stated, Our decision to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance is a natural extension of the Company's commitment to delivering clean energy solutions for our customers, strong returns for our investors, and reliable energy for the communities that we serve. Our growth plan will expand our renewable electricity fleet by two gigawatts over the next five years and deploy energy storage at a much larger scale. We look forward to continuing our contribution to global efforts to deliver an accelerated clean energy transition. TransAlta has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 61 per cent over 2005 levels and has a 2030 target that equates to a 70 per cent reduction compared to 2005 levels. TransAlta's transition away from coal-fired generation started in 2019 and by the end of 2021, the Company will end coal-fired generation in Canada. Through this process, TransAlta will eliminate 2,135 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity from its fleet and will have converted a further 1,259 megawatts to gas-fired generation, consistent with the regulatory frameworks set out by the governments of Canada and Alberta. The Company's sole remaining coal-fired unit in the U.S. will also cease operations at the end of 2025.

The Secretary-General will lead a delegation to the summit, to advocate for the interests of the 54 member countries, including 32 small states, and raise awareness about key Commonwealth actions to address the climate crisis. Days ahead of the summit, the Secretary-General said: ""I urge leaders to come to the table with the highest possible ambition and a reinvigorated determination to do all we can to keep a 1.5 degree cap on global warming. The science is clear - failing on this mission will cost us a viable, sustainable future for our children and grandchildren. We must not squander this opportunity to build back on a more sustainable path. ""I call on governments to align their COVID-19 recovery planning to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The developed world needs to keep its promise to deliver US$100 billion every year through to 2025 to support developing countries as they try to cope with the damaging impacts of this climate crisis. Additional financial support is also needed to address loss and damage, particularly for the most vulnerable."" The Commonwealth Secretariat will be hosting a pavilion at the COP26 venue for the first time, with a wide range of in-person and hybrid events planned over two weeks from 1 - 12 November. An online hub containing event information, live online broadcasts and other resources is now available. The Secretariat will also be launching a number of key initiatives at COP26 , in the area of climate finance, sustainable land management, energy transition, natural resource management and ocean action. The Commonwealth Secretary-General and relevant spokespeople will be available for media interviews around COP26 and climate change. For media requests, please see contact information below.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA229","COP26 Created New Carbon Market Rules: How Will Arbitration Respond?","Kluwer Arbitration Blog","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 23, 2022( Kluwer Arbitration Blog: HYPERLINK http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com As the climate crisis has intensified, much has been said about the roles that arbitration can play in the collective global response - including during the recent BVI Arbitration Week HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trG6PMJZ0BU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trG6PMJZ0BU , which coincided with the Glasgow climate conference. Arbitration has been utilised as a tool for resolving disputes as market mechanisms have developed to deliver greenhouse gas emission reductions. At COP26 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021 https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021 , governments adopted long-awaited rules for carbon market cooperation under the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact/cop26-outcomes-market-mechanisms-and-non-market-approaches-article-6's https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact/ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact/cop26-outcomes-market-mechanisms-and-non-market-approaches-article-6's cop26 -outcomes-market-mechanisms-and-non-market-approaches-article-6's Article 6.2 and Article 6.4. This post discusses the significance of these rules, what they mean for carbon disputes and how arbitration can contribute to the resolution of such disputes. Carbon Markets Rising Carbon markets exist to incentivise emission reductions HYPERLINK https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbon-pricing https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbon-pricing at the least cost. By purchasing a carbon credit, a government or company can offset a proportion of its emissions, i.e., count the actual emission reductions underlying the credit against its own emission reduction commitments. Carbon markets can also create incentives for investment and technology transfer in climate-vulnerable countries. By setting quantified emission targets for developed Parties, the Kyoto Protocol HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol was a major spur for the development of carbon markets . This treaty sets out three 'flexibility' mechanisms HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms: https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms: Joint Implementation (JI) HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/joint-implementation; https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/joint-implementation; the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism; https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism; and Emissions Trading https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/emissions-trading https://unfccc.int/process/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms/emissions-trading . Following Kyoto's adoption, domestic carbon pricing was introduced in various jurisdictions, with the EU's Emissions Trading System HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en being the largest example. Today, carbon markets have largely outgrown the Kyoto mechanisms. For instance, carbon pricing continued HYPERLINK https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620 to expand during the past year, with the proportion of global emissions covered by carbon pricing up from 15% in 2020 to 25.1%. Arbitrating Carbon Market Disputes Carbon market transactions are effected through forward contracts https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp for the production and delivery of credits (emission reduction purchase agreements HYPERLINK https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erpa.asp https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erpa.asp ) and spot and derivatives contracts HYPERLINK https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp for secondary trading. While some carbon contracts provide for court jurisdiction, many provide for arbitration. Examples include the International Emissions Trading Association's emissions trading master agreement for the EU ETS HYPERLINK https://www.ieta.org/Trading-Documents https://www.ieta.org/Trading-Documents (providing for the PCA Secretary-General as the appointing authority, with the option to choose among the ICC Rules, UNCITRAL Rules or PCA environmental rules HYPERLINK https://pca-cpa.org/en/services/arbitration-services/environmental-dispute-resolution/ ), the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility HYPERLINK https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org / general conditions for emissions reduction payment agreements HYPERLINK https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/sites/fcp/files/2019/Sep/6.%20Emission%20Reductions%20Payment%20Agreement%20%28ERPA%29%20General%20Terms%20and%20Conditions%20%28English%29.pdf https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/sites/fcp/files/2019/Sep/6.%20Emission%20Reductions%20Payment%20Agreement%20%28ERPA%29%20General%20Terms%20and%20Conditions%20%28English%29.pdf (PCA Secretary-General as appointing authority; UNCITRAL rules; London as arbitral seat) and Norway's HYPERLINK https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/climate-and-environment/climate/innsiktsartikler-klima/norwegian-carbon-credit-procurement-program/id2415405/ https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/climate-and-environment/climate/innsiktsartikler-klima/norwegian-carbon-credit-procurement-program/id2415405/ template agreement https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/86680864084e47118f0086fccc0855fd/template-nmoce-erpa-2016-2020.pdf https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/86680864084e47118f0086fccc0855fd/template-nmoce-erpa-2016-2020.pdf for purchase of CDM credits (LCIA rules; London as arbitral seat). Arbitration is also provided for in the processes of carbon crediting standards bodies, such as Verra HYPERLINK https://verra.org https://verra.org / and the Gold Standard Foundation HYPERLINK https://www.goldstandard.org https://www.goldstandard.org HYPERLINK https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620 reports were collectively responsible for half the credits issued through crediting mechanisms in 2020). Verra's template agreement HYPERLINK https://verra.org/project/vcs-program/rules-and-requirements/ provides for disputes with validation/verification bodies (which assess projects under Verra's standard) to be settled through arbitration in London under ICC rules. The Gold Standard has developed bespoke rules HYPERLINK https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/v2.2_annex-ah.pdf https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/v2.2_annex-ah.pdf , based on the PCA environmental rules, for arbitrating disputes concerning project registration and credit issuance and labelling. Carbon disputes often turn on issues common to other contractual disputes: commodity non-delivery, breach of covenants or warranties, failure to fulfil conditions precedent, disputes over title or security, etc. Distinctive elements include the nature of the commodity, the carbon crediting project cycle, and the application of international climate standards. The project cycle itself can also generate disputes, e.g., concerning project registration or credit issuance. For instance, in an SCC arbitration HYPERLINK https://globalarbitrationreview.com/carbon-credits-case-leads-danish-victory https://globalarbitrationreview.com/carbon-credits-case-leads-danish-victory a Danish firm successfully claimed damages from its Russian counterparty regarding a JI project HYPERLINK https://ji.unfccc.int/JI_Projects/ProjectInfo.html https://ji.unfccc.int/JI_Projects/ProjectInfo.html . The Danish company had reduced emissions from the Russian state-owned entity's gas pipelines, but the Russian entity had failed to get the relevant projects registered in Russia, thereby blocking the issuance of the JI emission reduction units due under the contract. Carbon disputes are not limited to carbon contracts themselves but extend to the full gamut of disputes concerning the underlying infrastructure projects undertaken to generate emission reductions, potentially resulting HYPERLINK https://globalarbitrationreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-arbitration-review/2019/article/energy-arbitration-in-china HYPERLINK https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A22017A1207%2801%29 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A22017A1207%2801%29 for dispute settlement concerning international emissions trading cooperation. The Paris Agreement and COP26 Outcomes Article 6 of the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement introduced 'cooperative approaches' involving internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) (Article 6.2) and a 'mechanism' to contribute to emissions mitigation and sustainable development (Article 6.4), as well as non-market approaches (Article 6.8). According to the rules agreed in Glasgow, the Article 6.2 and 6.4 modalities differ from their Kyoto predecessors. The guidance on Article 6.2 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/310510 HYPERLINK https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620 ). The transferrable carbon units, ITMOs, can be measured either in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (as with the Kyoto units) or in other metrics consistent with participating Parties' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). ITMOs can be transferred not just as credit against a receiving Party's NDC target but also for 'international mitigation purposes' (currently, the international aviation carbon mechanism HYPERLINK https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx ) and 'other purposes' (voluntary carbon markets). https://unfccc.int/documents/310511 https://unfccc.int/documents/310511 The Article 6 rules should reinforce the existing trend toward more widespread and credible carbon markets. Indeed, over 70% of Parties reportedly HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_08E.pdf intend to use at least one Article 6 approach, with A6.2 cooperation the most popular. What Does this Mean for Arbitration? COP26 will also affect the nature of future carbon market disputes. For instance, significant growth in market activity through the creation and trade in ITMOs (including the subcategory of A6.4 emission reductions) can be expected to eventually result in more disputes. Institutions that provide for arbitration in agreements with counterparties (such as the Asian Development Bank HYPERLINK https://www.adb.org/ https://www.adb.org/ HYPERLINK https://www.adb.org/news/adb-launches-new-carbon-fund-incentivize-climate-investments https://www.adb.org/news/adb-launches-new-carbon-fund-incentivize-climate-investments to participate in this market. Also, the entry of new market participants and the unfamiliarity and complexity of new modalities compared to previous carbon credits - e.g., allowing for the diversity of NDCs (from which 'mitigation outcomes' are derived), mitigation metrics and activity methodologies - may generate disputes, at least during the early years of implementation. Carbon contracts will need to be updated to reflect the new rules (e.g., concerning human rights and environmental and social safeguards), thereby affecting the respective obligations of parties. A new generation of carbon contracts (mitigation outcome purchase agreements, or MOPAs) are being developed for this purpose. Some market standards bodies have already indicated HYPERLINK https://www.goldstandard.org/blog-item/post-cop26-%E2%80%93-reflections-article-6-outcomes https://www.goldstandard.org/blog-item/post- HYPERLINK cop26 -%E2%80%93-reflections-article-6-outcomes intent to update their frameworks for consistency with the COP26 outcomes. Governments are likely to introduce or amend legislation to structure their interaction with the Article 6 processes (e.g., as A6.4 activity hosts). These changed legal frameworks, differing from country to country, will apply to relevant disputes alongside pertinent international rules. It is also possible that arbitration will be directly incorporated into Article 6 governance. The A6.4 rules provide that '[s]takeholders, activity participants and participating Parties may appeal decisions of the Supervisory Body or request that a grievance be addressed by an independent grievance process'. This language indicates that two distinct processes - an appeal process and a grievance process - must be made available. For the appeal process, it is conceivable that arbitration would be utilised, perhaps if mediation is unsuccessful (as carbon contracts often provide). One model might be the Gold Standard Rules HYPERLINK https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/v2.2_annex-ah.pdf https://www.goldstandard.org/sites/default/files/v2.2_annex-ah.pdf mentioned above, which provide for appeals from the kinds of decisions that the Supervisory Body will also be taking (at least concerning registration of activities and issuance of units). In the A6.4 decision, Parties tasked the Supervisory Bodies to develop provisions for matters including the appeals and grievance processes. There is no existing UN climate appellate process that could be readily applied to the A6.4 mechanism. It is also worth noting that Parties never agreed a process for appeals against CDM Executive Board decisions, despite the issue being on the agenda since 2010. With the Paris rules adopted at last, arbitral institutions and associations now have opportunities to prepare for arbitration to play an effective role in their implementation. These opportunities include: HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/conveng.pdf https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/conveng.pdf (mandated in 1992 to be adopted £s soon as practicable'). However, Article 6 is a more discrete matter, and the timely adoption of dispute settlement arrangements might reasonably be expected. Engaging with carbon market standards bodies, as well as sovereigns and institutions nominated by them to participate in the ITMO marketplace, regarding further development of template and bespoke contract provisions and the potential utility of arbitration. Building capacity and awareness among arbitration practitioners regarding dispute settlement in this specialised but growing market. This includes developing familiarity with the unique regulatory context for carbon credits that includes the Paris Agreement, Article 6 rules, CDM rules, etc, plus the project cycle, actors involved and common structure of carbon agreements. Institutions exploring a larger role in carbon market disputes might also consider measures such as the adoption of specialised rules tailored to this market, the establishment of a panel of arbitrators with relevant expertise and the creation of a list of technical experts.

From: Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP Published 31 March 2022 First ever Intergovernmental Relations Annual Report highlights success of collaboration with devolved governments More than 440 ministerial meetings between UK government and devolved governments took place in 2021 Key success of collaboration highlighted by COVID-19 response, COP26 , City and Growth Deals and the British Irish Council The UK government has today (31 March 2022) published its first ever annual report on intergovernmental relations, which shows a year of collaboration and cooperation with the devolved governments. The Intergovernmental Relations Annual Report covers a historic year of January 2021-December 2021, as all governments battled the COVID-19 pandemic, brought action on climate change onto the global stage once more through COP26 , and put levelling up at the heart of the national agenda through city and growth deals. None of these could have been successes without joint working with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government, and Northern Ireland Executive. Secretary of State for Levelling Up and Minister for Intergovernmental Relations Michael Gove said: Regular, meaningful and sustained joint working between the UK and devolved governments over the last twelve months has delivered for people across the whole United Kingdom. We faced the COVID-19 pandemic together, co-operating on a world-leading vaccination roll-out which benefitted people in every corner of the UK. At COP26 in Glasgow, we stood as one in our determination to set ambitious climate change goals which will protect our planet for the future. While we do not always agree, we have shown in the most challenging of times that we can put our differences aside and work together in the interests of the people we serve. The report highlights that in the last year there were over 440 ministerial meetings between the UK government and the devolved governments. This is alongside extensive daily engagement between civil servants across the governments. The UK government reports on engagement between the governments on a quarterly basis, and the quarterly reports are available on gov.uk. The publications forms just one part of the UK government's ongoing commitment to transparency of on intergovernmental relations to Parliament and the UK. This is just the latest step in cooperation, and follows a landmark agreement published earlier this year between the UK government and devolved governments which established new ways of working. The Intergovernmental Relations Review set up inter-ministerial steering groups and official-level working groups which will meet regularly throughout the year. The first inter-ministerial steering group, chaired by Secretary of State Michael Gove, met last week to discuss Ukraine and levelling up. The new structure has a new mechanism for avoiding, escalating and resolving disputes; supported by joint secretariats and based upon consensus. \"

Marcene Mitchell, senior vice president for climate change at WWF, issued the following statement in response. ""As we close in on the end of this critical summit, this text provides a good indicator of the progress made to this point. Since the conference began, the world has seen and heard much of the United States government's return to climate leadership. We have heard from President Biden, former President Obama, Cabinet members, Governors, Senators, Congresspeople, Tribal leaders, Mayors, CEOS, community leaders, and in fact, every sector of American society. They have come to Glasgow to say America Is All In. Now is the moment for the United States to show it. The United States must seize this moment and push these negotiations to an ambitious conclusion. ""The text recognizes the immense challenge ahead of us, and acknowledges that we need to enhance the ambition of global commitments by 2022 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.

""These are all necessary elements of a successful outcome to COP26 , but alone, they are not sufficient. The negotiators must provide a plan for measuring short term action, not just long-term commitments. The text must shorten the period in which nations report updated NDCs, ensure the delivery of international finance, and strengthen the stock taking of commitments actually realized. To achieve the urgent and systemic change we need, the United States must do its part. Only with this level of leadership, will we get to where we need to be."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA233","UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE (COP26)","October 25, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities: The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) is scheduled for October 31 through November 12 in Glasgow, Scotland. COP26 will bring countries together to discuss their plans to address climate change over the coming decade. University of Minnesota climate science experts Jessica Hellmann and Heidi Roop are available to provide comments pre, current and post- COP26 on the significance of the conference to address climate change, including the conference's goals. On the fact that the world has been negotiating climate change for decades: ""I've studied climate science and I've taught about it often and every year at the time of the UN meeting, my students and I hope this time will be different. I like to remind students that this year's meeting is the 26th time the international community has gotten together to try to take action on climate change that's a collection of meetings that's gone on longer than most undergraduates have been alive. Knowing that the problem still looms so large after 26 years, it's hard not to be discouraged. At the same time, difficult issues and challenging problems often require repeated attention and fits and starts at solutions, and our collective awareness of climate change has grown from scientific obscurity to mainstream concern."" That investments to tackle climate are necessary but also can bring positive change: ""My research on the consequences of climate change and the difficulties of living through it tells me that taking action on climate change is essential to preserve planetary systems we love and need. As a worker, mortgage and tax payer, and parent, I also understand that change is difficult and scary. But when I look at the carbon-cutting technologies and approaches that have emerged in the past decades, and still more coming online with the right incentives, I see an exciting and prosperous future. And as a scientist and citizen, I can't see any reason why we aren't aggressively pursuing that future."" On the several dimensions of climate change: ""The threats of climate change to local communities and global societies are immense, and this is why the global negotiations on climate change have taken on so many different features and approaches over the years. Of course, countries will be negotiating greenhouse gas reduction commitments and approaches in Glasgow these are the most important actions we must take. But other parts of the meeting will be talking about adaptation, or approaches for living through climate change best we can, and financing, raising capital for climate change strategies around the world. These issues are also critically important issues so that we can navigate the globe through profound physical and social changes."" Heidi Roop, Ph.D. ""The eyes of the world will be on our global leaders as they decide whether our global climate commitments will be sufficient to address the urgency and scale of action that the science, and increasingly our lived experiences, very clearly show are needed. "" COP26 ""While meetings like these may seem far away and irrelevant, the conversations and commitments made, and honored, following this meeting have implications for every nation and person on the planet. COP26 is happening after a year of unprecedented climate-related disasters and on the heels of a new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that outlines very clearly the challenges and the opportunities in front of us: It's us. It is unequivocal that humans have warmed the planet. It's here. Human induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes. We committed to a certain amount of change through the emissions we've already produced and so we must prepare. The more greenhouse gases we emit, the warmer it will get and the worse the impacts will be. We still choose. The amount of future emissions will determine the extent of the climate impacts we will all experience. That decision is still largely up to us. We have no time to waste. ""Commitments made by participating nations in COP26 Jessica Hellmann is the director of the Institute on the Environment and the Ecolab Chair in Environmental Leadership. She is an expert on global change ecology, climate adaptation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. She counsels state and national governments on natural resource management so that future generations can enjoy the beauty and function of nature as we do today. Hellmann also works with governments and corporations to build investment in climate change adaptation. Heidi Roop is the director of the Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership, an assistant professor of climate science in the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, and an Extension Climate Science and Adaptation Specialist.

Letters have been sent to Ken Dalling, President of the Law Society of Scotland, and Julia McPartlin, President of the Scottish Solicitors Bar Association, underlining the extensive levels of engagement the Scottish Government has had with the sector in the run up to the key UN conference in Glasgow. The letter from Community Safety Minister Ash Regan says: Dear Ken and Julia, COP26 CONFERENCE ENHANCED CRIMINAL LEGAL AID FEES I have received a range of correspondence regarding the position of solicitors in respect of the upcoming COP26 conference and the longer term sustainability of criminal defence agents. I am also aware of a range of social media and other media communications from your members. The correspondence and communication identify three key issues; COP26 arrangements, weekend and holiday custody courts and the longer term sustainability of the profession. Comments have also been made about the level of engagement between the Scottish Government and the profession on these matters. I think it is helpful to clarify the position on each of these issues. Enhanced Fees during COP26 In July this year a working group to consider COP26 related fees was established by the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) and attended by representatives from Law Society of Scotland (LSS) as well as representatives of individual Bar Associations. The purpose of the group was to facilitate early planning, full engagement and transparency for those providing the criminal legal assistance services required over the duration of this important international conference. I understand that following the first meeting in July the group met on a number of occasions over the summer. I am advised that the LSS representatives on the working group developed a model for enhanced criminal legal assistance fees during the conference on the basis of those discussions, and those were shared with members of the working group, including a representative from the Glasgow Bar Association. The proposals provided for a generous package of enhanced fees for COP-26 related cases during the conference. These proposals were submitted to Ministers and were approved without amendment. It was understood that those representatives of the profession who formed part of the working group would ensure the wider legal profession would be kept informed of these discussions. I also understand that when the proposals were circulated through the separate Legal Aid Engagement Group (LAEG) that, whilst clarification was sought on the operation of the fees, there were no specific concerns raised around the proposed enhanced fee levels for the conference period. The proposals for enhanced criminal legal assistance fees had to be negotiated and approved ahead of any confirmation from the UK Government that the associated costs will be met as part the overall cost to the United Kingdom of hosting the conference. However, the Scottish Government recognised the need to provide reassurance to the profession that the fees would be payable and to aid planning for duty schemes. As part of the planning for the COP26 conference, the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service have confirmed that weekend custody courts will operate in a small number of locations during the period of the conference. This was an operational decision for the Courts and senior judiciary following dialogue with justice partners. In addition to fees for specific COP26 work, therefore, the proposal for weekend custody courts led to us agreeing a further package of enhanced fees for solicitors. In the absence of proposals from the LAEG, a fee model, based on that used for police station duty, was proposed. It became clear that these were not acceptable to the profession and the LAEG was informed on 13 October that Ministers would consider a further enhancement and that decision would be taken on this as soon as possible, and this message was directly relayed to members of the profession by SLAB. I confirmed acceptance of that on 20 October and that has again been communicated to the profession by SLAB. The Scottish Legal Aid Board and Scottish Government have engaged with the representatives of the legal profession in good faith over the past few months to agree an enhanced package of legal aid fees to ensure that access to necessary legal representation would be available during the period of the COP26 conference. Scottish Ministers have agreed the specific proposals and requests from the representatives of the profession. We are, therefore, surprised and disappointed by the decision of individual Bar Associations not to participate in the COP26 duty scheme on the basis of the enhanced fee package approved in line with the LSS's own proposals. Whilst I recognise it is a choice for individual practitioners, given the agreement of enhanced fees for non- COP26 cases, I am also disappointed that many in the legal profession have indicated that they will refrain from representing their named clients in weekend custody courts whilst these are running during the limited period of the conference. Public Holiday Custody Courts Although not part of the COP26 fee package, the correspondence from representatives of the legal profession have also raised the issue of the request for enhanced funding for custody courts held on public holidays. Again, as you know, decisions on the holding of custody courts on public holidays are a matter for the Court Service and senior judiciary, not Ministers. However, following this issue being raised previously by the profession including following the decision by some solicitors not to represent their clients in public holiday courts earlier this year - my officials have worked collaboratively through the LAEG to review fees payable for public holiday custody courts. In September, officials asked representatives of the profession to submit specific proposals for a possible fee model for public holiday courts for consideration. We await these specific proposals and have committed to respond seriously to these proposals, once received. Review of Fees and wider Legal Aid Reform Members of the profession have also restated their wider concerns about the overall level of legal aid fees and about the capacity within the profession to engage with the justice Recover, Renew and Transform programme which is aiming to deal with the backlog in criminal cases that built up during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognise and value the role of the legal profession in the recovery programme and have acknowledged the additional demands that this is placing on the justice system. During my tenure as Minister I have, to date, introduced a 3% increase to all legal aid fees in 2019, a further 5% uplift to all such fees in the current year along with a commitment to bring forward an additional 5% increase next year. During 2021 the Scottish Government has directed 9m of grant support to legal aid providers, including to assist their participation in the RRT programme, and we are providing 1m of funding over this year and next to support the costs of employing trainee solicitors. This equates to a financial package of over 20m; and to date all that remains to be implemented is the second 5% uplift. The proposal from a representative of the profession that Ministers should agree to a further immediate, permanent and substantial increase to all legal aid fees additional to the specific enhanced fees already agreed - to allay concerns that legal practitioners have in participating during the COP26 conference is not something that any Government could agree to. However, we have already committed to revisit with the profession fee reform for summary and solemn criminal legal assistance as well as to work on longer-term wider reform of the legal aid system. There has been no resistance, or lack of commitment from the Government, to taking forward these issues. My officials established the LAEG with representatives from the SSBA and the LSS and a commitment was made to engage with that group on substantive decisions in respect of legal aid. That group steered the establishment and criteria for the allocation of the remaining resources from the 9m fund to help support participation in the RRT programme. More recently, options for early criminal fee reforms, to be taken forward through secondary legislation, have been discussed. This includes a number of the specific reforms that representatives of the LSS and SSBA raised at the recent roundtable session with the Parliament's Criminal Justice Committee. Members of the profession agreed to provide written feedback on proposals for these criminal fee reforms. That feedback is awaited and officials stand ready to respond productively to what is put forward by your representatives. In addition to these early reforms, following the independent review of legal aid by Martyn Evans and public consultation in the last session of Parliament, we committed in our recent Programme for Government to engage with the legal profession and others within the justice system to complete a wider review of the Legal Aid system and to introduce a Legal Aid Reform Bill in this Parliament, ensuring that the system is flexible, easy to access and meets the needs of those who use it. Following the publication earlier this year of the report of the Legal Aid Payment Advisory Panel, we have also committed to working with the profession to further identify the evidence base for the future setting of legal aid fees. We have made clear that we are open to practical and evidence-based proposals that can help inform the setting and review of legal aid fees on a sustainable basis. As noted above, given the way in which the significantly enhanced legal aid fees for the COP26 were developed, I am disappointed that a number of Bar Associations have decided not to participate in the COP26 or non- COP26 weekend duty schemes, despite the proposals from LSS being agreed in full. I am also disappointed and concerned about the way in which the Government's engagement with the profession on this issue and wider legal aid matters has been presented by some in the profession. I would welcome the opportunity to meet you both as senior representatives of the profession to discuss the way these matters have been presented and how we can ensure on-going effective engagement on important issues relating to legal aid and the sustainability of the legal profession. Background The Scottish Government has acknowledged the important role of criminal defence solicitors and agreed a 5% increase in legal aid fees in the current year, plus a commitment to a further 5% increase next year. We have committed to consider other issues raised by the profession, including with reference to public holidays. A package of specific funding has been developed in consultation with the profession to support the contribution of the legal profession during the forthcoming COP26 conference. \"

Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada, issued the following news release: U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, will join a bipartisan Senate delegation attending the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland this weekend. COP26 is the most important multilateral climate change conference since world governments negotiated the Paris Climate Accords in 2015. ""With Nevada already experiencing extreme heat, increasing drought and wildfires, and poor air quality, the climate crisis presents a serious threat and an enormous economic opportunity where our state can continue to be a national leader in clean energy jobs and conservation,"" said Senator Rosen. ""At COP 26, we will meet with senior Administration officials leading our climate efforts and foreign leaders from our partners around the world to discuss our shared obstacles and work together toward solutions. This conference is a historic chance to address this urgent global problem, and I'm honored to be part of the bipartisan congressional delegation representing our state and supporting the international effort to fight climate change."" Senator Rosen will be the only member of the Nevada congressional delegation attending COP26 . The goal of the climate change summit is to secure commitments from world leaders to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with the overarching goal of the Paris Accords. In addition to attending meetings with foreign leaders and high-ranking U.S. climate representatives at COP26 , Senator Rosen will participate in a panel event focused on clean energy innovation featuring a bipartisan group of lawmakers and hosted by the Atlantic Council. Nevada is quickly becoming a national leader in renewable energy deployment and technologies and has tripled its renewable energy production over the last decade. The state has the second-most solar jobs per capita in the country, and also ranks second in the nation in geothermal generation. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7658324 MSTRUCK \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA236","Peabody Energy Stock Slides On Watered-Down COP26 Coal Agreement","November 15, 2021 Monday 7:23 AM EDT","TheStreet.com","Peabody Energy Corp. shares slipped lower Monday after world leaders agreed to a phasedown coal production following climate talks at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The weekend agreement, which for the first time acknowledged that fossil fuels were the main cause of climate change, had called for a ""phase out"" of coal-fired power production. However, following an 11th-hour move, lead by China and India, the language was reduced to a ""phase down"" of coal use, allowing fossil fuel dependent countries a longer runway in terms of reducing their reliance on the world's dirtiest form of power. The final text, which included no timescale, only commits the signees into ""accelerating efforts towards the phaseout of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" in order to keep the broader COP26 ambitions of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius alive. ""Did I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way? No.,"" said UN Climate Envoy John Kerry. ""But if we hadn't done that we wouldn't have a deal. I'll take phase it down and take the fight into next year."" Peabody Energy shares were marked 1.2% lower in pre-market trading Monday to indicate an opening bell price of $11.23 each. Peabody, one of the world's biggest publicly-traded ""pure play"" coal companies, sold around 133 million tones of thermal and metallurgical coal last year. The group reported a third quarter loss of 60 cents per share last month, on sales of $679 million based on 33.7 million tons of coal. Still, despite the COP26 agreement, China coal demand will hit an all-time high this year, and analysts at BMO Capital Markets see ""strong 2022 results due to higher prices and higher volumes"" for Peabody as it re-starts its Shoal Creek mine in the coming weeks and ramps up production in the first quarter of next year. China's monthly coal output, in fact, hit the highest levels since March 2015 last month, with the world's biggest producer producing 357.1 million tons, taking the 10-month total to 3.3 billion. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA239","COP26 DISCUSSIONS MUST PRIORITIZE AGRICULTURE","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Local, national and world leaders, and committed climate change activists are in Glasgow for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to share the progress they\\x92ve made since the COP21 in Paris six years ago and to discuss what comes next. One of the issues that must be on the table at COP26 is the worrying impact of climate change on agriculture in Africa. Agriculture accounts for over 25 percent of Africa\\x92s GDP while employing over 70 percent of people that live in rural communities. When agriculture is impacted, women, who work in the agricultural sector suffer the consequences. The entire agriculture value chain is threatened by climate change. According to a recent World Bank Report, unless urgent actions are taken, climate change could force millions of Africans to migrate to new areas. At the production level, climate change is impacting agriculture via drought and flooding events. In 2020, flooding in East Africa impacted over six million people. In 2021, flooding has affected 669,000 people in West and Central Africa, over 700,000 people in Sudan and South Sudan and over 100,000 people in Nigeria. It is also having an impact through invasive and transboundary plant-eating insect pests such as the fall armyworm and the desert locust. Invasive insect pests cost the African continent U.S. $1 billion every year. Impacted the most are vulnerable groups that include African small holder farmers, women and girls, children, disabled and elderly people. Without a climate-resilient agricultural sector, even the most ambitious climate initiatives will bear minimal returns. It is imperative for countries participating in the COP26 meeting to finance agriculture initiatives. Looking at many developed countries, it is evident that it is possible to build climate resilient agriculture. This is particularly possible when several interlinked short-term and long-term strategies are put in place. At the foundation of climate-resilient agriculture is the need for smallholder farmers to have access to dependable and year round sources of water to support agriculture. At the moment African agriculture is dependent on rain-fed agriculture and because of climate change rains are no longer dependable. Complementing access to water for agriculture are other important tools including access to most recent and improved agricultural technologies and resources. From improved and climate-smart seeds to drought, flooding, insects and plant disease-tolerant crops varieties to recent knowledge of agricultural practices and access to markets and financial help. Important is the need for African countries to strengthen their early warning systems. These can only be achieved through strengthening African countries abilities to tap on big data and use it as a tool to stay ahead of all the climate linked disasters. Accompanying early warning systems is the need to lay out comprehensive climate adaptation initiatives. At the center of all actions and strategies is the need to put the people on the ground and African countries at the center of climate action. As a founder to a startup, Oyeska Greens that is working with farmers at the Kenyan Coast I have seen firsthand the value of putting farmers at the forefront.\\xA0 Putting them at the forefront ensures that the strategies and initiatives that are laid out are relevant and meeting the current challenges that small holder farmers and other vulnerable groups are facing as it relates to climate change. Without including the very people whom we are serving, we risk unsustainable and irrelevant solutions. Climate change is the most urgent crisis of our times. While talk and meetings such as COP26 are important, in the end it is the initiatives and actual projects being implemented in African countries, particularly in the agricultural sector that will help move the needle and address the escalating climate change crisis. All countries must work together and take action in the fight against climate change to avert many crises that are projected to happen if we fail to act.\\xA0 Lives of vulnerable citizens including women, elderly and people with disabilities are at stake. Now is the time to ACT Dr. Esther Ngumbi\\xA0is an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, and a Senior Food Security Fellow with the Aspen Institute, New Voices. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA240","University community responds to COP26 with hope, cautious optimism","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","Cavalier Daily: University of Virginia","World leaders gathered in Glasgow for the 26th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties from Nov. 1 to 13 to discuss and create comprehensive plans for addressing climate change. Members of the University community shared their thoughts on the strides made at COP26 , as well as the limitations of certain decisions. By the end of the proceedings, the 197 signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which established an international treaty to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate, produced a landmark agreement - for the first time, these signatories identified fossil fuel as a cause of climate change and urged developed nations to double their funding for reducing emissions in the developing world. The UKCOP26 promoted COP26 as the best last chance to address escalating climate change, as it builds on the steps taken at the 21st annual United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, commonly known as the Paris Agreement. Under this international treaty, 191 countries and the European Union agreed to work toward limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. Countries also agreed to avoid or minimize the risk of climate-related damage by implementing early warning systems and restoring habitats for storm and flood defenses. Environmental Science Prof. Scott Doney researches the relationship between climate change, the global carbon cycle and ocean ecology. He explained the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees draws on scientific studies exploring the damage to ecosystems, society and people. ""We're already seeing substantial impacts to the climate system - coral bleaching, droughts, increase in wildfires [and] heat waves,"" Doney said. ""1.5 degrees is not magical. Current problems will continue and probably will be exacerbated."" While Doney noted that countries have pledged larger reductions in emissions, like India's recent net-zero pledge by 2070, since the Paris Agreement, many climate topics - such as global equity, decarbonization funding and emissions reduction - were at issue in the lead-up to COP26 as countries were expected to increase their commitment and funding to better combat climate change. In the days leading up to COP26 , over 100 world leaders started the summit with a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030. If implemented, this pledge could help to avoid nearly 0.3 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2040. Fourth-year College student Brooke Crouch is active in the student organization Veggies of Virginia, and worked for Turning Green, a San Francisco based environmental non-profit in 2019. Crouch explained what a reduction of methane emissions could mean for the environment. ""[The 30-30 Pledge] has been exciting to me, because there hasn't been a lot of talk at the international level of reducing greenhouse gases ... other than carbon dioxide,"" Crouch said. ""Methane is much more potent than CO2 so it has a really huge impact when it's emitted ... we can see large positives from emission reduction."" In addition to reductions in emission, more than 100 countries pledged to end deforestation by 2030 during the summit. This pledge was a recognition of the crucial role that forests play in climate. When forests are cut down, they are no longer able to act as a carbon sink - in which a forest absorbs more carbon than it releases into the atmosphere - thereby contributing to climate change through their inability to sequester carbon dioxide. Environmental Science Prof. Deborah Lawrence is a former science advisor for the Office of the Special Envoy for Climate Change in the U.S. State Department and researches the link between tropical deforestation and climate change. Lawrence explained that forests play a crucial role in regulating climates. ""Without our forests, we would already be a lot hotter, and [so] we've got to keep them [in] the ground,"" Lawrence said. Doney said deforestation is particularly concerning since it impacts primarily tropical countries in the global south that have a rich variety of species. ""Deforestation is not just a carbon cycle or climate issue,"" Doney said. ""It's also biodiversity and social equity."" In an unprecedented push for reducing global emissions, a group of countries, cities and car manufacturers - including Ford and General Motors - explicitly recognized that internal combustion vehicles needed to be phased out by 2040. A number of major countries - including the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea and Germany - did not sign on to this pledge. Another significant step at COP26 was the joint U.S.-China commitment to work together to significantly reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases - including the U.S. goal to reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and China's plan to phase out coal consumption. In 2019, the U.S. emitted approximately 5.1 billion metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Additionally in 2020, China burned 3 billion tons of coal, according to the BBC. ""There was a worry that China was somehow stepping back,"" Lawrence said. ""I think [the joint commitment] is really important because without China, we cannot meet our goals."" COP26 also included important discussions among delegates about the ongoing concern to address fairness - particularly in regard to financing - for developing nations, Lawrence said. ""One of the issues that still hasn't been fully resolved ... [is] the extent that the developed world can provide funding to support actions [that] the global south needs to take to help them not only with addressing their emissions, but also adapting and trying to reduce the damages from climate change,"" Doney said. Despite the inclusion of fossil fuels and pledges made on methane and deforestation at COP26 , certain world leaders and officials - including Secretary General Antonio Guterres - viewed the emissions reduction pledges as insufficient given the growing danger of climate change and the lack of actionable mechanisms to help at-risk and developing countries decarbonize and adapt to a warming world. Doney explained that while international pledges are significant, they do not represent actual policy. ""When countries come [to COP26 ] and make pledges, a lot of the really hard work goes on at the national [domestic] level to actually implement [these pledges],"" Doney said. ""It's one thing to say what you're going to do - it's another to actually act on it."" At the regional and local level, the University has taken steps toward its own sustainable future. According to the University's 2030 sustainability plan, the University aims to be carbon neutral by 2030 and fossil fuel-free by 2050. These goals - which Lawrence described as an ""ambitious"" - have been met with some disappointment from Crouch, who believes more action is necessary. ""Our targets should be bigger, bolder,"" Crouch said. Crouch ultimately believes these goals are a step forward, but that students should do all they can to keep pushing those in power to take climate action. ""Writing letters to the editor about issues you care about, calling and writing to your representatives, meeting with your representatives, joining local advocacy groups - they might be small actions, but they do add up to a much larger impact,"" Crouch said. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA241","Ceres Applauds Deforestation Pledges Announced at COP26","November 3, 2021 Wednesday 9:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSPol) -- Ceres, a non-profit organization that is mobilizing many of the world's largest companies and investors to take stronger action on climate change, water scarcity and other global sustainability challenges, issued the following news release on Nov. 2, 2021: Several major pledges announced at COP26 will accelerate global efforts to end deforestation, signaling the growing importance of nature conservation in climate policy. Today, President Biden announced a plan that would spend $9 billion through 2030 to conserve and restore U.S. forests, among hundreds of other world leaders. This plan comes amidst a wave of commitments to ending deforestation, including a pledge by top financial institutions to stop investment in companies with deforestation in their supply chains. This pledge was supported by investors with over $8.7tn in assets under management, including Boston Common, Domini, Impax, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. As part of the commitment, signatories are adhering to the Deforestation-Free Finance Roadmap released this week by Global Canopy, designed to guide the implementation of these commitments in their portfolios. ""These pledges announced at COP26 will go a long way in our global efforts to end deforestation. We especially applaud the leadership shown by members of our Ceres Investor Network in spearheading this work,"" said Julie Nash, director of food and forests at Ceres. ""These are encouraging signs of a growing consensus around the role of intact forests in mitigating the climate crisis and limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.""

The BITMO Platform allows signatories to the Paris Agreement to issue and exchange carbon credits as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.While countries negotiate at COP26 , the BITMO Platform stands by to enable a quick start of international carbon trading under the Paris Agreement. Blockchain for Climate Foundation created the BITMO Platform to advance Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and shepherd an effective, efficient, and timely global carbon market using blockchain technology. The BITMO Platform enables issuance and exchange of ""Blockchain Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes"" (BITMOs) as ERC-1155 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Each BITMO token, equivalent to one tonne of CO2, has all pertinent carbon credit data embedded right into the NFT. Launching November 8, the BITMO Platform will provide accounting and exchange infrastructure necessary under Article 6, connecting demand for emissions reductions with the best climate action opportunities around the world. Countries signatory to the Paris Agreement may help fulfill commitments to reduce emissions by purchasing BITMOs from proven emissions reductions achieved elsewhere. The BITMO Platform is a secure record of issuance, transfer, and retirement for each country's Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) that can be reconciled with National Carbon Registries and meet future UN requirements. BITMOs make all relevant data publicly available and are settled immediately when exchanged, helping avoid double counting of emissions reductions. The BITMO Platform helps humanity address the climate crisis while fostering global co-operation. In that spirit, Blockchain for Climate Foundation is convening aNational Party Working Groupto pilot the issuance and exchange of ITMOs using the BITMO Platform.

The country is balancing its responsibility for climate action against domestic concerns from keeping its factories running and homes warm during the winter, to growing its renewables sector, and the goal of increasing prosperity for its middle class. Some of these align with reducing emissions, others are in conflict. Below is a timeline of what China did and didn\' t do during HYPERLINK https://qz.com/re/cop26/ COP26 .

Analysts hoped for strong commitments from China that would influence global climate ambitions , but the 2021 plan appeared to largely reiterate pledges made in 2015. China's decision on its NDC casts a shadow on the global climate effort. In light of the domestic economic uncertainties, the country appears hesitant to embrace stronger near term targets, and missed an opportunity to demonstrate ambition.

Developed countries caused most of the climate impacts stronger storms, desertification, deadly heat waves, rising seas that developing countries are suffering today. Financing for those impacts was the most contentious issue during COP26 . China is not one of the developing countries that needs money from the UN, but it has repeatedly used its position as a global power to pressure the US and Europe to fund climate adaptation for poorer countries, and called developed countries\' refusal to do this the biggest barrier to climate action. Nov. 4: China, along with India, does not sign the global coal pledge to phase out coal-fired power and refrain from building new coal plants. Emissions from burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change, and China consumes more coal than any other nation.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA248","ICRA sees up to $500B in investments needed to achieve India's COP26 goals","Biofuels Digest","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 06, 2022( Biofuels Digest: HYPERLINK http://www.biofuelsdigest.com http://www.biofuelsdigest.com In India, the Indian Credit Ratings Agency, ICRA, in its recent research report, has analyzed India's COP26 commitment in two phases - up to 2030, and the net zero target for 2070[1]. Being a developing country, which is at an inflection point in terms of its energy consumption, the nation's per capita energy consumption is expected to surge 3x-4x over the long term. Parallel to this, India has also committed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 1 billionn metric tons by 2030. The country has additionally committed to a net zero carbon emission target by the year 2070, by when the per capita energy consumption would have surged from current levels. Rohit Ahuja, Head of Research and Outreach, ICRA says, 'In order to achieve the net zero target by 2070, a focused roadmap would be required. It calls for timely interventions by the government and large capex/investments in GHG emitting sectors like power, industry and transport. These sectors together emit ~90% of CO2 as per 2019 data of International Energy Agency. Ambitious targets for COP26 opens massive investment opportunities across segments stemming from 500 GW renewables by 2030, higher EV penetration (~10% by 2025), 20% ethanol blending for petrol (~3x increase from current levels), improvement in energy efficiencies (battery storage, smart cities, etc.) and improvement in carbon capture from enhancing green cover and use of advanced technologies. This would be a daunting task and would need massive policy interventions to ensure investments across aforementioned sectors remain profitable enough to sustain well beyond 2030.' The ICRA research report notes that as per the government's five key investment areas, an incremental addition of 5x in non-fossil fuels power generation capacity by 2030 is required for which India would need about $450-500 billion investments including investment towards transmission infrastructure and storage capabilities.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA249","Opinion: COP26 deserves our attention","November 12, 2021 Friday","The Argus: Illinois Wesleyan University","Picture By Alyssa Lowder The Glasgow Climate Change Conference is a conference being held in Scotland for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 . The 2021 COP26 consisted of hundreds of world leaders coming together to discuss the effects of climate change from Oct 31 to Nov. 12.\~ The discussion on climate change needed to be aggressive and clear, and many leaders wanted more support for Biden's Build Back Better Plan. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out with a report before COP26 that detailed 10 Climate insights that need to be taken into account throughout the discussions in Glasgow.\~ The first insight was that 1.5 degrees celsius is still achievable but overshoot of this temperature goal was likely because there is a 2 billion gigatonne reduction needed with an additional linear decrease five percent yearly.\~ The second insight of the 10 that needed to be taken into account discussed how methane and nitrous oxides cannot be ignored within the decreases of emissions and need to be included and reduced. The third insight talks about the megafires happening all over the world. With Americans familiar with the fires in California that have not stopped burning nor been able to be controlled. These megafires are actually amplifying the already warming climate, affecting every ecosystem they touch.\~ The fourth insight discussed how tipping points within the climate, although now less likely, are still ever so dangerous. The fifth insight was that the climate action taken must be just with the richest 1% decreasing their emissions by a factor of 30 and the poorest 1% able to increase their emission by a factor of three. The world's poorest are the ones that are suffering the most compared to the world's richest that can afford to adapt to the changes within the climate that only affect them minimally.\~ The sixth insight relates closely to the fifth insight about climate justice that stated that household behaviors and lifestyles must change, specifically consumption patterns. For the top 1% that would mean both dispersing their wealth as well as not supporting a consumerist lifestyle and helping those that cannot provide for themselves or protect their families from climate change and the increased weather disasters it brings.\~ The discussion of politics in carbon pricing was what the seventh insight was composed of. There is currently carbon pricing in 61 countries but that only covers 20 percent of carbon emissions. The European Union carbon pricing is an example of how successful this program can be if the pricing is increased to make an economic difference.\~ The eighth climate insight was that nature based solutions are fundamental and need to be robust and resilient. Specifically not using already natural carbon sinks as additional offset resources because they are already factored into the current carbon budget we have.\~ Number nine discussed the resiliency of the ocean and how it is the global thermostat. This is important because there are countless threats to the ocean including direct exploitation, invasive species, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction and modification. Protecting marine life needs to be at the utmost priority as they support the ecological systems.\~ The tenth climate insight was that the costs of climate change mitigation are justified by the benefits to the health of humans and nature. The ultimate cost of climate destruction is the health of humans and animals combined. Thus the cost is worth the ever increasing price as we continue to delay climate action to work on mitigation and adaptation strategies for the future.\~\~ The Gaslow Conference spreads awareness for climate change and what we can do to stop it, implementing necessary measures to be utilized in preserving our planet for future generations. \"

Although the march was initially organized by Fridays for Future, the youth-driven movement inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, people of all ages gathered at George Square to demand climate action. From small children waving their handmade picket signs, to older adults demanding a better future for those that will come after them, the HYPERLINK COP26 host city saw citizen activists in unprecedented numbers rallying to get their message heard.

An even larger march is expected on Saturday. Young climate activists take part in demonstrations at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Welsh citizen Jane Mansfield carried around a sign that read:  Code red for humanity , the HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/secretary-generals-statement-the-ipcc-working-group-1-report-the-physical-science-basis-of-the-sixth-assessment signature phrase UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres used after the latest HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/ IPCC \~ HYPERLINK report published earlier this year warned of a looming climate catastrophe.  I really care about the world that we are passing on to future generations, and what we are doing to the Global South. I live in southwest Wales and climate change is clearly happening, but we don\'b4t even grasp what is happening in so many other parts of the world and I am scared, she told UN News. Latin-American Indigenous leaders were also among today\' s demonstrations. They were the ones leading the march and several of them sent a loud message to world leaders: stop extracting resources and to \' leave carbon in the ground\' .  Indigenous people are dying in the river; they\' re being washed away by massive floods. Houses are being washed away, schools full of children inside, bridges, our food our crops, everything is being washed away , they said at a stage in George Square. Meanwhile, some activists wore bobblehead masks of presidents and prime ministers and depicted them as being arrested with signs that read  climate criminals .  Act now so that we still have a future to live in. While the World Leaders Summit took place in the Blue Zone this week, we asked visitors to our Green Zone what their message was for global leaders across the river.The youth have spoken.

The leaders are not doing nothing; they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves, and to continue profiting from this destructive system. This is an active choice by the leaders to continue the exploitation of nature and people and the destruction of presents and future living conditions to take place , she said, calling the conference a  greenwashing event . Other Friday for Future members, speaking to UN News, asked for more participation and better youth representation in the negotiations that are underway at COP26 .  Every year we have been disappointed by COP, and I don\' t think this year will be different. There is a sliver of hope but at the same time we don\' t see enough action, we can\' t achieve anything with just pledges at empty promises , said a representative of Youth Advocates for Climate Change in the Philippines  Negotiations are happening and yet we are here in the street, because we haven\' t been included. The richest people come in their private jets and take the decisions. We are here and we won\' t be ignored. We will make our own space , another climate advocate added. The Youth Statement The same call was made inside the Blue Zone of the conference, where climate activists from YOUNGO, the Children and Youth Constituency of UN Climate Change, delivered to the COP presidency and other leaders a statement signed by 40,000 young people demanding change. The statement raises several points of concern, among them inclusion in climate negotiations. They also asked Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( https://unfccc.int/ UNFCCC ), to support their efforts to have a paragraph mentioning the importance of the youth included in the final declaration that is expected to be adopted at the end of COP26 . The statement, which was handed over to Ministers, also asks for action on climate finance, mobility and transportation, wildlife protection and environmental conservation.  Wherever I have been in the world, I have been struck by the passion and the commitment of young people to climate action. The voices of young people must be heard and reflected in these negotiations here at COP. The actions and scrutiny of young people are key to us keeping 1.5 alive and creating a net-zero future , said Alok Sharma, COP26 President. Meanwhile, the UK and Italy, in partnership with HYPERLINK https://en.unesco.org/ UNESCO , Youth4Climate and Mock COP coordinated new global action to equip future generations with the knowledge and skills to create a net-zero world. As Education Ministers and young people gathered, over 23 countries put forward national climate education pledges, ranging from decarbonizing the education sector to developing school resources. UN News/Laura Qui\'f1ones Activist dressed as dinosaur character takes part in demonstrations at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The youth are right: the new commitments aren\' t enough The UNFCCC published HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/cop26-update-to-the-ndc-synthesis-report its latest updates of the national commitments thus far to reduce carbon emissions, and although some advances have been made during the conference, they are still not enough.  A sizable increase, of about 13.7 per cent, in global greenhouse emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 is anticipated , the report says. Before COP, the increase was calculated at 16 per cent, but for the world to be able to curb global heating and avoid disastrous consequences, emissions must be cut by 50 per cent in the next nine years. For Carla Huanca, a young activist who travelled all the way from Bolivia to be in Glasgow with her friend, the dinosaur  T-Resilient , another extinction can\' t be a possibility.  We young people will be the ones that will inherit this planet, and that is why it is so important that our voices are heard. We demand government actions by governments to have the planet we want, she told UN News. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA251","Hawaii's Message At COP26: The World Must Move Beyond Zero Emissions","Honolulu Civil Beat","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 22, 2021( Honolulu Civil Beat: HYPERLINK http://civilbeat.com http://civilbeat.com Editor's note: The state's Climate Commission is hosting a post- COP26 event on Jan. 13 with Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. See details in HI EVENTS on climate.hawaii.gov. 'Keep Glasgow cold, wet and grey,' said a sign held by one of the protesters standing outside the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference venue in Glasgow, Scotland. It succinctly portrayed what combatting climate change means  an existential threat to our way of life, cold and wet as it may be for some of us. Taking an important message to the world, a delegation from warm and sunny Hawaii headed to COP26 earlier this month, led by Gov. David Ige. Cabinet officials, climate policy staff, and an 'ohana' delegation of lawmakers, UH scientists, law professors, students, and youth and youthful activists from Hawaii community groups spent time at COP26 relaying Hawaii's world-leading ambitions through High Impact Actions, and a strong message that net-zero greenhouse emissions is not enough  we must go beyond zero to save islands. Hawaii is the David to climate change's Goliath, the small state with a big ambition, 'because we believe that big ambition leads to big action.' When Gov. Ige announced the goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045, other governors were disbelieving of him; three years later in 2018, California  the world's fifth-largest economy  followed and set the same target as Hawaii. Hawaii was the first state to show its commitment to the Paris Agreement by enshrining it in law. This year, the Hawaii Legislature declared a climate emergency, making Hawaii the first state to do so, and highlighting once again, Hawaii's leadership. Special U.S. Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said that Paris, in 2015, was the building of the arena. This year, Glasgow starts the race to zero and gives a blueprint for how to get there by 2030. Hawaii's ambitions are already beyond zero. By law, Hawaii must absorb more carbon than it emits by 2045 or sooner. Gov. Ige compared the situation to being in a sprint relay. Hawaii delegation to COP26 included Department of Land and Natural Resources Chair Suzanne Case, First Lady Dawn Ige, Gov. David Ige, Climate Commission Coordinator Anukriti Hittle and Hawaii State Energy Office Chief Energy Officer Scott Glenn. The governor is pictured at top with U.S. Climate Alliance Govs. Jay Inslee of Washington state, Kate Brown of Oregon and J.B. Pritzker of IllinoisOffice of the Governor/2021 Why go all the way to Glasgow? Everyone knows Hawaii, and when Hawaii speaks, people listen. At COP26 , Hawaii continued to push the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) goal, and highlight the challenges faced by small island states. Going to Glasgow in the face of adverse pandemic conditions showed Hawaii's commitment to climate action, and its support of the federal government's renewed efforts. More broadly, what did Glasgow achieve? The U.S., to show it was £ll in' after being absent from the world climate stage the past four years, unveiled more funding for adaptation, and signaled more of a role for 'mother nature.' With all the new pledges combined, forecast models say we will still achieve only 1.7 degrees Celsius, not the well-under 1.5 Celsius needed to keep Hawaii warm, sunny, and wet where it should be. Still, that's one thing that came out of COP26  higher ambition. Priority Policy Areas So what does higher ambition mean for Hawaii? COP26 as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a 25-governor bipartisan network that represents an economy larger than all countries but the United States and China, and works hard to uphold and go beyond the U.S. pledges offered. The priority policy areas for collective coalition adoption span sectors of power, buildings, industry, transportation, and across the economy, including areas such as resilience, just transition and equity, natural and working lands, and the cost of greenhouse gases. Hawaii was applauded in particular for its impressive record of including women and diversity in climate governance  over 50% of positions in the state's Climate Commission are held by women, and almost three-quarters are held by ethnic minorities. Everyone knows Hawaii, and when Hawaii speaks, people listen. But high ambition is not enough. It only means something if it leads to big action. The state's Climate Commission Co-Chair Suzanne Case unveiled Gov. Ige's-approved Hawaii High (HI) Impact Actions that define our own state-level version of the pledges made at the national level. Only  you guessed it  Hawaii's are more ambitious. Case pointed to nitty-gritty actions that commission member departments are taking over the next year. She showed what these high impact actions look like on the ground. Over 70 specific actions are listed on the commission's Goals and Progress page[1], for anyone wishing to take a peek. In a consensus-driven process such as the COP26 , we go only as fast as our slowest runner. And that means truly embracing that we are a global community with global impacts  we cannot hide behind national borders. Even with its many inequities, vulnerabilities, capacity constraints and challenges, Hawaii's culture and community embodies connections to the larger Pacific. It is a place that understands how to move ahead with everyone in agreement, sprinters and less-resourced alike. And that's what Hawaii brings to the world  an island leadership that is relevant not only for the sunny places, but also for those that are cold, wet and grey.

Many have today criticised the final agreement as not going far enough in efforts to prevent the devastating impacts of climate change. The international aid agency is also calling on government and industry leaders to consider the COP26 agreement a baseline and to put vulnerable children and young people at the heart of more ambitious climate change prevention plans. They should do this by ensuring that children are fully involved in developing and implementing ambitious country plans that aim to stop the world's temperature rising above 1.5C. Only this will guarantee that all plans and promised donor funding towards ending the climate crisis are realised in ways which address the needs and rights of the most vulnerable children. Pleas for children to be fully involved in ending climate change have been echoed by young people who attended COP26 . Two youth advocates from Sierra Leone, Tenema and Tejan, said ""We want our governments and NGOs to create a platform where children are being empowered to be climate ambassadors."" Ellen from Ireland said, ""I'm really passionate about young people having a say in decisions that affect them; we're so often overlooked. I would just like our world leaders to realise the urgency of this and make the most of those of us who are willing to offer some help."" Whilst World Vision was glad to see a call for all parties and stakeholders to develop guidelines for enhancing public participation in climate change decision making and the inclusion of children and youth, we wait to see how this commitment will be implemented to value young voices at all levels of climate conservation plans. Andrew Morley, World Vision International President and CEO, said: ""We salute the children who have stepped up in ways we could never imagine at COP26 . Girls and boys told governments about the appalling impact of climate change on their lives, with life-threatening consequences for nutrition, health, education and protection. They even came forward with solutions, such as Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration, or natural re-greening."" ""Now it is time for world leaders to heed their call to action.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA254","Pockets of leadership ahead of COP26","Investor Strategy News","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 22, 2021( Investor Strategy News: HYPERLINK http://www.investorstrategynews.com Usually restrained fund managers are venting their frustrations with governments and companies over climate inaction. The rebukes get louder as COP26 gets closer. Martin Currie, a global equities house with about $9 billion in Aussie shares, has made its position clear on what it would like to see come out of the Glasgow meetings for world leaders and others, scheduled to run from October 31-November 12. Martin Currie's recently established Stewardship Institute issued a note to investors last week (October 22) which indicates the roles all interested parties, including asset owners and managers, should play. The manager also calls out the Australian government for its tardiness on climate action. The investors' note, ' COP26 : A climate for change?' says that high-level commitments on climate change are no longer enough. If the gathering is to be considered a success, then more specific action and a greater sense of urgency are needed - not just from governments, but also from companies and investors - resulting in a tangible shift in the decarbonisation pathway of the wider economy. 'As investors, we are extremely concerned that action at COP26 will not be significant enough to put the world on a pathway to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,' the note says. 'The latest IPCC report, published in August, was rightly described by UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, as a 'Code red for humanity' and a warning that without a significant step up in efforts then keeping warming below a threshold of 1.5 degrees could become out of reach. 'In our view, it is critical that COP26 is used as an opportunity to accelerate action and for governments, companies, and investors to take specific action to rejuvenate momentum on climate action. We want to see COP26 set up a climate for real change, commitment, and action from all players.' John Gilmore The note was written by David Sheasby, Martin Currie's head of stewardship and ESG, and John Gilmore, stewardship and ESG specialist. They say that COP26 must succeed in creating decisive action from governments in three key areas: 1. Climate laggards need to step up. The note points out that G20 countries account for 78 per cent of the world's emissions and have the resources to tackle climate change effectively. 'There should be no excuses for inaction here, and key hold-outs such as Australia should stop vacillating and make national net-zero commitments and follow it up with real policy action.' In addition, countries without interim targets or where they lack detail, such as India and China, need to show a much clearer roadmap for immediate action rather than further postponement. China, for example, is still increasing its use of coal and that needs to change quickly. 2. Fair financing needs must be met. The commitment agreed at COP16 for developed countries to provide US100 billion annually to fund climate transition has not been met. only a fraction of the financing comes from grants, too much of this funding comes with unwelcome conditions or in the form of loans, many of which have above market interest rates. This creates a disincentive for climate investment by developing countries. 3. Fixing carbon pricing and ending fossil fuel subsidies. Carbon pricing is a key mechanism for incentivising economies to move away from fossil fuels and carbon intensive activities. 'Our view is that even in the absence of a global carbon tax or trading scheme being implemented, a commitment on a global floor for the cost of carbon would be a promising first step. Without this, there is a clear disincentive to move first on carbon pricing,' the note says. For investors and investee companies, Sheasby and Gilmore say there is an urgent need for more decisive action in three key areas. They are: Investors must take collective action to promote net zero Companies need to deliver real-world emissions reductions, and As a fund manager, Martin Currie, which became a signatory to the UN's PRI in 2009, has accelerated its own commitments and stepped up its actions through corporate engagement, reducing its carbon footprint as a business, becoming a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and by building 'climate resistant portfolios'. Sheasby and Gilmore said separately that for the latest round of talks there had been more focus on individual country actions than collective responses. 'There hasn't been a real follow through on prior challenges around financing climate action for developing countries that we refer to in the article and no real traction on areas that need a collective response like carbon pricing,' Sheasby said.'This requires leadership and goodwill and there seems to be a lack of goodwill or bandwidth to generate real progress on these items.' With fund managers, they could be clearer in setting out expectations for companies and engaging with them on these. They should be using escalation tools at their disposal, such as holding directors to account through voting or filing or supporting carefully targeted shareholder resolutions. Sheasby said: 'Climate change is a material risk for many companies, so they need to be prepared to provide detail and context on how they are approaching this. Managers need to be prepared to scrutinise the targets that companies are setting to understand whether the businesses that they are investing in are really sustainable over the long term.' Asked about Australia, he said the Australian government did not show leadership but that the finance industry and many of the super funds had stepped up and taken on this role. Even in the global context those funds had shown leadership, he said. 'An example is HESTA, which has focussed on climate change for a number of years and last year was the first major superannuation fund to set out a goal of being net zero by 2050.'

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA256","STATEMENT: BRIGHT SPOTS AT COP26 NEED TO TURN INTO ACTION AND EVEN MORE AMBITION IN 2022","November 13, 2021 Saturday","States News Service","The following information was released by the World Resources Institute (WRI): The UN climate negotiations ( COP26 ) have concluded. The 151 new national climate commitments submitted ahead of and during COP26 fell short of putting the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C. But after two weeks of negotiations, delegates reached consensus that countries should further strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets next year, deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts. Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute: ""In a year marked by uncertainty and mistrust, COP26 affirmed the importance of collective global action to address the climate crisis. While we are not yet on track, the progress made over the last year and at the COP26 summit offered bright spots and a strong foundation to build upon. The real test now is whether countries accelerate their efforts and turn commitments into action. ""Negotiators found common ground on key issues, including agreeing to further strengthen 2030 targets in order to keep the 1.5C goal within reach, step up and accelerate financial support to developing countries, establish a dedicated space to finally address permanent losses and damages from climate impacts, and finalize rules to implement the Paris Agreement. A particular bright spot at COP26 was how effective vulnerable countries, youth and climate campaigners were in demanding greater action and accountability. And for the first time, negotiators explicitly agreed to accelerate action to phase down unabated coal power and phase-out fossil fuel subsidies an important step forward. ""A number of major emitters have weak 2030 plans and will need to put forward more aggressive targets to drive down emissions this decade. Encouragingly, countries agreed to come back next year to submit stronger 2030 targets and to put forward long term strategies that aim towards a just transition to net zero by around mid-century. If the world is going to beat back the climate crisis, no one can sit on the sidelines. ""It is inexcusable that developed countries failed to meet their commitment to deliver $100 billion annually starting in 2020, even as they provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for fossil fuels. It is significant that the final outcome at COP26 puts developed countries on the hook to report on their progress towards the $100 billion goal. Countries also made headway toward developing a new financial goal that goes beyond 2025. Nations also agreed to at least double funding for adaptation by 2025, implying at least $40 billion, which is very important progress. "" COP26 ""One of the more worrying outcomes from COP26 is the rules for international carbon markets. While negotiators agreed that double-counting the same emission reductions is unacceptable, it is unfortunate that countries agreed to allow the use of old emission credits to meet their new climate commitments. At COP27, it is crucial that negotiators put stringent guidelines in place to ensure these credits represent real reductions and minimize how many end up being used. ""The big announcements outside the formal negotiations were encouraging. Collectively they signal a resolve for the world to deliver the systemic change needed in key sectors to put us on a more sustainable path. Countries, companies and investors announced plans to accelerate the shift away from coal power, to drastically cut methane emissions, to halt and reverse forest loss, and to align private investments to net-zero. The Science Based Targets initiative offered a new standard for companies to verify their net-zero commitments. The value of nature was prominent in Glasgow, including the need to quickly scale up nature-based solutions and landscape restoration, make agriculture more sustainable and protect the ocean. Much more needs to be done to quickly convert these promising initiatives into real world action and ensure they are just and inclusive. ""The train is moving and all countries need to get on board. As attention shifts beyond COP26 , it's critical for everyone to step up their efforts and turn commitments into real action in ways that benefit all people."" \"

Mitchell/Getty Images News via Getty Images Under pressure to avoid catastrophic climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed for the first time to phase down unabated coal-fired power plants and most fossil fuel subsidies while pledging to submit more ambitious emission reduction targets just a year from now. The 11-page Glasgow Climate Pact also adds pressure on nations to quickly ramp up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade in hopes of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. By adopting the pact, they might be able to keep a narrow window open for meeting the most ambitious goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The unprecedented deal reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Nov. 13 came after days of grueling and often tense negotiations over wording for the coal plant retirements, rules guiding a global carbon market, and how to compensate vulnerable nations for climate disasters happening today. People bring water and food to neighbors in a Belgian town that suffered record-high rain tied to climate change in July 2021.Source: Tierry Monasse/Getty Images News via Getty Images ""Together, over the past two weeks, parties have demonstrated what the world had come to doubt: That countries can rise above their differences to unite against a common challenge,"" an emotional COP26 President Alok Sharma told delegates after the Glasgow pact was adopted. ""I think today we can say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees within reach. But its pulse is weak, and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate our commitments into rapid action."" Deep disagreements remained over the final Glasgow document, with the European Union and other nations telling the summit they were disappointed with the coal language becoming weaker at the last minute. Coal-dependent China and India nearly jeopardized the final deal by insisting that ""phaseout"" of coal plants be changed to ""phase-down."" Small island states and developing nations also demanded and failed to secure finance commitments for the loss and damage they already suffer from climate change. In the end, government diplomats huddling in the cavernous conference center in Glasgow chose to set their differences aside to support the deal, which also finalized rules of the Paris accord. Here is how nations delivered and fell short on three critical goals that the U.K. COP26 presidency set for the high-stakes summit. 1. Keeping 1.5 degrees C within reach The Paris Agreement called on nations to keep the global temperature rise to ""well below"" 2 degrees and ideally to 1.5 degrees over preindustrial levels. If world leaders managed to keep hopes alive in Glasgow, they also kicked the can down the road by agreeing to revisit their emission pledges a year from now. As part of their Paris commitments, countries were expected to deliver updated and more ambitious plans to the United Nations ahead of COP26 , detailing how they planned to cut emissions by 2030. Unless the total output of climate-warming pollution is reduced by 45% below 2010 levels by 2030, a stabilized net-zero emissions world would become unattainable, scientists have warned. In all, 13 countries and the 27-nation European Union submitted updated plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, but their effort fell short. Although the U.S. and many other countries set more ambitious carbon reduction goals in recent months, some nations simply resubmitted their 2015 emission reduction plans. Brazil and Mexico were among a few that even scaled back their ambitions. Halfway through the conference, researchers sounded the alarm. Not a single country including the world's top emitters had policies in place that could zero out emissions by midcentury, Climate Action Tracker concluded. The world was on track to reach 2.4 degrees or higher, the organization projected. The U.S. was among the nations in Glasgow that pushed for another round of Nationally Determined Contributions by late 2022 when leaders meet for the next climate summit in Egypt. It means nations get another chance to submit new and possibly significantly more ambitious plans next year. 2. Boosting climate finance Developing nations wanted to see rich countries make good on a decade-old promise to award $100 billion annually to help them develop clean energy sources and adapt to rising sea levels, drought and other climate impacts. The vast majority of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere were generated by the U.S. and other Western economies over the past 250 years. The Glasgow Climate Pact promised to double funding for adaptation by 2025 and to report back on the progress they were making in meeting the $100 billion goal. It also, for the first time, called for a two-year dialogue on a finance mechanism to compensate nations for loss and damage. But the lack of concrete funding commitments and weak deliverables frustrated COP26 delegates and groups who for years had pushed for more support for vulnerable nations. ""It is inexcusable that developed countries failed to meet their commitment to deliver $100 billion annually starting in 2020, even as they provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for fossil fuels,"" Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement. Others warned that the failure to immediately address ""loss and damage"" could slow the overall global climate effort. ""Rich countries dragging their feet on the mechanism to compensate the poorest countries for climate damages that are already being suffered is shameful and has to be resolved,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. ""Both because it's the right thing to do and because failure on this would greatly complicate things on emission reductions."" But COP26 COP26 Thirty countries along with numerous local governments, automakers and investors also signed a declaration to accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles during the two-week climate summit, and more than 130 leaders from government, corporations and financial firms promised to collaborate to halt deforestation by 2030. 3. Wrapping up carbon market rules When Sharma hit his gavel Nov. 13 to declare ""Article 6"" of the Paris Agreement rulebook adopted, the COP26 meeting hall broke out in a cheer. An outstanding but critical part of the Paris rules, Article 6 spells out how nations can establish a global carbon market to help reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, which proved to be one of the thorniest issues to resolve from the 2015 pact. ""The agreed Article 6 rules give countries the tools they need for environmental integrity, to avoid double-counting [emission reductions] and ultimately to clear a path to get private capital flowing to developing countries,"" said Kelley Kizzier, the Environmental Defense Fund's vice president for global climate. There has been concern over the Glasgow deal allowing countries to carry over old credits from the Kyoto Protocol that preceded the Paris Agreement to meet their new carbon reduction commitments. But Kizzier noted that the credit allowance was limited to 120 million metric tons of carbon and would not be allowed past the first round of national climate commitments. 4. COP26 While the national climate pledges disappointed, COP26 delivered in some other key areas that Sharma had deemed critical for meeting the 1.5-degree target: speeding up the retirement of coal plants and accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. Before agreeing to the new language on coal in the Glasgow Climate Pact, 46 nations had already pledged during the summit to phase out their coal fleets and to stop building new plants unless they are equipped with carbon capture technology. Three of the world's top 10 coal generators signed the deal but not the three largest ones the U.S., China and India. The focus on coal at COP26 was unprecedented and signals change, said Chris Littlecott, an associate director for the climate change think tank E3G. ""We have broken through the barrier of governments accepting that coal has to go,"" Littlecott said. ""Even for those who are trying to slow it down and who try and do it on their own terms, that mental barrier has now gone."" \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA258","Please don't fall for COP26's empty rhetoric","African Arguments","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 08, 2021( African Arguments: HYPERLINK http://www.africanarguments.org http://www.africanarguments.org COP26 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the COP26 World Leaders Summit. Credit: Karwai Tang/ UK Government. As government delegations from across the globe gather in Glasgow for COP26 , the entire world is awaiting and expecting serious, comprehensive, and urgent action to combat an existential crisis facing humanity. Instead, the UK, the host nation, has been engaging in what you could call Government by Press Conference. Instead of working towards the necessary actions we need to address the climate crisis, we've been treated to a PR show. We've been offered one announcement after the next, each designed to capture headlines and reassure us that our leaders are doing what is needed. Yet a closer look reveals they all disguise a central hypocrisy or are riddled with loopholes. Take the declaration[1] that over 40 countries have come together and committed to phase out coal. This is a great thing, right? If we're going to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we will absolutely need to stop coal, as well as oil and gas. Yet the UK - the first country to benefit from fossil fuel powered industrialisation - is itself opening a new coal mine[2]. Or take the announcement[3] that several countries will end overseas fossil fuel financing. What could be more urgent and important? The instinct on hearing such news is of course to celebrate. But delve into the detail, and you see that these same countries will continue to subsidise fossil fuel production in their own countries. Or, finally, take the pledge by over 100 countries to cut methane,[4] the most potent of the greenhouse gases, by 30% by 2030. Again, one desperately wants to see this as a victory, but one third of anthropogenic methane emissions are caused by fossil fuel production. How can you commit to cutting methane meaningfully without committing to cutting oil and gas? It doesn't add up. Scientists calculate that emissions need to fall by 45% by 2030[5] if we're going to keep global heating to 1.5C. But even after all these announcements emissions are still set to increase 13.7% by 2030[6]. The highest polluting governments want to be able to tell the world that they get it, that they hear the message young people are sending and that they recognise we're in a climate emergency that requires large-scale transformative change. But their actions prove that they don't. For them, it's PR and it's crucial we don't fall for it. Those of us from regions of the world that contributed to the lowest greenhouse gas emissions yet are feeling the worst impacts of the climate crisis have learnt this lesson the hard way. Over many years, we've been promised funds for adaptation to survive extreme weather events. We've greeted with excitement repeated high-level pledges to mobilise resources to support us in dealing with irreversible loss and damage caused by climate breakdown. And yet, we've seen hardly any progress. In 2009, world leaders in Copenhagen promised to channel $100 billion to less wealthy countries by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change. That is a tiny sum compared to what is actually needed, but even this is yet to be delivered[7]. And now they're talking of mobilising trillions. How can we swallow new promises when we're faced with the emptiness of old ones? In Africa today, about half a billion people don't have reliable access to electricity. We need to build[8] our energy capacity and can do so in a way that doesn't add to the climate crisis. It just requires clean technology and finances, and yet rich countries are not providing them. And so, we have a situation in which a group of vulnerable countries are eager to do their part in solving a problem they did not cause. Meanwhile, the rich polluting countries that did cause the problem are denying them even this opportunity. Sadly, the past year and a half has only deepened this sense of distrust and this divide. We are living through an unprecedented global pandemic against which our best weapon is the Covid-19 vaccine. Yet even though it would ultimately be in rich countries' own interests to allow poorer countries to manufacture and distribute the vaccine and so reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging and spreading, they refuse to release the patents. For all the rhetoric of following the science and global solidarity, still just a tiny fraction[9] of Africa's populations have been able to get the jab. The people must act The main objective at COP26 is to keep global heating to 1.5C. Let's be clear: this is not a safe and stable level. We're already at 1.1C and are facing an unprecedented frequency of extreme weather events and climate instability. Every increment higher, things get exponentially worse. After decades of inaction, though, we are at the stage that limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C would be a huge relief. If you're looking to COP26 to deliver this, however, you'd be dangerously mistaken. Powerful and wealthy governments are incapable or unwilling to do what is necessary. This puts the responsibility back on people across the world force their hand. We need to mobilise at all levels globally. We need to get to the streets, petition our representatives, and make our priorities known through what and where we buy. We need a global movement to discuss, debate and demand the people-centred change we need to survive, not more PR.

(Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images) This story originally appeared in The Guardian[1] and is part of 'Climate Crimes,' a special series by The Guardian and Covering Climate Now. Mark Hertsgaard is Covering Climate Now's executive director. Glasgow, Scotland COP26 president Alok Sharma held back tears as he accepted India's last-minute motion to weaken the summit's pledge to 'phase out' coal. Sharma had been saying for months that he wanted COP26 to 'consign coal to history.'And until India insisted otherwise at the 11th hour, it looked like the summit might achieve that scientifically imperative task. But United Nations climate negotiations operate by consensus: Each of the 197 participating nations can veto the majority. In effect, India with China's support had threatened to block the agreement entirely if the text was not softened from 'phase out' to 'phase down' coal. Moments after Sharma gaveled the Glasgow Climate summit to a close on Saturday, this reporter asked if he had tried to talk India out of its explosive last second demand to weaken the summit's pledge. Did Sharma, as the summit's presiding officer, try to dissuade India from this hostage-taking? A plainly weary Sharma declined to divulge his conversations with the delegations, but said, 'Anyone watching the footage can make up their own minds about how I felt.' 'It is emotional,' he added. 'I have visited frontline communities around the world who are experiencing the effects of climate change. I'm disappointed we couldn't get that language across the line.Still, the COP26 president said, this was the first time in the history of UN climate negotiations that a coal phaseout was even mentioned in the agreements that governments signed. It's impossible to be happy about COP26 's outcome virtually every country said the Glasgow Climate Pact[2] was less than what it wanted, and island nations in particular were furious over India's last-second intervention but the pact was not an irredeemable failure. Sharma's claim that COP26 had 'kept 1.5 alive' is plausible, if barely. One reason is that the pact obliges the world's governments to come back next year and try again and bring stronger action plans with them. A second reason pertains to a recent climate model that remains little-known among the public, the press, and even many policy-makers and that could fundamentally shift our thinking about what's possible: Contrary to widespread belief, there is far less additional temperature rise irrevocably 'baked in' to the climate system than the three to four decades that was previously believed. Fast, dramatic emissions cuts can therefore still make a big difference. Current Issue HYPERLINK https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-29-december-6-2021-issue/ https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-29-december-6-2021-issue/ The provision urging countries to develop more aggressive climate action plans before COP27 markedly accelerates the schedule that existed prior to COP26 , when the world's governments were not due to update action plans until 2025. 'Scientists have found that governments' current action plans would cause global temperatures to increase to 2.4 [degrees] C, which would bring absolute devastation to hundreds of millions of people and ecosystems around the world,' Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said in an interview at COP26 . 'So waiting five years to come back to the table is not an option.' What's more, next year's updated climate action plans must outline what governments will achieve during the 2020s the so-called 'decisive decade' when global emissions must be cut in half to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C rather than by 2050, the date referenced by many government 'net zero' pledges. And United Nations Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres went further, urging[3] that action plans be updated 'every year' throughout the 2020s while also 'raising ambition.' Requiring annual updates could encourage stronger action around the world, said Guterres and other civil society leaders. Annual updates would expose developed countries, fossil fuel states, and other foot-draggers to more frequent and sustained pressure from developing countries, which generally want more climate action, as well as from the media, activists, Indigenous peoples, religious leaders, and other elements of civil society. Sending £ message of hope and resolve toall those leading the climate action army,' Guterres said after COP26 ended that 'I know many of you are disappointed.' The secretary-general added, 'We won't reach our destination in one day or one conference. But I know we can get there. Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward. I will be with you all the way. COP27 starts now.' Pushing forward with the ambition of capping average global temperature rise to 1.5 C need not be an exercise in futility in light of scientists' updated understanding of the climate system. For decades, scientists thought that even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped overnight, the inertia of the climate system in particular, carbon dioxide's long-life span in the atmosphere would nevertheless keep driving global temperatures higher for at least 30 more years. But Scientific American recently explained that this is £n old idea' that scientists have discarded. 'As soon as CO2 emissions stop rising,' the magazine explained[4], 'the atmospheric concentration of CO2 levels off and starts to slowly fall because the oceans, soils and vegetation keep absorbing CO2, as they always do. Temperature doesn't rise further. It also doesn't drop, because atmospheric and ocean interactions adjust and balance out.' Kevin Anderson, a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, affirmed the Scientific American analysis. 'It's now well-established in the scientific community that if we stopped all emissions today, we would stop almost all of the temperature rise and most of the resulting impacts,' Anderson said. The problem is that governments at COP26 were not acting on what science says, Anderson added. 'Science tells them, if we want to hold to 1.5 [degrees] C, what we need is rapid, deep cuts in emissions,' he said.'But there is absolutely no sign of that from the negotiators here. So, they are explicitly choosing to fail poor people today, who suffer the worst impacts of the climate emergency, as well as the young people who have to live with this in the future.' 'The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees [C] is a death sentence for us,' Aminath Shauna, the Maldives' minister of environment, climate change and technology, told the summit after India insisted on weakening the coal phaseout pledge. India had justified its position as a balanced and pragmatic approach that recognized that some developing countries still relied heavily on fossil fuels. Shauna responded, 'What is balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time. It will be too late.' Meanwhile, Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace vowed that she and fellow climate justice activists around the world 'will be back in the streets starting Monday.' 'We will be pushing governments to phase out not just coal but all fossil fuels and be much more ambitious in general,' Morgan said. 'So when governments come back to these negotiations next year, they'll bring climate action plans that actually match the climate emergency.'

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA260","Commentary: How global climate negotiations work and what's expected from COP26","New Hampshire Bulletin","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 26, 2021( New Hampshire Bulletin: HYPERLINK https://newhampshirebulletin.com Over two weeks in November, world leaders and national negotiators will meet in Scotland to discuss what to do about climate change. It's a complex process that can be hard to make sense of from the outside, but it's how international law and institutions help solve problems that no single country can fix on its own. I worked for the United Nations for several years as a law and policy adviser and have been involved in international negotiations. Here's what's happening behind closed doors and why people are concerned that COP26 might not meet its goals. What is COP26 ? In 1992, countries agreed to an international treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[1] (UNFCCC), which set ground rules and expectations for global cooperation on combating climate change. It was the first time the majority of nations formally recognized the need to control greenhouse gas emissions[2], which cause global warming that drives climate change. That treaty has since been updated, including in 2015 when nations signed the Paris climate agreement[3]. That agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to 'well below' 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), and preferably to 1.5 C (2.7 F), to avoid catastrophic climate change[4]. COP26 COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 through Nov. 12, after a one-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. HYPERLINK https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FAnL5/4/ https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FAnL5/4/ [7] Why are world leaders so focused on climate change? The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report, released in August 2021, warns in its strongest terms yet that human activities have unequivocally[8] warmed the planet, and that climate change is now widespread, rapid, and intensifying. The IPCC's scientists explain how climate change has been fueling[9] extreme weather events and flooding[10], severe heat waves and droughts[11], loss and extinction of species[12], and the melting of ice sheets and rising of sea levels[13]. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the report a 'code red for humanity.'[14] Enough greenhouse gas emissions are already in the atmosphere, and they stay there long enough that even under the most ambitious scenario[15] of countries quickly reducing their emissions, the world will experience rising temperatures through at least mid-century. However, there remains a narrow window of opportunity. If countries can cut global emissions to 'net zero[16]' by 2050, that could bring warming back to under 1.5 C in the second half of the 21st century. How to get closer to that course is what leaders and negotiators are discussing. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the latest climate science findings a 'code red for humanity.' (UNFCCC) What happens at COP26 ? Once the heads of state depart, country delegations, often led by ministers of environment, engage in days of negotiations, events, and exchanges to adopt their positions, make new pledges, and join new initiatives[17]. These interactions are based on months of prior discussions, policy papers, and proposals prepared by groups of states, U.N. staff, and other experts. Nongovernmental organizations and business leaders also attend the conference, and COP26 has a public side[18] with sessions focused on topics such as the impact of climate change on small island states, forests, or agriculture, as well as exhibitions and other events. The meeting ends with an outcome text that all countries agree to. Guterres publicly expressed disappointment[19] with the COP25 outcome, and there are signs of trouble[20] heading into COP26 . Celebrities like youth climate activist Greta Thunberg add public pressure on world leaders. (UNFCCC) What is COP26 expected to accomplish? Countries are required under the Paris Agreement to update their national climate action plans every five years, including at COP26 . This year, they're expected to have ambitious targets through 2030. These are known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs[21]. The Paris Agreement requires countries to report their NDCs, but it allows them leeway in determining how they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The initial set of emission reduction targets in 2015 [22]was far too weak to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One key goal of COP26 is to ratchet up these targets to reach net zero carbon emissions[23] by the middle of the century. Another aim of COP26 is to increase climate finance[24] to help poorer countries transition to clean energy and adapt to climate change. This is an important issue of justice for many developing countries whose people bear the largest burden[25] from climate change but have contributed least to it. Wealthy countries promised in 2009 to contribute $100 billion a year[26] by 2020 to help developing nations, a goal that has not been reached[27]. The U.S.[28], U.K., and EU[29], among the largest historic greenhouse emitters, are increasing their financial commitments, and banks, businesses, insurers, and private investors are being asked to do more. Other objectives[30] include phasing out coal use and generating solutions that preserve, restore, or regenerate natural carbon sinks, such as forests. Another challenge that has derailed past COPs is agreeing on implementing a carbon trading system[31] outlined in the Paris Agreement. Chinese street vendors sell vegetables outside a state-owned coal-fired power plant in 2017. (Kevin Frayer/ | Getty Images) Are countries on track to meet the international climate goals? The U.N. warned[32] in September 2021 that countries' revised targets were too weak and would leave the world on pace to warm 2.7 C[33] (4.9 F) by the end of the century. However, governments are also facing another challenge this fall that could affect how they respond: Energy supply shortages[34] have left Europe and China with price spikes for natural gas, coal and oil. China[35] - the world's largest emitter - has not yet submitted its NDC[36]. Major fossil fuel producers such as Saudi Arabia[37], Russia[38], and Australia[39] seem unwilling to strengthen their commitments. India[40] - a critical player as the second-largest consumer, producer, and importer of coal globally - has also not yet committed. Other developing nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, and Mexico are important. So is Brazil, which, under Javier Bolsonaro's[41] watch, has increased deforestation of the Amazon - the world's largest rainforest and crucial for biodiversity and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. What happens if COP26 doesn't meet its goals? Many insiders believe that COP26 won't reach its goal[42] of having strong enough commitments from countries to cut global greenhouse gas emissions 45 percent by 2030. That means the world won't be on a smooth course for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and the goal of keeping warming under 1.5 C. But organizers maintain that keeping warming under 1.5 C is still possible. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been leading[43] the U.S. negotiations, remains hopeful[44] that enough countries will create momentum for others to strengthen their reduction targets by 2025. The world is not on track to meet the Paris goal. (Climate Action Tracker) The cost of failure is astronomical. Studies have shown that the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius[45] can mean the submersion of small island states, the death of coral reefs[46], extreme heat waves, flooding and wildfires, and pervasive crop failure. That translates into many premature deaths, more mass migration, major economic losses, large swaths of unlivable land, and violent conflict over resources and food - what the U.N. secretary-general has called £ hellish future.'[47] This article is republished from The Conversation[48] under a Creative Commons license.

Glasgow is expecting more than 30,000 visitors, including some 120 world leaders. The transport ministry is warning of widespread disruption, and says it is working on contingency plans including limited rail service across the city and between Glasgow and Edinburgh, operated by managers and supervisors that are not members of the union.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA263","FIVE CLIMATE JUSTICE BENCHMARKS FOR A SUCCESSFUL COP26","October 29, 2021 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by ActionAid: Here's what the experts say is required from this landmark climate summit ActionAid's expert spokespeople and young activists from the Global South are available for interviews, briefings and commentary throughout COP26 Ahead of the G20 summit and COP26 climate talks, ActionAid is setting out five climate justice benchmarks to build trust and deliver the action needed to limit warming to 1.5\'cbC. The international social and gender justice organisation, which works with women and girls living on the frontlines of the climate crisis, will be bringing their voices to Glasgow as vaccine inequality and Covid-19 restrictions drive exclusion from this year's summit. Teresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator at ActionAid International, says: ""The world is holding its collective breath as COP26 is set to decide our shared future. The negotiations will reveal whether the wealthy countries most responsible for the climate crisis can step up on the ambition and finance needed to protect communities on the frontlines, limit warming to 1.5\'cbC and prevent catastrophic climate breakdown. ""A successful COP26 will put people and the planet before profits and business-as-usual. It will recognise that women, Indigenous Peoples and communities in the Global South are already leading the fight against the climate crisis and need urgent support to scale up their response. It will deliver real action to cut emissions to real zero. ""As the terrifying reality of increasingly frequent and severe heatwaves, wildfires, flooding and hurricanes is already with us, it's too late for anything but radical and transformative action."" ActionAid's five climate justice benchmarks for a successful COP26 : 2. Years of climate negotiations have failed to deliver a new financing mechanism to support countries to recover from the impacts of the climate crisis. Loss and damage finance must be on the table at the negotiations and COP26 must deliver a decision on a new loss and damage fund to support climate vulnerable communities, including women and girls, in the Global South. 3. To have a realistic chance of limiting warming to 1.5C, climate targets must bring emissions down to Real Zero, not Net Zero. Real plans for real transformation in energy, food, transport and industrial systems are needed, based on just transitions and countries' fair share of action. Too many Net Zero climate plans are based on far off 2050 targets when action to cut emissions and phase out fossil fuel production must start today. The majority of Net Zero plans legitimise emissions-as-usual through carbon offsets, long-shot technologies and land grabs. ActionAid research shows there isn't enough available land on earth to meet the demand for planting the vast new forests, bioenergy crops and unproven technology that so many Net Zero' plans rely on. 4. Article 6 negotiations must not be allowed to crank open the loopholes and double counting in carbon markets that allow polluters to carry on polluting business-as-usual. Carbon offsetting, whether included in Net Zero climate pledges or traded as part of carbon markets, is being used to greenwash climate inaction and threatens to drive land grabs and human rights infringements in the Global South. 5. Agriculture negotiations must agree a transition away from the harm caused by industrial agriculture and intensive animal farming, towards agroecological farming practices. These farming techniques work with nature, build climate resilience and cool the planet while improving land rights and access to markets, including for Indigenous communities, rural women and smallholder farmers. All Parties must include ambitious and rigorous environmental protections into their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to prevent further loss of biodiversity and wildlife.

This statement is being made in light of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) summit in Glasgow, Scotland. BSP Governor Benjamin E. Diokno said, 'Central banks and financial institutions should recognize their important role in contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy. As stewards of the financial sector, we should all commit to act with urgency in achieving the desired emissions reduction targets and in promoting the sustainability agenda.' For the COP26 Champion the sustainability agenda in the financial system through the roll out of the initiatives under the Sustainable Central Banking (SCB) Program to foster environmentally responsible and sustainable policies and work practices. The SCB Program embodies the essential roles of the BSP as an enabler, mobilizer, and doer in relation to advocating sustainability principles in the financial system. Provide an enabling regulatory environment to equip banks in managing climate change, environmental, and social risks, and at the same time, unlock financing to economic activities contributing to sustainable development. Facilitate the conduct of climate stress-testing exercises and collection of more granular data on climate, and environmental and social risks exposures in the banking industry. Promote a collaborative approach in the financial sector and harmonize policies and align initiatives with the objectives and strategies of the Philippine Sustainable Finance Roadmap and Guiding Principles. Build partnerships to intensify awareness and capacity-building activities for the financial sector. 'We need to take advantage of the momentum calling for action, and step up our response towards climate change,' Governor Diokno added. In July 2020, the BSP became a plenary member of the NGFS, a group of central banks and financial supervisors that voluntarily exchange experiences and best practices to enhance the financial sector's environment and climate risk management and accelerate the transition towards a sustainable economy. \"

Nowhere is this more evident than the Lake Chad Basin, which covers almost 8% of the continent and supports tens of millions of people. The United Nations says it has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s because of drought. The resulting competition for resources has caused poverty and conflict. Over 10 million people are dependent on humanitarian assistance. Oladosu Adenike, 27, has witnessed Lake Chad's tragic transformation firsthand. She is a prominent campaigner on climate change in Africa and started the Nigerian ""Fridays for Future"" campaign, joining the global movement after meeting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Adenike is one of several young African delegates who traveled thousands of miles to Glasgow, Scotland, to be part of the COP26 climate summit and to convey their sense of urgency to world leaders. ""The peace and stability in this region -- in the Lake Chad region, the Sahel -- it depends on when we are able to restore the lake and able to say that people can get sustainable livelihoods, for them not to be able to be vulnerable to join armed groups of people. And this will likewise improve democracy in the region,"" she told VOA. Adenike is an official Nigerian youth delegate at the COP26 summit and has addressed senior delegates on the need to act fast. But she says she is frustrated by slow progress. ""We are still in the talking phase. We have not yet transited into the action phase, which is needed right now this moment, and not postponing it into the future. Because that is the most dangerous thing you can do right now. Delay now is a denial of the climate change crisis,"" Adenike said. Kaluki Paul Mutuku is a youth delegate for Kenya. Like Adenike, he's a prominent young voice in the fight against climate change in Africa. ""We are constantly in the fear of losing our family members, losing our communities because the climate is dry -- it is worsening by the day -- there are droughts, there is extreme rainfall, and communities cannot bear it,"" he told VOA. ""Just in 2019, we had a huge locust invasion that took over our crop plantations. We had huge floods in Nairobi, which killed so many people, and just this year, we are having so many people lives being lost due to starvation and famines,"" he said. Mutuku said that delivering on climate finance -- the money rich countries have agreed to pay poorer nations to adapt to climate change and decarbonize their economies -- is the most vital outcome of COP26 . The 2009 pledge to pay $100 billion a year still has not been met. ""How do we finance to avoid emissions in Africa? How do we equip communities with resources and money to really be able to adapt to climate change, and how do we ensure that we give climate proofing for them?"" he said. For young activists from around the world, it has been a long journey to COP26 in every sense. They say they will continue to fight for climate justice long after they return home. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA270","COP26: The Time for Delivery is Now, Say Imperial College-London Experts","November 17, 2021 Wednesday 8:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Imperial College London issued the following news: By Hana Amer, Simon Levey, Katrine Petersen and Siobhan Stack-Maddox Experts discuss the work that needs to happen now, after the UN climate change conference concluded with a new agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact. COP26 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference that came to a conclusion in Glasgow this weekend, has delivered a new climate pact that was agreed by more than 190 countries that have signed up to the Paris Agreement on climate change. The conference saw the UK Presidency finalise an agreement where all signatories acknowledged, for the first time, that burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) is warming the planet and causing our climate to change. However, many were disappointed by the shortfall in countries' pledges to cut their emissions, known as their 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs), which scientists say still do not put the world on track for the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperatures to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Dr Fredi Otto, Senior Lecturer at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, said: ""1.5 C is not dead, but pledges do not reduce emissions, only national policies do, and they have to be implemented. So, it's a Schrodinger's cat situation in that it's dead and alive for now - and we'll only know which it really is when we measure emissions in the coming years."" Another critically important part of the COP26 negotiations was the issue of climate justice, and finance from developed countries to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, as well as compensate for what is known as 'loss and damage' - those impacts that cannot be adapted to, such as hurricanes destroying homes, or island nations disappearing due to sea level rise. COP26 saw progress on acknowledging the importance of this finance and the responsibility of developed countries to provide it, but many developing countries were left frustrated with a lack of tangible outcomes. Alyssa Gilbert, Director of Policy and Translation at the Grantham Institute, said: ""At an international stage, loss and damage was a bigger and clearer discussion in this COP than I have seen previously, but still not addressed head on. This topic will remain essential to developing nations and an international compromise is not clear yet."" For researchers at Imperial College London, a delegation of whom attended the climate summit as official observers of the process, the opportunity to meet activists, business representatives and policymakers from all over the world has sparked new discussions and ideas. In this piece, they consider what the Glasgow Climate Pact means for their ongoing work to bring about a greener, cleaner, fairer future for all, and emphasise the importance of rapid, immediate action to deliver on the outcomes of COP26 , and close the gaps and shortfalls it left behind. Emission reduction pledges Professor Martin Siegert, Co-Director of the Grantham Institute, said: ""Whereas the Paris COP21 in 2015 was characterised by a huge wave of enthusiasm for the 'Nationally-Determined' first steps towards decarbonisation, Glasgow COP26 has been a sobering meeting where we acknowledged that much more global ambition is needed if we are to avoid the worst consequences of dangerous climate change. ""Certainly, the next attempt to raise ambition cannot wait another 6 years - and one outcome from Glasgow will be more regular updates to carbon reduction targets. Such meetings may succeed if non-State actors and Governments work together to form not just 'pledges' but comprehensive plans for rapid decarbonisation that are supported by their citizens."" Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, Chair of the Grantham Institute, added: ""Overall, COP26 achieved as much as I realistically expected, with some pluses and some minuses. However, the crucial tests of all the words spoken and promises made are:will the global greenhouse gas emission curve reach a maximum by the middle of this decade and then start to fall? Are the developed countries now going to give substantial help to developing countries to cope with damage due to climate change and to pursue low carbon growth?"" Looking ahead, Dr Ajay Gambhir, Advanced Research Fellow at the Grantham Institute, commented: ""[The updated pledges] signal a pathway to a less than 2 C warmer world for the first time, which is hugely encouraging. But that has to be contrasted with the fact that emissions continue to rise, so it's now critically important that the policies and measures to deliver the envisaged peak and then rapid fall in emissions are put in place all over the world."" Professor Ralf Toumi, Co-Director at the Grantham Institute, added: ""The CO2 in the atmosphere is the ultimate verdict on all our efforts."" Climate finance and justice Izhar Shah, Research Associate at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, said: ""It is clear that the climate conscience is back in policymaking [...] Globally speaking, I see a divided house between developed and developing countries. What I'd like to see is developed countries providing technological and financial assistance to developing economies."" Dr Friederike (Fredi) Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute, commented on the COP26 outcomes on climate finance: ""The weak outcome on loss and damages[...] shows that climate change is still mainly regarded as a future problem in anything other than rhetoric. The developed states are still not prepared to take responsibility for what has happened already and that is a problem, the next COP really needs to move forward on climate justice which is not just inter-generational."" On important next steps, Courtnae Bailey, Research Postgraduate on the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP, commented: ""Doubling adaptation finance from 2019 levels [as agreed in the COP26 text] is great, but this still does not fill the adaptation finance gap."" She continued: ""The private sector needs to be engaged in financing adaptation for the scale of finance needed to flow. Governments therefore need to start rewarding investment in resilience and sustainability."" In agreement that despite the steering for more finance towards adaptation, more technical know-how and deeper understanding is needed of what works successfully, Alyssa Gilbert highlighted: ""Similarly, just transitions are an essential part of the discussion. Recognised very clearly in Glasgow, but also lacking funding and, perhaps like adaptation, it is still not clear what a just transition really looks like - which could be very different in different parts of the world. This will remain an important area for development."" Nature and biodiversity Patrick Walkden, a Research Postgraduate on the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet DTP (SSCP DTP) at the Natural History Museum and Imperial college, highlighted that at COP26 , ""there was finally some recognition of the interconnectedness of both the climate and biodiversity crises and that there are synergies in addressing both."" Fellow SSCP DTP Postgraduate Researcher Galina Jonsson agreed that ""despite being long overdue, officially recognising the crucial role of 'protecting, conserving and restoring ecosystems and nature' in tackling climate change is a leap in the right direction."" For Senior Lecturer Dr Bonnie Waring, ""one thing is certain: meeting net zero goals will necessitate not only protection of existing forest, but also the recovery and restoration of areas deforested in the past. There is a very urgent need for the ecological community, working in concert with local stakeholders, to provide data and tools that can guide best practices for restoration efforts. We must also provide rigorous ways to explore potential synergies or trade-offs among the different ecosystem services forests provide."" Postgraduate Researcher Galina Jonsson emphasised that future action must ""bridge the gap between the climate and biodiversity agendas. Currently, climate change and global biodiversity loss have separate international conventions (UNFCCC and CBD, respectively). The vital next step is to enable a unified approach where international goal and targets are well-informed and appropriately implemented to simultaneously tackle both crises and avoid finding ourselves with divergent goals and targets that should be tackled under one banner, where progress towards one can be at the expense of the other."" Fossil fuels Krista Halttunen, a Postgraduate Researcher on the SSCP DTP, emphasised that "" COP26 was the first time that fossil fuels were explicitly mentioned in a climate agreement. Even though the final language on coal 'phase-down' and 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies is not particularly strong, the deal still sends a signal to investors and markets that fossil fuels may not be a good investment for the future."" Additionally, ""the last-minute change of phrasing highlights the need to include developing country perspectives in the discussion about the future of fossil fuels, specifically how to map out realistic pathways for phasing out incumbent industries. I hope to include this perspective more in my future research as well."" For Krista, ""the next important question is, what will a managed phase-out look like in practice, from the perspective of companies, governments and investors?"", a question which is central to her research. ""I think the announcements at COP26 have paved the way for more concerted efforts and new collaborations to develop pathways and solutions in this area."" Looking ahead, Krista said ""the discussions at COP26 show that even though an energy transition will not happen overnight, fossil fuel phase-out is now firmly on the global agenda. I hope that governments, companies, and investors will take note of this and start planning for a managed transition away from fossil fuels now. Delaying the planning will only increase the risk of a sudden and disorderly transition, likely to have significant negative impacts on societies, economies and investments."" Paloma Ortega Arriaga, a fellow SSCP DTP Research Postgraduate stressed that ""fossil fuels should be phased out and the money spent on these should be relocated to clean energy technologies and to people who lack energy access."" Civil society and climate change Societal engagement with climate change - through education, local climate solutions and citizen engagement - will play an essential role in driving climate action. COP26 , Dr Vasiliki Kioupi, Assistant Teaching Fellow at the Centre for Environmental Policy, said: ""This COP26 Dr Neil Jennings, Partnership Development Manager at the Grantham Institute, stressed the importance of engaging everyone in the journey to reduce emissions: ""Although the level of public support for climate action is very high, it still remains a significant challenge to implement emission reductions on the scale and speed necessary while keeping all the public on board. This challenge points to the importance of deliberative democratic approaches for guiding local climate action and to focusing on the principles of a Just Transition - ensuring that the shift to a low carbon economy is well planned and that no one is left behind."" Dr Emma Lawrance, Mental Health Innovations Fellow at the Institute of Global Health Innovation, said people may experience impacts on their mental health when engaging with climate change: ""It's important that we can create communities that have the foundations to care for each other and our health while simultaneously acting on climate. The good news is that invariably, what is good for climate is good for people's mental health; whether reducing air pollution, more active ways of getting around, or more tree cover and biodiversity in our cities. ""We will be working with our partners around the world to create ways to learn from each other and ensure the hidden costs of climate inaction on our wellbeing, as well as the multiple benefits of climate action for healthier, fairer societies, are accounted for and heard by decision-makers."" Representation and inclusion With the UK Presidency committing to deliver an ""inclusive COP26 "", Postgraduate Researcher Paloma reflected: ""since I started studying my PhD on energy access, I realised how important it is to understand and include the needs of the local communities before designing any type of intervention. COP26 has reinforced this view, because the most valuable lessons I learned and the wisest words I heard during the week I attended COP26 were from youth activists and indigenous people. Like Paloma, Postgraduate Researcher Patrick was inspired by youth activism ""especially against the backdrop of what is an incredibly slow and oftentimes demoralising process, it injected much need enthusiasm and inspiration, giving hope that we can begin to hold governments and corporations to account so that they can bring down emissions and move towards greater sustainability."" However, Paloma highlighted that youth and indigenous groups ""were underrepresented, and on many occasions, overlooked by decision makers, media and other people attending COP26 . I really believe that we need to give them the space and attention they deserve and include them more in the process."" Postgraduate Galina agreed, emphasising that COP is ""the only formal democratic space where smaller climate-vulnerable nations have a voice and the only place where indigenous peoples, women and other groups disproportionally affected by climate change have a voice, but only when they are not locked out of the process. RINGOs, the only non-advocacy observer constituency, were also locked out. UNFCCC must ensure this is not repeated at future COPs."" Reflecting on the UK Presidency, Alyssa Gilbert said: ""It was hugely inspiring to have a COP hosted by my home country. The locality meant that the discourse influenced people across the nation, spurred on by greater media attention, and the UK as hosting government was forced, even if too briefly, to make climate change issues central to other policy areas and commitments. I had underestimated how powerful this effect can be."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7668022 MSTRUCK \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA272","Insurers make progress on climate resilience at COP26, face fossil fuel battle","December 3, 2021 Friday","SNL Insurance Daily","The insurance industry made further progress on climate change resilience at November's COP26 , but has a ways to go when it comes to reducing or eliminating underwriting for carbon-related activities. Insurers had a bigger presence at COP26 than at previous gatherings and had a particularly robust showing in the resilience conversation, Rowan Douglas, head of global insurance broker Willis Towers Watson PLC's climate and resilience hub, said in an interview. The industry unveiled two initiatives to advance greater climate resilience globally. The Insurance Development Forum, an industry-led public-private initiative that aims to improve countries' natural disaster resilience through insurance and risk management, at COP26 launched the Global Risk Modelling Alliance, which seeks to improve climate-vulnerable countries' access to risk modeling. It also co-established the Global Resilience Index Initiative to create a global model for measuring climate resilience. The next step for both initiatives is building public-sector support and getting the Global Resilience Index Initiative up and running by next year's COP27 meeting in Egypt, Ekhosuehi Iyahen, the Insurance Development Forum's secretary general, said in emailed comments. Fossil fuel feud Continued support for fossil fuel underwriting got a frosty reception from some at COP26 , raising questions about their progress on climate goals. Industry representatives were clear during COP26 that carriers would not stop insuring fossil fuels entirely, but instead help companies make the transition to renewable energy. There is a role for engagement with fossil fuel companies on a transition, Peter Bosshard, global coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign, said in an interview. But that engagement should be time-restricted and have consequences, otherwise insurers are just ""kicking the can down the road,"" he said. Bosshard said insurers have made rapid progress on exiting coal underwriting, but expressed disappointment in their different approach to oil and gas. He said the first step carriers should make is to stop insuring the expansion of oil and gas production and stop giving off the impression that they are ""trying to buy themselves more time"" to underwrite fossil fuel projects. Members of the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, or NZIA, consisting of 14 insurers and Lloyd's of London, pledge to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in their underwriting portfolios to net-zero by 2050. The NZIA is looking to launch its target-setting protocol in January 2023, after which members have six months to come up with their first set of interim five-year goals. The alliance is also working with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials on a global standard for measuring and disclosing insured greenhouse gas emissions, slated for launch in summer 2022. ""If it is 100-meter race we are just off the starting blocks,"" Butch Bacani, program leader for the UN Environment Programme's Principles for Sustainable Insurance Initiative, said in an interview. Just getting started S&P Global Market Intelligence asked the eight NZIA founding members whether they planned to go further on curbing oil and gas underwriting than already announced and what limits they were imposing on engagement. Swiss Re AG reiterated a pledge made in 2020 to stop providing individual insurance cover to the companies responsible for the 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas production in the world by July 2023. Munich Re said it was sticking to the plan announced in December 2020, which includes cutting carbon emissions relating to oil and gas underwriting by 5% by 2025. ""We monitor relevant market developments and continuously expand our ESG strategy,"" an Allianz SE spokeswoman said in an email. The NZIA waiting for certain metrics and goal-setting does not mean its members are doing nothing in the meantime, Bacani said. Insurers joining the alliance need to tell the UN what they plan to do over the next 12 months to decarbonize their underwriting portfolios immediately. The alliance is also pushing for companies to do more carbon reduction early on so there is less reliance on not-yet-proven carbon reduction technologies to reach net-zero, Bacani added. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA273","American Nuclear Society Urges COP26 to Recognize Nuclear Energy's Climate Role","November 3, 2021 Wednesday 8:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The American Nuclear Society posted the following letter: On behalf of over 10,000 nuclear engineers, scientists, and technologists, the American Nuclear Society urges COP 26 delegates to insist that any agreement arising from COP26 include a strong role for nuclear technology in achieving carbon reduction targets. Deep decarbonization and electrification of the global economy will require the increased availability of firm, ""dispatchable"" zero-carbon energy technologies. Nuclear energy is the only energy source with a proven track record of producing firm, zero-carbon energy at the scale needed to meet global goals. Indeed, it's increasingly clear that achieving net-zero worldwide carbon emissions is simply not feasible without a significant expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy worldwide. Specifically, we urge the delegates to assume that a significant commercial deployment of new reactor designs and advanced nuclear fuel will occur in the 2030 timeframe and to acknowledge that such a scale-up will require a significant investment in research and development funding for advanced nuclear technologies. Deep decarbonization requires action in all sectors of the world economy, not just electricity generation. As such, we urge delegates to recognize the inherent advantages of employing nuclear technology for industrial process heat, hydrogen production, district heating, and desalination. To achieve decarbonization as rapidly and efficiently as possible, governments and policymakers must implement technology-neutral, performance-based climate and energy policies that treat all carbon-free energy sources fairly and equally. Nuclear must be treated on a level playing field with other clean energy technologies. Delegates should not accept anything short of fair and equal treatment for nuclear energy vis-a-vis other zero-carbon sources, as doing so would be fundamentally incompatible with global progress on climate, economic prosperity and energy security. As a recognized civil society organization with UN observer status, ANS will be on the ground in Glasgow during COP26 where we are sponsoring ten delegates from the Young Generation Network. As representatives of ANS, the pro-nuclear delegates will be attending events in the exclusive bluezone during the next two weeks. ANS's social media channels will be resharing photos, videos, and observations from our COP26 delegates who hail from Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. ANS is also taking our message directly to COP26 attendees by participating in Nuclear For Climate's booth where ANS's logo and images will be on display. Our message at COP26 is clear: Carbon-free nuclear energy must be a part of our climate solution and the time to act is now. Six years on from the Paris Agreement, our world leaders need to get serious about climate change and that starts by preserving and expanding nuclear energy. Sincerely, Craig H.

Setting a new pledge to reduce emissions by 2030, launching a global initiative to rapidly cut methane, and increasing financing for developing countries are a good start. ""However, more is needed to turn words into action. Given the urgency of the climate crisis, and as the largest historical emitter, the US must step up with bold climate action promises and pledges are no longer enough. We urge the Biden Administration to do everything in its power to pursue more ambitious and just emissions reductions, further scale up of finance for adaptation, and address the climate impacts already devastating vulnerable communities across the world. ""In the following days at COP26 , the US must work with other countries to secure a strong outcome that ratchets up emission reductions by major economies. Current pledges are still far below what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. ""Back in Washington, the US must back up its global climate commitments with congressional action. Passing the Build Back Better plan offers an historic opportunity to invest in good green jobs and reduce emissions. But achieving emission reductions must go beyond investing in the green energy transition. The time has come to end the chokehold fossil fuels have on our economy by ending subsidies that allow fossil fuel companies to profit even more from climate destruction. Additionally, Congress must also make good on US global climate commitments by scaling up appropriations for international climate finance. ""We are seeing the devastating impacts of the climate crisis in the US and across the world, particularly on vulnerable communities. It is code red for humanity. Ambitious climate action cannot wait."" \"

AKAH is part of the official Tajik delegation to COP26 together with the Committee for Environmental Protection, Agency for Meteorology, Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, and other relevant agencies. During the panel events, representatives from the delegation presented their work and plans towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the country's NDC, or Nationally Determined Contribution. They discussed how the Government of Tajikistan and the international community could collaborate on climate-resilient development in mountain areas, taking into account four key priorities of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and Sustainable Development Goals 11 (building sustainable communities and cities) and 13 (climate action). With the Government of Switzerland agreements for joint engagement on forestation, glacial lake monitoring, snow leopard preservation and modalities for integrated habitat and watershed assessments were finalised. Recognising the scale of the challenge and the need for closer cooperation, the five countries of Central Asia Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan came together for the first time to present a single regional position at COP26 . The opening ceremony of the exhibition of Central Asian countries was held under the motto ""5 countries, 1 region, 1 vote"". During the talks in Glasgow, the countries discussed the implementation of key issues of the Paris Agreement and initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, as well as the transition to a green economy, renewable energy sources and climate-sustainable development.

COP26 , where crucial work was done to highlight climate innovations happening in our communities that can be scaled up to help meet national goals to stop climate change. ""FCM proudly brought Canadian municipal voices to the international fight against climate change. Local governments have influence over half of the country's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and are key to meeting Canada's climate goals. From coast to coast to coast, communities of all sizes are on the front lines of climate change, but they are also at the forefront of climate action. ""In advance of COP26 , FCM's Big City Mayors Caucus declared support for the Cities Race to Zero pledge as part of the United Nation's Race to Zero campaign. FCM's priorities at COP26 were to align national and local climate action, and promote the importance of scaling-up investments in local pathways to net-zero. ""At COP and beyond, FCM is supporting disaster mitigation, strengthening local capacity on climate, supporting communities transitioning to net zero, as well as expanding the federal-municipal collaboration on climate action in our shared mission to meet Canada's 2030 emissions reduction target. ""Municipal leaders play a critical role in the mission to meet Canada's emissions reduction target and set the country on a pathway to net-zero by 2050. FCM's representation at COP26 continued building strong relationships with key partners, including Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault, the Minister of Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson and Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change Patricia Fuller. Deepening federal-municipal coordination, aligning national and local climate action and identifying opportunities to scale up local solutions for deeper GHG reductions were at the heart of our discussions. It was also an opportunity to promote the ways municipalities can partner with the federal government to retrofit buildings, electrify the transportation sector, reduce methane from landfills and implement natural-climate solutions. ""Our delegation also engaged with mayors and organizations from around the world who are committed to taking urgent action on the climate crisis. That is why our delegation met with important organizations such as the federally mandated Net Zero Advisory Body, the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices, C-40 and the Global Covenant of Mayors, to name a few. ""Whether we're looking at retrofitting buildings and switching to zero-emission transit, restoring wetlands and other natural assets, building bike paths, diverting waste, or building resilient infrastructure, municipal leaders know how to build more sustainable communities. Our unique expertise makes us creative and innovative problem solvers, and empowered with the right tools, local leaders will play a vital role in this mission. ""The climate crisis is the defining challenge of our time, and while our participation in COP26 has given us determination to act, we know how much work remains to be done.

In order to achieve these goals, the nearly 200 nations that signed the Paris Agreement agreed to a framework for promoting policies and environmental actions focused on achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century. This objective of balance is often referred to as ""net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions and will be one of the main challenges that delegations representing the Parties to the Paris Agreement take up next week. Tackling that challenge, from October 31, 2021 until November 12, 2021, global leaders will gather in Glasgow, UK, for the 26th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC ("" COP26 "").1 We have identified four key points that businesses should be aware of ahead of the COP26 negotiations.

The NDCs are how each country decides what its contributions will be towards fulfilling the Paris Agreement's goals, including the temperature targets.2 Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, Parties are supposed to communicate updates to their NDCs every five years.3 The United States has recently updated its NDC, setting the target of reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels in 2030.4 The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, have committed themselves to a net reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990.5Many Parties have not announced updated NDCs since 2015. Given that the NDCs are the bedrock of the Paris Agreement, agreeing on enhanced NDCs is expected to be one of the more debated and closely watched topics at COP26 , including when and for which timeframe the new NDCs should be adopted. During the World Leaders Summit, when about 120 government leaders willspeak at the start of COP26 , we will likely see announcements from heads of state on updated NDCs and how countries plan to strengthen their commitments. Second: Paris Agreement Article 6 To ensure the operationalization of climate action, Article 6[1] of the Paris Agreement aims to incentivize international cooperation in implementing NDCs through various proposed mechanisms. One proposal concerns greenhouse gas emissions reduction or offset credit trading, a model allowing countries that are Parties to the Paris Agreement to sell unused emission reduction or offset units. Another proposal focuses on an international greenhouse gas emissions reduction or offset credit market, where private and public sector parties can trade credits. Article 6 is the only article in the Paris Agreement for which the Parties have not yet established rules, due to the complexity of its ambition. A key goal of the COP26 is finding a solution for Article 6. New rules will likely have more of an impact on countries that intend to use markets to satisfy their NDCs, and on businesses operating in those countries. Key issues that are likely to arise are accounting, certification of emissions reduction, and whether credits associated with the Kyoto Protocol market mechanism can be used under Parties Agreement Article 6. Third: Finance At the COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009, developed country Parties pledged to provide developing countries with $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020.6 The latest studies indicate this target will likely have been missed with climate funding by developed countries reaching about $80 billion in 2019.7 The United Nations has described climate finance for both mitigation and adaption to climate change as a key pillar to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement,8 and promoting an ambitious climate finance policy is one of the main goals of the UK presidency of COP26.9 In the run up to COP26 , the European Commission announced it is increasing its climate finance by EUR 4 billion until 2027, up from the existing $25 billion yearly contribution by the EU and its Member States.10 President Biden also announced that the US is doubling its financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis, and that with the help of increased private capital, the goal of mobilizing $100 billion to support climate action in developing nations will be met.11 Even with increases in financing by developed countries on the horizon, negotiation points at COP26 will include how the financing must be done in practice; for example, whether it should be loan-based or in the form of grants, with the latter preferred by developing countries. There will also be debates over how to increase funding for climate change adaptation in the developing world, which currently receives less funding than climate change mitigation efforts. Fourth: Accountability and dispute resolution Since its adoption, the Paris Agreement has influenced climate change litigation in ways that cannot go unnoticed by negotiators. Climate actions have been filed not only against states but also against companies. In a series of landmark decisions, both states and companies were ordered to reduce emissions and comply with targets set out in the Paris Agreement.The Dutch Supreme Court's 2019 Urgenda v. the Netherlands decision referred to the Paris Agreement in ordering the Dutch State to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. That ruling was followed by courts in Belgium[2] and Germany[3] finding that governments in those countries had not met their obligations to implement robust climate change mitigation policies. In a recent landmark decision, the Hague District Court ordered Shell [4]to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions from its business operations and sold energy-carrying products by at least net 45% at the end of 2030, relative to 2019 levels. While the Paris Agreement did not provide a binding legal requirement in these cases, it provided the factual backdrop for judicial action and, in some cases, informed the duty of care of states and companies from which basis the courts calculated its decisions. These rulings not only put pressure on both states and companies to set emissions targets, they are also expected to accelerate negotiations during the upcoming COP26 . Dispute resolution under the Paris Agreement is not likely to be a topic of debate. While Article 24 of the Paris Agreement sets the stage for negotiation and resolution of climate disputes, only a few states have made declarations to submit disputes to the International Court of Justice or arbitration. 1 The Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, which is the decision making body that oversees the Paris Agreement, will also be meeting in Glasgow. 2 UNFCCC, ""Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),"" available at: HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs [5]. 3 Article 4(9) of the Paris Agreement. 4 United States of America, ""Reducing Greenhouse Gases in the United States: A 2030 Emissions Target,"" April 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/United%20States%20of%20America%20First/United%20States%20NDC%20April%2021%202021%20Final.pdf https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/United%20States%20of%20America%20First/United%20States%20NDC%20April%2021%202021%20Final.pdf .[6] 5 European Union, ""Update of the NDC of the European Union and its Member States,"" December 17, 2020, available at: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/climate-finance-roadmap-to-us100-billion.pdf.h-2019-data-03590fb7-en.htm COP26 : Delivering on $100 billion climate finance,"" 12 October 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/cop26-dEuropean https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/ HYPERLINK cop26 -dEuropean eliverinon-100-billion-climate-finance/[9]; OECD, ""Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries: Aggregate Trends Updated with 2019 Data,"" 17 September 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/env/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-aggregate-trends-updated-witments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf https://www.oecd.org/env/climate-finance-provided-and-mobilised-by-developed-countries-aggregate-trends-updated-witments/European%20Union%20First/EU_NDC_Submission_December%202020.pdf .[10] 8 UNFCCC, ""UN Climate Chief Urges Countries to Deliver on USD 100 Billion Pledge,"" 7 June 2021, available at: https://unfccc.int/news/un-climate-chief-urges-countries-to-deliver-on-usd-100-billion-pledge https://unfccc.int/news/un-climate-chief-urges-countries-to-deliver-on-usd-100-billion-pledge [11]. 9 UKCOP26, "" COP26 Goals,"" available at: HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals https://ukcop26.org/ HYPERLINK cop26 -goals /[12]. 10 European Commission, Press, ""Opening address by President von der Leyen at the EU Sustainable Investment Summit via videoconference"", 7 October 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_5121 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_5121 [13]. 11 The White House, Briefing room, 'Remarks by President Biden Before the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,' 21 September 2021, available at: HYPERLINK https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/21/remarks-by-president-biden-before-the-76th-session-of-the-united-nations-general-assembly [14]/.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA281","Leverage #COP26 Twitter BETTER (fast), Climate Communicators","Learned On Women","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 05, 2021( Learned On Women: HYPERLINK http://learnedon.com http://learnedon.com HYPERLINK https://learnedon.com/wp-content/uploads/Influence.pngWe're https://learnedon.com/wp-content/uploads/Influence.pngWe're in a climate moment, folks. If you've been thinking that your Twitter platform is not worth developing, let COP26 preparation be your mind-changer. From the real-time, rapid changes and behind the scenes finagling of decision-makers, to the unbelievable number of organizations and leaders wanting to be seen on stage or in media coverage, COP26 social engagement is about leader-to-leader signaling. Are you ready to do your influencer part? Would there be value in not wasting time on that platform this time around? Here's a call to action: You've got a few weeks. You actually can make a difference if you more intentionally approach this platform. I've been behind the scenes building climate-focused leadership platforms (for NGOs and corporate clients), using Twitter as a key tool, since COP21. I've developed Twitter handles with high value followers and no affiliated website from week one. I've helped organizations who didn't know the corporate sustainability space well, or understand how to align with global climate stories, dig right in and make their climate announcements ring. I've helped get clients on the radar of key media with just 30 days before a milestone event. (See my LinkedIn[1] recommendations.) It's very rewarding and very doable, but it's not something that can be templated. It takes a few customized tips that speak specifically to things like how you should manage your 'pinned tweet' for most impact, how to use hashtags that bridge your organization to the news topics, and how more intentional quote tweeting can earn you extra thanks and appreciative follows (among many more). How on earth can YOUR tweeting get seen in the frantic COP26 streams? I have simple strategies. I never saw it coming, but Twitter naturally aligns with my particular reading, monitoring, journalist-appreciating, cheering on and community-engaging predilections. If even a handful more leaders or organizations leverage this awareness-raising power tool in this dire climate moment, the impact would be significant. Beware: Twitter is not the same as all of your other social platforms, so, my top, perhaps counterintuitive, tip is: don't waste time on Twitter at all if you can't tend it with strategic intention. Or, you can get help. That's why I'm here - to jumpstart the smart Twitter advantage that leaders, corporations and nonprofit communications, partner development professionals can take along with them to the virtual climate action dais. To be clear: this is not about rapidly gaining bazillions of followers just because. This is about you thinking 'in a dream world, we'd be able to informally DM with this journalist, that academic, or that potential partner' and aiming for it. It's about warming connections because you know you'll have reason to activate them for all the climate events to come (and they'll only get more dire). To influence climate discussions we have to build and amplify our own climate influence (before we need it). Let's do this. Even at this late date, you'd likely highly value a bit more expertise in your approach. A 30-minute coaching session, right now, will energize, guide and jumpstart your smarter use of this tool for leader-to-leader and media relationships in ways you can put to use immediately.

Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP Prime Minister Boris Johnson will call on ministers and negotiators to come together and bridge the gaps remaining to reach consensus at COP26 , as he travels to Glasgow in the final days of the climate summit today (Wednesday 10 November). Negotiators from 197 parties are in intensive talks to reach agreement on a range of key issues, including a common time frame for national commitments on emissions reductions and agreed methodology for countries to report on their climate action. These important technical points will help to ensure that commitments are translated into action. They are also working to agree progress on finance for nations most vulnerable to climate change and to address the issue of loss and damage in developing countries. The negotiations run alongside a series of government and private sector commitments on coal, cars, cash and trees made by throughout the two weeks of COP26 under the UK's presidency, with the goal of keeping the 1.5C target alive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: Negotiating teams are doing the hard yards in these final days of COP26 to turn promises into action on climate change. There's still much to do. Today I'll be meeting with ministers and negotiators to hear about where progress has been made and where the gaps must be bridged. This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people. We need to pull out all the stops if we're going to keep 1.5C within our grasp. The Prime Minister will be joined by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in Glasgow and will meet with representatives from the heads of delegations' negotiating teams and the observer groups, which represent a cross-section of civil society. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA283","What did we learn from COP26? Consider the three Ms","November 16, 2021 Tuesday 12:00 AM EST","strategy+business","Photograph by\~Flavio Coelho The recently concluded COP26 in Glasgow was, among other things, HYPERLINK a festival of acronyms Watching from afar, I came up with my own acronym to define the key takeaways from the two-week confab: MMM. Momentum, money, and measurement. Momentum . COP26 provided an important signal boost for the messages that participants were trying to get across. Momentum is also key to unlocking a crucial force for combating climate change: collective action. Efforts to reduce emissions or transform global trade networks only work if many people lock arms and agree to jump into an uncertain future together. Some activists will surely conclude that there wasn't enough collective action taken at COP26 . But the public pledges made at the conference-on HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/ deforestation , on HYPERLINK https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/cop26-heres-what-countries-have-pledged methane , on HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-declaration-on-accelerating-the-transition-to-100-zero-emission-cars-and-vans/ electric vehicles -were substantial. And these public promises help create momentum for further action. After all, upon reading a declaration of intent, the next question is: how do you plan to live up to it? Efforts to reduce emissions or transform global trade networks only work if many people lock arms and agree to jump into an uncertain future together. One of the biggest commitments made at COP26 had to do with the second M : money. Take HYPERLINK https://www.gfanzero.com/ GFANZ : spearheaded by former UK central banker Mark Carney, who HYPERLINK https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Mark-Carney-on-a-values-led-economy spoke to strategy+business last summer , the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero brings together 450 institutions with collective assets of US$130 trillion. That's a lot. One of the noteworthy developments of the last couple of years has been the volume of capital lining up behind technologies, products, services, and goods aimed at lowering emissions. To be sure, some of these dollars-and pounds and euros-can be ascribed to the good intentions of finance leaders concerned about their public image. But GFANZ demonstrates that there's a larger, more powerful dynamic at work. With each passing year, more and more low-emissions businesses pencil out, yield profits, and find viability in competitive marketplaces, from solar power plants to electric buses. As a HYPERLINK https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/audit-assurance/corporate-reporting/esg-investor-survey.html?utm_campaign=sbpwc&utm_medium=site&utm_source=articletext recent PwC survey found How do we know this? Well, it's because of the third M : measurement. There's an old saw in manufacturing that what gets measured in this world gets controlled. That speaks to efforts like tightly managing inventory and eliminating waste. When it comes to climate issues, measurement takes on a more important meaning. Measurement is one of the levers that will accelerate the energy transition that was discussed with such gravity in Glasgow, that will harness all that momentum, and that create a safe harbor for all those investor dollars. After companies, organizations, and countries make pledges to reduce emissions, both from their operations and from supply chains, they will have to measure and report those reductions accurately and carefully. Prices are one of the most familiar forms of measurement. And as HYPERLINK https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2021/pwc-global-carbon-pricing-report.html?utm_campaign=sbpwc&utm_medium=site&utm_source=articletext a joint PwC/World Economic Forum report , released on the eve of Glasgow, found, establishing an (acronym alert) ICPF, which stands for an International Carbon Price Floor, could spur emissions reductions.\~ As we look ahead, our responsibility-as consumers, businesspeople, and leaders-to measure our own progress will grow, and fast. Indeed, one of the to-do items for the participants in COP26 is to come back next year-not six years from now-with a road map for reducing emissions. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA284","COUNTRIES COMMIT TO CLIMATE RESILIENT, LOW CARBON HEALTH SYSTEMS AHEAD OF COP26","September 29, 2021 Wednesday 1:42 PM  EST","US Fed News","UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 29 -- The United Nations World Health Organization issued the following news release: Several Countries, including Cabo Verde, Madagascar, Malawi, and Sao Tome and Principe, have submitted formal commitments to the COP26 Presidency to strengthen the climate resilience and sustainability of their health systems. They have done so as part of the COP26 Health Programme, which has been designed to bring a stronger health focus and ambition to the UN climate conference in Glasgow this November. More countries are expected to join ahead of COP26 . In an effort to promote the COP26 Health Programme, two webinars were organized on 29th September, as part of an ongoing collaboration between the COP26 Health Presidency, WHO, Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) and other relevant partners. The first webinar in this series was opened by Dr. Naoko Yamamoto, Assistant Director-General, WHO, Hon. Ifereimi Waqainabete, Minister for Health and Medical Services, Fiji and Hon. Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, Minister of Health Malawi. The government of Fiji, which launched the Climate Resilient Health Systems Initiative together with WHO in May 2020, today formally committed to the COP26 Health Initiatives on Climate Resilient and Sustainable Low Carbon Health Systems and Facilities. ""In the midst of the pandemic, we had to recover from extreme weather events and manage the resulting health impacts,"" said Hon. Ifereimi Waqainabete, Minister for Health and Medical Services, Fiji. ""[It] has shown us that health systems and facilities are the main line of defense in protecting populations from emerging threats ... and that now is the time to increase our commitment to a safer, and more sustainable and inclusive future for all."" As part of the COP26 Health Initiative, Fiji has committed to (1) conducting a climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment (V&A) of the country's health system, health care facilities and the health of its population; (2) reviewing and strengthening its Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP); and (3) developing a roadmap for a climate resilient health system, and for a net-zero emission health sector before 2045. Hon. Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, Minister of Health Malawi, restated the commitments from Malawi today. The government of Malawi has committed to conduct a V&A, strengthen its HNAP, and develop a sustainable low carbon health system that reaches net-zero health sector emissions by 2030. ""The government of Malawi recognizes the essential role of the health sector to ensure a successful COP26 These commitments are welcomed by the UK government, WHO and Health Care Without Harm (HCWH), who coordinate the COP26 Health Programme. "" COP26 is an important platform for these commitments to help drive tangible action on the ground, to protect health and reduce emissions,"" said Dave McConalogue, Health Adviser, Health Services Team, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), United Kingdom. ""As we are driving forwards actions on climate change, we also need to maximize the health benefits of these actions."" ""The future of health system - as with all systems - has to be low carbon, and has to be resilient to climate impacts. These governments are leading the way, and COP26 is the right platform for others to join them,"" said Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, Head, Climate Change and Health Unit, WHO. ""These commitments by governments show that sustainable health care should not reduce quality of care. We will be there on the road to support you during and after COP26 ,"" said Sonia Roschnik, International Climate Policy Director, Health Care Without Harm. COP26 HEALTH PROGRAMME Climate change is resulting in poorer health outcomes, increasing mortality and is a driver of health inequities. However, health is well placed to be a significant part of the solution; the positive health impacts from stronger climate change action can motivate global ambition; health systems which are resilient to climate change can help protect their populations from the negative impacts; and sustainable low carbon health systems can make a substantial contribution to reducing national and global emissions. Health was selected as one of three science priority area for COP26 by the UK government. As part of the COP26 Health Programme, the COP26 Presidency is working alongside WHO, Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) and the UNFCCC Climate Champions to engage countries and stakeholders on climate and health. The COP26 Health Programme has been established to bring stronger health focus and ambition to COP26 . Initiatives under the COP26 Health Programme include:  Building climate resilient health systems.  Developing low carbon sustainable health systems.  Adaptation Research for Health.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA285","HOLY SEE: FAITH AND SCIENCE: AN APPEAL FOR COP26 FAITH LEADERS AND LEADING SCIENTISTS JOINED AT THE VATICAN TO RAISE AMBITION AHEAD OF COP26.","October 4, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: From: Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Published 4 October 2021 On 4 October 2021, faith leaders representing the world's major religions joined scientists at the Vatican to call on the international community to raise their ambition and step up their climate action ahead of COP26 . Almost 40 faith leaders signed a joint Appeal, which was presented by Pope Francis to COP26 President-Designate, the Rt Hon Alok Sharma, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hon. Luigi Di Maio. Signatories include high-profile representatives from across the Christian denominations, both Sunni and Shi£ Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism and Jainism representing a broad range of faith leaders. The Appeal: Calls for the world to achieve net-zero carbon emissions as soon as possible, to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels;"" Presses wealthier nations and those with the greatest responsibility to take the lead, stepping up their climate action at home and financially supporting vulnerable countries to adapt to and address climate change."" Urges governments to raise their ambition and their international cooperation to transition to clean energy and to sustainable land use practices, environmentally friendly food systems and responsible financing. With the window narrowing to restore the planet, the faith leaders and scientists implored the international community to take speedy action, saying: 'Future generations will never forgive us if we miss the opportunity to protect our common home. We have inherited a garden: we must not leave a desert to our children.' The Appeal follows months of dialogue, in which the faith leaders and scientists built a dialogue in a spirit of humility, responsibility and mutual respect to agree a common moral duty to tackle climate change. The diversity of participants makes this a highly significant moment with the potential to have a powerful impact not only at COP26 but also on the estimated 84% of the world's population who identify with a faith. COP26 President-Designate, Alok Sharma, said: I am honoured to receive this historic joint appeal as we press for progress towards limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C at COP26 in just a few weeks' time. We must all hear the voices of those most affected by climate change and I hope people of faith will continue to be a key part of this dialogue as we work together to drive forward climate action. Background note The Vatican event and Appeal were preceded by a series of virtual dialogues between the faith leaders and scientists throughout 2021. The event and dialogues were organised by the British and Italian embassies to the Holy See, as well as the Holy See itself. Logistical support and facilitation for the organisation of the event and its preparatory meetings have been provided by Wilton Park, an executive agency of the UK Government."" The Faith and Science: Towards COP26 meeting takes place after the preparatory COP26 events in Milan: the world Conference dedicated to young people 'Youth4Climate: Driving Ambition' and the Pre- COP26 (28 September to 2 October 2021)."" The UK, in partnership with Italy, will host the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow in 31 October-12 November 2021. The summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \"

The new index \'e2\€ developed by the Insurance Development Forum \'e2\€ will help insurers, lenders and investors measure the climate resilience of countries, companies and supply chains. The coalition behind the initiative aims to provide data using metrics that are based on insurance risk modeling principles. ""It is imperative that it is clear which financial flows and investments are Paris-aligned. Without this, we will not achieve the net-zero transition needed for 1.5\'c2\'b0,"" said UN Climate Envoy Mark Carney, who supports the GRII. ""GRII can play an important role by creating a shared understanding of mounting physical climate risks. In turn, this will help close the insurance protection gap and direct investment and aid to where they are needed the most."" Clean Energy Fund The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Allianz Global Investors plan to raise \'e2\£c500 million for a new fund that will support climate mitigation, climate adaptation and access to electricity in developing countries. The Emerging Market Climate Action Fund (EMCAF) will be a ""fund-of-funds"" that will invest in other climate-focused funds and clean energy projects. The initiative is supported by the governments of Germany and Luxembourg, the Nordic Development Fund and Swedish insurer Folksam. Launched at COP26 , the fund plans to mobilize substantial amounts of private capital to get projects off the ground in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. EMCAF will invest in specialized funds that support renewable energy projects such as onshore solar and wind, domestic and industrial energy efficiency, and adapting cities' infrastructure to make it more resilient. As EMCAF's investment adviser, the EIB will be responsible for identifying and appraising potential investments, while Allianz will manage the fund. AXA Tightens Up Oil Investment Policy French insurer AXA has tightened up its investment policy for the oil and gas sector announcing at COP26 on Monday that it will divest investment in ""climate laggards"" after three years if they are not making sufficient progress toward net-zero emissions. From 2022, AXA will apply a ""stronger climate lens"" to its investment criteria, using a science-based framework for the oil and gas sector that it plans to release this year. It will monitor actions taken by companies until 2025 and then decide if they should remain in its portfolio. ""If we don't see progress and strong commitments from companies, we need to be \'e2\€ \£6 ready to divest,"" said AXA Investment Managers Executive Chairman Marco Morelli. ""We must give companies the time to adjust but we must also adopt a no-compromise approach with investee companies that don\'e2\€  t take climate change seriously."" Starting in early 2022, AXA's portfolio will exclude companies for which oil sands represent over 5% of total production. It will divest from companies that derive over 10% of production from the Arctic region and exclude small players with over 30% of their production derived from shale/fracking. AXA also plans to exit all coal investments in OECD countries by 2030 and in the rest of the world by 2040. Staff Reports \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA289","For climate finance, COP26 starts Wednesday; plus, methane is the new coal","24/7 Wall St.","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 03, 2021( 24/7 Wall St.: HYPERLINK http://www.247wallst.com http://www.247wallst.com By David Callaway, Callaway Climate Insights[1] COP26 really starts Wednesday. That's when former Bank of England GovernorMark Carney, now the leading voice in global climate finance along with perhaps,Larry Fink, has promised a scorecard of what banks are where in their climate commitments. It's also when the first talks designed to create a global carbon market for emissions begin, in the form of soliciting an elusive agreement to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which establishes the market. Finally, it's when discussions about securing the $100 billion a year for poorer nations to fight climate change really get into full gear. Amid the pessimism around the United Nation's annual climate conference this year, sparked by lack of attendance from Russia and China's leaders and a frustrating pre-meeting of the G20 leaders in Rome, a few bright spots began to appear Tuesday. A deal among 90 nations to reduce harmful methane from fossil fuel plants and pipelines was greeted as a big success. It was prompted by a new rule from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reduce methane emissions by 41 million tons over the next 14 years. And India pledged to be net zero by 2070, which although 20 years later than everyone else (and 10 years after China), was still regarded as a step forward. Most surprising was to see Brazil sign on to the global deal to slash deforestation, which would help repair the damage done to the Amazon Basin. Though that global pledge has been made before, to little effect, it was still counted as a day one win by environmental activists. But for climate finance, which is the key to whether COP26 is a success or failure, the action begins Wednesday. In terms of stepping up, banks and asset managers have developed a large lead over governments in the last few years. Expect more concrete  and doable  results to come in the next few days.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA291","MINISTER GUILBEAULT WILL ACCOMPANY PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU AND THE CANADIAN DELEGATION TO UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE (COP26)","October 31, 2021 Sunday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Government of Canada: Six years ago, the world came together to sign on to the Paris Agreement. The science says that in order to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach and avert the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to do more, and on a faster timeline. That is why Canada will join over 190 countries in Glasgow for COP26 and why Canada has significantly increased its climate targets and climate actions since the coming into force of the Paris Agreement. The conference runs from October 31 to November 12, 2021, in Glasgow, United Kingdom (UK). Prime Minister Trudeau will lead Canada's delegation for the World Leaders Summit on November 12. Minister Guilbeault of Environment and Climate Change Canada will lead the delegation for the Ministerial segment of COP26 and will be on the ground in Glasgow from November 1 to 12, 2021. COP26 is the highest profile United Nations climate change conference since 2015, when the Paris Agreement was reached. This year, the world must demonstrate and build trust around how it will collectively deliver on the promises outlined in the Paris Agreement. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, who is hosting COP26 , noted at pre-COP that despite the severity of the climate crisis, rapid change is still possible, and that COP26 can and should mark the beginning of the end of climate change. Canada is committed to doing its part to deliver the ambitious climate action that the world wants, and needs. Canada also hopes to build trust, raise global ambition, and advocate for concrete action by all. Canada has taken steps to ensure diverse perspectives are reflected in international forums. Canada's delegation for COP26 will include representatives of federal opposition parties, representatives of provinces and territories, including Ministers of the Environment and Premiers, as well as National Indigenous Organizations and Representatives (NIORs). The delegation will also include youth, civil society, business, labour, and Canadian municipalities. The Canadian delegation will be posted on the UNFCCC's website in the near term. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA292","Sustainability Meets Accountability! COP26 Reflections & Role of Technology Leadership in Climate Change","BBN Times","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 08, 2021( BBN Times: https://www.bbntimes.com https://www.bbntimes.com Sustainability Meets Accountability! COP26 Reflections & Role of Technology Leadership in Climate Change Together we can! As the headline image showcases above, that's my overriding perspective fresh from attending COP26 [1] and the Social Innovation Forum, and in many ways we saw Gen Z lighting the way - some incredible youth leadership on show! And this all supported by expanded awareness of key issues, for example levels ofE-waste[2]anticipated to double by 2050, a renewed global appreciation of the power of the collective, the rise of conscious consumerism, deepened focus on supply chains, reflection on individual, organizational and brand purpose, and all alongside enhanced technological solutions and convergence too . the list of catalyst vectors just goes on! Indeed, embedding sustainability considerations by design is now an imperative to business success and competitive advantage, the very definition and actualization of you 'can do well by doing good'. 'The World Economic Forumreported[3]in January 2021 that business' top five risks are related to the environment. 62% of CXOs said sustainability is essential to remain competitive' So the time is now to reflect onthe howof the COP26 mission 'to put the world on a path to aggressively cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow Earth's warming.' This takes the type of dialogue we experienced in Glasgow and virtually, bringingtogether different areas of society. It involves science and research, government and citizen developers, and leading business and technology players too, including IBM whose CEOArvind Krishna[4]recently accepted the inaugural Terra Carta Seal from HRH The Prince of Wales in recognition of over 50 years of commitment to environmental sustainability. This builds on IBM's early commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 65% by 2025 against base year 2010 and to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Related to this, a snapshot from my recent COP26 /SIF interview with Sanjay Tugnait,Chief Market Maker & Global Managing Partner - Sustainability Practice, IBM Consulting is availablehere[5]. Looking beyond the importance of discussion, it's the momentum that builds and collective actions that last which are clearly imperative, and for me three key interlinked themes emerged - matters of data, its management and storage, social impact measurement, and the power of the co-creation through partnerships and open source. Let's explore each in turn! Open Source - Call For Code In August 2021, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres'described[6]the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group report as 'Code Red for Humanity'. Reflecting on this I have been continually impressed and indeed committed to supporting the Call for Code campaign, of which IBM is a founding partner. This movement is a catalyst for social impact innovation at scale, most recently highlighted by this year's Call for Code winnerSaaf-Water[7]: an open source AI and IoT platform that anyone can use to monitor groundwater safety around their home and in their communities. Wonderful! and an endeavour very close to heart - more on thathere[8]! Data Storage and IT Infrastructure Big data offers unprecedented shared value for business, lifestyle, education and impact benefits including theopportunity[9]to advance scientific progress to help address our most pressing environmental concerns. With the volume, variety, velocity and volatility of data all increasing, achieving that 5th V of data value remains an Industry 4.0 or indeed a Society 4.0 imperative. And this is not just a case of enhancing data integration, or applying the latest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools and techniques, it is equally a case of optimizing data storage and its sustainability impact. The larger the amount of data in question, the more important it becomes to utilize the most energy-efficient means of collecting, storing and analyzingit. Indeed, a tiered storage solution, including tape storage, can reduce CO2 emissions by a staggering 87%. As data multiplies rapidly and many organizations from SME to Enterprise are still very much navigating the rate and scale of change, a truly flexible storage solution which can grow as your business does is ideal - whether on-prem, in the cloud or both. The IBMFlashSystem[10]Family delivers on exactly this, affording the containerization of systems and data for seamless portability and enabling agility as situations evolve. This is coupled with high-performance, high-reliability storage, superior functionality across Hybrid Cloud and equally critically, comes with sustainability advantages embedded right from design. When consumption and waste is kept to a minimum not only does the environment benefit, so does business too! IBMSpectrum Virtualize[11]plays a key role here by allowing upcycling which extends the useful life of existing storage hardware investments, alongside reducing e-waste to create a positive sustainability impact. And as detailed below, there is an array of additional benefits too right across data and cyber resiliency, data security and simplicity, cloud capability and maximum value, and capacity optimization. A case in point is the electronics manufacturerElectrolux[12]which moved its mission-critical analytics tools built on SAP HANA to IBM Power Systems, running on FlashSystem storage hardware, and using IBM Spectrum Virtualize to create easy-to-manage virtual storage environments whilst also helping optimize storage performance. This partnership has enabled the expansion of Electrolux's hardware infrastructure from two years to five years, with a 30% reduction in disaster recovery infrastructure costs, and 75% faster recovery times to protect against downtime - now that's shared value personified! And you can explore more about the IBM-SAP power partnershiphere[13]andhere[14]- a great example of embedded trust and people and technology in alignment so everyone in the ecosystem benefits. Power of Partnership and Matters of Measurement Continuing the theme! I consider the 'power of partnership' to be one of the biggest learning lessons to emerge from the pandemic - together we can make the art of the possible actualisable, and do it at scale too! This very much aligns with the ethos of Sustainable Development Goal 17 'Partnerships to collaborate with industry and technology providers to collectively address UN's social and environmentalgoals[15]'. Harnessing the power of partnerships with like-minded organizations can co-create value across the ecosystem - and indeed these very organizations can be those which may traditionally be viewed competitors. The importance of shared values and shared mission overrides such concerns and we saw examples of this tangible co-creative action emerging from COP26 notably the Alliance for Clean Air which you can dive into in more detail in mylaunch[16]video. The 10 founding partners come from industries as diverse as transport, technology and retail and are all committed to measuring and decreasing their air pollution emissions, creating healthier communities around the world. Brilliant! Alongside this, I would also highlight the Pathfinder formationannouncement[17]which is enabling the first steps to creating a data exchange network, jointly developed by 35 stakeholders from industry including IBM, and the broader decarbonization ecosystem. This is also helping to tackle one of the most critical challenges in scaling social impact -access to primary data that is sufficiently granular, accurate and verified. Data accounting and access factors must be overcome and beyond this consistency and standardization around impact measurement is critical too. Increasingly conscious consumers must be able to make fair comparisons and ultimately informed choices across organizations and their ESG reporting and credentials. Final Thoughts Embedding sustainability by design encapsulates prioritisation, alignment, integration and measurement right across the organizational mission, culture, values, technology and education that underpins this. And focussing in on technology specifically, it is clear that this is a critical conduit to achieving sustainability impact that scales, with key considerations across data and infrastructure flexibility, portability, accessibility, waste and product lifespan. Above all, it is clear that the foundation of positive change is objective goals, trusted data and transparent reportingthat combines commitment with accountability too, with organisations using their 'sphere of influence' to create a contagion of positive change.

Further information Villa Necchi Campiglio To minimise the venue's environmental impact, FAI has launched an energy efficiency programme at Villa Necchi based on smart auditing, a digital service offering ongoing and predictive monitoring and analysis of energy consumption, aimed at ensuring a more efficient use of resources. In addition, the Villa uses non-potable groundwater for garden irrigation, for the ornamental pool and for toilets, as well as a geothermal heat pump for air conditioning in some rooms. Finally, the menu on offer during the events does not include any food with a high environmental impact and catering uses reusable or compostable materials, thus banning completely single-use plastic. Any uneaten food will be donated to the food bank, where permitted by law. Digital invitations, recycled and recyclable materials for the installations, 'Havana Paper' badges and RPET lanyards are all part of the UK House' commitment to sustainability at Villa Necchi. What the UK has done so far: In December 2020, the UK set out its nationally determined contribution, committing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030, the highest level of emission reduction of any major economy to date. Between 1990 and 2019, the UK reduced its total greenhouse gas emissions by 44%, while its economy grew by 78%. Since 2000, the UK has decarbonised its economy faster than any other G20 country. The UK is the world's largest producer of offshore wind energy, and the first country to end direct government support for the overseas fossil fuel energy sector. The UK is doubling its international climate funding to support developing countries, with 11.6 billion allocated over the period 2021-2025. Between 2011/12 and 2019/20, The UK's ICF programmes are estimated to have avoided or reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 31 million tonnes - equivalent to removing 6.7 million cars from the roads for a year. In 2012, 40% of the electricity produced in the UK came from coal. That figure is now less than 2%, and will be brought down to zero by 2025. The UK has announced it will stop selling new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, thus being the fastest G7 country to decarbonise cars and vans. Over the next 5 years, at least 3 billion of international funding will be spent on nature and nature-based solutions. Plans have been announced to put farmers at the forefront of reversing environmental decline and tackling climate change. The low carbon sector and supply chain provide over 460,000 jobs in the UK. The ambition is to reach 2 million green jobs by 2030. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA295","Aviation industry brings net-zero 2050 commitment to COP26","November 10, 2021 Wednesday 7:00 AM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire New technology aircraft and jet fuel made from waste: the global air transport industry has outlined how to meet its new long-term climate goal during Transport Day events at the UN COP26 in Glasgow. This confirms thecommitment of the world's airlines, airports, air traffic management and the makers of aircraft and enginesto net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in support of the Paris Agreement. Aviation is one of the only sectors to have made such a global commitment. Analysis detailed in theWaypoint 2050report outlines credible paths for the air transport sector to reach net-zero carbon. The industry says a mix of new technology including potentially shifting to electricity and hydrogen for some shorter services; improvements in operations and infrastructure; and a transition to sustainable aviation fuel by mid-century would provide a majority of the carbon reductions. Remaining emissions could be captured using carbon removals measures. Speaking at a COP26 event with the UK Government today, Haldane Dodd, Acting Executive Director of the Air Transport Action Group said: ""Aviation has increased its ambition in line with the need for all sectors of the economy to pursue rigorous climate action. Despite having endured the greatest crisis in aviation history, this net-zero 2050 goal shows that our sector has placed climate action as one of its highest priorities."" A complete shift away from fossil fuels for air transport around mid-century would be possible, with sustainable aviation fuels made from waste resources and rotational cover crops gradually transitioning towards fuels generated from low-carbon electricity. Importantly, the shift to sustainable fuels will enable green energy industry opportunities in nearly every country, sustaining up to 14 million jobs worldwide. ""Our analysis shows several scenarios, with new technology options such as electric and hydrogen aircraft for the short-haul fleet, to a complete shift to sustainable aviation fuel for medium- and long-haul operations. We have identified the building blocks needed and the scale of the challenge is substantial, but with supportive government policy and the backing of the energy sector, it can be done."" ""National government policy measures focused on innovation and energy transition are vital. We also urge the member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to support adoption of a long-term climate goal at the 41st ICAO Assembly in 2022, in line with industry commitments.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA296","World Resources Institute: Bright Spots at COP26 Need to Turn Into Action and Even More Ambition in 2022","November 15, 2021 Monday 8:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSOps) -- The World Resources Institute issued the following statement:    The UN climate negotiations ( COP26 ) have concluded. The 151 new national climate commitments submitted ahead of and during COP26 fell short of putting the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 C. But after two weeks of negotiations, delegates reached consensus that countries should further strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets next year, deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts. Following is a statement from Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO, World Resources Institute: ""In a year marked by uncertainty and mistrust, COP26 affirmed the importance of collective global action to address the climate crisis. While we are not yet on track, the progress made over the last year and at the COP26 summit offered bright spots and a strong foundation to build upon. The real test now is whether countries accelerate their efforts and turn commitments into action. ""Negotiators found common ground on key issues, including agreeing to further strengthen 2030 targets in order to keep the 1.5 C goal within reach, step up and accelerate financial support to developing countries, establish a dedicated space to finally address permanent losses and damages from climate impacts, and finalize rules to implement the Paris Agreement. A particular bright spot at COP26 was how effective vulnerable countries, youth and climate campaigners were in demanding greater action and accountability. And for the first time, negotiators explicitly agreed to accelerate action to phase down unabated coal power and phase-out fossil fuel subsidies - an important step forward. ""A number of major emitters have weak 2030 plans and will need to put forward more aggressive targets to drive down emissions this decade. Encouragingly, countries agreed to come back next year to submit stronger 2030 targets and to put forward long term strategies that aim towards a just transition to net zero by around mid-century. If the world is going to beat back the climate crisis, no one can sit on the sidelines. ""It is inexcusable that developed countries failed to meet their commitment to deliver $100 billion annually starting in 2020, even as they provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for fossil fuels. It is significant that the final outcome at COP26 puts developed countries on the hook to report on their progress towards the $100 billion goal. Countries also made headway toward developing a new financial goal that goes beyond 2025. Nations also agreed to at least double funding for adaptation by 2025, implying at least $40 billion, which is very important progress. "" COP26 ""One of the more worrying outcomes from COP26 is the rules for international carbon markets. While negotiators agreed that double-counting the same emission reductions is unacceptable, it is unfortunate that countries agreed to allow the use of old emission credits to meet their new climate commitments. At COP27, it is crucial that negotiators put stringent guidelines in place to ensure these credits represent real reductions and minimize how many end up being used. ""The big announcements outside the formal negotiations were encouraging. Collectively they signal a resolve for the world to deliver the systemic change needed in key sectors to put us on a more sustainable path. Countries, companies and investors announced plans to accelerate the shift away from coal power, to drastically cut methane emissions, to halt and reverse forest loss, and to align private investments to net-zero. The Science Based Targets initiative offered a new standard for companies to verify their net-zero commitments. The value of nature was prominent in Glasgow, including the need to quickly scale up nature-based solutions and landscape restoration, make agriculture more sustainable and protect the ocean. Much more needs to be done to quickly convert these promising initiatives into real world action and ensure they are just and inclusive. ""The train is moving and all countries need to get on board. As attention shifts beyond COP26 , it's critical for everyone to step up their efforts and turn commitments into real action in ways that benefit all people.""

""We welcome President Biden's declaration at COP26 that the United States is back in the global fight against climate change.

Current pledges are still far below what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. ""Back in Washington, the US must back up its global climate commitments with congressional action. Passing the Build Back Better plan offers an historic opportunity to invest in good green jobs and reduce emissions. But achieving emission reductions must go beyond investing in the green energy transition. The time has come to end the chokehold fossil fuels have on our economy by ending subsidies that allow fossil fuel companies to profit even more from climate destruction. Additionally, Congress must also make good on US global climate commitments by scaling up appropriations for international climate finance.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA298","COP26: NUCLEAR PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE","November 16, 2021 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Nuclear Energy Institute: The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) wrapped up last Friday, but headlines continue to highlight nuclear energy as central to tackling the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report in August stating that global warming is happening quicker than previously thought, making COP more important than ever. Decarbonization is critical, and nuclear, which provides more than a quarter of the worlds clean power, is central to the clean energy transition. The bipartisan momentum around nuclears role in combatting climate change was evident at COP. Nuclear energy will play an important role in decarbonizing the energy sector in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, France and China, as well as countries transitioning away from coal like Romania and developing countries such as Ghana. In fact, nuclear and wind provided over 76 percent of Glasgows energy during the conferencea testament to its real-life application in the fight for net zero. Nuclear power provided around 70% of the electricity when wind was down, emphasizing the importance of clean, reliable energy to compliment intermittent renewable energy sources. Throughout the two weeks, many voices chimed in on the benefits of nuclear, such as International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol: ""Nuclear power generation needs to double if we are to reach our energy and climate goals. This years conference in Glasgow solidified that nuclear holds an integral and unmistakable role in the worlds decarbonization goals. U.S. Leadership in Global Initiatives It is in the spirit of cooperation that nations at COP sought to find ways they can work together to reduce emissions globally. Commitments to expand nuclear power both at home and abroad was an important outcome of this years conference. On November 2, the UN launched the 24/7 Carbon Free Energy Compact at COP26 . NEI, along with 39 other companies, policymakers, investors, and organizations have signed on as supporters of the compact, which will advance around-the-clock carbon-free energy as we seek to decarbonize electricity generation globally. As a firm source of carbon-free electricity, nuclear energy will play an important role. NuScale, an American small modular reactor (SMR) developer, and Nuclearelectrica, a Romanian nuclear energy producer, announced an agreement to initiate the deployment of the first SMR in Europe. This historic announcement is a critical step forward in our fight against the global climate crisis. Through this partnership, nuclear energy will continue to play a vital role in our carbon-free future, while positioning the United States as a leader in advanced nuclear technology developments, said Korsnick. In an interview at the conference, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm emphasized the desire to build new nuclear reactors in the United States. We are very bullish on these advanced nuclear reactors, she said. We have, in fact, invested a lot of money in the research and development of those. The U.S. also announced a $25 million pledge in support of expanding access to clean nuclear energythe Nuclear Futures Package. The funding will advance modern nuclear power generation and innovative new designs, as well as establish partnerships with other countries to support progress on nuclear energy goals abroad and the worlds climate targets. NEI at COP President and Chief Executive Officer Maria Korsnick attended the conference in Glasgow. She spoke about the coal to nuclear transition, sharing how siting small modular reactors (SMRs) at retired coal plants could utilize existing infrastructure and talent to accelerate the clean energy transition. The good-paying jobs nuclear supports can revitalize local economies abandoned by a dying fossil fuel industry, she said. And it can improve public health, bringing reliable electricity without the localized air pollution. She participated in other panels focused on climate finance, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects of nuclear energy, and investments in carbon-free technologies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) lead by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi organized several events at COP26 , encouraging conversations about nuclear power and its vast applications. To achieve net zero we need more nuclear power. Thats the scientific consensus from the IPCC and other leading climate experts. Governments are starting to converge around this consensus, but we must act faster, said Grossi. The climate crisis is a global problem that requires a global solution. It is important for the United States to honor its decarbonization commitments at home, while also leading technological advancements abroad. We need an all hands-on deck approach to the carbon-free energy mix to make changeand discussions at COP26 demonstrated that while we still have a long way to go to address the climate crisis, nuclear has proven it will be a crucial part of the solution. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA300","International Rescue Committee: COP26 Final Hours - Don't Forget People Caught Up in Crisis","November 15, 2021 Monday 8:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Rescue Committee issued the following news release on Nov. 13, 2021: With the final hours of negotiations at COP26 underway, the IRC is urging world leaders to prevent catastrophic levels of emissions and to support the poorest countries to adapt to the immediate consequences of climate change, already playing out in places where the IRC works. The draft text from COP26 which was released yesterday lays out important, but insufficient, steps to meet this double challenge. Despite new and updated emissions pledges, the world is on track for 2.4 degrees C average temperature rise, far beyond the goal of remaining below 1.5 degrees C. Climate finance and vital support for adaptation remains a critical sticking point for the ongoing negotiations. It is a terrible symbol of neglect that the original pledge for developing countries of $100 billion in climate finance by 2020 will not be met until the end of 2022. Climate finance for adaptation to least-developed countries currently stands at $15 billion per year, out of the $80 billion in climate finance currently mobilized. This is a fraction of what is needed for people living with the climate crisis now. The IRC welcomes new pledges for climate adaptation made at COP26 , including President Biden's $3 billion in adaptation finance annually until 2024 and the EU's pledge of $100 million to the COP26 adaptation fund, which raised over $350 million in total at COP26 . The UN however estimates that $300 billion will be needed by 2030 for climate adaptation alone. The IRC is warning that the massive financial void will leave vulnerable, specially fragile and conflict-affected countries, with little support. These are places where climate change is already an extreme and everyday reality:  Drought across 80% of Afghanistan is driving acute hunger and food insecurity;  In Ethiopia, already one of the sites of the devastating 2012 famine in the Horn of Africa and an unprecedented locust outbreak last year, 11 million people are already facing crisis levels of food insecurity as conflict rages in the Tigray region.  Last year, we witnessed over 1.4 million people displaced in Northern Central America due to the deadly combination of ongoing conflict and multiple natural disasters. The impact is already being felt as rising temperatures, drought and extreme weather conditions contribute to food shortages and spiralling hunger. Women and girls are suffering the most from climate change. The UK's COP26 Presidency signalled a commitment to women and girls by launching new, dedicated funding to advance gender equality in climate action, however its scale and geographical reach is too limited to meet the global challenge; commitments to support women and girls disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis must not end here. David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said: "" COP26 needs to remember the poorest and most vulnerable in its final hours. This was billed as a critical moment for the international community to come together and make much-needed progress in tackling the climate crisis before it's too late. But for IRC's clients around the world already facing emergency climate conditions, time has already run out. In these critical final hours of negotiations, global leaders must keep the devastating implications for the lives of the most vulnerable people at the forefront of their minds - and ensure they are made part of the final agreement. ""It is crucial that both tests set at this year's conference are met: to prevent the catastrophic breach of 1.5 degrees C rise in temperature, and step up to help the most at-risk communities adapt to the climate change already underway. ""The US-China agreement for further cooperation is significant, a sign that the shared dangers of the climate crisis cannot be ignored. But the impact of the existential threat posed by climate change is spread unevenly - and thus far, vulnerable populations are being all but assured that they will continue to bear the brunt. With climate finance and adaptation funding woefully insufficient, large swathes of the global population will be left defenseless against a problem they did not cause. ""The climate crisis speaks to a gross mismanagement of the global commons and a collective failure by countries to live up to their responsibilities. The great injustice is that these failures will be felt most deeply by people already mired in humanitarian catastrophe, and who contributed the least. The world, especially the world's most vulnerable, cannot afford for these negotiations to fail.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA301","Four Out of Five Major Carmakers Fail To Support COP26 Emissions Pledge","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 28, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com  Four of the world's five largest car manufacturers have not signed a deal to eliminate new car emissions by 2040. The offending quartet - Volkswagen, Toyota, the Renault-Nissan alliance, and Hyundai-Kia - have not showed their support to the pledge which is to be announced at COP26 today, despite months of pressure from the UK. By signing the agreement, the signatories have pledged to end the sale of new cars that produce emissions in 'leading markets' by 2035, and globally by 2040. Hundreds of city and regional authorities have signed the deal which covers a quarter of the world's cars and is backed by manufacturers including Daimler, Ford, General Motors and China's BYD, as well as governments including Canada and Chile. China, the world's largest car market, did not sign, while the US, the second largest, was also absent from the agreement by Tuesday evening. However, individual states including California, New York and Washington backed the deal, as well as cities such as Dallas, Charleston, Atlanta and Seattle. So Paulo in Brazil and Buenos Aires in Argentina have also signed the pledge. LeasePlan, the world's largest car leasing company, has also signed the agreement, while Uber has also joined, committing to make its entire fleet zero emission by 2030. Ola Kallenius, Daimler chair, told the Financial Times: 'Each company has to make their own choice, but all the colleagues I know are all moving forwards at a very fast pace. 'There are very few countries putting as much money, resources or brain power into the transformation than the German auto industry.' Mercedes-Benz has already committed to selling only electric cars by 2035 where feasible, and will only launch battery models after 2025, which means backing the deal will cost it very little. Other automotive supporters such as Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo Cars had also already set out electric plans that fall within the timeline. Nigel Topping, who represents the UK on climate change at the UN, said: 'We are getting to the end of the internal combustion engine, the only question is when.' Juan Pablo Osornio, head of the Greenpeace delegation at COP26 , said: 'For this announcement to have credibility all major auto manufacturing countries need to be part of it, including Germany and the US. 'This week is crunch time, and it's vital leaders send a signal that fossil fuels are on the way out and are no longer a viable investment.' Truck manufacturers at COP26 including Scania and fleet operators including DHL also pledged to make all new vehicles zero-emission by 2040, in a separate deal. However, despite being supported by the UK, Chile, Turkey and New Zealand, the deal has again lacked the backing of the US government. Tanith Allen, Director, Infrastructure & Manufacturing, Sustainable Business commented: ""Sustainability in manufacturing, particularly in the automotive space is no longer a nice to have - by not investing now, organisations are putting their future businesses at risk. One of the big challenges we've seen within some manufacturers is in the shift of where sustainability sits and how it's governed, primarily being the move from a risk and compliance issue to a function which drives growth and is owned by Innovation. COP has never been more visible than at this year's event and sustainability increasingly plays a part in the way many people choose to live, travel and consume. Paired with financial incentives linked to policy (such as ULEZ) and disruptive sustainability focused start-ups challenging what is industry best practice, we're expecting 2022 to be a defining year for many automotive businesses in terms of their legacy in sustainability.""

Bennett sharply criticized COP26 organizers for the access issue, and had threatened to cancel his appearance at the event Tuesday. COP26 President Alok Sharma has repeatedly said that a fully inclusive conference was critical to the success of the climate conference. CNN has reached out to the UK Prime Minister's office for comment. According to an official traveling with Bennett's delegation to Scotland, Israeli officials spent two hours trying to get Elharrar into the COP venue Monday but ""due to it not being fully wheelchair accessible, the efforts were unsuccessful and the Minister could not enter."" Israel's Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who is not part of the delegation, tweeted, ""it is impossible to safeguard our future and address the climate crisis, without first and foremost caring for people, including ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities."" Britain's Ambassador in Tel Aviv, Neil Wigan, was quick to say sorry. ""I am disturbed to hear that [Karine Elharrar] was unable to attend meetings at COP26 . I apologise deeply and sincerely to the Minister. We want a COP Summit that is welcoming and inclusive to everyone,"" he tweeted. The United Nations climate change body later apologized for ""inconveniences associated with accessing the venue of COP26 , both physically and virtually, in an email distributed to COP26 participants on Tuesday. The UN Climate Change secretariat added that "" COP26 is taking place under exceptional and unprecedented logistical circumstances"" and that access to many spaces had to be reduced to comply with Covid-19 protocols in maintaining social distancing. With over 38,000 registered attendees, social distancing at the conference has proven difficult. An ""unprecedented interest"" in this particular COP, and the security arrangements of the World Leaders Summit, has ""added to the many logistical pressures,"" the statement continued to explain. ""In many ways, the first few days of the COP26 have been a learning process, with participants and staff getting used to the pandemic-related logistical measures and circumstances, and we are doing our utmost to continuously learn and adapt.""

In a video message, she said many people hoped the ""time for words has now moved to the time for action"". She urged them to act ""for our children and our children's children"" and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen added she took ""great pride"" in how her ""dear late husband"" Prince Philip promoted environmental issues. The 95-year-old monarch had been scheduled to attend the United Nations conference in Glasgow. But she pre-recorded her address last week at Windsor Castle after being advised to rest following medical checks. The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are both attending the COP26 conference, which is seen as a crucial gathering if temperature increases and climate changes are to be limited.

She referred to his warning at a 1969 academic gathering of the dangers of failing to address pollution. The Queen said: ""It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William. ""I could not be more proud of them."" She mentions how the environment was a subject close to the heart of ""my dear late husband"" Prince Philip and says she ""could not be more proud"" that it was an interest sustained by her son Charles and grandson William. She also seems to make reference to her own mortality: ""None of us will live forever."" But there is also the authoritative voice of someone looking back after almost 70 years as head of state, telling world leaders to take the long view and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen says ""statesmanship"" means serving the future rather than short-term political rewards. She might be on the video screen but she was telling world leaders to focus on the big picture. The Queen said she also drew ""great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages - especially the young - in calling for everyone to play their part"". She said: ""In the coming days, the world has the chance to join in the shared objective of creating a safer, stabler future for our people and for the planet on which we depend. ""None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope.""

She added: ""It is the hope of many that the legacy of this summit - written in history books yet to be printed - will describe you as the leaders who did not pass up the opportunity; and that you answered the call of those future generations. ""That you left this conference as a community of nations with a determination, a desire, and a plan, to address the impact of climate change; and to recognise that the time for words has now moved to the time for action. ""Of course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. ""But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps."" Ahead of COP26 , the Queen was overheard appearing to suggest she was irritated[14] by people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"", when it comes to climate issues. Prince Charles told COP26 earlier that a ""war-like footing"" is needed to tackle the climate Addressing the opening of the conference earlier in the day, the Prince of Wales urged world leaders into action, saying he understood that many countries could not afford to ""go green"". Instead, he said, there needs to be a ""vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector"", which had trillions of dollars at its disposal. ""The scale and scope of the threat we face call for a global, systems-level solution, based on radically transforming our current fossil fuel-based economy to one that is genuinely renewable and sustainable,"" he said.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA305","COP26: THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE OVER GLASGOW STREETS DEMANDING CLIMATE ACTION","November 5, 2021 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations: ""What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!"" echoed throughout central Glasgow on Friday as thousands of protesters took the streets during the dedicated ""Youth Day"" at COP26 . From small children waving their handmade picket signs, to older adults demanding a better future for those that will come after them, the COP26 host city saw citizen activists in unprecedented numbers rallying to get their message heard. An even larger march is expected on Saturday. Young climate activists take part in demonstrations at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Welsh citizen Jane Mansfield carried around a sign that read: ""Code red for humanity"", the signature phrase UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres used after the latest IPCC report published earlier this year warned of a looming climate catastrophe. ""I really care about the world that we are passing on to future generations, and what we are doing to the Global South. I live in southwest Wales and climate change is clearly happening, but we dont even grasp what is happening in so many other parts of the world and I am scared,"" she told UN News. Latin-American Indigenous leaders were also among today's demonstrations. They were the ones leading the march and several of them sent a loud message to world leaders: stop extracting resources and to 'leave carbon in the ground'. ""Indigenous people are dying in the river; they're being washed away by massive floods. Houses are being washed away, schools full of children inside, bridges, our food our crops, everything is being washed away"", they said at a stage in George Square. ""Act now so that we still have a future to live in."" While the World Leaders Summit took place in the Blue Zone this week, we asked visitors to our Green Zone what their message was for global leaders across the river. The youth have spoken. We must act now.# COP26 pic.twitter.com/j2HnhsKwdS COP26 (@ COP26 ) November 5, 2021 Meanwhile, some activists wore bobblehead masks of presidents and prime ministers and depicted them as being arrested with signs that read ""climate criminals"". More real action, less 'greenwashing' Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was the last to appear on the protest's stage, where she criticized world leaders for their continued ""blah, blah, blah"" after 26 years of climate conferences and put in doubt the transparency of the commitments they have made during this COP. ""The leaders are not doing nothing; they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves, and to continue profiting from this destructive system. This is an active choice by the leaders to continue the exploitation of nature and people and the destruction of presents and future living conditions to take place"", she said, calling the conference a ""greenwashing event"". Other Fridays for Future members, speaking to UN News, asked for more participation and better youth representation in the negotiations that are underway at COP26 . ""Every year we have been disappointed by COP, and I don't think this year will be different. There is a sliver of hope but at the same time we don't see enough action, we can't achieve anything with just pledges and empty promises"", said a representative of Youth Advocates for Climate Change in the Philippines ""Negotiations are happening and yet we are here in the street, because we haven't been included. The richest people come in their private jets and take the decisions. We are here and we won't be ignored. We will make our own space"", another climate advocate added. The Youth Statement The same call was made inside the conference's Blue Zone, where climate activists from YOUNGO, the Children and Youth Constituency of UN Climate Change, delivered to the COP Presidency and other leaders a statement signed by 40,000 young people demanding change. The statement raised several points of concern, among them inclusion in climate negotiations. It also asked Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to support young people's efforts to have a paragraph mentioning the importance of the youth included in the final declaration that is expected to be adopted at the end of COP26 . The statement, which was handed over to Ministers, also asks for action on climate finance, mobility and transportation, wildlife protection and environmental conservation. ""Wherever I have been in the world, I have been struck by the passion and the commitment of young people to climate action. The voices of young people must be heard and reflected in these negotiations here at COP. The actions and scrutiny of young people are key to us keeping 1.5 alive and creating a net-zero future"", said Alok Sharma, COP26 President. Meanwhile, the UK and Italy, in partnership with UNESCO, Youth4Climate and Mock COP coordinated new global action to equip future generations with the knowledge and skills to create a net-zero world. As Education Ministers and young people gathered, over 23 countries put forward national climate education pledges, ranging from decarbonizing the education sector to developing school resources. UN News/Laura Quiones Activist dressed as dinosaur character takes part in demonstrations at the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The youth are right: the new commitments aren't enough The UNFCCC published its latest updates of the national commitments thus far to reduce carbon emissions, and although some advances have been made during the conference, they are still not enough. ""A sizable increase, of about 13.7 per cent, in global greenhouse emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 is anticipated"", the report says. Before COP, the increase was calculated at 16 per cent, but for the world to be able to curb global heating and avoid disastrous consequences, emissions must be cut by 50 per cent in the next nine years. For Carla Huanca, a young activist who travelled all the way from Bolivia to be in Glasgow with her friend, the dinosaur ""T-Resilient"", another extinction can't be a possibility. ""We young people will be the ones that will inherit this planet, and that is why it is so important that our voices are heard. We demand government actions so we can all have the planet we want,"" she told UN News. \"

She will be travelling alongside the performers and acting as the voice for their silence action. She said: ""The Red Rebels are silent performers, but I have become involved in coordinating and speaking for this action because it really is 'Code Red' for climate now. In my teaching I share with students examples of £rtivism' - how performance can enable a deeper emotional response to an issue and shift people's or policymakers' thinking. ""The Red Rebels express the grief, fear, sense of urgency and fragile hope that many people feel around climate, and the need for climate justice.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA308","OUTCOME OF THE UN COP26 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","November 22, 2021 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Government of Sweden: The UN COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow has ended. The main successes of the conference were that countries were encouraged to sharpen their climate goals as early as next year, double support for adaptation to climate change by 2025 and that the role of fossil fuels in climate transition was mentioned for the first time. Both before and during the conference, much revolved around the need for increased ambitions in global climate work and the gap between the countries current commitments and the Paris Agreements 1.5 degrees Celsius target. The commitments made by the countries are decided at national level and are therefore not subject to negotiation. However, the overarching decision of the meeting contains wording on the phasing out of subsidies for coal and fossil fuels, more ambitious commitments on the 1.5 degrees Celsius target, the importance of a just transition, human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples. The parties are now also encouraged to ensure meaningful and inclusive participation of young people. Limiting heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require a lot of us, but the decision we have taken in Glasgow lays the foundations for making it possible. Over these past two weeks, the countries of the world have shown that they can agree on even the most difficult climate decisions and take major steps forward. This will not be enough, but it will speed up the pace of climate efforts and give us much greater opportunities to counter the climate crisis, says Minister for Environment and Climate Per Bolund. During COP26 Climate finance One of the conferences major negotiation issues has concerned climate finance, i.e support for emission reductions and climate change adaptation in developing countries, and the commitment to mobilise USD 100 billion per year from 2020 to 2025. This is important to enable climate transition in developing countries and enable them to raise the level of ambition in their climate action. The UK Presidency gave Per Bolund, together with his Egyptian colleague Dr Yasmine Fouad, the task of leading the negotiations on climate finance. Together, they proposed, among other things, doubling the support for climate adaptation by 2025, which was requested by those most affected by climate change, and was also part of the final decision. Climate change is already doing enormous damage in many places and is making life more difficult for millions of people. The message were sending from the conference is clear: support for climate adaptation will double by 2025. This will make a big difference to all those people who would otherwise have been hit hardest by the climate crisis, says Minister for Environment and Climate Per Bolund. The conference also decided how the process for a new joint financing goal should be designed. A decision on such a goal is expected in 2024. International cooperation and emissions trading A sticking point has been the rules for how countries are to report their emissions. For Sweden and several other countries it has been important that all countries report their emissions in an equivalent way and that certain countries not be exempt from certain reporting requirements. The rules now agreed require all countries to report in such a way that their emission figures can be transparently reviewed. Common timeframes At COP26 Loss and damage The conference has also agreed on functions for the Santiago network and a process for deciding on the structure and financing of COP27. The aim is to strengthen technical assistance to the most vulnerable developing countries in order to identify and access solutions to counter loss and damage from climate change. The conference also agreed on a dialogue to discuss financing arrangements to counter, prevent and address damage and losses from climate change. Initiatives In connection with COP26 , a high-level meeting was also held in the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, which was launched by Sweden and India in 2019 to drive the climate transition in heavy industry. The meeting gathered ministers and business leaders who agreed to develop road maps to achieve net-zero emissions in heavy industry. During COP26 \"

Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow: ""The Paris Agreement is working. It was never expected to solve the climate emergency in one go - but to do so over time. In 2014, before the Agreement was adopted, the world was heading toward close to 4 degrees Celsius of global heating. Coming out of COP26 , new commitments made mean that we are heading toward closer to around 2 degrees. Glasgow was an important step in keeping open the possibility of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. ""Whether COP26 COP26 has provided the political signal, building blocks, and the solutions to do just that. ""The successful finalization of the guidelines to fully implement the Paris Agreement - including in relation to transparency and carbon markets - is a welcome achievement and lays a solid foundation to further raise climate ambition over time."" Statement of Nathaniel Keohane, President, Center for Climate and Energy Solutions On the U.S. role at COP26 : ""The United States came to this conference needing to demonstrate renewed global leadership on climate. The importance of that role was on display in Glasgow, where American leadership helped secure a range of commitments including the Global Methane Pledge among more than 100 countries to cut emissions of methane by 30 percent by 2030, and where Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry's dogged diplomacy paid off in the US-China announcement as well as a strong 2030 target from India. ""But the most important test of U.S. leadership will be in Washington, DC. For America to regain the trust of the world on climate, and persuade others to follow its lead, President Biden and Congress must build on the important, but initial, down payment in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and show that we are serious about delivering on our commitments. That means passing the Build Back Better framework, with its $555 billion investment in climate, clean energy, and resilience - an investment that will create good jobs throughout the country, supercharge America's competitiveness in the global clean energy economy, and demonstrate that the leadership we saw in Glasgow is backed up by action at home."" On Article 6 ""Importantly, negotiators also reached agreement on the so-called 'Paris rulebook,' including guidance on Article 6. In the Paris Agreement, Article 6 is the engine of international cooperation. It is what enables countries to work together to achieve faster, deeper cuts in emissions than they could on their own, while channeling finance to promote truly sustainable green growth in developing countries. But markets are only a force for good when there are guardrails in place to ensure environmental and social integrity. ""While the agreed Article 6 guidance is not perfect, it is strong on the critical issue of avoiding double-counting, and it gives countries the clarity and direction they need to begin working together to raise ambition. To ensure environmental integrity, countries should refuse to use pre-2020 credits from the Clean Development Mechanism to meet their NDCs - instead focusing on new emissions reductions. Civil society will be watching."" [Category: Energy] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7665966 MSTRUCK \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA311","COP26 REVIEW: GLASS HALF FULL?","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change: Tim Lord Phil McNally Introduction After two years of waiting and two weeks of intense negotiations, COP26 has finally drawn to a close and Glaswegians have their city back. But how did the conference perform? Is 1.5 still alive? And do we now have reason to be optimistic on climate change? COP26 cannot, and should not, be measured in absolutes. Some may have hoped for a sudden leap in ambition to set the world on track for the goals of the Paris Agreement. But considering the whole economy reorientation required for net zero and the relatively limited negotiating mandates of the delegates involved in a COP, it was perhaps wishful thinking to expect transformation rather than incremental improvement. In truth, Glasgow was far from being a failure on the scale of Copenhagen but neither was it a transformational success comparable to Paris. Progress was made perhaps more than might have been expected but not enough to satisfy the science on climate change. So how do the agreements of the past fortnight measure up? And where do we go next on climate change? A success with limitations, or a failure with some bright points? Success or Failure? In our July paper, we set out four ways the UK, and the world, could ensure that COP26 was viewed as a success. So, it's worth taking a moment to judge performance against those metrics. First, we called for raised ambition backed by credible delivery plans. On this point, it makes sense to take the long-term view. At the time of Paris, the world was on track for 4 degrees of warming. At the time of the last COP, in Madrid in 2019, only 16 per cent of global GDP was covered by a national net-zero target. As COP26 drew to a close, warming of under 2 degrees is potentially in reach, and almost 90 per cent of global emissions are now covered by a net-zero target. This is real progress and was supported in Glasgow by increased long-term ambition in particular, by India coming forward with a net-zero target for 2070. But while the long-term targets are cause for qualified optimism, there was less progress on the crucial issue of cutting emissions in the short term. Net-zero targets provide important long-term direction but the cumulative nature of climate change means that the rate at which we get there, and in particular the actions we take in the next ten years, are crucial. As Figure 1 below shows, the pathway to 1.5C would have been far more manageable if the world had taken sustained action at an earlier point. But the steep increase in annual emissions since 1990 means that the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C has been depleted and the pathway is now much steeper. It's for this reason that a focus on near-term emission reductions is more important than long-term goals, and that is why nations' 2030 ambitions and plans also known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are so core to the COP framework. Figure 1: Source: HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reach https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reach To stay on track for the objective of keeping warming under 1.5C, we need to cut global annual emissions by roughly 45 per cent by 2030. If we add up all the emission savings from updates to NDCs as well as the sector deals agreed in Glasgow, that delivers a reduction in 2030 emissions of around 5.5 to 6.9 GtCO2e, or 11 to 14 per cent below current levels. This doesn't look good for the UK's primary objective for COP26 to ""keep 1.5 alive"". Figure 2: Source: HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1002/CAT_2021-11-11_Briefing_GlasgowSectorInitiatives.pdf https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1002/CAT_2021-11-11_Briefing_GlasgowSectorInitiatives.pdf Given the lack of willingness from key countries to strengthen their 2030 targets, it is important that the final text of the Glasgow Climate Pact offers a lifeline by requesting countries to come back with stronger NDCs aligned with 1.5C by 2022, creating another opportunity to get closer to the green bar in Figure 2 and enabling the UK to argue that 1.5 is alive, albeit with a faint and weakening pulse. But an admission that short-term commitments are not adequate is an admission that we have not yet made the progress we need a huge problem when time is running out. Second, we called for a pathway for low- and middle-income countries that enables decarbonisation, resilience, energy access and economic growth. With the impacts of climate change growing more acute by the year, the issues of adaptation, loss and damage received more attention in Glasgow than any previous COP. But it's on this area where COP26 performed particularly poorly. There were glimmers of light in particular, that developed countries finally agreed to meet their longstanding commitment to provide $100 billion a year of climate finance to low-income countries. But overall the scale of finance offered, and in particular the lack of movement on finance for adaptation and loss and damage,1 There were small gestures from wealthy nations, such as the 290 million from the UK and the 2 million from Scotland on loss and damages. But when measured against the $300 billion that the UN says is required annually by 2030 for developing nations to adapt to climate change, the contribution from developed nations falls a long way short. meant that the lack of trust between high- and low-income countries was exacerbated rather than addressed. The inclusion in the Glasgow Climate Pact of a new dialogue on loss and damage meaning the issue should be progressed at COP27 offers hope of progress in the future. But none of this is enough to stop the developing nations most exposed to climate impacts from leaving Glasgow feeling that their voices had not been heard. Our third objective for COP26 was for climate change to be positioned in mainstream politics and public consciousness, and we have seen some positive signs in Glasgow to that effect. The summit has been a mainstay in the national headlines over the past fortnight, and leaders across the world including those not present in Glasgow have made strong statements on both the need to address climate change with urgency and the economic opportunity that the transition to net zero presents. But while the need for climate action is increasingly embedded in mainstream politics both here in the UK and globally there is a real question whether the framing of action as ""business as usual plus"" will be sufficient to engage voters in the significant technological and behavioural changes that net zero will require. The test of that will be in the coming months and years, and it will be important for future COPs to give more consideration to the demand side rather than focusing the vast majority of time and effort on supply. For example, efforts to reduce oil production will founder without more concerted global efforts to phase out petrol and diesel engines and similar challenges exist in other sectors. Our final recommendation for Glasgow was to focus on unleashing the power of the private sector and the state. There was criticism that the business presence at COP26 was too strong, with some fearing that vested interests may have been influencing the negotiations. But this interpretation misses a key point. It is unquestionably true that parts of the private sector have both helped create the problem of anthropogenic climate change and have slowed the adoption of solutions. But the simple fact is that meeting the scale and urgency of the change required will only be possible by deploying the skills and capital of the private sector. Given that context, the fact that Glasgow saw a stronger business presence than any previous COP is a positive signal that climate policy has shifted from the preserve of environmental NGOs, climate diplomats and energy specialists and into mainstream economic consciousness. And the focus is now on governments designing the right policy frameworks and market incentives to unlock that newfound private sector willingness to act and drive technological innovation. In conclusion: debates on whether the glass if half full or half empty whether the summit was a success with limitations, or a failure with some bright points offer more heat than light. The summit offered significant progress, but not yet enough to turn the tide on climate action. What next? What next? The key question is not ""was the summit a success?"" It is: ""what happens next?"" On that question, there are two things to look out for. The first is whether the increased momentum on climate change translates into meaningful and deliverable plans to accelerate climate action. Part of that is about targets in particular, whether big emitters such as China and Australia, who opposed increased ambition in the short term, succumb to international pressure and embrace an accelerated trajectory to net zero. But even more importantly it is about delivery as minimising the level of temperature increase is dependent on countries taking substantive action across their economies to deliver on their pledges. To that end, it will also be important for the COP process to influence domestic politics both highlighting the progress being made and increasing the domestic political salience of action in countries that are slow to act. For example given Australia's unwillingness to take action, it will be interesting to see whether the international pressure created through the COP process contributes to increased domestic pressure for rapid action. The second is what the right international process for driving action on climate change should be is the COP framework sufficient, or is something else needed? Because just as addressing climate change requires technological innovation, we need also to consider whether new diplomatic or institutional innovations are needed to accelerate progress. The COP process has had real successes: the annual cycle ensures pressure can be brought to bear on those that are underperforming, and broad representation means that every nation has a voice (though, as the endgame made crystal clear, some count for more than others). But the nature of seeking agreement among almost 200 parties, all with individual interests, means that laggards can dominate the terms of the debate, and ambition often defaults to the lowest common denominator. COP26 saw important process innovations: the sectoral deals on methane, coal and forests, which enabled more ambitious countries to push forward together; the bilateral statement from the US and China; and the deal to provide funding to reduce South African dependence on coal. All three took place outside the formal COP process but provide a template both for enabling high-ambition countries to forge ahead (and expose the laggards in doing so), and for targeting action in specific sectors in a coordinated way. And the summit also saw some indication of willingness to address the issue of making climate laggards face the consequences of their decisions. The past 12 months have, for example, seen a gearshift in the tempo and seriousness of discussions on the need for measures such as carbon border taxes. This is important: one reason why the COP process has not changed the position of the laggards is they face little penalty for their refusal to act. The future of climate action may involve requiring them to face the cost of those decisions and high-ambition countries working together to ensure those costs are properly reflected could provide a vital tool to accelerate action. The 2020s are regularly referred to as the decade of delivery, but we are now two years into that decade and global emissions have not started to plummet downwards in the way that avoiding catastrophic climate change demands. To have any chance of keeping 1.5 alive, or of hitting even 2C, the focus must now shift to progressive leadership and delivery.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA312","Q&A on COP26: Carlson School's Susanna Gibbons Reflects","November 19, 2021 Friday 9:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSOps) -- The University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management issued the following Q&A with Susanna Gibbons, managing director of the Carlson Funds Enterprise on Nov. 17, 2021: This month world leaders met at the United Nations climate conference, COP26 , to negotiate a deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impacts of global warming. Susanna Gibbons, the managing director of the Carlson Funds Enterprise, was among the University of Minnesota delegation that attended the historic conference in Scotland. She shares her insight from the conference and her views as an investment professional on how policymakers and financial leaders can unite to meet the climate targets. Q: At the conference, the term ""sustainable finance"" or ""green finance"" was often used. What does it mean? One of the issues that I encountered at COP26 is that policymakers and investment professionals are using the term ""sustainable finance"" to mean two different things. For policymakers, it is really just a question of funding: How do we get funding for the many different initiatives which will drive the necessary emission reductions? For investment professionals, the question involves expectations of risk and return surrounding those needed investments. I think that has been one of the key holdups in driving investment. My own view is that sustainable finance is about pricing the negative externalities that accompany any sort of environmental impact, whether it is around carbon emissions, water pollution, or species loss. A negative externality occurs when an entity engages in an activity that causes some harm to others. Negative externalities are really difficult to price because the effects are usually broadly distributed, and they accumulate over time. Q: In terms of carbon emissions, leaders at COP26 finalized ""Article 6,"" which determined the rules for international trade of emission reduction units. How does this resonate with your view of sustainable finance? The agreements appear to move in the direction of pricing those negative externalities. The accounting guidance in particular--allowing an emission reduction project in the U.S. to generate credits that can be purchased by a company operating in Europe--will help provide incentive to a number of important projects. However, the carbon trading agreements alone won't solve everything. Businesses need to make decisions not just on whether they are required to price external consequences today, but on how those impacts may be felt across time. We have seen time and again--whether it is with asbestos or tobacco--businesses that do not anticipate shifts in society's willingness to accept the consequences will ultimately lose. If prices do not accurately capture some of the significant effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change, then the markets will ultimately fail. Carbon markets are moving in the right direction, but most participants do not feel they fully capture the true cost of greenhouse gas emissions. Successful markets need to be guided by good public policy, and climate change is one of those areas where unpriced externalities are leading to global systematic failure. In order for markets to channel sustainable finance, we must price those costs appropriately. Q: How can Minnesota businesses incorporate more ways to combat climate change? I think Minnesota is incredibly well positioned to start developing solutions to climate change, but it will require a significant amount of collaboration--particularly among people who do not always agree. For example, Minnesota's agricultural industry is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Simply imposing mandates is not the solution. Instead, it could involve providing regulatory frameworks like the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which creates an economic incentive for capturing the methane lost through waste products. This in turn allows for cost-sharing so that the farming community doesn't shoulder the financial burden of the transition to a lower carbon system. The systemic shift would also require investing in biogas distribution systems and continued public funding in electric vehicle charging stations. The key is to get these separate systems--private agriculture, private finance, municipal waste and sewage, municipal finance, electric and gas utilities--to all move together toward a zero carbon future. The solutions require a degree of coordination and cooperation across systems which I think has rarely been attempted, but which I think Minnesotans are stoic enough to undertake. Q: What did you learn at the conference that gives you hope? Climate change messaging should really be about one of excitement over where we could be heading rather than despair over where we currently are heading. One of the things that impressed me the most at COP26 was the extent of technological innovation that is already available and poised to deliver on our promise of limiting global warming to a threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Business plays a critical role in bringing these technologies to market--there is no solution to climate change that does not involve the business community. I also see hope from our world's youth. Young people--not just in our delegation--were clearly frustrated with the slow pace of progress to date, but I think they are forcing the world to take notice and respond; to try and deliver a better world than the one they were born into. Q: Ultimately, what should people take away from the actions made at COP26 ? The clear message from COP26 was that it is time to act. There was no disagreement on that point. We have no more time to waste. In order for our actions to be effective, we need to collaborate in ways that we have not in the past. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7671136 MSTRUCK \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA313","EPRI CEO: COP26 Agreement 'Solidifies Global March Towards Decarbonization'","November 14, 2021 Sunday 9:28 AM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire On Saturday, world leaders from nearly 200 countries came to an agreement at COP26 , increasing national ambitions to reduce near-term emissions, reiterating the long-term aim of 1.5C warming that entails net-zero targets around mid-century, and increasing the climate change focus on adaption and resilience. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) CEO Arshad Mansoor, who was in attendance at COP26 , had the following statement: ""This agreement solidifies the global march towards decarbonization. It will take collaboration in technology and institutional innovation by countries around the world to reach both the near- and long-term goals. Cleaner electricity,accelerated electrificationand the deployment of cleaner energy resources and fuels will play a critical role in all countries. ""In particular, numerous sectors of the economy including transportation, buildings, and industry stand to achieve large carbon emissions reductions through increased energy efficiency, broader electrification, and the deployment of zero andlow carbon fuels. Through collaborative research and development with public and private stakeholders, we are developing a broad suite of clean electric generation, storage, grid, and end-use technologies that will help countries decarbonize their electric sectors and reduce emissions across their economies. This will enable countries to choose what works best to meet those needs, while keeping electricity accessible, affordable, and reliable for all consumers."" For the United States, an EPRI analysis issued earlier this week finds that carbon reductions across all sectors of the U.S. economy through cleaner energy, increased energy efficiency, and accelerated electrification will be crucial to achieving the 2030 U.S. climate goal. Accelerated electrification will help to lower emissions from transportation, buildings, and industry, while reducing overall energy costs for many consumers. A copy of EPRI's analysis is availablehere. In the longer-term, meeting national and global net-zero goals entails developing an array of technology options that are not commercial at scale today, including carbon capture utilization and storage, advanced nuclear, low-carbon fuels, and advanced electric end-uses. EPRI is working with its research partners on these technologies, engaging in a number of collaborative global clean energy initiatives, including itsLow-Carbon Resources InitiativesandEfficient Electrification Initiative.\~ Additionally, EPRI continues its work on resilience, adaption, and equity issues, which spans the organization's entire research portfolio. About EPRIFounded in 1972, EPRI is the world's preeminent independent, non-profit energy research and development organization, with offices around the world. EPRI's trusted experts collaborate with more than 450 companies in 45 countries, driving innovation to ensure the public has clean, safe, reliable, affordable, and equitable access to electricity across the globe.

To have a chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C, emissions of greenhouse gases must halve by 2030 and reach 'net zero' by 2050. Every additional increment of warming escalates the risks to people, ecosystems and communities. National emission reduction targets submitted in 2015 were not ambitious enough to keep the rise in the global average temperature to 'well below' 2C, let alone 1.5C. And across the world, countries are grappling with increasingly severe and more frequent climate change impacts. COP26 needs to be a turning point. For a positive outcome in Glasgow substantial progress is needed in three main areas: in raising the ambition of countries' 2030 nationally determined contributions (NDCs); on providing support for climate-vulnerable developing countries; and on agreeing the remaining details of the 'Paris Rulebook'. \"

On the closing day, the CoR published a COP26 political declaration endorsed by several partners. The COP26 conclusions are gathered in the Glasgow Climate Pact. Following the end of Glasgow climate talks, the LGMA constituency, gathering subnational governments in the UNFCCC system, published that 'Multilevel action is the beacon of hope to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive'. Already in July 2017, the CoR published that 'Cities and regions can bridge the emissions gap'. On COP26 COP26 political declaration endorsed by several partners. Day 7. Saturday 6 November was the Nature and Land Use Day at COP26 . A key outcome was the pledge by 45 governments calling for urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming. You can read here the press release from the COP26 UK Presidency. Day 8. Sunday 7 November. The Under2 Coalition General Assembly took place with the participation of several CoR members including Andries Gryffroy (BE/EA), Member of the Flemish Parliament, Marieke Schouten (NL/Greens), Alderman of the municipality of Nieuwegein and Juanma Moreno (ES/EPP), President of Andalucia and member of the CoR extended delegation to COP26 . The Under2 Coalition is a global community of state and regional governments committed to ambitious climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. It brings together 260 governments representing 1.75 billion people and 50% of the global economy. Day 9. Monday 8 November. The Local Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) Constituency, gathering networks of subnational governments in the UNFCCC system, organised daily briefings on the negotiations via ICLEI- Local Governments for Sustainability as its focal point, assessing progress in relation to the specific objectives of subnational governments in global climate talks such as securing direct references to multilevel cooperation in the COP26 conclusions. The CoR members Vincent Chauvet (FR/Renew Europe), Mayor of Autun, (FR/RE), and Kata Tutto (HU/PES), deputy-mayor of Budapest joined the above-mentioned members in Glasgow. CoR members had the occasion to participate in events organized by CoR partners in the Multilevel Action Pavilion including 'The leading role of regions in raising ambitions for adaptation and resilience', coordinated by Regions 4, a global network of regional governments in the fields of sustainable development, climate change and biodiversity. Members also took part in the event 'Time4Multilevel action: 2030 agenda of cities and regions to enhance ambition and accelerate action' organized by several CoR partners including ICLEI, Regions4, UGCL, BC3, CEMR. Monday negotiations focused on Article 6.8 on Non-Market Approaches with some of the LGMAs' proposals taken on board such as the reference to 'sustainable, integrated and territorial development'. An important outcome for subnational governments was the global leaders' commitment to a shift towards locally-led adaptation. The COP26 President Alok Sharma announced that 88 countries are now covered by Adaptation Communications or National Adaptation Plans to increase preparedness to climate risks, with 38 published in the last year. Global leaders committed to a shift towards locally-led adaptation through over 70 endorsements to the Principles for Locally Led Adaptation and over $450m mobilised for initiatives and programmes enhancing locally-led approaches. Day 10. Tuesday 9 November. The members of the CoR delegation participated in the European Commission (EC) briefing together with the delegation of the European Parliament at COP26 . The briefing on the state of play of the negotiations was chaired by the EC's VP Frans Timmermans in the EU coordination room.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA316","Former President of Ireland Speaks At Boston College During Hosting Earth Conference","April 25, 2022 Monday","The Heights: Boston College","Former President of Ireland Mary Robinson said the climate crisis is in need of a feminist solution during the Hosting Earth Conference at Boston College on Saturday. ""Climate change is a man-made problem and requires a feminist solution,"" Robinson said. ""It is the way in which we have to address the issues. It's problem solving and listening to all voices."" Robinson, who also served as the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Change from 2014 to 2015, delivered the keynote speech on the climate crisis and ecological hospitality during the conference, which also included panel discussions and art performances. When discussing how to address the climate crisis, Robinson said it is important to integrate the stories and perspectives of those who are most affected. ""I came to understand that we weren't able to grasp the climate story because of the way we were learning,"" Robinson said. ""We have to move to storytelling."" Robinson said climate change causes major injustices, especially in the developing world, which is already suffering from generations of poverty and other social issues. ""I learned that [climate change] was impacting African countries far more,"" Robinson said. ""Then I learned that small island states, Indigenous peoples, and the poorest parts of richer countries were also suffering, and they were the least responsible for [the climate crisis]."" As the first female president of Ireland, Robinson, elected in 1990, spoke extensively about gender inequality around the world and how the climate crisis is advancing this inequality. ""Eighty percent of the food in the developing world is produced by women, yet they own much less of the land and get much less access to credit,"" Robinson said. Robinson said her role in the male-dominated world of politics inspired her passion for bringing women leaders together to address the climate crisis. Robinson also said her experience as the U.N. Special Envoy for Climate Change helped her recognize the full extent of the climate crisis and its effects. ""[The scientists] made it clear that in that time, bad things will probably happen,"" Robinson said. ""First of all, the coral reefs will probably disappear entirely. Secondly, the Arctic ice will disappear and the permafrost will melt. Permafrost is very substantial."" Even with these dire predictions, Robinson said there were significant achievements at COP26 -the U.N.'s annual climate change conference where participants pledged to reduce their contributions to global warming. ""The interesting thing-which is positive about COP26 despite the fact that the [countries'] pledges are not enough and we're not on target yet-is that everybody was talking the language of aligning with the 1.5 degrees celsius and that's really important,"" Robinson said. According to Robinson, there is an international goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Even a slightly higher temperature, Robinson said, could have serious consequences. ""The most significant step that was taken [to limit global warming] was done because of pressure from climate justice,"" Robinson said. ""Pressure from the small island states, Indigenous people, and young people, who marched in the street in Paris. The mantra was '1.5 to stay alive.'"" Robinson concluded her talk by encouraging people to change how they think about the climate crisis. ""Imagine the world we need to be hurrying towards,"" Robinson said. ""We have to get a real feeling of wanting to get there."" Related feminist climate crisis Hosting Earth Conference Load-Date: \~April 25, 2022 \"

The watchdog Climate Action Tracker (CAT) HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/press/Glasgows-one-degree-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/ warned on Tuesday that global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be roughly twice as high as what's necessary to limit warming to 1.5 degrees - a threshold HYPERLINK https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/global-climate-change-report-un-ipcc/index.html scientists have said the planet should stay under to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. The net-zero goals of 40 countries account for 85% of global emissions cuts, but the group found only 6% of those emissions were backed up by concrete plans. ""It's all very well for leaders to claim they have a net zero target, but if they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action,"" said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, in a statement. ""Glasgow has a serious credibility gap."" ""We know that the window to keep 1.5 degrees alive is closing but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that it is still achievable,"" a COP26 spokesperson said in a statement. ""As today's reports make clear, we've seen genuine progress in the first week of COP26 , but we have a lot more to do. We need to be serious about both ambition and action this decade and that is why as COP26 Presidency, we are pushing hard through negotiations this week to build on progress to keep 1.5 degrees in reach."" Delegates from around the world are gathering at COP26 to attempt to limit the climate crisis. While there were several breakthroughs in the first week of negotiations, experts warned the deals may not meet the urgency of the moment -- specifically, that they won't bring the world closer to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. ""There's a lot of big statements, which don't have the details underneath: exactly when, how much, who's going to do what,"" said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics with the World Resources Institute. More than 130 countries that represent more than 85% of the planet's forests HYPERLINK http://www.cnn.com/2021/11/01/world/cop26-climate-deforestation-deal-intl/index.html pledged last week to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030, in what was seen as the first big deal of the COP26 summit. When destroyed, forests can emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The agreement included some of the world largest carbon stocks locked away in tropical forests. In another breakthrough, more than 25 countries have so far signed on to an agreement to HYPERLINK http://www.cnn.com/2021/11/03/world/countries-agree-to-end-fossil-fuel-financing-abroad-cop26-climate/index.html stop financing fossil fuel projects abroad . But critics say it doesn't go far enough and should include financing for fossil fuel projects at home, not just internationally. Christine Shearer, the program director for coal at Global Energy Monitor, called the deal ""a game changer,"" but stressed that fossil fuel projects must be stopped within these countries' own borders, too. Under current policies -- not proposals, but rather what countries are actually doing -- CAT projects global temperatures to climb to 2.7 degrees. If all net-zero pledges are fully implemented, CAT reported the most optimistic scenario would be warming of 1.8 degrees, which would require bold and rapid action by 2030. Still, countries' climate targets for 2030 remain inadequate, according to the analysis. CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report. TM & \£9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Children have said they are angry, but not surprised at a decision to water down a call for ""an accelerated phase-out of coal power and subsidies for fossil fuels"" from the COP26 draft agreement. A second, softer draft published this morning called for parties to ""[accelerate] the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels."" Nomundari, a sixteen -year-old climate activist from Mongolia, said: ""Me and my friends expected to be let down by the adults at COP.

During a side-session at COP26 on 11 November, Nomundari explained how she and other children in parts of Mongolia struggle to breath due to poor air quality and, while her government was taking action to improve things, much more needed to be done on fossil fuels globally. ""I'm angry because how long do we have to keep repeating this and how long will they keep ignoring us? I have asthma because of it and I can't even do sport and play with my friends because of it.

They shared their thoughts and stories about what damage climate change was already causing in their communities and the terrible cost children and their families were paying because of it. Even before this morning's change, youth advocates from Sierra Leone Tenema and Tejan had already questioned whether leaders were doing enough to address the climate crisis: ""We want happy and healthy futures, but that isn't going to be possible unless leaders address climate change at COP. In the face of extreme heat, drought, and natural disasters, what are politicians doing to ensure we get the futures we deserve?"" Ruth, a youth advocate from Kenya, shared that it was thanks to land restoration approaches like Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) that children were eating healthy meals again, and not having to walk miles for water and firewood. She is now a champion of FMNR and encourages other young people to use it to address the impact of climate change. They and Nomu are desperate for courageous action at COP26 : ""Governments must accept the fact that climate change is indeed a serious issue,"" she said.

The Most Honourable Andrew Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica, launched the new Strategy with NDC Partnership Co-Chairs, Senator the Honourable Matthew Samuda of Jamaica, Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, and The Right Honourable Alok Sharma of the United Kingdom, COP President and Member of Parliament, to support developing countries implement their climate commitments. The Finance Strategy targets money and support for developing countries, harnessing a unique cooperation model to drive sustainable national, regional and international transformation. The Strategy will: Strengthen country capacity, deploying specialist advisors to sectoral ministries and national development banks, Guide countries developing NDC financing strategies with Development and Implementing Partners to align NDCs with wider development plans, and Facilitate private sector buy-in on financing strategies to enable the implementation of NDCs. The new Finance Strategy builds upon the Partnership's recent work, which has seen USD1 billion mobilized to support developing countries' climate action. Yet, much more is needed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's Sixth Assessment Report,Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change,warns that we are not on track to meet the 1.5\'b0C target above pre-industrial levels established in the Paris Agreement. Following COP26 ""As a small island developing state, the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement is not an abstract target but a matter of survival,"" said Prime Minister Holness. ""That is why the development and launch of the NDC Partnership's Finance Strategy is so important and timely."" ""The Partnership's Finance Strategy provides a strong signal to members and global leaders that raised ambition in developing countries must be urgently matched with large-scale, predictable and timely financing,"" added Minister Samuda. COP President Alok Sharma added: ""At COP26 we made significant progress, but now is the time to turn commitments into action. The Partnership has shown that by combining countries' leadership with a coordinated response from international partners, technical and financial support can be mobilized effectively.""

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA323","COP26: Global Leaders Jockey for Position","November 1, 2021 Monday","Oil Daily","Opening statements from global leaders highlighted divisions that will set their stamp on negotiations over critical issues at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. Potential stumbling blocks include topics such as carbon trading, carbon offsets, financing for fossil fuel projects, how emissions should be measured and the responsibilities of rich nations to help developing countries. The tone was set by a weekend meeting of the G20 countries that delivered mixed signals and laid bare some of the fault lines likely to surface in Glasgow. Although G20 leaders endorsed the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C and acknowledged the ""relevance"" of achieving net-zero emissions around midcentury, the summit's final communiqu\'c3\£9 set no firm target dates. The G20 countries agreed to end financing for coal-fired power plants overseas and step up efforts to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels. But they were unable to find consensus on the thornier issue of accelerating their own phaseouts of coal. The UK \'e2\€ which is hosting the COP26 gathering \'e2\€ has said that ""consigning coal to history"" is a major goal of the talks in Glasgow. China China's President Xi Jinping put the onus on developed countries to do more to help emerging economies tackle the climate crisis in a written statement to the conference. Xi urged all parties to intensify their actions to address the climate challenge, but he made no significant new commitments on behalf of China. ""Developed countries must not only do more themselves, but also provide support for developing countries to do better,"" he said. Xi said China will accelerate the development of a green and low-carbon circular economy, ""resolutely"" curb high energy-consuming and high-emission projects, and ""vigorously"" develop renewable energy. Xi, who has not left China since 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, had not been expected to attend the summit in person. United States US President Joe Biden, who did attend the conference in person, said that climate action is ""a moral imperative, but it's also an economic one."" He also dismissed the idea that recent shortages and high prices for coal, oil and gas could derail the transition to low-carbon energy. ""High energy prices only reinforce the urgent need to diversify sources,"" he said. The problem for Biden's White House is that the US has been an inconsistent supporter of climate action, with his predecessor Donald Trump pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement. Biden's appearance in Glasgow without a comprehensive legislative package or new federal regulations will have reinforced the image of Washington as an unreliable ally when it comes to taking the strong measures needed to tackle climate change. Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin did not address the COP26 summit live, but the Kremlin approved a previously announced low-carbon strategy that targets carbon neutrality by 2060. At the earlier G20 meeting, Putin highlighted an energy efficiency program among various measures that will help Russia hit net zero. The Russian president also defended nuclear power and gas as sources of clean energy and insisted that the absorption of carbon dioxide by forests and other natural sinks will also play and important role in addressing global warming. Such projects in Russia and Latin America could in fact be more effective than investments in renewable energy in other countries, he said. Staff Reports \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA325","COP26 Key to Transition Momentum","October 29, 2021","Petroleum Intelligence Weekly","While many are looking for COP26 to send a clear signal that the world is moving urgently and collectively to tackle the climate crisis, the outcome of the UN climate conference in Glasgow will probably be less clear cut \'e2\€ as are its likely implications for the oil industry. The UN climate talks , which kick off Oct. 31, will see broader consensus than ever before on the need for urgent climate action, even if divisions still persist on the pace of change and who foots the bill. In formal \'e2\€  conference of the parties\'e2\€ business, there are some critical decisions to be taken on important details like accounting and carbon trading. Glasgow is also the first test of the five-year ratchet and review mechanism agreed in Paris, with all countries asked to submit ambitious new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to get to net zero by midcentury. COP26 is about more than just the official negotiations though; what happens alongside is important too in building and sustaining momentum for subnational actors, businesses and civil society groups. What happens around the COP, in preparation, is also critical in building momentum. So far, 147 countries representing 57% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have communicated new or updated NDCs. This still leaves the world on track for a temperature rise of at least 2.7\'c2\'b0C this century, according to a new report this week from the UN Environment Program (UNEP). That report offered another glimmer of hope, however, suggesting that net-zero pledges made so far could make a big difference. If fully implemented, they could limit the predicted global temperature rise to 2.2\'c2\'b0C. While many of these have been in big consumers like the US and EU, producers have also been stepping up , with this week\'e2\€  s net-zero pledges from Saudi Arabia \'e2\€ following Russia, the United Arab Emirates and others \'e2\€ representing a major symbolic shift, confirming net zero as essential industry requirement. These signal acceptance that the energy system will see far-reaching change over the coming decades. Oil and gas production is still however central to future plans, highlighting differing views on how fast or by what means the world should move to midcentury net-zero goals. The world\'e2\€  s current energy crunch has significantly shifted the rhetoric of the discussion heading into COP but it's not clear that it has changed the trajectory or the pace of the transition. Major producing countries and Western oil majors point out that oil and gas will be needed for decades and investment in capacity is critical as demand continues to grow. Consuming nations are keen to mitigate current prices and secure near-term supplies. But they have not backed off decarbonization targets and ambitious goals for low-carbon fuels like hydrogen. China has increased coal production quotas for this year but also unveiled plans to cap its oil refining capacity, with no net increase allowed after 2025. India\'e2\€  s oil and gas demand are expected to continue growing for the next two decades, and under some BP scenarios the country accounts for 90% of energy growth, CEO Bernard Looney said. But India is also keen to develop renewable and hydrogen sectors that can cut into costly oil and gas imports. Pledges by countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia as well as large oil companies to reach net-zero emissions show that producers understand the need for a place at the climate table, even if they differ on the path to achieve net zero. While Glasgow's focus is broader than just the energy transition, there are a few specific areas that could impact the industry. With NDCs still falling short of what\'e2\€  s needed, the UK, as COP26 president-designate, is preparing an agreement to deliver some short-term measures to help keep 1.5\'c2\'b0C in reach. Phasing out unabated coal power is one priority. There are calls too for COP26 to help tackle methane emissions from fossil fuel production. Agreement on Article 6, which covers cooperative approaches including carbon trading, could also provide a more solid basis for carbon pricing, emissions trading linkages and perhaps oil companies\'e2\€  offsetting plans. But this has proved one of the most difficult parts of the Paris accord to push over the finish line. If the formal COP talks stall, progress may also come from the wider COP events. This could include new proposals for finance rules to ensure better disclosure of climate risk, as well as efforts to advance low-carbon transport and technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture that bring together countries and companies. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA326","COP26 Roundup: Methane, Carbon Pricing, Coal","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","International Oil Daily","Methane Emissions Methane emissions were high on the agenda on the second day of the COP26 conference, with the US and the EU formally launching the Global Methane Pledge they first unveiled in September. Signatories to this agreement have committed to cutting methane emissions 30% by 2030. Over 100 countries have now signed up, US President Joe Biden told a COP26 event. The US has also announced steps it will take at home to implement the agreement. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted that Brussels will also launch new methane regulations next month. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said he is fully committed to ""doing the hard work"" at home to develop and implement a plan to slash methane emissions. He said that Canada was going beyond the requirement of the Global Methane Pledge by committing to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by at least 75% by 2030. Carbon Pricing and Article 6 Negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were due to begin in earnest on Wednesday \'e2\€ after the conclusion of the two-day leaders' segment of COP26 on Tuesday. But a leaders' roundtable on carbon pricing touched on some of the key issues involved. Von der Leyen said that Europe had showed carbon pricing can work and that it hopes this will be adopted more widely. This would be preferable, she said, to the carbon border adjustment mechanism Europe has proposed as an alternative to prevent ""carbon leakage."" International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also spoke of the importance of setting a minimum global carbon price, which World Trade Organization Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala agreed would be less of a headache than carbon border levies, which developing countries in particular are afraid of. Green Grids World leaders have backed a new Green Grid Initiative that supports a massive increase in the transmission and distribution of renewable electricity generated by solar and wind power. The scheme aims to address the mismatch between renewable power and the global grid network that is currently ill-equipped to transmit green electricity to consumers and communities that need it most. The idea is to build a global power network across time zones and borders that can bring hydropower, solar and wind-generated electricity from the best locations, such as wet, mountainous countries, deserts and windy oceans, to demand hotspots that currently rely on fossil fuels. The project is backed by the US, India, the UK and France, as well as countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Clean Tech Boost Over 40 world leaders signed up to a new Breakthrough Agenda, including the US, India, the EU, China, and other developing economies. The aim is to make clean technologies the most affordable, accessible and attractive choice around the world in each of the most polluting sectors by 2030. The plan will see countries and businesses work closely on a range of international initiatives to accelerate innovation and scale up green industries. These include clean power, zero-emission vehicles, and near-zero emission steel and hydrogen. It could potentially create 20 million new jobs. Nigeria's Net-Zero Pledge Nigeria has committed to hit net-zero emissions by 2060. President Muhammadu Buhari told the COP26 summit that the country intends to cut emissions 20% below ""business as usual"" levels by 2030. The reductions could be increased to 47% if Nigeria can secure ""financial assistance, technology transfer and capacity building from the more advanced and more willing international partners,"" he said. ""We are looking for partners in innovation, technology and finance to make cleaner and efficient use of all available resources to make a more sustainable transition in energy markets,"" Buhari said. Gas will continue to play a role in Nigeria's energy transition until 2040 ""without diverting from the goals of the Paris Agreement."" South Africa's Coal Exit South Africa will receive an initial $8.5 billion commitment from the US and European countries to help it accelerate its transition away from coal-fired power generation. The financing will be provided through loans, grants and investments and risk-sharing instruments over five years to help South Africa move away from coal-fired plants which generated about 90% of the country's electricity last year. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the funds would help support the country's more ambitious pledge to reduce emissions by 2030. It plans to accelerate investment in renewable energy and new sectors like electric vehicles and green hydrogen while helping state-owned utility Eskom to transition away from coal. Staff Reports \"

Leaders from 40 countries agreed Nov. 2 at the COP26 climate summit to an international plan to make clean technology ""affordable, accessible and attractive"" for all by 2030, in a bid to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees C. The plan, dubbed the Breakthrough Agenda, would halve global emissions across key sectors like power generation, road transportation, steel production and agriculture while also supporting the phaseout of coal and the transition to electric vehicles, according to a news release. By the end of the decade, renewables should become the most affordable and reliable choice of electricity for all countries, and zero-emission vehicles should become the new normal, leaders said, calling also for near-zero emission steel production as well as renewable and low-carbon hydrogen. Delivering these four goals, while also cleaning up agricultural processes, will add over $16 trillion across emerging and developed economies, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Signatories to the Breakthrough Agenda, which include the U.S., the EU, India and the U.K., will meet annually to assess progress toward the goals for 2022. ""Setting ambitious targets is only half the equation, as we all know,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said during the launch of the plan. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the initiative, saying the EU supports each of the focus areas. ""Finally, we prioritize the importance of innovation,"" von der Leyen said in Glasgow. Other emissions-reduction programs launched at the COP26 summit Nov. 2 include the Green Grids Initiative, designed to help integrate solar and wind power into networks, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, which aims to mobilize an initial $10 billion in funding from philanthropies, governments and development banks to support energy access and clean technologies in the Global South. Meanwhile, a partnership between the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Bill Gates-led Breakthrough Energy LLC intends to mobilize up to $1 billion between 2022 and 2026 to help scale technologies like clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA329","COP26: Talks Have Momentum, But 'Success' Hangs in the Balance","November 11, 2021","Energy Compass","As COP26 nears its conclusion, attention is focused on whether the negotiations will produce a roadmap to close the gap between current levels of ambition and what\'e2\€  s needed to avert the worst effects of climate change. The conference delivered some early momentum outside of official talks, with new initiatives launched by groups of countries and the private sector. This helped to partly close the ambition gap, but not enough to meet the 1.5\'c2\'b0C goal, with the UK now appealing to national leaders to help get an ambitious agreement over the finishing line. A surprise US-China plan, announced Wednesday, to cooperate on cutting emissions over the next decade may prove key. <li> The first week of COP26 delivered some strong momentum, with host nation the UK orchestrating announcements on a number of fronts that could help to bend the curve on global emissions if fully implemented. </li> </ul> Separate to the formal negotiating process, the conference opened with a series of announcements on new measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions. This included the formal launch by the EU and US of the Global Methane Pledge they initially announced in September. Under this over 100 countries, including Saudi Arabia , committed to cutting methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Having declared the demise of coal to be a priority at COP26 , the UK also launched a coalition of 190 countries and organizations that have committed to phasing out unabated coal by and ending support for new coal-fired power plants. The private sector stepped up, too, with over 450 financial institutions \'e2\€ which control $130 trillion in private capital \'e2\€ pledging to align their portfolios with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C, as part of a Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Heralded by the conference organizers as signs of early progress, climate campaigners were less enthusiastic. None of these initiatives are binding, they noted, while the coal pledge also excludes key coal consumers China, India and Australia, and the finance pledge doesn\'e2\€  t instantly marshal that $130 trillion out of fossil fuels, but by 2050. <li> Coal was firmly in the firing line in Glasgow, but oil and gas are also being targeted by some countries and financial institutions, and potentially by the final COP summary declaration. </li> </ul> Some 26 countries \'e2\€ including the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada and the US \'e2\€ and development finance agencies pledged to end direct public support for overseas fossil fuel projects, including oil and gas, by the end of 2022. Modest as this might seem, COP26 President Alok Sharma said it was just a start that could be built on in future COPs. Climate activists agreed this could be a ""game-changer,"" noting how similarly initially modest moves to end coal finance have since snowballed. Oil companies\'e2\€  net-zero goals could face more scrutiny too, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres setting up a new panel of experts to examine such pledges, while the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation and other bodies launched a new initiative to develop more consistent climate and sustainability disclosure standards for financial markets. New support was also announced for clean technologies like hydrogen. But while recent high energy prices don\'e2\€  t seem to have undercut the energy transition, there is a new recognition that gas and oil supplies remain critical in the short term . <li> Early momentum ran out of steam as the serious business of hammering out a deal at COP26 highlighted some still deep divisions that could yet scupper the chances of \'e2\€  success\'e2\€ in Glasgow. </li> </ul> Rows over money for developing countries to transition their economies, as well as to fund adaptation to climate change and compensate for the loss and damage it causes, were inevitable given that developed countries have failed to meet a promise they first made in 2009 to provide $100 billion per year in funding by 2020. This currently stands at around $80 billion/yr and won\'e2\€  t be met until next year. Poorer countries are now looking for clear commitments to scale this up from 2025, when the current pledge expires. The African Group of negotiators and \'e2\€  like-minded\'e2\€ developing countries want this to rise to around $1.3 trillion per year by 2030. Progress on finance is intimately linked to headway in the negotiation on Article 6 on carbon markets and pricing, which supporters believe could unlock massive flows of private finance for developing countries. Article 6 talks seem to have made some progress, although there are still areas of disagreement, including how much of a share of the proceeds from trading should be allocated to poorer countries and how many old, unused Kyoto-era credits from projects in developing countries can be carried forward into a new trading system. <li> Negotiators are also grappling a \'e2\€  cover text\'e2\€ or COP summary declaration that seeks to keep hopes of 1.5\'c2\'b0C alive, and which for the first time calls out fossil fuels. </li> </ul>This is perhaps where the success or not of COP26 will be ultimately determined. After an initial first draft, released by the UK earlier this week, was criticized for lacking ambition, a new and stronger draft emerged Wednesday morning. This includes the first ever direct reference to fossil fuels in any COP conclusion, calling for the phaseout of coal and an end to fossil fuel subsidies. The battle is now on to keep this clause in the final document, with strong opposition to it expected from key fossil fuel producers . Under the consensus process used to make decision at COP any country can block progress, which has often resulted in agreements that represent a lowest common denominator. But scientists warn that the time for small incremental steps has run out and that COP26 needs to produce a strong result or the 1.5\'c2\'b0C goal will be missed. Sharma has thus asked national delegations to consult with their home capitals and leaders in an attempt to find a breakthrough \'e2\€ and accelerate efforts to reach net-zero emissions by around mid-century. The US-China 10-year roadmap to cut emissions to keep 1.5\'c2\'b0C in target may provide a critical boost. Ronan Kavanagh \"

Daniele Guadagnolo, co-founder of Change for Planet, at COP26 . Photo courtesy of Mr. Guadagnolo. The COP26 UN climate conference held in Glasgow, Scotland, from 31 October to 12 November, was billed as humanity's last chance to get climate change under control and avert devastating consequences such as extreme weather events, ice melt, ocean acidification and food insecurity. Young people are concerned that their futures will be dominated by floods, heatwaves and storms as the climate that allowed previous generations to prosper changes rapidly. As a result, many are taking bold and transformative steps to green their communities, advocate for climate justice and protest against government inaction. Changing the status quo Photo courtesy of Aurelia Bruce. Young climate leaders who are part of the UNCTAD Youth network of young changemakers participating in UN discussions on trade and development matters made their voices heard at COP26 . They urged politicians and businesses to take concrete action and meaningfully include them in climate and environmental governance. Aurelia Bruce from Trinidad and Tobago joined the climate discussions as the focal point for the Commonwealth Youth Climate Network. ""We were tasked with organizing youth-focused events, actioning an intergenerational dialogue on shaping inclusive climate policies and bringing more youth expertise to the decision-making processes,"" Ms. Bruce said. Coming from a small island developing state (SIDS), Ms. Bruce believes delayed action to combat adverse effects of climate change will only exacerbate natural disasters and related social inequalities being faced by many Caribbean islands. ""For SIDS to survive increasingly extreme weather conditions, we must bridge the divide between developed and developing states to address this global issue together,"" she said. Attending his third climate conference, Daniele Guadagnolo from Italy participated in youth-led events at the invitation of the European Commission and the Italian government to talk about the role of youth in climate advocacy. He was one of the 400 youth delegates who drafted the Youth4Climate Manifesto, a global proposal for climate justice with a focus on reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2030, increasing youth participation in decision-making processes, education on climate and financing a greener future. ""This document gives us a fair chance to do something more ambitious,"" he said. ""The role of trade and development in capping carbon emissions and helping developing countries build institutional capacities to deal with challenges brought by climate change also featured strongly in the discussions."" Financing an equitable transition Vladislav Kaim from Moldova, who is a member of the UN Secretary-General Advisory Group on Climate Change, took part in negotiations to help align the strategies and key messages from COP26 with youth expectations and advise other high-level officials, while representing their own regional standpoints on what should be done. As the only economist in the group, Mr. Kaim took the lead on advisory on ensuring climate finance and a just transition from the standpoint of Eastern Europe. ""Most vulnerable countries are grappling with many challenges at the same time, one of them being the fiscal crisis,"" Mr. Kaim said. Photo courtesy of Vladislav Kaim. He said the way climate finance is currently disbursed will not make a significant dent in countries' efforts at adaptation and mitigation if comprehensive debt restructuring for countries facing a fiscal crisis is not done. ""I advocated for the inclusion of debt relief and partial conversion of debt to climate resources, outside of the $100 billion target earlier agreed in Paris so that countries would get an income and feel relief on the expense side,"" he said. Another point of discussion was how climate finance is disbursed at the micro level, with resources being allocated to a few big projects for which the youth don't have the capacity to apply. ""The rules of adaptation finance should be revised to make sure it's circulated towards smaller community projects led by the youth,"" Mr. Kaim said. The relevance of new generations in bringing about climate action has never been greater, even though meaningful inclusion of young people in shaping global climate politics and governance remains unsatisfactory. The COP26 Climate action was one of the issues deemed to be crucial to young people in the Youth Declaration presented at UNCTAD's 15th quadrennial conference held in October 2021. The youth are the decision makers of tomorrow and can play a powerful role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Through the UNCTAD Youth Network, women and men between the ages of 18 and 30 will continue to help build the narrative about the future by sharing ideas and experiences, working with fellow youth in preparing inputs to UNCTAD meetings on trade and development-related issues, and making their voices heard in major youth events and more. \"

He will first head to Italy for the G20, an intergovernmental forum comprising 19 countries and the European Union, and then to Scotland for the COP26 international climate conference. Before that, Biden is scheduled to meet Pope Francis in Rome on Friday. It will be followed by meetings with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He will also meet with French President Emmanuel Macron later in the day. On Saturday and Sunday, Biden will attend the key G20 events in Rome. There will be several sessions covering the main elements of the international economy and international affairs. ""On the margins of the Summit he will engage with key leaders on a range of issues of importance to the American people, including supply chain resilience, energy prices, the Iranian nuclear program, and more,"" the White House said. The COP26 COP26 will bring leaders together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In Glasgow, the U.S. President will deliver a major speech on climate. He will also have the opportunity to engage on the margins there on a range of important issues, including the Build Back Better World initiative - B3W - that the G7 announced at the summit in June. In the past few weeks, the U.S. and the EU came together for joint action on Covid-19, launched a global methane pledge and other key climate initiatives, and launched a Trade and Technology Council to set the rules and standards for economics and technology in the future. ""President Biden and key European partners will sit down at these two summits to coordinate policies on Iran, on supply chains, on global infrastructure efforts, and so much else,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters. He pointed out that neither China nor Russia will be represented at the summit at the leader level, reportedly due to COVID-19. ""The U.S. and Europe will be there, and they'll be there energized and united at both the G20 and COP26 , driving the agenda, shaping the agenda as it relates to these significant international issues,"" said Sullivan. The top White House official said the trip is going to give the President an opportunity to advance some of his highest priorities on behalf of the American people, such as global minimum tax, supply chains and energy prices. Biden approaches COP26 with a commitment that the United States will reduce carbon emissions 50 to 52 percent by 2030. He also intends to address the short-term imbalance in supply and demand in the global energy picture so that the economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere around the world is reinforced, according to Sullivan. COP26 First Lady Jill Biden will accompany Joe Biden in his second international trip since becoming President in January. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA332","U.N. Regional Information Center for Western Europe: COP26 - A Snapshot of the Agreement","November 16, 2021 Tuesday 8:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The United Nations Regional Information Center for Western Europe issued the following news on Nov. 15, 2021: After extending the COP26 climate negotiations an extra day, nearly 200 countries meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, adopted on Saturday an outcome document that, according to the UN Secretary-General, ""reflects the interests, the contradictions, and the state of political will in the world today"". The outcome document, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, calls on 197 countries to report their progress towards more climate ambition next year, at COP27, set to take place in Egypt. The outcome also firms up the global agreement to accelerate action on climate this decade. However, COP26 Mr. Sharma apologized for ""the way the process has unfolded"" and added that he understood some delegations would be ""deeply disappointed"" that the stronger language had not made it into the final agreement. By other terms of the wide-ranging set of decisions, resolutions and statements that make up the outcome of COP26 , governments were, among other things, asked to provide tighter deadlines for updating their plans to reduce emissions. On the thorny question of financing from developed countries in support of climate action in developing countries, the text emphasizes the need to mobilize climate finance ""from all sources to reach the level needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, including significantly increasing support for developing country Parties, beyond $100 billion per year"". Other key COP26 Beyond the political negotiations and the Leaders' Summit, COP26 brought together about 50,000 participants online and in-person to share innovative ideas, solutions, attend cultural events and build partnerships and coalitions. The conference heard many encouraging announcements. One of the biggest was that leaders from over 120 countries, representing about 90 per cent of the world's forests, pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, the date by which the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to curb poverty and secure the planet's future are supposed to have been achieved. There was also a methane pledge, led by the United States and the European Union, by which more than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of this greenhouse gas by 2030. Meanwhile, more than 40 countries - including major coal-users such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile - agreed to shift away from coal, one of the biggest generators CO2 emissions. The private sector also showed strong engagement with nearly 500 global financial services firms agreeing to align $130 trillion - some 40 per cent of the world's financial assets - with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, including limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Also, in a surprise for many, the United States and China pledged to boost climate cooperation over the next decade. In a joint declaration they said they had agreed to take steps on a range of issues, including methane emissions, transition to clean energy and decarbonization. They also reiterated their commitment to keep the 1.5C goal alive. Regarding green transport, more than 100 national governments, cities, states and major car companies signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans to end the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in leading markets, and by 2040 worldwide. At least 13 nations also committed to end the sale of fossil fuel powered heavy duty vehicles by 2040. Many 'smaller' but equally inspiring commitments were made over the past two weeks, including one by 11 countries which created the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA). Ireland, France, Denmark, and Costa Rica among others, as well as some subnational governments, launched this first-of-its kind alliance to set an end date for national oil and gas exploration and extraction. A quick refresher on how we got here To keep it simple, COP26 was the latest and one of the most important steps in the decades long, UN-facilitated effort to help stave off what has been called a looming climate emergency. In this treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere"" to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories. Since 1994, when the treaty entered into force, every year the UN has been bringing together almost every country on earth for global climate summits or ""COPs"", which stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. This year should have been the 27th annual summit, but thanks to COVID-19, we've fallen a year behind due to last year's postponement - hence, COP26 . MSTRUCK-7666455 MSTRUCK \"

Various  extensions to the UNFCCC treaty have been negotiated during these COPs to establish legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries, and to define an enforcement mechanism. These include the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which defined emission limits for developed nations to be achieved by 2012; and the HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to try and limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, and boost climate action financing. So, here\' s where COP26 gets interesting: during the conference, among other issues, delegates will be aiming to finalise the \' Paris Rulebook\' , or the rules needed to implement the Agreement. This time they will need to agree on common timeframes for the frequency of revision and monitoring of their climate commitments. Basically, Paris set the destination, limiting warming well below two degrees, (ideally 1.5) but Glasgow, is the last chance to make it a reality. IMF/K. M. Asad In Bangladesh, efforts are undertaken to improve coastal protection from flooding caused by storms and a rise in sea level due to climate change. So, this bring us to our initial question: why is it the last chance? Like a boa constrictor that slowly squeezes its prey to death, climate change has gone from being an uncomfortable low-level issue, to a life-threatening global emergency, in the past three decades. Although there have been new and updated commitments made by countries ahead of COP26 , the world remains on track for a dangerous global temperature rise of HYPERLINK at least 2.7\'b0C this century UN chief Ant\'f3nio Guterres bluntly calls it  climate catastrophe , one that it is already being felt to a deadly degree in the most vulnerable parts of the world like sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island States, lashed by rising sea levels. HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/04/1090432 Millions of people are already being displaced and killed by disasters exacerbated by climate change. For Mr. Guterres, and the hundreds of scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scenario of 1.5\'b0C warming, is the  only liveable future for humanity . The clock is ticking, and to have a chance of limiting the rise, the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years . This is a gigantic task that we only will be able to do if leaders attending COP26 come up with bold, time-bound and front-loaded plans to phase out coal and transform their economies to reach HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/12/1078612 so called net zero emissions ADB/Ariel Javellana Emissions from coal-fired power plants contribute to air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Hmm, but didn\' t countries like China and the United States already commit to net zero? The most recent UN HYPERLINK Emissions Gap Report This covers over half of global domestic greenhouse gas emissions, over half of global GDP and a third of the global population. Eleven targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions. Sounds great right? But there\' s a catch: many of the commitments delay action until after 2030, raising doubts over whether these net zero pledges can actually be achieved. Also, many of these pledges are  vague and inconsistent with the officially submitted national commitments, known as NDC\' s. This again explains why COP26 is so important:  The time has passed for diplomatic niceties...If governments - especially G20 governments - do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering , warned Guterres in the UN General Assembly this week. UNFCCC Friday for Future demonstration at COP25 So, what exactly is COP26 hoping to achieve (practically speaking)? {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The official negotiations take place over two weeks. The first week includes technical negotiations by government officials, followed by high-level Ministerial and Heads of State meetings in the second week, when the final decisions will be made \- or not. There are four main points that will be discussed during the conference according to its host, the United Kingdom: 1. Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach To do this, countries need to accelerate the phase-out of coal, curb deforestation, speed up the switch to greener economies. Carbon market mechanisms will be also part of the negotiations. Since the climate is already changing countries already affected by climate change need to protect and restore ecosystems, as well as build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure. 3. Mobilise finance That promise was not kept, and COP26 will be crucial to secure the funds, with the help of international financial institutions, as well as set new climate finance targets to be achieved by 2025. 4. Work together to deliver This means establishing collaborations between governments, businesses and civil society, and of course, finalising the Paris Rulebook to make the Agreement fully operational. In addition to formal negotiations, COP26 is expected to establish new initiatives and coalitions for delivering climate action. Unsplash/Adam Marikar COP26 How, when and where? The main event will be held at the Scottish Event Campus, from 31 October to 12 November, with the possibility of negotiations spilling over an extra day or two. So far, there are over 30.000 people registered to attend representing governments, businesses, NGOs, and civil society groups. The 197 Parties to the UNFCCC treaty, often get in groups or  blocs to negotiate together such as the G77 and China, the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, the Umbrella Forum, the Small Island Developing States, and the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean. The negotiations also include observers, which have no formal part in them but make interventions and help maintain transparency. Observers include United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, faith-based groups, and the press. But besides the official negotiations, there will be a conference, a pavilion, and thousands of side events happening, divided over thematic days, on topics like finance, energy, youth and public empowerment, nature, adaptation, gender, science and innovation, transport, and cities. The conference will happen across two zones \- The Blue Zone (Scottish Events Campus), and the Green Zone located at the Glasgow Science Centre. The Blue Zone is a UN-managed space where negotiations are hosted, and to enter all attendees must be credited by the UNFCCC Secretariat. The Green Zone is managed by the UK Government and open to the public. It will include events, exhibitions, workshops and talks to promote dialogue, awareness, education and commitments on climate change. Anyone famous attending? Several heads of state and government including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden are expected to attend. Other famous faces in Glasgow will include Sir David Attenborough, the COP26 people\' s advocate, activist Greta Thunberg, the famous Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams and singer-songwriter and HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/ UNEP ambassador Ellie Goulding. The Queen announced with regret, on Tuesday, that she would not be travelling to the event\' s main reception after all.

While COVID-19 continues to be a huge challenge across the world, tackling the climate crisis cannot wait according to the COP26 hosts. In-person negotiations are preferred over online ones, to ensure inclusive participation by high and low-income countries as well as ensuring scrutiny and transparency. Fully vaccination is encouraged for those attending the conference, and the United Kingdom ran a programme ahead of time, There will also be strict COVID-19 testing protocols in place, including daily testing for everyone entering the Blue Zone to ensure the health and wellbeing of all those involved and the surrounding community. There are also COP-specific arrangements for the COVID Travel Regime people will encounter as they enter England and Scotland, with some countries requiring quarantine (which will be funded by the UK Government for attendees in difficult circumstances.

The platform streamlines end-to-end sustainable finance lifecycle making it easier, cheaper and more transparent for both issuers and investors. The main goal of Evercity platform is to make sustainable finance more accessible to SMEs in developing countries.\~ Sustainable finance is a $15 trillion market showing significant growth amid the climate crisis. However, it is still not accessible to the most in need - SMEs from developing countries. They don't have enough knowledge and resources to issue sustainable finance. At the same time sustainable investors don't have access to real impact data and are exposed to greenwashing.\~ Evercity is solving these problems by providing a one-stop shop to automate and simplify the whole sustainable finance journey. The platform integrates monitoring tools (IoT sensors and satellites) to collect physical ESG risk and impact data. The raw data is being refined according to global standards and stored on the low-carbon blockchain to ensure its ultimate transparency and immutability.\~ The in-house built Sustainable Finance Protocol enables 10x times cost reduction and increase of issuance speed. It provides for the issuance of fully traceable sustainable assets on the blockchain: bonds, loans, carbon credits. The platform also allows EU Taxonomy screening of companies and portfolios, green finance framework creation, and automatic reporting on sustainable assets. Liza Romanova, Evercity founder and COO:\~ With my co-founder Alexey, we have been jointly working for over 10-years on developing digital innovations for global corporate sustainability leaders. We have been collaborating with the UN since 2017, when we made possible the world's first carbon credit transaction on the blockchain. This experience was used by Evercity to make sustainable finance as simple, cost-efficient and transparent as it has never been.\~ About Evercity\~ Evercity is a Berlin-based sustainability measurement and investment platform. Its mission is to accelerate global finance flows into projects and innovations needed to attain UN Sustainable Development Goals. Earlier this year Evercity graduated from Techstars & ABN AMRO Future of finance accelerator and made it to the finals of the Fintech Hackcelerator by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Despite calls for climate finance, funding for adaptation, and drastic emission cuts from rich nations, few of their requests feature in the HYPERLINK https://qz.com/2089094/what-does-the-cop26-climate-agreement-say/ final agreement , announced on 13 November. Rich nations have failed to meet their pledge to pay $100 billion a year by 2020 to poor countries. It is expected to be reached by 2023. While the target will be missed, more money has been promised, with COP26 \' s president, Alok Sharma, saying around $500 billion would be mobilized by 2025. Nations have also been urged to double the proportion of climate finance going to adaptation. However, this still falls far short of the HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-59214807 $1.3 trillion that African negotiators wanted \- and what is estimated that the continent could face in climate change-related costs.  It is saddening to learn that the \' wealthy\' nations have failed short by nearly $20 billion of their pledge to contribute $100 billion per year by 2020 to assist vulnerable countries most of which are in Africa to cope with the challenges of climate change, says Victor Ongoma, a professor in climate change based in Morocco.  This is a big setback especially at a time when most developing countries are facing socioeconomic challenges posed by covid-19. Funding for damage caused by climate change in Africa is still insufficient Many African delegates, including Guinea and Kenya, similarly expressed \' extreme disappointment\' on the outcome around loss and damage (which is distinct from the $1.3 trillion ask.) While experts estimate that the damage already caused by climate change across Africa could go into the trillions of dollars, the final deal excludes specific funding for this. Instead, the deal outlines plans to fund the Santiago network, a body that aims to build technical expertise on dealing with loss and damage. A tweet by HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/vanessa_vash/status/1459587709043982337 Vanessa Nakate , a Ugandan climate activist is quite telling, stating,  COP26 was nearly a breakthrough moment for loss and damage.

In a bid to keep the 1.5C target alive, the pact has requested countries to increase their ambition on cuts by next year. However, for the first time, the deal has committed to phase out some fossil fuels subsidies and reduce coal. South Africa, one of the top coal producers in the world, HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59135169 will receive $8.5 billion HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/news/12-billion-donor-support-to-halt-and-reverse-forest-loss-and-protect-land-rights $1.5 billion has similarly been pledged to protect and restore the Congo Basin , which is home to the second largest tropical forest in the world and absorbs 4% of global carbon emissions annually.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference, which ended Thursday, is no exception. We know agriculture and food are responsible for between 30% and 40% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. We also know our population is increasing and we must determine how to feed more people, more efficiently. With so much news coming out of COP26 and surrounding events, it's easy to miss parts of it.

Food and beverage companies can be part of the solution supporting governments and society in efforts to mitigate global warming or they can be part of the problem. ""The most destructive technology in human history is the use of animals to make food,"" Patrick Brown, CEO of Impossible Foods, said during this Nov. 6 event. Societies can learn from their indigenous people how to maintain biodiversity and create healthy food systems. ""If we got fid of animal agriculture today and continued to grow plant-based products in the same way that they're grown today, we'd still have a broken system,"" said Ashley Allen, Oatly's chief sustainability officer. Louise Mabulo, founder of the Cacao Project in the Philippines, said localized solutions to the food system's problems are more practical and economical.

Agroecology includes practices such as regenerative agriculture and rewilding. ""It should be recognized as a central tool to tackle the multiple crises we face, including the climate crisis. Agroecology is rooted in rebuilding relationships between agriculture and the environment, and between food systems and society.""

""At the same time, necessity and demand lead to invention and innovation, so what some see as the ashes of COP26 could very well turn out to become gold nuggets for entrepreneurs in the food startup space,"" he wrote. He argues that plant-based proteins will continue to increase and become more accessible. But cultured meat will have its place in the food system, as well.

In the latest briefing paper the authors argue that reaching net zero should not be seen as an endpoint to the UK's climate policy. Young and future generations will disproportionately face the impacts of climate change itself, so additional negative consequences of short-sighted policy design should be avoided. Moreover, the UK cannot act in isolation and should do more to encourage a global transition towards net zero, even once its own transition is complete. The paper calls for:  The UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emission to net zero by 2050  Secure and transparent supply chains must be established for the critical mineral resources essential to low-carbon energy systems.  Increased government attention and R&D funding must go into developing solutions for energy system waste disposal, with the incorporation of circular economy concepts.  Stable policy is needed to encourage CCS commercialisation, which must include robust regulation of storage monitoring.  Carbon sequestration through afforestation should be encouraged with broader financial incentives alongside education programmes that shift consumption patterns to ease land-use competition.  A Climate Action Unit within the FCDO should be formed, led by a senior minister, to ensure the long-term international climate leadership of the UK.  A mechanism for continuing the evaluation of the long-term consequences of climate policy is needed to improve policy design; the remit of the Climate Change Committee should be updated to include this. Owen Tutt (MA in International Studies and Diplomacy 2020-21) who alongside Johanna Caitlin Dieffenbacher contributed to the briefing said: ""It was a pleasure to write this briefing alongside such enthusiastic students from across the UK. We believe strongly in the need to consider the interests of young and future generations in the decision making of today. I hope our recommendations can offer a start for recognising and addressing the importance of this issue to climate policy."" He urged the importance of change adding: ""2050 is the start date of a new, net zero UK - not just an emissions deadline. Policies must start to reflect this. The dependence of energy and climate policy on decisions made decades ago necessitates that a long-term perspective is taken now to ensure we achieve a net zero emissions society that thrives in 2050 and beyond."" The paper, written by ten students from seven universities across the UK, analyses the long-term implications of net zero policymaking in the UK and explores the need for an increased focus on young and future generations' interests, while maintaining the urgency of far-reaching and ambitious policy today. The paper explores three net zero policy case studies, focusing on energy systems, carbon removal and international leadership, to highlight how integrating long-term thinking can strengthen the policy decisions made today COP26 will be held in Glasgow on 31 October until 12 November.

Chair Castor used, I think, the most important word I can think of when we talk about the climate crisis: action. We are beyond being inspired by possibilities, by ideas, by advancing the debate. This is a decade of action, and the stakes of inaction have become all too clear. So, in order to translate our work into action and those of us in the House of Representatives have a critical role to play we need some inspiration, we need some optimism, we need to stay motivated. And we got plenty of that here at COP26 . I think many of us were very energized after our meeting with Secretary Kerry yesterday, because his optimism is palpable. And so is his incredible substantive command of every single issue at stake in this climate crisis. And so, I am grateful for the opportunity to be here with our impressive American delegation a delegation that is not just back in, but all in and leading in incredibly effective ways. And we will take that sense of optimism and inspiration back with us to Washington, because weve got work to finish in the House and in the Congress to make sure that we are all in as well. \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA344","COP26's Failure to Advocate Livestock Reduction is a Ludicrous Failure, Says Humane Society International","November 12, 2021 Friday 8:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","(TNSOps) -- The Humane Society International issued the following news: As COP26 prepares to reveal the final pledges focused on cutting emissions from energy, transport and other sectors, campaigners from Humane Society International, one of the largest global animal protection NGOs in the world, say the total omission of targets to reduce livestock farming and cut meat and dairy production and consumption, represents a ludicrous failure considering the sector is the world's second largest emitter of human-induced greenhouse gases. Stefanie McNerney, plant based solutions manager at Humane Society International, says: ""Whilst there were many conversations at COP26 side events and press conferences about the urgent need for global food system reform to cut meat and dairy production and consumption, this vital climate mitigation strategy was depressingly absent from the COP26 leader negotiations. Current pledges on methane, coal, forests and transport still look set to put us way off target to limit global temperature rise, so it is a ludicrous failure to ignore the opportunity to limit one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, animal agriculture. We need policies and targets that shift farming toward plant-based food production, and the clear lack of ambition to do so is deeply troubling. We have reached a stage in the climate crisis where so called technical solutions such as cattle feed additives are nowhere near enough to tackle emissions from this sector. The climate clock is ticking and it is well past time to move beyond these low-impact greenwashing distractions offered by Big Ag that merely perpetuate the growth of an unsustainable industry. The science is clear that that's not an option. Will governments follow the science and plan a just transition to a more climate-resilient, plant-centric food system, or will we be waiting until the cows come home for them to stop ignoring the cow in the room?"" Key points:  Despite world leaders at COP26 acknowledging that food production not only contributes to climate change, but also holds one of the keys to mitigating it, dialogues around this sector lacked ambition, with most official conversations focusing on low-impact strategies such as modifying livestock feed, tackling nitrous oxide in fertilizer and rewilding, whilst completely omitting discussion of high impact actions such as livestock reduction and diet change.  HSI welcomes the pledges on methane reductions and bringing an end to deforestation. However, animal agriculture is one of the largest contributors to both methane emissions and deforestation, and these issues cannot be addressed without reducing global livestock numbers and shifting to more plant-centric food production and consumption.  Diverting the discussion toward short-sighted mitigation tactics whilst willfully ignoring and even shooting down the topic of livestock reduction and diet change is nothing short of greenwashing by the livestock industry. Governments that are serious about climate change must address emissions from animal agriculture, and that means reducing the number of animals raised for consumption and transforming our food system to a more sustainable, resilient, plant-centric system that is just for all.  On the subject of missing the point, in the draft CMA decision by the COP26 president, the words £nimal agriculture' and 'farming', let alone 'livestock reduction' do not even feature once.  The other cow in the room was the cow served on the COP plates. The provision of meat on the menu at a climate conference was disappointing. The CO2equivalent labelling on all food served at the conference clearly demonstrated the very large carbon footprint of beef dishes compared to plant-based options. The juxtaposition of emissions between a beef burger weighing in at a hefty 3.3 kg CO2 e compared to a plant-based burger at just 0.2 kg CO2 e literally served up an obvious mitigation strategy on a plate--one that was a glaring omission from the COP26 negotiations. HSI's #TheCowInTheRoom campaign called on COP26 to acknowledge and act on the climate damaging impacts of intensive animal agriculture. The campaign has the backing of leading plant-based food companies and investors including Beyond Investing, Mosa Meat, Eat Just, Wicked Kitchen and Linda McCartney Foods, as well as celebrities such as Moby, Billie Eilish, Joaquin Phoenix, Alan Cumming, Alicia Silverstone, Mary McCartney, Leona Lewis, Martin Freeman, Lily Cole and Stephen Fry. Earlier this week the campaigners handed in a petition of more than 70,000 signatures with campaign partners ProVeg International and Four Paws.

Thank you all for joining our hearing on the findings of the latest working group reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I also want to thank our expert witnesses for being here today. The reality of the latest IPCC reports cannot be ignored. Global emissions must peak within the next three years to ensure we stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming in the next century.

Throughout COP26 , the need to keep within 1.5 degrees of warming while making global efforts to support community adaption was a recurring theme. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee has been working to pass legislation needed to curb the worst climate impacts. Even with current efforts to curb carbon emissions, climate change has already permanently altered the lives of most Americans. Whether it is flooding, drought, or extreme weather, the impacts of climate change are being felt by all our constituents. There are many climate impacts that are already ""baked in,"" and will occur regardless of how quickly we cut emissions. This means we must move forward with robust climate adaptation approaches alongside emissions mitigation. Many adaptive solutions are already available and have been outlined in the IPCC's latest report. Many of our Federal science agencies have conducted research to collect the data needed to plan for adaptation. This research includes data on climate, how crop yields will shift with time, and how rising sea levels will impact communities. Utilizing this data for ambitious and impactful climate action is necessary. However, it is also imperative that in finding solutions, the voices of communities most at risk are not left out of the discussion. Local community leaders see much of the first-hand impacts of climate change, and Indigenous communities hold generational knowledge that focuses on adaptation and resiliency. Indigenous and local knowledge is beginning to be recognized in broader adaptation methods, although more work is needed. We must ensure that this knowledge is not only considered in climate adaptation efforts at all levels of government but is done so equitably.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA352","Ambitious Coal Transition Pledge Not Fully Embraced at COP26","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 05, 2021( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com Yesterday, we highlighted[1] some of the developments on coal at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), including issuance of a 'Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement' committing to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally and pursue a transition to clean power generation. While a number of countries and organizations appeared to support the pledge, with many issuing their own statements on ending international coal financing and phasing out coal-fired power generation during COP26 's Energy Day, fewer than 80 countries and organizations have actually signed onto the statement's binding commitments (the 'Pledge'). Over the course of Energy Day, the COP26 parties amended through negotiation the four aspects of the Pledge (which we reported[2] on yesterday) in an effort to generate greater support. As we previously noted, the United States, China, India and Australia have not signed the Pledge, representing a major blow to its ultimate impact and efforts to meet the Paris Agreement's climate targets. Crucially, the signatories diluted the timeline for transitioning away from unabated coal power generation. Now, the Pledge aims to achieve this transition for 'major economies' in the 2030s (or as soon as possible thereafter), and for the rest of world in the 2040s (or as soon as possible thereafter). It is also worth noting that certain nations did not commit to all aspects of the Pledge, including Indonesia and the Philippines, which refused to endorse part 3 of the Pledge relating to the construction and financing (both domestically and internationally) of new unabated coal-fired power generation. In addition, nations have already communicated parameters around their ability to phase out unabated coal in line with the already vague timelines set out in part 2 of the Pledge. Poland, for instance, noted that it considers itself a developing nation and will phase out unabated coal by 2049, while Indonesia promised only to consider accelerating its phase-out of coal in the 2040s (ahead of its national net zero target of 2060), conditioned on the receipt of international financial and technical assistance. It is fair to say that ambitious statements at the beginning of Energy Day signaling that coal would be consigned to history as part of COP26 may not come to fruition for many years.

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA353","Fueling COP26","September 17, 2021","Jet Fuel Intelligence","Conventional jet fuel suppliers are keen to tout their environmental credentials by providing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for flights carrying delegates to the UN's COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow this November. European major BP revealed last week it had teamed up with UK flag carrier British Airways to fuel all BA flights from London\'e2\€  s Heathrow, City and Gatwick airports to Glasgow and Edinburgh for the duration of the Nov. 1-12 conference. \'e2\€  We want to help decarbonize the aviation industry and we will continue to collaborate with industry stakeholders and governments to explore viable options to help scale up sustainable aviation fuel more broadly,\'e2\€ says Air BP CEO Martin Thomsen. BP says the SAF supplied will offer up to 80% lower life-cycle carbon emissions than conventional fossil-based jet fuel. Vitol Aviation has already said it will supply SAF to Heathrow ahead of COP26 . The into-wing subsidiary of Swiss oil trader Vitol became the first company ever to supply SAF to London \'e2\€  s main airport ahead of the G7 meeting held in Cornwall back in June. \'e2\€  We wrote and ensured the new quality checks and regime, and proved proof of concept,\'e2\€ Vitol Aviation\'e2\€  s General Manager Toby Davies tells Energy Intelligence. \'e2\€  Once that is done then the whole route is easy to follow,\'e2\€ he adds. Both Vitol and BP will supply SAF made by Finland\'e2\€  s Neste at it\'e2\€  s Porvoo HEFA [hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids] facility. That is the only plant making commercial volumes of SAF in Europe despite a growing number of refinery conversions and project announcements. Vitol says its SAF is blended to meet global Jet A-1 aircraft fuel standards before it leaves the trader\'e2\€  s Ghent storage facility, then is shipped to Heathrow like any finished fuel. Current Jet A-1 rules allow up to 50% SAF in blends. Kerry Preston \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA354","National climate pledges at COP26 fail to deliver on Paris goals, analyses show","November 17, 2021","SNL Power Policy Week","COP26 activists dressed as world leaders sit on a raft in a Glasgow canal. Many climate action groups have taken to the streets in recent days to demand that government leaders make more progress.Source: Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images News via Getty Images The world's eight largest emitters account for nearly two-thirds of all greenhouse gases that humans spew into the atmosphere, and all those nations are falling short of meeting their net-zero emission pledges, climate researchers warned. A key goal of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, now in its second and final week, was to keep the global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels ""within reach."" The high-stakes summit was the first time nations would assess progress after signing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Importantly, countries were expected to arrive at COP26 with new carbon reduction goals for 2030 that would keep them on track to decarbonize by midcentury. But with only a few days left at the summit, concern is growing over the massive gap between what nations plan to do to slow emissions by 2030 and what is needed to keep warming within the 1.5-degree limit. Efforts by the top-emitting nations China, the U.S., India, the European Union, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil and Japan all range from ""insufficient"" to highly or critically insufficient, a new analysis by the Climate Action Tracker shows. A separate United Nations report released Nov. 9 concluded that even if official climate pledges known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, were implemented, warming by the end of the century could reach 2.7 degrees, far above the Paris targets. ""Not a single country has short-term policies in place to put itself on track toward its own net-zero target,"" said Niklas H\'f6hne with the NewClimate Institute, one of the organizations behind the Climate Action Tracker. ""We would in 2030 be emitting twice as much as we should if we want to [reach] 1.5 degrees."" A look at the pledges that the seven top-emitting nations and the 27-nation European Union made in the weeks and months leading up to COP26 makes clear why the climate breakthrough many hoped for may not materialize. Weak pledges, inconsistent policies Indonesia and Brazil submitted the same NDC climate pledge ahead of COP26 as they did in 2015, although Brazil's has effectively been weakened, according to Climate Action Tracker's analysis. Brazil in its update allowed for an increase in its base year emissions that it uses as a reference, meaning Brazil can continue to grow its emissions and still meet its targets. Russia's updated NDC did not show an increase in ambition and the country's net-zero goal for 2060 has not been formally adopted. India announced a long-awaited net-zero goal Nov. 1, saying it will decarbonize its economy by 2070 two decades later than what scientists say is needed to keep climate disruptions manageable. India has not yet submitted a new NDC. China, also with a 2060 net-zero goal but a relatively detailed NDC, continues to invest in coal generation as does Indonesia. Japan submitted a strengthened NDC that calls for a 46% reduction in emissions from 2013 levels by 2030, close to the 50% required to align the nation with the 1.5-degree goal. But Japan's plan to still get 19% of its power from coal plants in 2030 is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement goals, the Climate Action Tracker analysis said. The European Union's 27 nations this year adopted and financed its ambitious Green Deal, mandating a 55% emission reduction below 1990 levels by 2030. But many EU member states have been slow to implement these policies which means they may not meet that goal. Climate Action Tracker rated the EU ""insufficient."" The U.S. NDC, meanwhile, is hanging in the balance of Washington politics. It remains uncertain whether the Biden administration's ambitious climate agenda will be fully implemented and whether the world's second-largest emitter and top per-capita greenhouse gas producer will deliver on its pledge to the Paris treaty. Without actual policies to back announcements and promises, declaring progress at COP26 is premature, many researchers say. On Nov. 4, the International Energy Agency caused a stir when it projected that if all net-zero pledges were implemented and nations make good on a voluntary global methane pledge, global warming would be limited to 1.8 degrees C, approaching the Paris goal. ""Clearly we don't have the 2030 numbers in hand that get us where we need to go,"" said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute. ""Not even to 1.8 degrees, let alone 1.5."" \"

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA356","COP26: Hydrogen Gets a Boost From Glasgow Talks","November 9, 2021 Tuesday","International Oil Daily","Support for green and low-carbon hydrogen has strengthened in recent months with supporters advancing a raft of projects that aim to lay solid foundations for the nascent industry. The COP26 climate conference in Glasgow provided plenty of plenty of momentum , with multiple pledges and alliances unveiled there. An additional impetus came from the announcement of large-scale project proposals and production roadmaps from countries that plan to become major producers and exporters, including Australia and the United Arab Emirates. Producer Nations Last week, the UAE \'e2\€ the first country in the Middle East to set a 2050 net-zero target \'e2\€ announced plans to become a major producer and exporter of blue and green hydrogen, as outlined in its Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap. ""The UAE is well on its way to meet its ambition to be a global leader in low-carbon hydrogen with more than seven projects already under way, which will target 25% market share in key export markets, including Japan, South Korea, Germany and India,"" the country's energy ministry announced. Unleash the Catapult The Green Hydrogen Catapult (GHC) \'e2\€ a coalition of hydrogen industry players including Acwa Power, Iberdrola and Snam \'e2\€ announced plans at COP26 to finance and build 45 gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity for green hydrogen production. Finance should be secured by 2026 and some projects should be operational in 2027. When the GHC was launched in December 2020, the target was just 25 GW. Crucially, the GHC says this capacity should go a long way toward securing green hydrogen production at prices below $2 per kilogram. Recent numbers from the Hydrogen Council suggest more than 520 large-scale hydrogen projects are planned worldwide with cumulative capacity in excess of 90 GW, costing $160 billion. Hydrogen was also championed under the Breakthrough Agenda, with 40 world leaders from China, the US, India and the EU saying they would aim to deliver clean and affordable energy solutions by 2030. Key Role Green and low-carbon hydrogen is more expensive than current production of grey hydrogen using natural gas, a process that emits carbon. However, industry bodies see the greener version playing a key role in hard-to-abate or hard-to-electrify sectors once costs decline sufficiently to compete commercially. The Hydrogen Council\'e2\€  s recent report Hydrogen for Net Zero shows that hydrogen can provide the lowest-cost decarbonization solution for over a fifth of final energy demand by mid-century. The council says hydrogen could contribute a cumulative reduction of 80 gigatons of CO2 and is therefore essential to limit global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Over the next decade, global demand for renewable and low carbon hydrogen could grow by 50%, the council estimates. By 2030, this would translate into an annual CO2 emissions abatement equivalent to the total volume of CO2 emitted by the UK, France and Belgium combined. However, this would require a significant scaling-up of production, infrastructure and end-users, it adds. Strong Words Beyond hydrogen, various other low-carbon projects, alliances and pledges were highlighted at and around COP26 . The Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, headed by Bill Gates, aims to raise $3 billion in concessional capital to catalyze up to $30 billion of private sector investments to ""bring down clean technology costs and create markets for green products."" That money would flow to areas such as green hydrogen, direct air capture (DAC), long-duration energy storage and sustainable aviation fuel. Hydrogen could also be supported under the First Movers Coalition, made up of 25 major companies that want to help commercialize emerging clean technologies in hard-to-decarbonize sectors from steel and trucking to concrete and chemicals. At a recent TED talk just days before COP26 , Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said Shell will investing some $1 billion in hydrogen production project at Rotterdam before it has a customer base to support it. Van Beurden said Shell is very confident that hydrogen will play a meaningful role in the energy transition and will go out and develop a customer base for it. Jason Eden \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA357","What is COP26? Here's what to know about the global climate summit","October 23, 2021 Saturday 6:00 AM GMT","Fastcompany.com","Over two weeks in November, world leaders and national negotiators will meet in Scotland to discuss what to do about climate change. It's a complex process that can be hard to make sense of from the outside, but it's how international law and institutions help solve problems that no single country can fix on its own. I worked for the United Nations for several years as a law and policy adviser and have been involved in international negotiations. Here's what's happening behind closed doors and why people are concerned that COP26 might not meet its goals. COP26 ? In 1992, countries agreed to an international treaty called HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-convention/history-of-the-convention#eq-1 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which sets ground rules and expectations for global cooperation on combating climate change. It was the first time the majority of nations formally recognized the HYPERLINK need to control greenhouse gas emissions , which cause global warming that drives climate change. That treaty has since been updated, including in 2015 when nations signed the HYPERLINK Paris Agreement . That agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and preferably to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F), HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ to avoid catastrophic climate change COP26 stands for the 26th Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC.

UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the report a HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362 ""code red for humanity."" Enough greenhouse gas emissions are already in the atmosphere, and they stay there long enough, that HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM even under the most ambitious scenario of countries quickly reducing their emissions, the world will experience rising temperatures through at least mid-century. However, there remains a narrow window of opportunity. If countries can cut global emissions to HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/more-companies-pledge-net-zero-emissions-to-fight-climate-change-but-what-does-that-really-mean-166547 net zero by 2050, that could bring warming back to under 1.5 degrees C in the second half of the 21st century. How to get closer to that course is what leaders and negotiators are discussing. What happens at COP26 ? During the first days of the conference, around 120 heads of state, like U.S. President Joe Biden, and their representatives will gather to demonstrate their political commitment to slowing climate change. Once the heads of state depart, country delegations, often led by ministers of environment, engage in days of negotiations, events, and exchanges HYPERLINK https://gizmodo.com/your-guide-to-cop26-the-world-s-most-important-climate-1847845039 to adopt their positions, make new pledges, and join new initiatives . These interactions are based on months of prior discussions, policy papers, and proposals prepared by groups of states, UN staff, and other experts. Nongovernmental organizations and business leaders also attend the conference, and HYPERLINK https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainability/cop26/what-is-cop26 COP26 has a public side with sessions focused on topics, such as the impact of climate change on small island states, forests or agriculture, as well as exhibitions, and other events. The meeting ends with an outcome text that all countries agree to. Guterres HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1053561 publicly expressed disappointment HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/27/cop26-climate-talks-will-not-fulfil-aims-of-paris-agreement-key-players-warn signs of trouble heading into COP26 . COP26 Countries are required under the Paris Agreement to update their national climate action plans every five years, including at COP26 . This year, they're expected to have ambitious targets through 2030. These are known as HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs nationally determined contributions, or NDCs . The Paris Agreement requires countries to report their NDCs, but it allows them leeway in determining how they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The initial HYPERLINK set of emission reduction targets in 2015 was far too weak to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One key goal of COP26 is to ratchet up these targets to reach HYPERLINK net zero carbon emissions Another aim of COP26 is HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/finance/ to increase climate finance HYPERLINK whose people bear the largest burden HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094762 $100 billion a year HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/statement-from-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-on-climate-finance-in-2019.htm a goal that has not been reached HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-seeks-double-climate-change-aid-developing-nations-biden-2021-09-21/ U.S. , U.K., and HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-pledges-extra-4-billion-euros-international-climate-finance-2021-09-15/ EU , among the largest historic greenhouse emitters, are increasing their financial commitments, and banks, businesses, insurers, and private investors are being asked to do more.

The press has run too many 'hopey-changey' stories about COP26 , or alternatively, stories that are correctly critical but typically focus on some particular shortcomings, like the US taking actions right after the conference that are at odds with the pledges made. This article is a more comprehensive account of how COP26 came up short. By Reynard Loki, a writing fellow at the Independent Media Institute[5], where he serves as the editor and chief correspondent for Earth | Food | Life[6]. He previously served as the environment, food and animal rights editor at AlterNet and as a reporter for Justmeans/3BL Media covering sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Produced by Earth | Food | Life[7], a project of the Independent Media Institute After more than two weeks of negotiations during the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, diplomats from almost 200 nations finally agreed on two major points: ramp up the fight against climate change and help at-risk countries prepare. Specifically, governments agreed to meet again[8] next in 2022 with more robust plans to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent by 2030[9], significantly reduce emissions of methane (which has even more global warming potential than CO2), and nearly double the aid to poor countries to help them mitigate the effects of climate change. Notably, nations agreed to initiate reductions in coal-fired power and to begin slashing government subsidies on other fossil fuels, representing the first time a COP text mentioned coal and fossil fuels. Alok Sharma, COP26 's chief organizer, called[10] the Glasgow Climate Pact £ fragile win.' Acknowledging the deal is imperfect, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry registered his support. 'You can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and this is good. This is a powerful statement,' he said[11]. 'We in the United States are really excited by the fact that this raises ambition on a global basis.' And while the agreement represents a step forward, it has been roundly criticized by scientists, climate activists and representatives from small, poorer nations who will feel the brunt of the climate impacts much sooner than big, richer ones. Shauna Aminath, environment minister of the Maldives, denounced[12] the final COP26 deal as 'not in line with the urgency and scale required.' The Maldives has supported life and human civilization for millennia, but 80 percent of the archipelago of low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean is poised to be uninhabitable by 2050[13] due to rising sea levels caused by global warming. 'What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time,' Aminath said[14]. 'It will be too late for the Maldives.' ' COP26 Long before the annual climate chinwag, there was an air of futility about what has been described as our 'last and best chance[16]' at securing a livable environment for future generations. How could there not be? The leaders of more[17] than 150 countries have been trying to lower humankind's global warming emissions since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) talks started more than a quarter-century ago. And since the first summit was held in 1995, global emissions have, instead, skyrocketed[18]. The summit's host, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson who joined activists in invoking the mantra 'keep 1.5 alive[19]' was unimpressed with his guests, saying[20] during the G20 summit (held in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 ) that all the world leaders' pledges without action were 'starting to sound hollow' and criticizing their weak commitments as 'drops in a rapidly warming ocean.' Science has put a deadline on us. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels a limit decided by the Paris agreement humankind must achieve 'net-zero' emissions (i.e., whatever amount we emit into the atmosphere, we must also remove) by 2050. But that target seems highly unlikely. Big polluting nations like the United States, China and Russia not only continue to burn fossil fuels at an alarming rate but also continue to drill for more oil. China the world's biggest emitter, responsible for more than a quarter of humanity's total emissions[21] and Russia have pushed[22] their own net-zero targets to 2060. India has pushed[23] it to 2070. That is kicking the climate can down the field, to be dealt with by future leaders. (A quick glance at a graphic created by the Economist[24] showing the quick and steep drop in emissions that China must undergo to achieve its own target underscores the magnitude, and perhaps folly, of winning the war against the climate crisis.) In the United States, a divided nation has ossified a gridlocked legislature that hasn't passed many game-changing climate laws. Much environmental protection has been exercised through executive actions, such as regulations imposed by federal agencies, which can be simply overturned by the next administration. When a Democrat is in the White House, environmental protection is higher on the priority list[25]. When a Republican is in the White House, it's more about protecting polluters[26]. The country lacks the necessary strong federal and state climate legislation to protect people and the environment from toxic, global-warming pollution, protect fenceline communities[27] (which are often poor communities of color and Indigenous communities) and hold polluters to account. One of the bright spots of the summit was a landmark $19 billion agreement[28] between more than 100 nations together responsible for about 85 percent of the world's forests to end deforestation by 2030. Healthy, intact forests are critical in the climate fight as they prevent around one-third[29] of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. But in a press statement, Dan Zarin, the executive director of forests and climate change at Wildlife Conservation Society, said[30] that the Glasgow Climate Pact 'does not mean that the world has solved the climate crisis.' He pointed out that even if all the participating nations' pledges to reduce emissions (known as 'nationally determined contributions' or 'NDCs') were achieved, the world would not hit the 45 percent reduction needed by 2030 to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In the Glasgow Climate Pact, countries only agreed to strengthen their NDCs by the end of 2022. President Joe Biden, who attended the summit, hailed the forest agreement, which aims to restore almost 500 million acres of ecosystems, including forests, by 2030. 'We're going to work to ensure markets recognize the true economic value of natural carbon sinks and motivate governments, landowners and stakeholders to prioritize conservation,' said[31] Biden, adding that the plan will 'help the world deliver on our shared goal of halting natural forest loss.' But activists were less enthused. The forest agreement 'is one of those oft repeated attempts to make us believe that deforestation can be stopped and forest can be conserved by pushing billions of dollars into the land and territories of the Indigenous Peoples,' said[32] Souparna Lahiri of the Global Forest Coalition, an international coalition of NGOs and Indigenous Peoples' organizations defending the rights of forest peoples. '[R]eferences to the rights of Indigenous peoples are relatively weak' in the Glasgow text, said[33] Jennifer Tauli Corpuz, a lawyer from the Igorot people in the Philippines and chief policy lead at Nia Tero, a nonprofit advocacy group for Indigenous peoples. Specifically, she said that '[w]e will have to watch closely the implementation of [ COP26 's] new carbon scheme,' referring to the finalization of rules that will manage the creation of the international carbon market, and were part of the 2015 Paris climate accord. In addition to the lack of Indigenous representation in the final text of the Glasgow Climate Pact, people from poorer island nations that are most susceptible to the impacts of sea level rise were also underrepresented at the talks, mainly due to COVID-19 restrictions. Just three out of 14 climate-vulnerable Pacific island states[34] were able to send delegates to COP26 , while the fossil fuel industry sent more than 500[35] delegates. Ultimately, the climate pledges made by nations do not match the climate policies[36] of those nations. And since the pledges are non-binding, there is no legal stimulus to ensure that actual policies line up with those pledges. 'The NDCs are voluntary measures,' said[37] Lakshman Guruswamy, an expert in international environmental law at the University of Colorado-Boulder. 'There's no way of implementing, imposing, or trying to enforce a non-binding agreement.' No penalties, no legal ramifications, no climate court, no climate police. All people have is civil society. It's up to us 'regular people' to stand up, speak up and mobilize; to inspire care for the climate and the environment in young people; and to rethink and retool our own personal behaviors to be in line with the ultimate goals we have for the future. There can be no significant change without both the political will behind candidates who will fight against climate change and public pressure to hold elected officials to their word. What many engaged citizens in the U.S. don't realize is that it's not enough to participate only once every four years by voting in presidential elections. Real change happens when people take an active role in their local communities. It starts at home, with our families, our friends and our neighbors. Make no mistake: Our personal decisions as consumers play a decisive role in the state of the global climate. 'While large oil companies like ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, we consumers are complicit,' writes[38] Renee Cho, a staff writer for the Columbia Climate School. 'We demand the products and energy made from the fossil fuels they provide. One scientist found that 90 percent[39]of fossil fuel companies' emissions are a result of the products made from fossil fuels.' Sadly, according to a recent poll, even though a majority of people believe that climate change is a serious issue, few are actually willing to change their lifestyles to help save the environment. 'Citizens are undeniably concerned by the state of the planet, but these findings raise doubts regarding their level of commitment to preserving it,' according to the survey[40] of 10 countries, which included the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. 'Rather than translating into a greater willingness to change their habits, citizens' concerns are particularly focused on their negative assessment of governments' efforts The widespread awareness of the importance of the climate crisis illustrated in this study has yet to be coupled with a proportionate willingness to act.' Even if consumers become more willing to adapt their behaviors to make them more climate-friendly, they are not necessarily knowledgeable as to how to make those changes. '[I]ndividual consumers are not capable of identifying the behavior changes that are really worth doing to help the climate,' writes[41] John Th\'f8gersen, an economic psychologist at Aarhus University, in the journal Behavioral Sciences. Emmanuel Rivire, director of international polling at Kantar Public, which ran the 10-country survey to coincide with COP26 , said[42] the poll results contained £ double lesson for governments.' First, they must 'measure up to people's expectations [b]ut they also have to persuade people not of the reality of the climate crisis that's done but of what the solutions are, and of how we can fairly share responsibility for them.'

"COP26","USA","COP26_USA359","COP26 President Alok Sharma Urges G20 Leaders to 'Step Up' Climate Commitments","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Oct 14, 2021( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com At the end of the month, world leaders will gather for the most critical climate conference of our generation. This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow decides the future of emissions and international cooperation on climate, but some questions remain: Who will commit? And with everything at stake, will it be enough? COP26 President Alok Sharmadelivered a speech[1]from Paris on Tuesday, reiterating the importance of keeping our global temperature rise within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit set by the Paris climate agreement and calling out certain countries for their lack of commitments. The appointed leader of COP26 sets the agenda ahead of the talks, heading negotiations while prioritizing the conference's predetermined goals. This year, Sharma has a crucial message for G20 countries: The world's richest nations 'must honor the promises made here in Paris six years ago.' 'Temperatures have risen at least 1.1 above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather is on the march around the world,' said Sharma, citing the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'Code Red' report[2]from August. 'This summer we've seen devastating flooding in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America, record temperatures across the globe, and what some have called the world's first climate-induced famine in Madagascar.' Sharma, a British member of parliament and minister of state at the Cabinet Office, highlighted the countries that have renewed and increased their commitments to reducing emissions, usingrecent net zero target declarations[3]from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as examples. He then went on to point out the lack of effort coming from G20 countries, 'which account for around 80% of global emissions.' 'Under the G20 climate and energy ministers meeting in July, every G20 country agreed to set out ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets before COP26 ,' said Sharma. 'The UK, France, Italy, Germany, the EU, Canada, the US, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, and South Africa have done so. Now the rest must deliver.' The G20 countries missing from the list of those that have renewed commitments include Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. ""So I say to those G20 leaders, they simply must step up ahead of COP26 ."" COP26 begins, G20 countries will meet in Rome for the Summit of the G20 Heads of State and Government on Oct. 30 and 31. The COP26 Currently, the Australian government is under pressure to increase its goal of cutting pollution, according to theSydney Morning Herald[5]. Sharma is hoping that through its participation in COP26 , Australia can commit to a larger pledge toward net zero. The country is one of the world's top exporters of coal, second only toIndonesia[6]. On sustainability and clean living, Sharma urged world leaders to leave coal power in the past, shift toward electric vehicles, end deforestation, and cut methane emissions. 'We recognize that these can be complex transitions for countries, which comes as we face global gas supply challenges,' he said. 'Yet volatile prices underscore the importance of countries accelerating their move toward more clean, renewable power.' Sharma also spoke onChina's new coal financing policies[7], which pledges a halt to building foreign-based coal plants, and he urged G20 leaders to target rampant coal use at home. 'We need a system that accelerates progress, recognizing that whilst all countries must act, those with the greatest responsibility must do more.' We have a limited window of time to address global warming in order to prevent the currently predictedworst case scenario[8]. As time runs out before the highly anticipated COP26 climate conference ticks down, so do our chances of preempting the climate crisis before bearing irretrievable consequences. 'The point is, that at 1.1 degrees warming, the effects are already alarming,' said Sharma. According to the IPCC report, Earth's temperature is on track to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit, and without immediate action to reduce global warming emissions, we will see even moredevastating extreme weather events[9]. Sharma warned that even if the world reaches net zero tomorrow, governments must have plans in place to protect people, land, and vulnerable nations from the effects that human-caused climate change has already set in motion. Advocacy groups, environmental leaders, and climate activists have urged leaders to commit to climate financing for low-income nations ahead of COP26 . At the COP15 conference in 2009, the world's richest countries pledged$100 billion a year[10]to fund climate adaptation and sustainability for countries at risk of bearing the worst consequences of climate change. In his speech, Sharma urged the G20 to finally deliver on that promise. 'I hope that we will come together as a global community to help equip the most vulnerable to protect themselves from climate change,' he said. 'Success  or failure  of COP26 is in [world leaders'] hands; and so is the fate of the Paris agreement ... because since it was signed, the world has not done enough.'

A host of countries, cities and companies committed Nov. 10 to phasing out the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars and vans by 2040, and even earlier in some markets, in a declaration at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The pledge includes countries like the U.K. and Canada while corporate signatories include vehicle manufacturers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co., which will only sell zero-emission vehicles by 2035 or earlier. Yet, the world's largest carmaking economies, including China, the U.S., Japan and Germany, are absent from the commitment, as are major automakers Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Corp. Cities signing up include many from nations that are not signatories, including New York City, Los Angeles and Rome, which have pledged to shift to zero-emission fleets by 2035. Business fleet owners such as Uber Technologies Inc., IKEA AB and BT Group PLC will aim to make the switch by 2030 or earlier. ""The changes we have seen in the automotive industry would have looked remote when we took the [ COP26 Today, one in five car sales are made in countries with a phaseout date for polluting vehicles. ""There are clear signs that cars have turned a corner,"" Harrison said. Investors with large holdings in car manufacturers have also joined the pledge, promising proactive engagement and escalation of issues with the companies. Technology debate is over COP26 . Volvo has said it will not sell internal combustion engine vehicles after 2030. It is joined in the declaration by Ford, GM, Mercedes-Benz AG and Jaguar Land Rover Ltd., among others. According to Samuelsson, concerns over electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which remains a prohibiting factor to adoption for many drivers, are resolvable. ""I'm not too nervous about that,"" he said, adding that he expects supply to ramp up alongside increasing uptake of EVs. Rather, the CEO sees a need for progress in the primary energy supply that fleets will be drawing from. ""The primary energy needs to be fossil-free,"" he said. Instead, countries across the world, including the U.S. and Germany, are rolling out EVs while coal continues to play a key role in the power mix. ""We will also have to start thinking about the primary energy in the supply chain,"" Samuelsson added. Volvo is buying initial quantities of so-called green steel, made with the electrification of heat generation by Swedish steel firm SSAB AB. Green steel is picking up momentum as a hydrogen market takes shape, but the method remains in an expensive pioneering phase. Battery production will also need to be fossil-free, or else cars will build in more emissions through their supply chain than they avoid over their lifetime, Samuelsson noted. Equality in the transition Nigel Topping, the U.K.'s high-level champion for climate action at COP26 , said that polluting petrol and diesel cars phased out in developed nations ought not be exported, or ""dumped"" into poorer nations, shifting pollution and emissions overseas. \"
"COP26","USA","COP26_USA361","How Is Opec-Plus Navigating the COP26 Talks?","November 4, 2021 Thursday","International Oil Daily","Heading into COP26 climate talks this week, oil and gas producers had pointed to the current energy crisis to highlight the need for more upstream investment, long-term supply contracts and a more manageable pace for the energy transition. But senior leaders of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates were noticeably absent in Glasgow, even though all three major producers recently announced net-zero emissions targets. What is on the line for major producing countries at COP26 and how are they responding? What Is at Stake for Opec-Plus at COP26 ? COP26 talks. The announcements reflect an acknowledgment that the transition is coming and producers have a better chance of influencing its course if they are part of the conversation. Both countries will ensure that their output is low cost and low carbon. To build on their low-cost advantages, they are investing heavily in technologies such as methane leak reduction, CCS and blue hydrogen. Is the Threat to Producers Just an Economic One? Poorer producers such as Iraq and Nigeria see climate change as an existential threat. ""For Nigeria climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today,"" President Muhammadu Buhari told COP26 . Africa's largest oil producer has pledged to attain net zero by 2060 and is requesting help with financing to get there. Iraqi President Barham Salih stated that ""the economic and environmental impact of climate change is by far the most serious long-term threat facing the country."" Iraq is the fifth most vulnerable country in the world to changes in the climate, according to the UN Environment Program. Salih emphasized that desertification now affects 39% of Iraq's territory. The country's population is set to double by 2050, but Baghdad already struggles to supply power and drinking water. Tom Pepper \"

Drylands will suffer from disproportionate climate disasters despite their relatively insignificant greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to humid areas, according to the peer-reviewed paper ""Potential threats over drylands behind 2 degrees Celsius global warming target"" by Huang Jianping, a professor with northwest China's Lanzhou University, and his collaborators.

"COP22","China","COP22_China17","COP22 needs to deliver strong climate action","November 7, 2016 Monday","Global Times (China)","Illustration: Liu Rui/GTThings are moving quickly in the world of climate change policy. On Friday, less than a year after it was agreed, the Paris Climate Agreement came into force, after it had been ratified by over 55 nations representing more than 55 percent of global emissions output. For a global agreement, brokered by the United Nations, the progress of the pact from agreement to coming into effect has been extraordinarily rapid. It took eight years for 1997's Kyoto Protocol to come into force - and then its first commitment period didn't start until 2008. Those were crucial years lost while countries bickered over who should bear responsibility and pay to mitigate and adapt to the effects of global climate change. Developing countries were excluded, and during the almost two decades since Kyoto, as many have transitioned to become middle-income economies, their emissions have risen greatly as developed countries have lessened. Emissions have also been flatlining or dropping in some countries, including the US - but this is not down to effective policymaking, rather to the effects of economic downturns and some businesses, such as the coal industry in both the US and China, shutting down production as mines are no longer economically viable.So the Conference of the Parties, or COP22, which starts in Marrakesh, Morocco on Monday, has a lot riding on it. Many details of the Paris Agreement still need to be ironed out before nations start implementing the measures necessary to contain global warming to a maximum of 2 C, preferably 1.5 C.Each country had to submit a plan of action to cut greenhouse gas emissions prior to COP21, but these are still voluntary, and climate scientists have said that these do not go nearly far enough - the world would still be on track for warming of at least 3 C, which would leave many vulnerable countries and regions at risk of catastrophic damage - not least small island states, Sub Saharan African nations already at risk because of drought, and densely populated coastal regions in many countries. Low-lying countries, such as Bangladesh, are in danger, but so are economic powerhouse regions of China, like Shanghai and the Pearl Delta region. The Marrakesh meeting coincides with 10th anniversary of the influential climate change report by British economist, Nicholas Stern. The 2006 Stern Report was an attempt to quantify the cost of unregulated global warming, and warned that mitigation taken before the world was on a track to climate change it could not get off would be cheaper than trying to adapt to the effects of climate change in the decades to come. But speaking to the Observer newspaper Sunday, Stern said that his report did not go far enough - he said he underplayed the dangers and should have been far stronger in his warnings than he was. The biggest problem for the delegates at COP22 is going to be wrangling over the mechanisms to reduce emissions in countries that desperately need to modernize their economies, but lack the means to pay for it. Who should pay for global warming caused by decades of emissions from developed countries? In the past, especially at the notorious Copenhagen meeting in 2009, this issue almost derailed the entire meeting. The problem of greenhouse gas emissions is transboundary - should China or India be blamed for all their emissions when developed nations have effectively outsourced many of their emissions by transferring ""dirty"" manufacturing processes overseas? Why should Big Oil get away with not paying for the damage their product does in countries far away from where oil is produced and even used? Oil companies just recently pledged a $1 billion fund to help mitigate against the cost of climate change - but this amount has been roundly criticized by climate scientists as being a mere drop in the ocean for these companies who make profits today from a product which will impact the world for generations to come. It must be remembered that gases emitted today have a strong lag time in the atmosphere - so even if strong action starts to take place after 2020, the world will not see any effect for decades.Finally, the result of the US election will undoubtedly be in the minds of delegates at Marrakesh. Donald Trump, who said climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China, has said he will row back on the Paris Agreement. New Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has questioned it too, even though his country is one which is already suffering from the effects of global warming in the increased intensity of typhoons and flooding.After the hard graft at Paris last year, it is concerning that the rise of populist politicians may derail what is a crucial agreement for the world. The COP22 meeting must not be sidetracked by climate change deniers, and must build on the rapid progress that has been made since Paris. It is after all, better to prevent than to clean up afterward.The author is a Global Times editor.

To help those who are most vulnerable to these hardships adapt to climate change, agreements regarding climate finance were also made in Paris.China is taking a lead in realizing the historic Paris Agreement, which has been now ratified by 119 parties. At the G20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, Beijing submitted its ratification document of the Paris Agreement to the UN.The Chinese government takes climate change seriously and has taken practical actions to fight it. In 2011, it started carbon trading pilot programs in seven provinces, exploring ways to reduce the cost of controlling greenhouse gas emissions via the market. Drawing on the experience of these pilots, China is building a national carbon trading scheme that covers all key industrial sectors, which is expected to be introduced in 2017.China is also running several low carbon demonstrations at provincial, city, industrial park and community levels. And the extensive low-carbon programs have contributed to its climate change response.For China, it is clear that economic growth and addressing climate change to achieve sustainable development can, will and must proceed hand-in-hand. Such an approach will make societies and countries, like China, only stronger and more resilient, or in other words: future-proof.Most notably, a great opportunity lies in carbon pricing as a critical instrument to unlock the public and the private capital needed for the transition to low-carbon technologies. Putting a meaningful price on carbon, for instance, will stimulate energy efficiency technology and make renewable energy more competitive.Our generation is pivotal: we have a moral duty to act on the science that is irrefutable. By putting a meaningful price on carbon, the current generation can take responsibility for its carbon footprint and anchor addressing climate change into our economic system.The unprecedented challenge of climate change is now recognized by central banks, too. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, recently called climate change a ""tragedy of the horizons"" because the impact of climate stretches beyond the traditional horizons of business and governments. From the perspective of international financial stability, an interest all countries share, he promotes addressing climate change with more urgency.The political momentum for carbon pricing is unparalleled. Along with China, about 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces are already implementing mechanisms to tax or trade carbon, or are planning to do so.This is why it is important for governments, businesses, universities and other parties to share the best practices, learning from each other to set definitions, to measure, to set targets and to report progress, to share the experience of working with carbon pricing and creating the most effective carbon-pricing system and policies. Several initiatives are emerging to facilitate such collaboration. It is noteworthy that more than 700 companies are considering an internal carbon price. Another 500 companies already have set an internal carbon price.While designing and implementing carbon-pricing systems and policies comes with many challenges, the stakes couldn't be higher. Accelerated implementation of a meaningful carbon price across the globe can turn the notion of ""tragedy of the commons"" into an ""opportunity of the commons"" and create low-carbon prosperity for all. It not only makes business sense: our children and generations to come will thank us for finally stepping up.Xie Zhenhua is China special representative for climate change affairs and vice chairman, committee of population, resources and environment, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Feike Sijbesma is CEO of Royal DSM and co-chairman Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition.\l"

"COP22","China","COP22_China21","Stop polluting the planet in name of development","February 22, 2017 Wednesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","Last November, the United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. Participants from all over the world came together to create a plan for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement.It was an important step forward, but the issue remains far more complex than most would care to admit.The global cooperation that has emerged lately is certainly welcome. But, while teamwork is critical to success, so is recognition of the distinct roles and responsibilities of governments in the industrialized and developing worlds.The industrialized countries have long produced massive amounts of emissions and other kinds of pollution, while consuming a huge share of the world\' s resources  including 90 percent of the world\' s water  all in the name of their own development. As a result, these countries now enjoy high standards of living and food security.The situation for developing countries is different. Not only have they contributed substantially less to climate change; they are also suffering its worst effects, including food shortages and the loss of livelihoods, brought about by increasingly extreme and frequent weather events like floods and droughts.  Africa is paying a particularly heavy price. Though the continent is responsible for only 4 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions, it is suffering more than any other continent from climate change, as rising temperatures, shifting seasons, and proliferating droughts deplete biodiversity, destroy ecosystems, and undermine security and stability. Already, Africa has ten million  climate refugees. If nothing is done, that figure will rise to almost 60 million in just three years.The industrialized countries have pledged to support their developing-country counterparts, like those in Africa, in their effort to steel themselves against climate change.But their promises are modest, relative to what is actually needed. Policymakers often tout  sustainable development, but lack clear answers for how to achieve it. In many cases  Donald Trump being the most notable example  they seem determined to do just the opposite.As it stands, economic power is being used as a political tool, wielded by leaders attempting to evade their global responsibilities. Trump has explicitly declared his intention to ignore the Paris agreement.But, as the Marrakesh declaration emphasizes, success in mitigating climate change will require political commitment at the highest level. Moreover, climate action must take into account the special needs and context of developing countries, especially the least-developed economies and those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.With this in mind, the declaration demands greater efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security, and meet the agriculture challenges posed by climate change. And it calls for greater support for climate projects, including through capacity building and technology transfer from developed to developing countries.Notwithstanding Trump\' s reluctance, many countries seem to recognize the imperative to act.

Though the rise in global temperature has been gradual, its consequences are often swift and disastrous. Earlier this year, the so-called ""coastal El Nino"" phenomenon, caused by unusually high sea temperatures, sparked torrential rains and floodings that claimed more than 100 lives in Peru, according to the National Emergency Operations Center. The disaster also left more than 155,000 people homeless, destroyed nearly 6,000 kilometers of roadways, and swept away 258 bridges. Reconstruction is estimated to cost 12 billion to 15 billion U.S. dollars, Peru's Minister of Defense Jorge Nieto said in early April. Successive natural disasters caused by extreme weathers followed fast on the heels of Peru, hitting Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay, before returning to lash Colombia again. A landslide in Colombia's southern city of Mocoa killed more than 300 people on April 1. Less than three weeks later, mudslides destroyed some 75 homes and killed at least 14 residents in Manizales, a town in west-central Colombia. ""Dramatic changes (in the environment) have accelerated phenomena associated with climate change that are lashing the region,"" Carlos Dario Ramirez, a biologist at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research, told Xinhua. ""Latin America has in recent years seen changes in the weather system that were previously controlled, but due to human intervention, phenomena such as El Nino and La Nina are increasingly affecting countries closest to the Pacific region,"" said Ramirez. ""Venezuela has experienced a problematic drought for nearly two years, from 2015 to 2016,"" he recalled, ""which damaged crops and wildlife,"" and led the government to explore ""what the vulnerabilities were in order to minimize the impact of climate change."" Venezuela also decided to pursue environment-friendly policies to move away from fossil fuels by promoting the use of solar and wind power. While countries need to take individual steps to mitigate the effects of extreme weathers on their populations, the problem of climate change requires a global effort, the experts agreed. Venezuelan climate analyst Cesar Eulogio Prieto said that ""since we are already feeling the effects of climate change, the issue has become a priority on the agenda of nearly every country in the world, as shown by the 2015 Paris agreement."" Reached at the United Nations climate change conference held in the French capital in 2015, the Paris agreement aims to prevent global warming, setting a temperature hike limit target. ""The topic is so important and urgent that in discussions on how to tackle it, the debate is not just about how to reduce its causes, but also how to prepare for its consequences,"" said Prieto. Cindy Fernandez, of Argentina's national meteorological service, believed that global warming is altering weather patterns. ""Climate change is affecting the whole world in different ways, and Argentina is no exception,"" she noted. ""In recent years, we have seen an increase in extreme rain incidents, so we can expect it to become increasingly more frequent,"" Fernandez said. Precipitation in Argentina has risen, ""not because there are more rainy days, but because it rains more each time. When it rains, we get more water than before,"" she explained. In the past few weeks, severe downpours have been reported in seven provinces, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of people and material damage. \l"

According to data covering the first 11 months of the year,temperatures spiked in the early months of 2016 because of a very strong El Nino event and remained well above the long-term average for the latter part of the year. Long-term indicators of human-caused climate change, including record carbon dioxide concentrations, and glacier melt, and low sea ice, continued. WMO will issue consolidated figures on 2016 global temperatures in early 2017. December data confirms WMO's assessment issued in November that 2016 will very likely be the hottest since records began in the mid 1880s. The WMO provisional statement on the climate in 2016, released for the United Nations Climate Change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, cited preliminary data (to the end of September) that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

One minister went as far as saying that this will be the first time an international meeting  sets out to build a new civilization. While the Paris climate talks focused on a single culminating deal, in Marrakesh they diverge into multiple strands of parallel talks on different aspects of making the Paris Agreement real.\~ These include setting out a rulebook for all countries to use in making their national climate plans, how we can\~ finance the green transition, how we will develop and coordinate valuable scientific research, how we will build capacity and skills to enable progress everywhere, and what we will do to help countries already suffering loss and damage. Finally, there are meetings on how we will measure, verify and report all the other stuff in order to make sure no one is cheating.Photo: Flickr via UNclimatechange.Given the complexity of the process, there is a danger that the talks may instead go down in memory as the  petty procedural talks, at which every step to realise the Paris Agreement got bogged down in a swamp of minor issues and vested interests.Some of the core Paris Agreement working groups are not getting as far as setting their own terms of reference, instead announcing that these or other essential groundwork discussions  will continue at the next meeting. \~ There are reports of slow progress in discussions on how to plan an effective  facilitative dialogue to ensure the 2018 COP achieves the intentions of the Paris Agreement \- a clear case of  talks about talks.

Optimists say that Trump will realise the pragmatic path to making America great again will be investment in greener infrastructure. Political analysts say that a US withdrawal will enable China to take greater leadership of global climate change processes. Pessimists are muttering in the corridors about Armageddon.Photo: Pixabay.Central to the achievement of the Paris Agreement are Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) setting out each country\' s plans to reduce greenhouse gasses. These were put forward by most countries before the Paris talks last year. Everyone accepts that these initial pledges are not enough; adding up to a level of warming dangerously above two degrees. Yet a year later, none of the representatives at COP22 are offering improvement, except for dear Argentina, which began a review process to upgrade its commitment right after Paris.In UN language, what we need is  enhanced ambition for reducing emissions, for adapting to the effects of climate change, and for providing funding to help the less-developed countries do both of these things.A key part of increasing ambition on climate action is the switch to renewable energy. The subject crops up in the majority of the official and side meetings where governments, regions and cities announce their targets for renewables. Scientists and economists are here explaining why the switch to renewables is not only vital, but can bring the benefit of growth and jobs.Global Climate March in Hong Kong.

When those of us from Hong Kong are asked what our city target is on renewables, we can only sigh with embarrassment and confess that our shiny modern city with its massive financial sector has a renewables target of one percent.We need to ratchet up ambition on emissions and efficiencies, and we do need to redesign the way the world designs, finances, builds, manufactures, travels and trades. Many experienced commentators, such as Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the landmark Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, say that we have a limited window of opportunity in the next few years,\~ while interest rates remain low, to take bold action on investment in new infrastructure to tackle climate change.The scientists and the economists are hammering the point that if we don\' t do more now, we will pay a huge cost of catching up later in terms of not only economic costs, but also social and humanitarian costs.John Sayer is a Director of Carbon Care Asia and a Hong Kong NGO representative at the COP 22 talks in Marrakesh.\l"

"COP22","China","COP22_China43","A shift toward climate leadership","December 9, 2016 Friday","China Daily European Edition","Amid global uncertainty about future US policy, China could set the pace for environmental action Implementation was the keyword for the 22nd Conference of Parties meeting (COP22), recently held in Marrakech, Morocco. In October, 113 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ratified the Paris Agreement, representing 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. Following this achievement, two urgent matters lie ahead: the development of elaborate and concrete road maps to achieve the goals set in the agreement and fulfilling what is left in the Kyoto Protocol. Marrakech was, without doubt, the beginning of the post-Paris era. Climate finance was under the spotlight during the conference, discussed widely across national pavilions and at side events. Deep concerns were shared by developing countries, especially the least developed and most vulnerable. Although developed countries promised at Copenhagen in 2009 to give annual aid of $100 billion (94 billion euros; 79 billion) from 2010 to 2020 to help developing countries cope with climate change, so far there is still an annual $40 to $70 billion gap to fill. Additionally, this is only the financing shortage within the Kyoto time frame. The world is facing an even bigger challenge when it comes to the Paris Agreement. Last year, before the Paris Conference, developed countries, led by the European Union and the United States, secretly formed a ""high ambition coalition"" with 79 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, but excluding China and India. The group emerged at the end of the conference to push for a legally binding plan to hold the global temperature increase to within 1.5 C by 2100, instead of the former agreed target of 2 C. The final version of the Paris Agreement, therefore, states ""pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels"". This plan serves the best interests of vulnerable countries. But the climate finance conundrum dragged the ambition down to earth at COP22, with the name ""Donald Trump"" contributing to the process. Noticeably, the landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the east. China was widely expected to play a leading role at , an expectation reinforced by the pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump's election. Over the years, China has indeed proactively helped other developing countries on climate change. From 2011, China has invested more than $1 billion to help African and vulnerable countries. In last year's US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change, China committed to establishing the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change Fund and to provide $3.1 billion in three years. This will finance programs including infrastructure construction, personnel training and capacity building in developing countries. At COP22, this commitment was strengthened again by Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, during the High-Level Forum on South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, which was the most important event in the China pavilion. During the forum, the COP22 president, UN officials and dozens of ministers from developing countries shared their views and visions on south-south cooperation and China's positive role in it. By incorporating climate change in south-south cooperation, China expanded the scope for foreign aid, which is widely recognized as an important strategy in every country's foreign policy portfolio. The poor and vulnerable countries cry for money, technology and expertise to adapt to climate change and develop a green economy. In this sense, conventional foreign aid targets such as poverty, health and education can be considered more broadly as climate change issues. Geopolitically, large powers compete for greater influence in global governance through foreign aid programs. The gap in climate financing therefore offers considerable opportunities for competitive donors to influence the climate agenda and international affairs more generally. In this potential competition, China has many advantages, including empathy for the need for economic development and the necessity of cooperation. This has resulted in China's ""assistance-plus investment"" foreign aid model. International opinion on China's foreign aid, however, is extremely polarized. Some argue that China's no ""strings attached"" approach is efficient and generates win-win outcomes. Others criticize this direct, economically-driven assistance as a form of neocolonialism. Unarguably, China's influence on less-developed countries has been growing rapidly, along with growing concern from the West. The reasons behind this come not only from concerns that China may undermine the democratic process of these countries but also, and more important, from the fear of losing advantages they earn from their own foreign aid programs. The elephant in the room at COP22 was the question, Does Trump fear losing these advantages? He claimed on the campaign trail that he would halt US funding for UN climate change programs, seemingly undermining US President Barack Obama's original commitment of $3 billion. What he will actually do once in office remains to be seen. Regardless, China is taking on a growing leadership role in global climate governance. It is inevitable that the shifting landscape toward China's leadership will put pressure on the US in terms of its global image and influence. The world can only hope that, as a self-proclaimed successful investor, Trump will come to agree with Obama that climate finance is ""a smart investment for us to make"".

New Zealand had joined countries at the 2016 UN climate change conference, COP22 (the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), in supporting to the Marrakech Proclamation, which highlighted the global momentum on tackling climate change, said Bennett. ""The COP22 ""It was also an opportunity to have fruitful discussions on issues important to New Zealand such as how to reduce emissions from agriculture and how to create high integrity international carbon markets,"" she said in a statement. ""New Zealand has a fair and ambitious target of reducing emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. I have several work streams in place which will help form an effective plan to meet that target."" New Zealand ratified the Paris Agreement, agreed in December last year, on Oct. 5. Earlier this month, the opposition Green Party said the government needed to ""real evidence"" of a plan to reduce New Zealand's emissions, which were up 19 percent since 2008. The international campaign group, Greenpeace, has called for a summer of action to highlight the government's ""sham plan"" on climate change, saying the country was forecast to meet 80 percent of its target by offsetting emissions in the international carbon market. \l"

As a matter of fact, China's development provides an enormous opportunity for Europe and both sides benefit from strong and stable bilateral ties. The European Union is China's biggest trading partner, and China is the EU's second biggest, following a dramatic increase in trade in recent years. Data from Chinese customs show that bilateral trade reached 2.94 trillion yuan (423.34 billion U.S. dollars) in the first 10 months of 2016, reaching a new high, and overcoming the global trade downturn. China and Europe should also work closer together in global governance issues, with climate change as a primary example. China and the EU played key roles as brokers of the COP21 Climate Agreement in Paris, and were urged to work even more closely for COP22 in Marrakech. With the Paris Agreement having entered into force, China and the EU will need to trust each other more than ever to help ensure that these critical measures are being implemented fully and correctly. In all global issues, China is a partner to the European Union, a sign of the friendship and mutual trust built over the 42 years since diplomatic relations were formally established in 1975. Strong bilateral ties need these twin guarantees to ensure that different political systems and different cultures can still find common ground. International relations are not a zero-sum game, as China has repeatedly shown in its partnerships with Europe. Through strong bilateral ties, China seeks a relationship with the European Union that promotes win-win development and mutually benefiting cooperation. Senior European politicians should be cautious about the statements they make, and safeguard the long-term and steady development of China-EU relations. Biased views will do no good for such development. \l"

Freshwater fish have also been affected, and the impact of global climate change has mostly been negative,"" Corlett said.No ecosystem on Earth has been unaffected. For example, several commercial fish species have shrunk in the past 40 years, while some fruits, such as apples and peaches, which need cold winter temperatures, have also been affected.In addition to reducing agricultural yields, rising temperatures have also affected people, as pest and disease outbreaks have increased.The research results were published in the journal Science on Friday, describing the future of humankind as ""unpredictable"".Political leaders across the world reached an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse emissions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.""The global commitments made at that meeting target a 2 degree Celsius rise in temperature, which is still dangerous,"" Corlett said.""While the first 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature took a century, the next will only take a few decades, so both the human and animal kingdoms will have less time to adjust.""Another 1 degree Celsius rise would result in large decreases in some sensitive natural ecosystems, such as coral reefs, and the extinction of many species, while others will move to cooler areas.""Climate change doesn't only affect temperatures. Changes in rainfall are more difficult to predict, but some places will get wetter and some drier. Sea levels will continue to rise and the oceans will become more acidic as they absorb carbon dioxide from the air. Heat waves will be more frequent and more deadly,"" Corlett said.The research conclusion was reached after studying hundreds of previously published scientific papers. The scientists identified a set of core ecological processes and assessed the already observed impacts of climate change on each one.""The research systematically evaluated the impact of climate change on different species on Earth.

But if electric cars are to make a significant difference to urban air quality, charging them with electricity produced by low-emission sources is crucial.As Formula E wants to play a key role in advancing the technology surrounding electric car ownership, not just the cars themselves, the decision was taken that charging the cars had to come from a sustainable source.Fiaformulae.ComRising Moroccan singleseater star Michael Benyahia will get his first taste of the FIA Formula E Championship when he gets behind the wheel for a street demonstration on Nov 10 ahead of the Marrakesh ePrix.

Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), hailed the momentum of strong support for climate action and sustainable development. Seventy heads of state and government attended the high-level segment of COP22 and the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1), an indication of ""irreversible momentum"" for climate action. Informal consultations over the text of outcome documents lasted well into Friday night, pushing the closing session into the wee hours of Saturday. Mamadou Honadia, head of the Burkina Faso delegation, told Xinhua that negotiators had been trying to bridge their differences over the fate of the so-called Adaptation Fund, which was set up under the Kyodo Protocol. Developing countries worried about the fate of the Adaptation Fund since the Kyodo Protocol will expire in 2020 and be replaced by the Paris Agreement, he said. ""The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to financing adaptation concrete projects,"" Honadia said. ""We don't want this fund to disappear."" Developing countries demand a change in the wording related to the fund in a draft decision to be adopted by the conference, Honadia revealed, adding that the document must make it clear that the Adaptation Fund ""shall"" serve the Paris Agreement. An explanatory note released earlier Friday by Mezouar said that the fund ""should"" serve the Paris deal. Developed countries and developing countries had also differed over when the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1) resume and over its agenda. Many developing countries that have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement, such as Burkina Faso, demand that CAM1 be ""suspended"" so that they could attend it as a signatory instead of as an observer, Honadia said. He said that developing countries hope CAM1 would have a balanced agenda and discuss all major issues under the Paris Agreement, including mitigation, adaption and technology transfer. The agenda under discussion mainly focuses on the implementation of nationally determined contributions and is thus in favor of developed countries, he added. The conference, which started on Nov. 7, brought together thousands of government officials as well as representatives from international organizations, the civil society and businesses. It aims to pave the way for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. \l"
"COP22","China","COP22_China63","Peatlands could help reduce carbon emissions","November 21, 2016 Monday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","WETLANDS, forests, and oceans absorb and store carbon, which makes them a vital asset for countries pursuing the Paris climate agreement\' s targets for reducing CO2 emissions. So how can we use them most effectively?The Paris accord was concluded by 196 governments last December, and came into force earlier this month. Now, its signatories are meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, for the annual United Nations . Several conference events specifically focus on how countries can use natural systems to meet their CO2-reduction targets.While the climate-change challenge is immense, so, too, is the opportunity to accelerate sustainable development and ensure a better future for everyone on the planet. Under the Paris agreement, governments have committed to reducing their carbon emissions drastically, in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The vast majority of signatory countries have already presented national action plans for achieving this goal, and these plans will become more ambitious over time.These Nationally Determined Contributions include renewable-energy targets and proposals for sustainable transportation, energy efficiency, and education. In addition, countries should consider adopting policies to manage natural capital better. The Paris agreement itself recognizes the important role that natural ecosystems play in limiting the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and governments should not neglect such powerful tools.Governments will need to take action to conserve existing ecosystems in people-friendly ways. This is particularly true of wetlands, which include all land areas that are covered with water, either seasonally or permanently.Peatlands are particularly important. Though they cover only 3 percent of the world\' s total surface area, they store twice as much carbon as all forests combined. Peatland soils are composed of carbon that has accumulated for thousands of years; and when peatlands are drained or burned, that carbon is released into the atmosphere. In fact, draining peatlands releases two times more carbon into the atmosphere than the aviation industry does.In 2015, fires raged across Indonesia\' s forested peatlands, raising concerns worldwide about how much carbon was being released into the atmosphere, to say nothing of the far-reaching health effects. Indonesia\' s government estimates that peatland fires and deforestation alone account for more than 60 percent of the country\' s total greenhouse-gas emissions.Conserving and restoring peatlands could significantly reduce global CO2 emissions, which is why, in 2015, the Nordic Council of Ministers announced a commitment to preserve the region\' s peatlands. Almost half of Nordic countries\' peatlands have been lost, and this ecosystem degradation contributes 25 percent of their total carbon emissions.The Paris agreement entered fully into force in less than a year. This indicates that there is global momentum for concrete action to address the causes of climate change, as well as its effects, such as the disastrous floods, water shortages, and droughts already afflicting many countries.That sense of urgency is not surprising. According to UN-Water, 90 percent of all natural hazards are water-related, and they will increase in frequency and intensity as climate change worsens. But natural systems can mitigate them: wetlands act as sponges that reduce flooding and delay the onset of droughts; and mangroves, salt marshes, and coral reefs all act as buffers that protect against storm surges. And wetlands, oceans, and forests do far more than just absorb and store carbon; they also provide fresh water, and are a food source for nearly three billion people.Martha Rojas-Urrego is Secretary-General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS STRATEGY Since 1997, when sustainable development was set as a national strategy, China has been stressing its crucial role both domestically and at world forums. Pursuing sustainable development is the fundamental solution to all kinds of global problems, the premier said, adding that as a responsible developing country, China is willing to join in relevant international efforts and continuously increase investment in South-South cooperation. SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION ""China plays a 'very important' role in promoting and consolidating South-South partnership,"" said Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), on Saturday. Cooperation among developing countries, with its great potential in managing climate change, is a main area of discussion at , to help developing economies come up with common responses to their pressing needs. Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said here Monday that China stands ready to continue contributing to global efforts in addressing climate change through South-South cooperation. China is willing to share its best practices, including in capacity-building, with other developing countries, Xie told the opening session of a forum on South-South cooperation. With 27 MoUs signed and many regional dialogues and exchanges, China has made considerable donations to other developing countries to help them address climate change issues according to their own requirements, Xie said. CHINA'S CONTRIBUTION Standing as an active contributor in the global climate campaign, China, itself still a developing country, now tops the world in conservation efforts and utilization of new and renewable energies. Since 2011, China has earmarked around 85 million U.S. dollars for low-carbon, energy-saving, capacity-building and other projects in developing countries. ""China becomes the largest investor for renewable energies across the world,"" said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. ""It shows the Chinese commitment towards climate change and tackling air pollution."" Earlier November, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Erik Solheim, hailed China's contribution to advancing the global green agenda, commending China for its ""robust leadership"" in advancing the December 2015 Paris Agreement. Signed during COP21, the Paris Agreement entered into force on Nov. 4, committing its 180 signatories to limiting global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. At the Paris climate summit in late 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated China's pledge to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent from the 2005 levels by 2030. On Monday in Marrakech, Xie, China's top climate change envoy, reaffirmed the country's plan to set up a 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) fund for South-South cooperation, to help establish low-carbon model parks, implement mitigation and adaption projects, and train personnel in developing countries. Laura Tuck, vice president for sustainable development of the World Bank, on Friday praised as ""impressive"" China's planned Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which will be worth 50 billion dollars, the largest in the world. China is the first developing country to set up a national carbon emissions trading market, based on its seven pilots that are running now. Xie Ji, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation to , said on Thursday that China has set up an ambitious target of reaching the peaking of CO2 emissions around the year 2030. ""Many cities promised they can reach their peaking before 2030, and a few cities are trying to achieve the target around 2020,"" Xie said, adding that many industries, especially energy intensive ones, were asked to cut CO2 emissions and try to reach the peaking around 2020. \l"

""However, it will be much easier to conceptualize\~if we warn that the number of hot nights in the city will surge in the near future.""Hot nights, by definition, refer to days with a minimum temperature of 28\'b0C or above.""Forty or fifty years ago, there were only three or four hot nights in summer on average, but now such nights are up more than 10-fold, with 30 to 40 such nights annually in recent years,"" the professor says.When the Hong Kong Observatory was first established in 1883, the set record of a severe rainstorm yielded only a few dozen millimeters in an hour. But now, we often hear something like 150 millimeters within an hour, Lau added.It is necessary to reduce emissions to alleviate climate change, he said, arguing that such initiative works like insurance.The 2015 United Nations was regarded as a historic turning point, as the participating 195 countries agreed by consensus to reduce their carbon output ""as soon as possible"".Lau says it can serve as a good start, but warned that even if every participant delivers on their promise, it is unlikely to keep global warming ""to well below 2 degrees Centigrade"".What also worries him is that Hong Kong is rather unprepared for coping with climate change.Outlining a series of potential problems associated with global warming, Lau warned that senior citizens and those with respiratory illnesses will suffer most amid rising temperatures.Also, there is the prospect of electricity black-outs as households and offices use air-conditioning for long hours, putting a huge strain on energy resources.In terms of public health, the city's healthcare system could come under stress due to epidemics caused by tropically active insects as they thrive in Hong Kong due to increased temperatures.Among other potential problems, Hong Kong may also need to brace for potential floods in the city's underground railway system and places in low-lying coastal areas.Lau says there is a lot that Hong Kong can do to safeguard its environment, an aspect that hasn't received enough care over the years.Citing an example, he pointed out that waste-sorting efforts have been too slow in the city and that many items that can be recycled are instead ending up at landfills.The society as a whole must develop greater environmental awareness, with each citizen making a conscious effort to go green in their daily lives, Lau said.Only through a concerted drive can we ensure a more sustainable future for our city, he said.This article appeared in the Hong Kong Economic Journal on Aug. 2.Translation by Darlie Yiu[Chinese version    ] \l"

"COP22","China","COP22_China68","US trumps developing world's climate deal","November 28, 2016 Monday","China Daily","The United Nationsclimate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, concluded on Nov 20 without making any substantial progress, because it was tasked with charting the course of implementing the climate deal reached in Paris in December 2015.Although the Paris agreement has been ratified by 105 countries at last count, including China and India, it is not fully in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol and many see it as rewarding the big defaulters who also happen to be, historically, the biggest polluters - the countries in the developed North.There are two categories of such countries: those that agreed, under the Kyoto Protocol, the principle of historical culpability and the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" to reduce emissions more deeply than developing countries, but reneged; and those that refused to ratify the protocol, led by the historically biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the United States.The Kyoto Protocol was based on the principle that since the developed countries emitted huge amounts of GHGs for more than a century during their industrialization and development drives, they should yield ""emission space"" to the developing countries. Consequently, it was further incumbent on them not only to undertake more stringent, and binding, emission cuts but also help developing countries to chart cleaner growth trajectories through financial aid and technology transfers.None of this happened on a scale significant enough to make the kind of impact necessary to arrest climate change. The US refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol: its position was that of classical climate change denier, with former US president George H.W. Bush saying the American way of life was not up for negotiation.The Paris climate agreement buried the Kyoto Protocol and the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" and placed all countries, irrespective of their historical contribution to GHG emission or level of development, in the same position of having to undertake binding reduction targets, even if, obviously, the depth of cuts were not envisaged to be matching. Critically, the cuts accepted by the Barack Obama administration, although Obama himself is a not climate change denier, were nowhere near the levels required to keep the temperature from rising 2 C above pre-industrial levels, which climate scientists say is just short of the tipping point. The US is vital to any climate treaty because in the absence of adequate action by it, cuts accepted by most countries of the global South (including China and India) won't cut the mustard.Perhaps the leaderships of the countries of the South should have done more to compel the developed world to fulfill its responsibilities. India is especially guilty of selling out.For years, successive Indian governments have been clear that the Kyoto Protocol framework should be the basis for the fight against climate change. It was clearly in assiduous pursuit of the ""special relationship"" with the US that the Indian government craved so desperately. While previous Indian governments resisted the urge to give in to the demands of the developed world, especially the US', this one has, literally, stooped to genuflect before Washington's interests.This is not to say that India should not take urgent steps to reduce emissions. The recent crisis in Delhi caused by extremely hazardous air quality, which almost shut down the city, is enough of a warning.Action, however, should be taken by countries of the South on their own terms, rather than under the pressure of developed countries. India has, in fact, been running an emissions-reduction program to meet voluntarily set targets, which will not hurt commitments to development and factor employment.Now that Donald Trump, who is a self-proclaimed climate change denier, has been elected US president, the climate deal is back in the mix. If Trump sticks to his known anti-climate change stance, the only option would be to go back to the Kyoto Protocol and hope the White House accepts its principles.The writer is a senior journalist based in India.

""I am looking forward to working together with you to expand China-U.S. cooperation in every field, at the bilateral, regional and global levels, on the basis of the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, with differences controlled in a constructive manner, so as to push China-U.S. relations further forward from a new starting point, benefiting the peoples of the two countries and other countries as well,"" Xi said. Russian President Vladimir Putin: Putin ""expressed his hope for joint work aimed at steering Russia-U.S. relations out of the crisis, as well as solving pressing issues on the international agenda and searching for efficient responses to global security challenges."" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: Ban encouraged the United States to stay true to its ""unity in diversity."" ""As a founding member of the United Nations and permanent member of the Security Council, the United States is an essential actor across the international agenda,"" he said, adding that ""now more than ever, we must mobilize around the principles and common values of the United Nations Charter."" European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker: ""Only by cooperating closely can the EU and the United States continue to make a difference when dealing with unprecedented challenges.""

They also agreed to speed up the implementation of initiatives that have already been identified or launched, not only by building on their own resources, but also by mobilizing multilateral and bilateral donors as well as non-state ones.

"COP22","China","COP22_China94","Commentary: Build on Marrakech momentum for global climate action","November 20, 2016 Sunday 1:32 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","As delegates attending the Marrakech United Nations climate conference leave for home, the global community should start working on bolder, faster steps right away, acting on the renewed determination displayed in this ""Rose City"" to save humankind from itself. All countries, both developing and especially developed ones, should seize and build on the ""irreversible"" and ""extraordinary"" momentum reflected at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP22) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 12th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP12), and the 1st session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1). A proclamation issued on Thursday in Marrakech demanded the ""highest political commitment"" to combating climate change, as ""a matter of urgent priority."" The United States, the largest developed economy, and China, the largest developing country, should take the lead in the fight against global warming. China, for its part, has steadily forged ahead with efforts in promoting a green, low-carbon economy at home and in helping fellow developing countries in the South tackling climate change. Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said the Chinese government considers it an inherent requirement under its own sustainable development to address climate change and shoulders its share of responsibility for the common destiny of the human race. China has set itself a binding target of 19 percent cut of CO2 emission per unit of GDP for the period of 2015-2020. China has launched the China Fund for South-South Cooperation on Climate Change, to establish low-carbon model parks, implement mitigation and adaption projects, and train personnel in developing countries. Many have expressed optimism that Trump would do the right thing after taking office inside the White House; others have warned of the dire consequences if he does not. In a speech in Marrakech, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned against making ""irrevocable choices"" for ""decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture."" ""No one has a right to make decisions that affect billions of people based on solely ideology or without proper input,"" Kerry said. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was among the most optimistic. ""I am sure that he will make a good, wise decision,"" Ban said, stressing that the Paris Agreement is advocated by ""not just a few countries"" but represents a ""wholehearted commitment by the whole world."" Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji, which takes over the presidency of UN climate change conference next year, asked Trump to make the right climate decisions to save the world from ""catastrophe."" ""A global scientific consensus is that it (global warming) is very real,"" Bainimarama said, inviting the U.S. president-elect to visit Fiji and to see for himself the effects of climate change. ""As the second biggest carbon emitter on earth, the United States must take responsibility for contributing to our collective response to this crisis and show leadership at this critical stage,"" Bainimarama said. In addition to uncertainties over future U.S. climate policy, another focal point in Marrakech was arrangements for financial support for global climate action, especially among delegates from developing countries. They were disappointed at developed countries' slowness and inadequacy in contributing to global climate action. A report on the progress of rich countries' commitment to provide an annual 100 billion U.S. dollars to developing countries before 2020 was rejected as not reflecting reality. ""There is reluctance to acknowledge that action needs to happen today, if not yesterday,"" Meena Raman, of Friends of the Earth Malaysia, told a press conference on Friday, accusing developed countries of dragging feet. ""There is an attempt here to introduce a report... which pretends to show that they are on track,"" she said. ""All of us know that they are not on track."" ""The numbers are being forged, the methodology is flawed, and the developed countries are way, way short,"" she said. Many called for immediate action rather than waiting until after 2020. ""The action before 2020 is absolutely crucial,"" said Dipti Bahatnagar, of Friends of the Earth International. ""Developed countries, the ones with the historical responsibility, need to have stronger targets on reducing emissions."" In his remarks at the closing plenary, Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, who serves as president of , said Marrakech has pushed the implementation of the Paris Agreement up a gear. Marrakech represents a landmark between the historic Paris Agreement and the way forward, he said. The world should work harder, faster on climate change, and make the Rose City the new start of a rosier future for this and future generations. \l"

This brief proclamation was issued to signal a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development. The conference, which opened on Nov. 7 to pave the way for the implementation of the landmark Paris Agreement, has been overshadowed by the unexpected win of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election.

BUMPY ROAD AHEAD TO RECONCILE YEMEN WARRING SIDES The internationally recognized government of Yemen has rejected a peace plan proposed by the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shortly after it turned down a UN-proposed peace roadmap. It is saying neither the U.S. nor UN plans can lay the groundwork for permanent peace or they may legitimize the Houthi-Saleh coup. Moreover, the two plans were not based on the Gulf Initiative, the outcomes of the national dialogue conference and the UNSC's resolution 2216, it says. The government's rejection of the US and UN plans is a sign of total confusion of all including foreign players, the US in particular. Observers argued that the US role toward Yemen is based on commitment to back the US biggest ally in the region, Saudi Arabia. Both countries are now seeking any peace deal before US president Barack Obama leaves office. CEASEFIRE GOES INTO EFFECT IN YEMEN A 48-hour ceasefire declared by Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen began on Saturday to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to besieged areas. The two-day ceasefire that began from 12:00 noon in Yemen's timing (09:00 GMT) will be automatically renewed if the Shiite Houthi fighters and supporters of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh adhere to it. The main purpose of the ceasefire is allowing humanitarian aid access to reach besieged areas including the southwestern province of Taiz, according to the Saudi-led military coalition. UN ""APPALLED"" BY ESCALATION OF BATTLES IN ALEPPO The UN said it was ""extremely appalled"" by the escalation in fighting in Syria, particularly in Aleppo. The statement on Saturday recounted instances of intensified violence, such as the raging conflict in the northern city of Aleppo, and the mortar shelling that targeted several residential areas in the capital Damascus. It said such attacks targeted civilians and infrastructures, calling on all warring parties to cease ""indiscriminate attacks.""

Erdogan slammed European Parliament (EP) President Martin Schulz for his remarks that the EU could impose sanctions on Turkey following its anti-terror arrests. In a televised speech, Erdogan cited to calls from some EU members states to stop membership negotiations with Turkey and said ""You are even too late. Make up your mind immediately,"" he said.

Ankara is concerned that Washington is trying to create a Kurdish entity along the Turkish border in northern Syria by using the IS as a tool. Many towns and villages originally captured by the IS in civil war-torn Syria and Iraq were later liberated by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) outlawed by Turkey or the People's Protection Units (YPG), seen by Ankara as PKK's Syrian offshoot.

As the landmark Paris Agreement entered into force on Friday, the upcoming COP22 in Morocco will focus on the ways to implement it and accelerate work on the rulebook and definable pathway for cohesive global climate action. After long-term vacancy, Lebanon has at last elected Michel Aoun as president on Monday, who vows to pursue a unified foreign policy which is seen as a stimulus to both domestic and regional stability. To counter economic recession, Egypt is gearing up to push the long-awaited economic reform and its central bank has floated the Egyptian pound and the government raised fuel prices in a package to curb budget deficit, push local production and boost foreign investments. For ground battles in the region, the Iraqi forces are digging graveyard for the resistant IS groups in Mosul. Heavy clashes are underway amid a major offensive to flush out the extremist Islamic State (IS) militants from their last stronghold in Iraq. While in Syria's Aleppo, the 10-hour truce that went into force on Friday has ended without achieving its goals of evacuating rebels and civilians from rebel-held areas. Rebels in Aleppo blocked the evacuation and vow to fight till the siege is broken.

China and the United States formally joined the Paris climate pact on Sept. 3, one day ahead of the G20 summit held in the eastern Chinese lake side city of Hangzhou. The deal marks a turning point in the united efforts to address global warming. ""China seems to be [...] setting an example by implementing steps to limit global warming,"" Douglas H. Paal, director of the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Xinhua. China, the world's second largest economy and a major emitter of greenhouse gases, signed the Paris Agreement at UN Headquarters in New York on April 22, which is also Earth Day. Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, acting for President Xi Jinping, signed the document and announced that China would ratify the pact before the G20 summit in Hangzhou. To fulfill its commitments, China will have to cut carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 percent, and peak its carbon emissions by 2030. These targets are reflected in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). Many agree that China's ratification of the Paris Agreement ahead of the G20 summit, as wells as the summit's outcomes, will also strengthen China's leadership in the area. Moreover, concrete actions by major powers, like China, will increase expectations for an early initiation of the pact, ahead of its original deadl"

The report, jointly released by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that these World Heritage sites are vulnerable to climate change, highlighting the urgency to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees Celsius, Haq said at a daily news briefing here. The World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report documented climate impacts including increasing temperatures, melting glaciers, rising seas, intensifying weather events, worsening droughts and longer wildfire seasons, at iconic tourism sites such as Venice, Stonehenge and the Galapagos Islands. It also covered other World Heritage sites such as South Africa's Cape Floral Kingdom; the port city of Cartagena, Colombia, and Shiretoko National Park in Japan. The report included a complete list of World Heritage sites that are at risk. ""World governments, the private sector and tourists all need to coordinate their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to protect the world's most treasured cultural and natural resources from the impact of tourism activities,"" said Elisa Tonda, head of UNEP's Responsible Industry and Value Chains Unit. ""Policies to decouple tourism from natural resource impacts, carbon emissions and environmental harm will engage a responsible private sector and promote change in tourists' behaviour to realize the sectors' potential in some of the world's most visited places,"" she said. Because World Heritage sites must have ""Outstanding Universal Value,"" the report recommended that the World Heritage Committee consider the risk of prospective sites becoming degraded by climate change before they add them to the list. In particular, the report underscored the urgent need to identify the World Heritage sites that are most vulnerable to climate change, and to implement policies and provide resources to increase resilience at those sites. Meanwhile, the report also urged increased global efforts to meet the Paris Agreement climate change pledges, in order to preserve World Heritage sites for future generations. On Dec. 12, 2015, after nearly two weeks of hard bargaining, climate negotiators of 196 parties to the UN conference on climate change in the French capital sealed the Paris Agreement, aiming to reverse the trend of temperature rises mainly caused by carbon emissions. Experts said that China helped resolve several thorny issues to bring about some key breakthroughs. On April 22, a total of 175 countries, including China, inked the Pairs Agreement on the first day of its opening for signature at UN Headquarters in New York, a new record in the United Nations' 70-year history. ""Globally, we need to better understand, monitor and address climate change threats to World Heritage sites,"" said Mechtild Rossler, the director of UNESCO's World Heritage Centre. ""As the report's findings underscore, achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to a level well below 2 degrees Celsius is vitally important to protecting our World Heritage for current and future generations."" In addition, the report also recommended engaging the tourism sector in efforts to manage and protect vulnerable sites in the face of climate change, and to educate visitors about climate threats. ""Climate change is affecting World Heritage sites across the globe,"" said Adam Markham, lead author of the report and deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. ""Some Easter Island statues are at risk of being lost to the sea because of coastal erosion. Many of the world's most important coral reefs, including in the islands of New Caledonia in the western Pacific, have suffered unprecedented coral bleaching linked to climate change this year. Climate change could eventually even cause some World Heritage sites to lose their status,"" he added. \l"

Trump has been piled up with heaps of requests and heavily loaded with hard-nut questions. For decades, the U.S. Mideast policies have resulted in massive chaos in the region, so Trump has to pay back as much. For examples, Iran urges Trump to review U.S. Mideast policies, Turkey demands extradition of Gulen for ""new page"" in bilateral ties, Egypt calls for more regional stability, Palestinians want independent statehood, while Israel appeals for stronger alliance. Meanwhile, the Gulf states are pinning hopes on the upcoming U.S. administration to pump up sagging economy out of the spiraling recession due to oil price slump. Even conflicting parties in Syria are pinning hopes on Trump for achieving their respective objectives. The political landscape in the region has still been painted in gloomy colors in the week, as bloody and sticky battles are still rattling the war-torn Iraq and Syria, trapping civilians there in bloody abyss of despairs and misery. In addition, the evasive situation in Yemen, Turkey's military offensive in northern Syria as well as new ground offensive in Syria's Raqqa added to the woes and tore apart fresh bleeding scars in the region. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said Wednesday that the upcoming U.S. administration should review its policies in the Middle East. The U.S. interference in regional countries' domestic affairs is a key factor which increased violence and extremism in the Middle East, Qasemi was quoted as saying by official IRNA news agency. The unstable situation of the Persian Gulf region, the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, along with the threat of terrorism necessitates an urgent review of U.S. policies, he added. SYRIA'S CONFLICTING PARTIES PIN DIFFERENT HOPES ON TRUMP The Syrian government and various opposition parties have expressed different opinions over the winning of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election, with each having different wishes from the new U.S. president. For the Syrian government, wishes were that the United States under Trump's administration could be an ""effective member"" in the battle on terrorism, as Damascus deems all armed insurgents and the political opposition supporting them as terrorists. Shaaban's cautious wishes came as several segments of the Syrian society, mainly those supporting President Assad, expressed relative reliefs with U.S. Republican Trump winning the U.S. presidential election. IRAN CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE NUKE DEAL VIOLATION Iranian officials have expressed concerns and anger over the remarks of the U.S. president-elect Donald Trump against Iran's nuclear deal during his campaign. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday urged the incoming administration of the United States to remain committed to the last year international agreement which put an end to Tehran's nuclear disputes. Zarif warned that Iran might consider ""other options"" in case any party involved in Iran's nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, fails to comply with its commitments. TRUMP'S WIN SPURS CONCERN OVER US WITHDRAWAL FROM CLIMATE DEAL Trump's win of the U.S. presidential election on Wednesday has triggered concerns by experts attending the climate change conference here over the U.S. possible pull-out from the Paris Agreement, with others still expecting the president-to-be would be more measured and responsible on the issue. Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), congratulated Donald Trump on his election, saying that the ongoing conference will continue to discuss and mobilize, in order to ""pursue progress already made with all parties, particularly with the new American administration."" He highlighted that climate change issue transcends politics and concerns the ""preservation of our livelihood, dignity and the only planet on which we all live,"" saying that all parties will respect their commitments and stay the course in this collective effort. CHINA BACKS COOPERATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE WITH ALL PARTIES China expects to push forward the existing cooperation on climate changes together with all parties including the United States, said Gou Haibo, deputy chief of Chinese delegation to COP22 in Marrakech of Morocco on Wednesday. Gou told reporters that international mechanism like Paris Agreement is a fruit of the trend in which green and low-carbon development dominates, benefiting general interests of all countries and the international community. China will uphold a development concept highlighting innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing, said Gou, underlining that China will act positively and forcefully in maintaining the international mechanism, promoting international cooperation, and combating climate change. He also voiced hope for China and the U.S. to work together in boosting China-U.S. relations so as to better benefit peoples around the world. WORLD NEEDS BINDING MEASURES TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE Delegates from around the world are gathering in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh for the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference. The main goal of the Marrakesh conference is how to implement the landmark Paris Agreement which sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 Celsius degrees. This will require a delicate balancing act and significant funds. Developed countries, which are already industrialized, have the historical responsibility to provide assistance to developing nations in finding greener alternatives to industrialization and progress. WHO URGES FOCUS ON HEALTH TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Friday for giving health a central priority in the Climate Change Conference (COP22), currently held in Morocco, and including it in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. According to a WHO statement, almost one quarter of the global burden of disease and approximately 12.6 million deaths each year are attributable to avoidable environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures and ultraviolet radiation. Health gains represent major social and economic benefits of environmental protection, and therefore should be put forward as key motivating forces for public support and political action, it said. IRAQI FORCES EXTEND GRIP IN IS STRONGHOLD IN MOSUL Iraqi security forces on Saturday extended their grip in Mosul after intense fighting with Islamic State (IS) group in several eastern districts of the city, a security source said. The army's armored vehicles and soldiers swept al-Salam district after fierce clashes with heavily armed small groups of IS militants. The commandos of the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) also seized the Arbajiyah district after intense street battles cleared the nearby district of Qadsiyah. The advance unleashed the most intense street battles against IS militants since the offensive to retake the city began more than three weeks ago. SYRIAN FORCES RECAPTURE KEY AREAS FROM IS IN ALEPPO The Syrian forces have fully recaptured two important areas fallen recently to the rebels during a wide-scale offensive in the country's northern province of Aleppo, state news agency SANA reported on Saturday. The Syrian forces backed by the Lebanese Hezbollah retook the suburbs of Dahyeit al-Assad and Menyan, which had been overrun by the rebels during a wide-scale offensive on government-controlled areas in western Aleppo late last month. With this achievement, the Syrian army has regained much of what it had lost to the rebels during their latest offensive. EGYPT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMY AFTER IMF LOAN APPROVAL There is an atmosphere of optimism about the Egyptian economy as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a 12 billion U.S. dollars loan to Egypt and Standard and Poor's has revised its sovereign credit outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable,"" Egyptian prime minister said at an economic conference on Saturday. The country resorted to the IMF loan to finance the budget deficit through a strict economic reform program including cutting fuel and energy subsidies that burden the country's budget. UAE SAYS OIL COULD BE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN 2017 The energy minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said here Tuesday the world could face a shortage in oil supply in 2017. The UAE minister, Suhail Al-Mazrouei, said there could be a sudden spike in crude prices triggered by excess demand in 2017, as lower crude prices in the previous years led to reduction in oil and gas exploration projects. ""We could soon be back to conditions like in 2013 when an excess demand affected the price of oil,"" Al-Mazrouei told panel discussion during the ongoing Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC). EGYPT COURT CONFIRMS NULL ISLANDS TRANSFER TO SAUDI Egypt's Administrative Court on Tuesday confirmed null and void the transfer of the two Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, official news agency MENA reported. The court ruled that the government should abide by its previous verdict not to place the two islands in the Saudi waters. The final verdict on the government's appeal will be announced on Dec. 5. On April 12, Egypt's Cabinet announced that the joint Egyptian-Saudi technical maritime border drawing showed that the islands of Tiran and Sanafir fall within the Saudi waters. Tuesday's court decision came while Saudi Arabia has informed Egypt on Monday that shipments of oil products of 23 billion U.S. aid deal have been halted indefinitely. THE WEEK AHEAD The climate conference in Morocco, expectations and responses over Trump's Mideast policies, battles in Mosul, Aleppo and Raqqa as well as Egypt's economic reform push, new government in Lebaon and situation in Yemen will remain focus of topics in the region in the week from Nov. 13-19.

This year, the G20 Leaders' Summit takes place in Hangzhou, China, in early September. With its membership spanning nations like China, India, Russia and the United States, as well as the EU, the group as a whole constitutes close to 85 percent of the global economy, and its decisions have potentially immense impact. The questions are, what can everyone agree on, and how can those decisions be carried forward?Off targetThe problem with the G20 in the past was that it often seemed to miss opportunities to address the most pressing issues at any one time. Discussion at the 2014 G20 Summit held in Brisbane, Australia, was restricted because of the unwillingness of the host nation's government to prioritize talk of climate change and the environment. This was a great pity because the United States and China, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference in Beijing a few weeks earlier, had just agreed to a major accord in which both sides would restrict their carbon emissions over the next two decades. The Brisbane summit also did little to prepare for the United Nations held in Paris the following year, which resulted, to the surprise of many, in a meaningful international agreement. In that respect, the Brisbane event missed a big opportunity.The pressure on this year's G20 to deliver something is heightened due to the number of pressing issues facing the world and their complexity. The United States is experiencing what looks to be its most contentious presidential election in recent history, with Republican nominee Donald Trump standing on a vehemently anti-globalist, protectionist platform. In Europe, the UK's decision in June to exit the EU has been ascribed by most experts to similar anti-globalist public anger elsewhere in an era of trade deals and opening of markets that have resulted in as many losers and winners. In France, the radical right-wing National Front, under Marie Le Pen, currently enjoys its highest ever position in the polls. In Austria, a rerun for the presidency (a largely ceremonial but hugely symbolic role) is likely to result in another extreme right-wing success.The revolt against globalization has spread across political systems, resulting in more-nationalistic and more-divided electorates and communities. Predicting where all this might lead proves very difficult. One thing is certain, though. Given the levels of anger and frustration, complacency is not an option.A catch-22 situationThis year's G20 Summit gives global leaders the chance, from the perspectives of their different economies and political systems, to think about the central paradox of the current age: People have never lived longer, enjoyed higher standards of living, or enjoyed better health than they do at present, yet levels of dissatisfaction are also sky-high.What can be done, however, when the very means to unlock more growth and stimulate more economic activity is also perceived by many as being the source of all their ills? Free Trade Agreements and trade deals are regarded with deeper and deeper suspicion, and protectionist sentiment is intensifying, despite the evidence from most economists that unless trade barriers are removed and access to markets is increased internationally, global GDP is likely to flatl"

Informal consultations have been extended into the night, forcing Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), to postpone his plan to leave the southern Moroccan city. Speaking at a plenary session of the conference, Mezouar reiterated his appeal to all related parties to accelerate their talks so that the annual climate conference can conclude on Friday as scheduled. ""The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to financing adaptation concrete projects,"" Honadia said. ""We don't want this fund to disappear."" Developing countries demand a change in the wording related to the fund in a draft decision to be adopted by the conference, Honadia revealed, adding that the document must make it clear that the Adaptation Fund ""shall"" serve the Paris Agreement. An explanatory note released earlier Friday by Mezouar says that the fund ""should"" serve the Paris deal. Developed countries and developing countries have also been in disagreement over when the first conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement (CAM1) will resume and its agenda. Many developing countries which have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement, such as Burkina Faso, demand that CAM1 be suspended so that they could attend it as a signatory instead of as an observer, Honadia said. The agenda under discussion mainly focuses on the implementation of nationally determined contributions and is thus in favor of developed countries, he added. ""If the text is not well balanced, taking into consideration developed countries' positions and developing countries' positions, it will really be difficult,"" Honadia said. The two-week conference has brought together thousands of government officials as well as representatives from international organizations, the civil society and businesses. It aims to pave the way for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The next UN climate conference, COP23, will be hosted in Bonn, Germany, but presided over by Fiji. On Friday, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama reiterated his appeal for U.S. president Donald Trump to abandon the view that global warming was a 'hoax"" and to take responsibility in combating climate change. ""A global scientific consensus is that it (global warming) is very real,"" Bainimarama said. ""We must act more decisively and avert catastrophe,"" he said, inviting the U.S. president-elect to visit Fiji and to see for himself the effects of climate change. ""We in the Pacific, in common with the whole world, look to America for its leadership and for its engagement and assistance on climate change,"" Bainimarama said. ""As the second biggest carbon emitter on earth, the United States must take responsibility for contributing to our collective response to this crisis and show leadership at this critical stage,"" Bainimarama said. On his campaign trail, Trump had said he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change and stop funding international climate actions. \l"

By adopting the Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to jointly take actions to limit global temperature rising well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to keep global warming under 1.5 degree Celsius. Details of how to implement the agreement, however, was left for further negotiations. ""The whole world is united in its commitment to the global goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, as well as to the means by which to achieve them,"" said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at the opening plenary of the new round of talks in Bonn, Germany. ""Now we must design the details of the path to the safe, prosperous, climate neutral future to which we all aspire,"" she said. When officials leave Bonn in May 26, they are expected to have in their mind clearer pictures of various issues, including regular reviews and ""ratchet up"" of countries' climate actions and transparency of developed countries' financial support to developing countries. Researches showed that even if all current climate action plans of countries were fully implemented, the world is on a path towards a temperature rising of about 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Figueres said she is confident that the pace of negotiations will be faster than in past years as countries now understand the threat of climate change and opportunities of transforming their economies. A proof is the record number of countries which have already signed and ratified the Paris Agreement. Currently, 177 nations have signed the pact, 16 among them have completed their domestic ratification procedures. However, analysts warned that old quarrels between the developed and developing countries might re-emerge despite an overall trend of collaboration. In a press conference later on Monday, the European Union's chief negotiator Elina Bardram reiterated that the EU will not revise its targets of reducing carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and at least 40 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, targets which some developing countries and environment activists said were too low as the bloc had already reduced its emissions by 19 percent by 2013. ""The EU's 2030 climate and energy framework is a very very ambitious policy,"" she argued. Financial support to developing countries is another hot topic of the negotiations. ""For our endeavors to be achieved, enhanced and adequate financial and technology support as well as capacity building must be provided to allow for effective action both pre-2020 and beyond,"" said ""G77+China"" in a joint statement. Salaheddine Mezouar, Morocco's Foreign Minister and incoming President of the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech told negotiators that he expected the annual climate summit in November to be an occasion when a road map for concrete and predictable provision of the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar would be prepared. ""If COP21 is a COP of commitment, our ambition is to ensure that COP22 becomes a COP of action,"" he said. \l"

The new FAO move came as a result of recognizing the disproportionate burden that climate change places on small island developing states (SIDS). The 1.5-million-U.S. dollar project -- funded through the Africa Solidarity Trust Fund -- will focus on a variety of activities to mitigate and adapt production to changing climate conditions, and make farming practices overall more efficient. Farmers in Cabo Verde, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Sao Tome and Principe, and Seychelles will benefit from training and knowledge exchanges on climate-smart food production, as well as ways to create viable market opportunities for nutritious food, the UN agency said. Among these climate-smart agriculture practices are the use of a range of easy-to-grow crops of high nutritional value that will make production more resilient to adverse conditions. Other initiatives focus on innovative ways to increase food production. These include the introduction of fish aggregation devices -- also known as fish magnets -- to attract more fish to catch areas and increase the availability of nutritious seafood in local markets. On the marketing side, the project includes activities to help smallholders identify opportunities to enter high-value niche markets through Fair Trade or Organic labelling, to ensure the project is sustainable.

To raise awareness of this crucial and pressing issue, Formula E joined forces with Julius Baer, Visa, DHL, Schaeffler, The Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and Mumm Champagne House to bring this spectacular event to life. The zero-emission racer was driven on the ice cap by adventurous race-winning Formula E driver, Lucas di Grassi.The Brazilian, who will be seeking to go one better than his runner-up position in the season two championship when the series returns with the HKT Hong Kong ePrix on Oct 9, performed a series of jaw-dropping runs on the ice cap, inside the Arctic circle to the north of Greenland.The stunning exhibition is a continuation of Formula E's commitment to showcasing how electric car technology can be a key part of a more sustainable future, and play a vital role in tackling climate change.Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag said: ""I have four children and the future of the planet depends on how we can control the effect that human life is having on the environment and the climate. That is why I think climate change is very important to address, to control, to face, and everyone can do something. We do something for motorsport, other people can do something from whatever they do in their lives.""Formula E vice-champion Lucas di Grassi said: ""It was such a beautiful, peaceful place. To come here and see how huge the ice cap is and how the effect of global warming is changing it, melting it, gives me a completely different understanding of what we are doing with Formula E and the importance of driving electric cars.""The event was only made possible by the cooperation of and assistance from the Greenland government and its desire to raise awareness of a need for action on climate change. In order to learn more about the effects of the melting ice cap, Formula E has teamed up with Southampton University in the UK, and during the trip a tracking beacon was placed upon an iceberg that had broken away from the ice sheet.This will help to advance research into the behavior of these ice sheets in the open ocean, and the tracking device will allow both climate scientists and the general public to understand more about the graceful journey they undertake as they return to the sea.HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco said: ""I fully support the bold and ambitious activity that Formula E has undertaken as a way of raising awareness of the effect climate change is having on the ice cap in Greenland. My Foundation recognizes the role that electric vehicles can play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and believes that Formula E can inspire a new generation of motorists and potential motorists to 'drive electric' and help in the fight against global warming through high-profile activations (sic) like this.""A special 48-minute documentary looking at every aspect of how the event was put together has been commissioned and will be premiered at the sustainable innovation forum COP22, which will take place in Marrakesh, Morocco on Nov 13 this year. Formula E will also be in the North African country at the same time for the inaugural Marrakesh ePrix.Formula E breaks new ground by running a car on the Arctic ice cap to raise awareness of the role that electric car technology can play in tackling climate change.Will Gray / For China Daily(China Daily 09/16/2016 page11) HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/90/147408834171.jpghttp://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/90/147408834171.jpg00221917e13e1945a3d048.jpg\l"

HFCs, which are one of the six main greenhouse gases, are commonly used in air conditioners and refrigeration systems worldwide.The amendment would be a boon for sustainable development, and could prevent the release of as much as 100-200 billion tons of climate-changing emissions by 2050. That would be enough to take the world a quarter of the way toward achieving the 2o Celsius global-warming target set by the December 2015 Paris climate agreement.The Montreal Protocol was established to repair the ozone layer, which protects all life on the planet from deadly levels of ultraviolet rays. So far, it has been a remarkable success, with nearly 100 ozone-destroying chemicals phased out over the past three decades. The ozone layer is healing and, according to the latest estimates, it could recover by 2065, saving trillions of dollars in global health-care and agriculture costs.Much of this improvement is thanks to HFCs, which are excellent ozone-friendly alternatives to older chlorofluorocarbons, which have been phased out.However, HFCs, some of which are 4,000 times more potent as greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide, are a disaster for climate change, and their use is still increasing annually by 10 percent.It thus makes sense to focus on HFCs in taking action on climate change. For starters, reducing them can yield economic benefits, owing to the significant energy-efficiency improvements afforded by newer air-conditioning and refrigeration systems.Just phasing in more efficient air-conditioning systems would be the emissions equivalent of retiring 2,500 medium-size peak power plants (power plants that come on-stream during periods of high demand, such as during the summer).In China, switching to climate-friendly refrigerants and boosting the energy efficiency of air conditioning and refrigeration could lead to the equivalent in emissions savings of eight Three Gorges hydroelectric dams. In India, the switch could be equal to two more of the Indian government\' s current National Solar Mission.Many countries already recognize these far-reaching benefits and are taking unilateral action to phase out HFCs.A strong HFCs agreement in Kigali would add momentum to these efforts and provide financial support for developing countries that want to move to newer technologies but currently can\' t afford it.In the private sector, retail giants such as Walmart, Nestle, and Tesco have joined the Consumer Goods Forum, a cooperative climate initiative, and agreed to phase out products with HFCs.The Kigali meeting is set to yield a strong HFCs amendment. However, some countries in especially hot parts of the world heavily worry that climate-friendly alternatives for their essential air conditioning may not function as well. Any agreement can account for those concerns through a temporary exemption for those countries, while others move ahead with newer systems to demonstrate their effectiveness.A warming planet is already having a devastating impact on some of the world\' s most vulnerable populations, and it will only continue to do so. Ultimately, all countries will have to find a way forward on reducing HFCs and climate change generally, through national action plans and emissions reductions agreed to under the 2015 Paris agreement. Frameworks established by sister agreements like the Montreal Protocol can help to do this.HFCs will also be a central topic at the next major UN climate change conference, COP22, which convenes in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November. We are confident that the governments preparing to meet in Kigali understand the need for a strong HFCs amendment, which would give momentum to other agenda items, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in Marrakesh.Patricia Espinosa is Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Last October, the Moroccan parliament passed a landmark bill banning the production, import, sale and distribution of plastic bags across the North African kingdom. The bill, which became law on July 1, is part of a larger environmentally conscious effort across the country to go green. Having engaged in large-scale renewable energy projects, Morocco has launched the more challenging task of warning Moroccans against the use of plastic bags, which take hundreds of years to degrade. The law seems timely since the kingdom is ranked as the largest consumer of plastic bags in Africa and the second in the world after the United States. Green campaigners say the country's consumers may need years to fully comply with the new law, the Moroccan Minister of Industry, however, clarified in a statement that there was going to be several alternatives made available in the wake of the ban, citing the use of paper and fabric. Morocco ranks alongside Costa Rica, Bhutan and Ethiopia as one of the world's greenest countries, a fact partially due to its ambitious goals to crackdown on carbon emissions.

Judging by Trump\' s campaign rhetoric, and by statements from his Republican allies, environmental protection in the US will be gutted in a frenzy of deregulation and inducements for domestic oil, coal, and gas producers.Environmentalists are assessing the potential damage and developing strategies to avoid an onslaught driven by the most extreme anti-sustainability forces that have ever controlled Capitol Hill. The list of possible victims is long and depressing. If worse comes to worst, America will become much less green, while dealing a crippling blow to international cooperation.At the recent climate conference meeting (COP 22) in Marrakesh, attention focused on the various ways a Trump administration might kill the climate agreement reached at COP 21 in Paris last year. Death could come by assassination, with Trump tearing up the agreement. Or it could come by starvation, with the US refusing to do or pay its share. Or it could be tortured to death, with the US asking everyone else to do more.  inRead invented by TeadsBut the simple fact is that we don\' t know what Trump will do, because he doesn\' t know, either. His administration\' s environmental policy is not carved in stone; it\' s written in water, which always seeks the fastest route to the lowest point. How deep the zealots and the coal lobby will be able to make that point depends partly on the barriers built by the rest of us.Mobilizing forcesThat means concentrating on mobilizing the forces that can strengthen the case for America to remain part of the global move toward environmental sustainability. This will not convince diehards in the new administration, but it may sustain more moderate forces.So, who is this  we that must now take action?First,  we are US state governments and legislatures, nongovernmental organizations, local communities and corporations. All need to galvanize Americans\' support for protecting local environments and contributing to global solutions.Second,  we are the international community: the almost 200 members of the United Nations that in 2015 adopted the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement. It is critically important that all UN members, whether big or small, insist that these global agreements still direct the world\' s actions, regardless of what Trump does.It must be abundantly clear to the incoming administration that the combined economic and environmental interest in pursuing the sustainability agenda will continue to push countries and companies alike in that direction.Bo Lidegaard, former editor-in-chief of the Danish daily Politiken, is the author, most recently, of  Countrymen.

This highlights the greater sense of urgency on the part of leaders of the major powers.However, the Japan Times sees no such sense of urgency in Japan's lawmakers or the government, and the Mainichi Shimbun has criticized the Japanese government for being slow to go through the necessary procedures to ratify the Paris agreement.Meanwhile, the Asahi Shimbun said that: ""Betting that the pact would take effect around 2018, the (Japanese) government apparently opted to wait and see the moves of big emitters before deciding on its response.""A new study published in Nature Geoscience showed that the typhoons that have slammed into the coasts of East and Southeast Asia have become more violent, increasing in intensity by between 12 percent and 15 percent over the last four decades thanks to an overall warming of ocean surface waters in the Northwest Pacific.Researchers have repeatedly warned that Pacific tropical cyclones and Atlantic hurricanes are likely to become more destructive. They call for preparing for future typhoons and reducing carbon dioxide emissions to curb warming.Japan's ratification delay is clearly the wrong bet.\l"
"COP22","China","COP22_China135","Roundup: Montreal Protocol amended in Kigali to phase down potent greenhouse gases","October 15, 2016 Saturday 1:17 PM EST","Xinhua General News Service","History has been made in the Rwandan capital Kigali as the world witnessed the amendment of Montreal Protocol to curb global warming hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) gases in largest climate breakthrough since Paris. HFCs substances, which are used mainly in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, have a global warming effect up to 15,000 times greater than carbon dioxide and are the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emission, according to climate change experts. A successful amendment to the protocol signifies the international community's commitment to practical action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement - limiting global warming to 2\'b0C, and the more ambitious target of 1.5\'b0C. After week-long intense negotiations, international leaders and ozone preservation and low carbon development experts from nearly 200 countries struck a landmark deal on Saturday. Rwanda hosted the high-level meeting of the 28th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol (MOP28) from October 8 to 14 at the Kigali Convention Centre with an aim of reaching a global agreement on an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of HFCs. The agreement represents a significant step forward in implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will legally enter into force next month. Speaking to reporters shortly after passing the Montreal protocol deal, Erik Solheim, said the success in Kigali on HFCs is enormously important move in fight against climate change. ""Last year in Paris, we promised to keep the world safe from the worst effects of climate change. Today, we are following through on that promise,"" said UN Environment chief Erik Solheim. ""This is about much more than the ozone layer and HFCs. It is a clear statement by all world leaders that the green transformation started in Paris is irreversible and unstoppable. It shows the best investments are those in clean, efficient technologies,"" he said. Under the agreement, reached after the five-day long grueling negotiation, the developed countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and west European nations, will reduce HFC use first, followed by China along with a large number of other developing countries. Vincent Biruta, Rwanda minister of natural resources who was also the president of the meeting, said that the Kigali amendment is no longer a dream but a reality and it go down in history that a major climate deal was sealed in Rwanda. ""Passing the Kigali Amendment is truly a success. It shows the world that meaningful action on climate change is possible and that we stand a real chance of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We have made history today and we should all be very proud,"" he noted. ""Your commitment to a prosperous future and your willingness to come to the table in the spirit of collaboration is not only the hallmark of the Montreal Protocol, but also the best of humanity."" The Kigali Amendment is the result of seven years of negotiation. Under the amendment, developed countries will start to phase down HFCs by 2019 while developing countries will freeze their levels of consumption in 2024, with some starting the freeze in 2028. The amendment comes just weeks before the 22nd Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 22) in Marrakesh. The adoption of the Kigali Amendment builds momentum for even greater success in Morocco. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), HFC emissions are growing at a rate of about 7 percent annually. If the current mix of HFCs is unchanged, increasing demand could result in HFC emissions of up to 8.8 gigatons of CO2 equivalent per year by 2050. Montreal Protocol is regarded as the world's most effective environmental treaty. It was first signed on September 16, 1987, and is widely considered to be one of the most-effective multilateral environment treaties ever negotiated. It's the only treaty in the United Nations system to which every country is a signatory. \l"
"COP22","China","COP22_China136","Time to Turn Words into Action","November 17, 2016 Thursday","Beijing Review","An interview detailing China's emission reduction efforts NO. 46 NOVEMBER 17, 2016COP21 President Segolene Royal (right) and Morocco's Foreign Affairs Minister Salaheddine Mezouar attend the opening ceremony of COP22 in Marrakech on November 7 (XINHUA)As the Marrakech climate change conference is being held in Morocco, Beijing Review reporter Deng Yaqing interviewed Zou Ji, Deputy Director of China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, on the implementation of the Paris agreement, China's emissions reduction efforts and what developed countries have done and will do to reduce emissions before 2020. Edited excerpts of the interview follow:Beijing Review: China's top climate change official, Xie Zhenhua, has referred to the Marrakech climate change conference as an opportunity to implement the Paris agreement and the pledges made by its signatories. What's your take on this?Zou Ji: I think implementation here has multiple meanings. First of all, countries should carry out the arrangements and the six factors mitigation, adaptation, capital, technology, nsparency and capacity building included in the Paris agreement. All contracting countries should respect and stick to the basic principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, the equality principle and the respective capabilities principle. These form the cornerstone of the Paris agreement, and all countries deem them [to constitute] a political consensus. These principles infiltrate every aspect of the Paris agreement, including the six factors. To fully carry out the principles, a lot of details should be decided, which is a major task of the Marrakech conference and undoubtedly an arduous process. Second, before the commitment period of the Paris agreement begins in 2020, countries should continue to carry out pledges made in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and other arrangements under the UNFCCC, such as the Bali Roadmap, by 2020. Efforts in fighting climate change should be unremitting. More specifically, the focus is how developed countries party to the Kyoto Protocol will realize their promises. As we have seen, the European Union (EU), a major contracting party, has put its promises made for the period before 2020 into reality. That's to say, the EU has lowered its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels, and it has the strength to exceed its promise. However, it's reluctant to boost its emission reduction ambition and raise its target. I once suggested to EU negotiators that they issue a declaration to boost their ambition, but they didn't accept it. In my view, developed countries should play a leading role in the war against climate change and enhance mutual trust between countries. They should leave no stone unturned to reduce emissions, rather than standing by after achieving their set goals.I'm not condemning the EU because it has fulfilled its promises before 2020 and set a good example for other developed countries. I mean, if it can show the willingness to exhaust its mission reduction capability, developing countries such as China and India would be better stimulated to fulfill their promises and stronger momentum would be generated. This applies to the United States as well. Developed countries should respect the promise they made in Copenhagen that $100 billion will be provided annually from 2020 [to enable] developing countries to build their emission reduction capabilities and cope with climate change. According to calculations by some experts from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), more than $60 billion has been raised to date. But, what we need to know is the method of accounting and where the money will go. For instance, if developed countries label existing poverty leviation funds as financial support to developing countries in dealing with climate change, the negotiations during previous climate change conferences will make no sense. Developed countries should acknowledge the figure and avoid double counting or masquerading. Making related details clear will improve transparency and strengthen mutual political trust. In addition,a concrete roadmap and timetable regarding the funding should be put in place. In other words, developed countries should let developing countries know how the funds are collected and what they plan to do in the coming two or three years. Since the ""concrete roadmap"" has been written into the Paris agreement, negotiators will work out approaches to implement it. In short, issues related to funding including the accounting method, roadmap and where the money comes from and goes to should be made clear, and this is the focus of the negotiations during the Marrakech conference. Xie has made it clear on more than one occasion that China will not vie with other developing countries and small island countries for the $100 billion in the Green Climate Fund. But that's not to say that China doesn't have the right to use this money.How will the global stock take mechanism be started?A key mechanism of the Paris agreement the global stock take is another focus of discussions at this conference. While countries submitted their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to the UNFCCC, the global stock take was created at the Paris conference. As some global climate change experts estimate, all of the INDCs currently submitted by countries would result in an average global temperature increase of around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, falling short of the 2-degree-Celsius goal. To bridge the gap, countrieshave agreed to assess their implementation strategies and take stock of their efforts' results every five years. The assessments will start from 2023, and after that, countries will have to reinforce their actions every five years. A facilitating dialogue will be launched in 2017, and at the Marrakech conference, representatives are exchanging views on this front on informal occasions. Negotiations are fraught with arguments, conflicts and contradictions. We should know how to seek common ground and move forward.The United States has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, and Canada has withdrawn from, and Japan is reluctant to join, the second commitment period. Will these developed countries change their attitudes at this conference?Countries party to the Kyoto Protocol have to realize their promises made under the framework of the protocol, while countries that didn't sign it, such as the United States, have to do what they have promised under the Bali Roadmap. Refusing to join the Kyoto Protocol doesn't mean these countries don't have to cut emissions. As contracting countries of the UNFCCC, they have to perform their duties and carry out their promises made in the Cancun Accord under the Bali Roadmap.According to China's Policies and Actions on Climate Change (2016), China has accomplished the set goals in terms of energy consumption intensity, carbon intensity and forest stock ahead of time. Do you think China will also achieve its INDCs in advance?The report primarily relates the achievements China made last year and during the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-15). INDCs are what a country will accomplish during the period from 2020 to 2030. The two are closely interrelated, because current performance will determine whether long-term goals can be smoothly achieved. How could China meet energy conservation and emission reduction targets in recent years? For one thing, the Chinese Government and people have devoted much attention and resources to improve the efficiency of energy consumption and cut coal use. For another, there's no denying that China's economy has entered a new normal in recent years, and declining economic growth in combination with overcapacity [reduction] has greatly alleviated the pressure on emission reduction. If we can manage to complete the goals set for the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20), China will see its carbon dioxide intensity decrease at least 49 percent from its 2005 level. This means China will outperform its promise of 45-percent decrease in the Cancun Accord and step closer toward its goal of 60-65 percent decrease before 2030. However, we should also take note of the future trajectory of energy consumption in some sectors. For now, the manufacturing and industrial sectors are major energy consumers, while in the future, construction and transportation may catch up and their energy consumption will rise. Therefore, we should pay close attention to these sectors as well.Copyedited by Chris SurteesComments to HYPERLINK mailto:dengyaqing@bjreview.comdengyaqing@bjreview.com\l"

After a legally binding climate deal was reached in Paris among nearly 200 nations last year, the world is now on the way to making the agreement become reality.The 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), formally known as the COP22, is taking place from November 7 to 18 in Marrakech, Morocco. ""It's the first climate change conference after the Paris agreement came into force, [so] it is deemed as a chance to put the unprecedented deal into practice,"" said Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs.First of all, efforts will be made to intensify actions fighting climate change before 2020. ""Although representatives struck a deal last year, the emissions targets laid out in the Kyoto Protocol Amendment have not yet been realized. While the Paris agreement prescribes actions that curb climate change after 2020, the Kyoto Protocol Amendment targets actions before 2020, and both of them are important,"" said Yang Fuqiang, a senior climate, energy and environment adviser to the China Program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a not-for-profit international environmental advocacy group.Besides that, representatives will make detailed arrangements and work out a timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the Paris agreement, gain knowledge about the status of all contracting countries' actions related to carrying out their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), and make plans to achieve green and low-carbon development. They will also confirm that the promises made by developed countries concerning necessary capital, technology and capacity-building support for developing countries will be realized.""At the Marrakech conference, it should be made clear how much money developed countries have provided to the Green Climate Fund, where the money has gone, and what results the spending has yielded,"" Xie said. The Green Climate Fund, created in 2010, is a financial mechanism within the framework of the UNFCCC to assist low-emission and climate-resilient development.Due to the limited time, a lot of topics weren't talked through in Paris, such as technology transfers, capacity building, mitigation and adaptation and financial support. In Marrakech, representatives will give more time to discussing these topics, according to Yang.An aerial photograph of a photovoltaic power plant in Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province (XINHUA)Aiming highThe Chinese Government attaches great significance to tackling climate change, said Xie, noting that the nation takes the issue as a great opportunity to accelerate the transformation of its economic development model and carry out economic restructuring.According to statistics from China's Policies and Actions on Climate Change (2016) report released on November 1, the country's carbon intensity was reduced by 20 percent during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15) period, outperforming the target of 17 percent; the share of non-fossil fuels in its primary energy consumption in 2015 reached 12 percent, above the target of 11.4 percent; and forest growing stock climbed to 15.14 billion square meters, surpassing the target to be achieved by 2020.Furthermore, in the first three quarters of 2016, China's energy consumption intensity and carbon intensity further dropped 5.2 percent and roughly 6 percent respectively, exceeding this year's annual targets of 3.4 percent and 3.9 percent.To score so highly in energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction, China has endeavored to optimize its industrial structure, enhance energy efficiency and improve its energy structure, Xie explained.According to the report, service industries now account for 52.8 percent of China's economy, up 1.6 percentage points year on year; the growth of hi-tech and strategic emerging industries outpaced that of industrial enterprises with principal business revenue of more than 20 million yuan ($2.95 million) a year by 4.6 and 4.8 percentage points respectively.""In energy conservation and energy efficiency improvement, the country has taken measures targeting the industrial sector, transportation and public facilities,"" Xie said.In addition to a series of projects featuring energy conservation and emissions reduction, China has also enhanced relevant economic policies such as improving the low-carbon pricing mechanism, finalizing the financial and taxation incentive mechanism, and developing green finance.""Considering the current strong momentum, the chance is strong for China to realize the pledges made in its INDCs for 2030. Most experts in the energy realm believe the country can even fulfill the targets in its INDCs in 2025 or earlier,"" Yang said.By September, a total of 120 million tons of carbon dioxide, worth more than 3.2 billion yuan ($473 million), had been traded in China's seven pilot carbon-trading markets. In addition, the Chinese Government had contributed 580 million yuan ($86 million) to provide small island states, least developed countries and some African nations with material assistance, launched 10 low-carbon demonstration areas and 100 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and trained 1,000 experts and officials from other developing countries in tackling climate change.""Predating the Paris agreement, China issued an array of joint announcements with the United States, France, the EU, India and Brazil, which allowed it to reach consensus with major countries on divergent points and find solutions,"" said Xie, who believes those efforts facilitated the birth of the historic agreement.""Compared to the 2009 Copenhagen conference, preparations for the Paris conference were sufficient, and China's efforts in strengthening coordination and communication laid a foundation for the conclusion of the Paris agreement,"" said Li Shuo, Senior Climate and Energy Policy Officer for Greenpeace East Asia.Implementing the agreementThe Paris agreement comprises 29 items encompassing targets in finance and technology, capacity building, transparency, mitigation and adaptation. To shield the world from potential risks arising from climate change, the agreement requires countries to work together to limit the increase in average temperatures worldwide to levels no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius.""All participants in the Paris agreement have shown great sincerity and made great efforts. At the Marrakech conference, the main theme is how to carry it out and how to assess and measure the implementation,"" Li said.""While the world's largest developing country can surely realize the promises it made for the period before 2020, some developed countries are reluctant to commit themselves to fight climate change before 2020. [This is demonstrated by] the United States' refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, as well as Canada's withdrawal and Japan's reluctance to join the protocol's second commitment period,"" Li said.At the 2009 Copenhagen conference, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 to the developing world. Despite continual urging by members of the international community, progress in keeping that promise has remained lackluster.According to a report released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the aggregate volume of public and private climate finance mobilized by developed countries for developing countries reached $62 billion in 2014, almost 20 percent more than the $52 billion provided in 2013.Developing countries need to decide whether this funding is in l"

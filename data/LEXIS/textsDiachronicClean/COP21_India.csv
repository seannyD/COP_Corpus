UN-Habitat took part in the summit.Beyond advocating immediate action and the empowerment of non-state actors, the summit paved the way for the adoption, during in Paris, of an ambitious and exhaustive global agreement on climate change. The focus was placed on the development of a new global climate agenda that also includes the participation of citizens, civil society groups, the private sector and local governments.It also pressed for pro-climate commitments at national and international levels, as well as the presentation of a strong and concerted message at the COP21.Most of the vital economic and social infrastructure, government facilities and assets are located in cities. When disaster strikes, these are at risk of collapse.Cities need to fully accept the inevitable effects of climate change and adapt, while, at the same time, curb and mitigate the causes of climate change,said Elkin Velasquez, UN-Habitat s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. The summit also addressed the articulation of climate change, resilience, risk reduction and water in regards to sustainable urban development.These considerations were organized in four themes: Cities and the new global climate agreement; Inclusive cities, resilient cities; Climate change and cultural change; and Climate Finance. UN-Habitat is currently active in 20 countries implementing climate change related programmes. Projects range from assistance to local authorities to improve systems aimed at climate proofing urban infrastructure to ensuring that climate change adaptation becomes a key component of infrastructure design and urban planning.\l"

Cities play a critical role in emissions, thus they must also become key actors in global efforts to bring down greenhouse gas emissions.With this sense of urgency, UN-Habitat launched the Guiding Principles for City Climate Action Planning at the Climate Change Conference COP-21 in Paris. The principles establish benchmarks for action planning in cities, based on international evidence and best-practices. The new UN-Habitat Guide is all about orienting cities towards concrete, comprehensive climate action. The Principles are designed as an instrument for cities to tangibly address climate change and provide effective city-level climate action planning tools stated Raf Tuts, Coordinator of the Urban Planning and Design Branch of UN-Habitat at the launch session.Representing the view of cities, the Mayor of La Paz, Luis A. Revilla H. expressed that efficient climate change planning has to include local authorities in decision making through strengthening the vertical integration. As the world was increasingly urbanized, the 21st century agenda would have to focus on greatly reduce vulnerabilities of people and infrastructure to the impacts of a changing climate.Manish Bapna, Executive Vice President of the World Resources Institution WRI pointed out that different cities need different solutions, these guidel"

"COP21","India","COP21_India5","International: Fingers Crossed on COP21","December 1, 2015","The DayAfter","21st annual session of United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris is unlikely to bring out binding and universal agreementFrom November 30 to December 11, the United NationsClimate Change Conference, COP21 is beginning in Paris. This will be the 21st annual session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 11) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The objective of the 2015 conference is to achieve, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world with an overarching goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase to 2C above pre-industrial levels. I have my clear doubts on whether a binding and universal agreement can emerge.The reasons for my cynicism are not one. The first point of contention arises from the differential impacts of climate change on the developing and the developed nations. Recently, a number of authors have opened up a whole new area of research by using the natural variations in temperature among different years caused by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which produces extreme weather conditions in different parts of the world. For instance, research by Solomon Hsiang and colleagues shows that for rich countries, an additional degree of warming has a nominal effect, but for poor countries, the same change leads to very significant costs in the form of reduced economic growth and increased costs of military and other conflicts.This is akin to what Thomas Homer-Dixon, cherished political scientist, talked of in the 1990s, when he hypothesized about the environmental scarcities leading to the violent conflicts, and the limited capacity of the poor nations to cope up with the problems, due to the ""ingenuity gap"", the critical gap between our need for ideas to solve complex problems and our actual supply of those ideas.The second point of contention is the concern of distributive justice. The concern begins with: who pays for damages? Most developing countries firmly believe that mitigation should start in the rich countries that bear the largest part of the responsibility for historical emissions. How can one deny the position that the developed world has grown by emitting, whereas the developing and poor world are still on the learning curve? Can one deny the position that only after historically emitting CO2 extensively they have started talking of the perils of the planet, and want the developing world to share parts of the responsibility for the follies committed by them? The very suggestion that all countries should reduce their emissions by similar percentages clearly favors the countries that have large emissions today. Therefore, the calls that the developed nations should compensate the developing nations for the losses caused by the former to the latter through pollution damages also impinging on the ecosystem services is proper, just, and equitable.The third point of contention arises with the capacity of the scientific knowledge and skilled manpower of developing and poor nations to defend their interests in the international climate negotiations. The risks are different across the globe-some developing countries have much to lose from climate change, while others are more concerned over the costs of global agreements that will limit their markets for fossil fuel or hamper their perceived chances of development. As a result, building coalitions, even among the low-income countries, will be very difficult.The fourth point of contention arises from the divergence in priorities. Interestingly, the divergence in goals between developed and developing nations can be witnessed in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by developed and developing nations. Whereas the INDCs of the developed world like US, EU, and Japan do not consist of the term ""adaptation"" but only consist of the ""mitigation"" commitments, the developing and emerging nations have a significant portion of INDC's dedicated to ""adaptation"". The need to adapt arises for the poor of the developing world because of livelihoods losses due to ecosystem service losses.The bigger concern of climate change and global warming for the poorer nations is the changes in the land use patterns and forest cover, resulting in changes in ecosystem structures and functions, thereby impeding on the various ecosystem services. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) of 2005 enhanced human understanding of nature's capacity to provide ecosystem services (benefits) to the human society in the form of provisioning services (e.g., food, raw materials, genetic resources, water, minerals, medicinal resources, energy, etc), regulating services (e.g., carbon sequestration, climate regulation, pest and disease control, etc), cultural services (tourism, religion, etc), and above all, supporting services that are necessary for production of all other ecosystem services (e.g. nutrient recycling, gene-pool protection, primary production, soil formation, etc).For the poor people in the developing world, the ecosystem services adds up or complements their low incomes, and is often referred to as ""GDP of the poor"". So, the concern of the poor nations is with the impacts of global warming and climate change on ecosystems-livelihoods linkages, and not really carbon-dioxide emission! How can the poor adapt to such vulnerabilities? Who will pay for this adaptation?The fifth issue of contention arises again from the perspective of understanding the local priorities and bringing them in global platforms like COP 21. Developing nations including India has failed to do that so far! India will again fail to bring that, as I see it, simply because of complying with the carbon-centric approach of global negotiations, as decided by the prime movers of this negotiating process, which are primarily the developed nations. With India being one of the lowest per capita emitter of CO2, its bigger concern is the concern of the poor who are getting poorer because of the losses in the ecosystem services due to global warming and climate change.Unfortunately, the Indian dialogue initiators in the global platform, most of whom will be retired bureaucrats, are likely to adopt the same techno-centric and carbon-centric approach, and argue on l"

Much of its economy depends on a climate-sensitive natural resource base, including rain-fed subsistence agriculture. Disruptions in food or water supplies pose serious risks not only for your economies but also for political stability, particularly in fragile states, he continued. Noting that COP21 got off to a good start yesterday, the UN chief said the leaders personal engagement and ownership will be essential in producing the ambitious agreement that Africas people and the entire world need. Already, your leadership has helped make 2015 a year of opportunity, he told them. Many of you were present in Ethiopia in July for the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agendaon Financing for Development. Many of you were part of the historic gathering in New York in September for the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 SDGs. These agendas aim to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years. Now, here in Paris, governments have the opportunity to secure a global climate change agreement that can pave the way towards a safer, healthier, more prosperous and sustainable future, Ban insisted. He reminded leaders that sustainable energy offers huge economic opportunities: With the plummeting price of solar and other renewables, many African countries are moving quickly to embrace a greener pathway that still enables them to meet growing energy demand. Despite strong momentum towards a meaningful agreement, Ban said key political issues remain unresolved. There is a lot of work to do here in Paris, and the stakes are very high, especially for the most vulnerable people and countries, he underl"
"COP21","India","COP21_India11","COP21: UN joins France and private sector partners for action on electro-mobility","December 4, 2015 Friday","India Blooms","New York, Dec. 4 -- Recognizing that transportation has the highest growth in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of any industrial sector, transport representatives at the United Nations (COP21) presented 10 initiatives on Thursday that aim to reduce these emissions and build more sustainable transport systems.Among the events was the launch of the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change Call to Action. Endorsed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Energy Agency, as well as Tesla Motors and Michelin Nissan-Renault, it reportedly builds on commitments from companies, cities, States and associations that have undertaken decisive efforts towards sustainable transport electrification. Of course, I think the sector of transport is one of the most important to succeed in fighting climate, Sgolne Royal, the French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy told the UN News Service. So I announced three concrete initiatives, she explained. First, an open bid about less expensive electric cars less than 7,000 dollars [per car]; second, an initiative for towns to build a plan of mobility inside cities; and third, roads with positive energy which [would see thruways] covered with panel and would solve the problem between agriculture areas and road areas. With energy-related CO2 emissions expected to jump from one quarter of total energy-related emissions today to one-third by 2050, the actors that are part of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) are underlining that significant changes can be made in transport to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. The LPAA was launched one year ago at the the previous UN climate change conference in Peru, and aims to strength climate action beyond COP21. The effort comes as demand for public and freight transport is projected to grow rapidly, especially in emerging and developing countries. Yet, projections reveal a 50 per cent reduction of transport CO2 emissions compared to a transport-as-usual scenario can be achieved by 2050, without hampering sustainable economic growth. Moreover, according to the International Energy Agency, if global warming is to be limited to 2 degrees or less, at least 20 per cent of all road vehicles (cars, two and three-wheelers, trucks, buses and others) must be electric-powered by 2030, in conjunction with the low-carbon production of electricity and hydrogen. Other announcements today at COP21, which centered around the themes of Transport and Building, included new efforts to stabilize emissions from the aviation industry by 2020. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said it has received 74 action plans to advance the implementation of mitigation measures by States, which accounts for 80.6 per cent of global CO2 emissions from international flight.

Its the task of our generation to get it done, he continued. And my message is that this is our power. The people who are here [at COP21] represent the more active and the more engaged in this debate but my hope could only be that this will trickle down as well in their communities. We have to secure and claim the space for young people in this process. The process in which Alhendawi hopes more youth voices will be heard is the current talks happening in the 32 negotiating rooms of the 18 hectare conference centre locate north-east of the French capital. Youth delegates the ones the UN Envoy say represent some of the most active young climate advocates attended the youth event on Thursday wearing t-shirts which read: We must, we can, we will take action. Some blew up large green balloons before letting them fly loose and deflate a symbol of what their world could look like, should an ambitious agreement on climate change is not reached. Taking the stage, Alhendawi was greeted with cheering from the crowd as he wished young delegates a happy youth day. This is one of the most important days because what is at stake today is your present and future, he said. He added, Nobody has the right to gamble with your future. Following his remarks, in which he highlighted the importance of even little actions to tackle the significant challenges of climate change, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) the organizer of COP21 thanked youth representatives for what they have achieved in their respective communities. Thank you for what youre doing not just at the COP but also what youre doing back home, Christiana Figueres said. That is where the rubber hits the ground. Echoing this message, Alhendawi said he is very proud of the youth movement around the world. Young people were the mobilizers and the volunteers, he exclaimed. And they took to the streets reminding everyone that its time to take action on climate change. During the event, a manifesto called Our communiqu: Act like a kid was presented, which urges world leaders to include climate education in the universal climate agreement expected to be adopted at the end of next week.

Delta's high-efficiency products and solutions have helped customers save nearly 14.8 billion kWh of electricity and reduced carbon emissions by about 7.9 million tons of CO2e from 2010 to 2014, exceeding the total annual carbon emissions of some countries. Delta also actively supports the Commit to Action corporate carbon reduction initiative of the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). Having already reduced its energy use intensity by 50% over the last 5 years, Delta is now committed to a further reduction of 30% by 2020. He hoped that COP21 would bring the efforts made by Delta to the attention of the world and called for more businesses and people around the world to join in the fight against climate change. Delta has also compiled its experience and commitment to energy conservation into its Delta's Plan for Action on Climate Change to show Delta's active support for the goals of COP21,COP21. Delta has long focused on improving the efficiency of energy use and provides not only the expertise to the three key requirements of Communications, Connectivity and Computing essential to smart cities, but also high-efficiency energy storage, smart grids, electric vehicle charging, energy management and renewable energy solutions that can be used to build a low-carbon power infrastructure for cities. At the ""Sustainable Innovation Forum"", a key event at COP21 that will be held at the Stade de France on December 7, Mr. Hai will take to the stage along with representatives from national governments and leading companies to promote their perspectives on sustainable cities.Director of Delta's Road to Paris Campaign and Executive Director of the Foundation Ms. Shan-Shan Guo stated that the Delta Foundation hosted its first side event at COP20 Lima in 2014. Their presentation on the rebuilding of Namasia MinQuan Elementary School using green buildings gained significant international attention. This time at COP21 Paris, as negotiators from countries try to reach a legally binding climate agreement, Delta will take this opportunity on the international stage to highlight its energy-saving practices as an enterprise through various side events. At the same time, Delta will demonstrate its technical strength through the exhibition with a large-screen film in the Grand Palais in Paris. Delta will show both its concerns in climate change and commitment to carbon reduction.This year's COP21Source: Delta Group\l"

While many continued to hail the outcome document as the walls of COP21 were torn down on Sunday, the UN News Centre looked back on other aspects that contributed ""positive energy"" to the two-week event.Highlighting what made COP21 green was Fanina Kodre-Alexander from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), who manages communications on climate change, disasters and conflicts. She said UNEP worked with the organizers the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Government of France to ensure sustainability throughout the Paris-Le Bourget site located north-east of the capital. We work under our Eat, Think, Save campaign in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and we believe that food waste is the third largest emitter after a couple of countries, Koder-Alexander noted. To reduce waste, all the food provided at UNEP events, including those during COP21, is sourced from rescued food, resources that would otherwise have been destroyed. Kodre-Alexander highlighted that its always provided in a very appetizing and lovely way. Another exciting feature at COP21 related to food, which attracted a lot of attention, was the boulangers brought on premise to avoid trucking kilos of fresh baguettes ever day. They welcomed the UN News Centre into their lab, which is visible to all conference-goers through a thin see-through plastic tarp. To go with the bread, of course theres caf. Were very happy to see theyre using recyclable cups, said Kodre-Alexander. The method which theyve employed is that people are returning them to get a credit. Its quite successful and you dont see them left around and dropped in the garbage. In addition, welcome packs handed out to all participants included water bottles to limit the number of plastic ones purchased. Water stations to fill these were abundantly found around every corner, similarly to the many recycling bins, clearly labeled to support the separation of paper, plastics and compostable organic waste. UNEP has also tried to be as paperless as possible, added Kodre-Alexander. There are certain documents that need to be printed and distributed but we believe in either providing links to our website or USB keys when available. On Saturday, the printed final draft of the agreement was handed out to delegates to review before they reconvened hours later for its adoption. This was a rare time paper was seen throughout the venue, as negotiators met in all free spaces including the cafeteria. Meanwhile, several eco-friendly options were available to get to and from the site. In addition to free public buses, 300 electric cars were provided by Renault-Nissan to anyone seeking a ride.

"COP21","India","COP21_India18","COP21: UN spotlights need to protect forests and agriculture to improve livelihoods","December 2, 2015 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Dec 2 (Just Earth News/IBNS): The impacts of climate change on forests and agriculture were in the spotlight on Tuesday at the United Nations (COP21), as new alliances among organizations and stakeholders were announced aiming to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation, and to prevent threats to sustainable farming and people's livelihoods.Many of the events on the second day of the global gathering in Paris, France took place in the context of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) a joint undertaking by the Governments of Peru and France, the Office of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the organizer of the current conference, the 21st meeting of the Conventions States Parties. The Action Agenda was launched in December 2014 by the previous meeting of the UNFCCC parties in Lima, Peru. As highlighted in a press release issued by UNFCCC, the LPAA aims to strengthen climate action beyond COP21, by mobilizing robust global action towards low carbon and resilient societies and providing enhanced support to existing initiatives. During the two-week conference, 12 thematic focus events are being organized to expose how climate issues affect various sectors and to suggest relevant solutions to tackle them. On Tuesday, with forests and agriculture taking center stage, leaders from governments, the private and public sectors, civil society and indigenous peoples voiced their environmental concerns. This included how agriculture, forestry and other land uses are responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions about half of that from deforestation and forest degradation, mostly driven by demand for food and wood products and inequities and inefficiencies in the use of land for their production. Forest countries in partnership with other governments, the private sector and civil society are set for an increased international effort to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation in a few decades, said Perus Minister of the Environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal speaking at a press conference. The success of the LPAA and its action area on Forests relies on effective synergies between state and non-state actors, between investment and forest management all together rallied behind sustainably managed forests as a common goal, he added. According to UN estimates, approximately one billion people depend directly on forests for their livelihoods and each year, approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. This loss of forest cover is said to be responsible for roughly 11 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, governments and organizations, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), announced six new cooperative initiatives that aim to protect the long-term livelihoods of millions of farmer and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The entities highlighted how agriculture is one of the sectors most seriously affected by extreme climate but it also accounts for 24 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change. The initiatives focus on four key areas: soils in agriculture, the livestock sector, food losses and waste, and sustainable production methods and resilience of farmers. The new partnerships are expected to deploy money and know-how across both developed and developing nations to help hard-pressed farmers become key actors in the global drive to achieve a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. UNFCCC said todays events reveal the effective and concrete progress that can be made when a wide, international set of stakeholders work together to build resilience and low-carbon systems of production in agricultural and food systems.

The attacks in Paris, however, are affecting the preparations and activities planned for COP21 especially those that are outside the formal conference location at Le Bourget, he continued. Pasztor said the decision of the Government of France to cancel the climate march planned on 29 November must be respected. We hope that leaders and negotiators will still heed the voices of civil society who will gather and march in their towns and cities around the world now counting over 2000 to show support for climate action during the weekend of November 29th through peaceful mobilization, the Assistant Secretary-General stated. Meanwhile, he stressed that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon remains committed to working with leaders to achieve a successful outcome in Paris, recalling that last week, he spoke to G20 leaders on climate change, and urged them to guide their negotiators to achieve ambitious outcomes in Paris. The UN chief is scheduled to meet with leaders at the ASEAN-UN conference in Kuala Lumpur this weekend, at the Commonwealth Heads of States and Government Meeting in Malta next week, and at the COP itself, to help unlock progress on what Pasztor said are several sticking points. The preparatory process for Paris is showing results, he explained. He added, Various informal ministerial meetings have achieved certain convergence on some key political issues the details of which still need to be negotiated in Paris. According to the latest figures, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 per cent of emissions, have now submitted national climate plans with targets, known as the INDCs. If successfully implemented, these national plans bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the climate expert said, adding that it is significant progress but is still not enough. The challenge now is to move much further and faster to reduce global emissions so we can keep global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. At the same time, there must be support to countries to adapt to the inevitable consequences that are already upon us. Underlining that the two-week conference in Paris is not the end point, Pasztor said it must mark the floor, not the ceiling of our ambition. We are optimistic, he told reporters, while adding that there is still a great deal of work ahead to be done before the global community realizes a universal, meaningful agreement, taking place in the context of the2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by Member States in September.

He added, Weve been working very hard, very long the time for action is now. I have seen growing political momentum among Member States. They know that they have to take action. Ahead of COP21, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) the UN entity organizing the conference has already received some 180 voluntary climate action plans from countries. Formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, these will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached. As more and more INDCs were submitted, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said this shows nations are prepared to take meaningful action to address climate change. Many countries have also indicated they would like to see a mechanism in the agreement that will allow them to ramp up their ambition to reach the goal of limiting a global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. According to experts, a temperature rise beyond this level will cause irreversible damage to the planet by exacerbating droughts, floods, food and water shortages, affecting the most vulnerable countries first. Despite the scientific community acknowledging that the national pledges submitted so far will not limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius, Ban has underscored that a successful outcome at COP21 would allow the world to ultimately achieve this target. Tomorrow, around 150 Heads of State and Government are expected at the opening event at the Paris-Le Bourget site, an 18 hectare conference centre north-east of the capital. This space will be the main venue for the two-week meeting, with 32 negotiating rooms, working areas for delegations, civil society and journalists, as well as many venues dedicated to side events. Simultaneously, within the city borders, special events will be held such as an afternoon with Robert Redford at UNESCO on 6 December, and the awarding of the UN Development Programme (UNDP)Equator prize often referred to as the Academy Awards of sustainable development taking place at the renowned Thatre Mogador. At the conference, the interconnectivity between sustainable development and climate issues will be one of the overarching themes. In September, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is composed of 17 goals the SDGs to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years. Asked how a new climate deal and these SDGs are linked, the UN Secretary-General said a strong climate agreement backed by action on the ground will help the world achieve the global goals to make the world better and safer. Goal number 13 [focuses on] climate change but if we do not implement the climate change agreement, then all the remaining 16 goals will be affected. Not a single goal can be implemented in isolation, Ban explained. Science has made it plainly clear that this climate change phenomenon is caused by human behaviour, he continued. He added, Its only natural that we human beings should change our behaviour in a sustainable way. We have to do it. We dont have any time to lose. Thats why I am urging world leaders to demonstrate their moral and political leadership for humanity. The UN News Centre asked the Secretary-General what makes him optimistic that, in a world full of disease, war and famine, world leaders can work together instead of in their own self-interest. [Climate change] doesnt care about national boundaries, he stated. This is a global phenomenon and [leaders] understand that investing wisely in climate change will help their national economy boost. There are many countries who are investing in sustainable energy including solar energy. Its skyrocketing. The UN climate conference will officially open Monday when the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, is elected President of COP21. Negotiations towards a final agreement are expected to conclude on 11 December. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General today met with French President Franois Hollande to discuss the status of negotiations and identify key issues still under discussion. A readout issued by Bans spokesperson said they agreed that failure to reach an agreement was not an option and would have disastrous consequences. The two leaders also exchanged views on the issue of counter-terrorism and shared their concern of a growing influence of Daesh beyond Syria and Iraq. In addition, Ban stood in solidarity today with the people of Paris who were unable to join a climate march, after it was cancelled last week due to security concerns. Alongside scores of other people, he donated a pair of his marching shoes to be placed at the citys Place de la Rpublique near the scene of 20 Novembers terror attack, and where the climate march was due to start. As the world gathers in Paris to stand up for climate action, let us also stand in the shoes of all victims of terrorism, war and persecution and respond with compassion, said a note he wrote and left at the scene. Following the event, the thousands of shoes contributed were donated to a non-governmental organization working with Syrian refugees.

He will announce the initiative alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US President Barack Obama, and French President Francois Hollande. Other countries to take part in the initiative include South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada, and Norway.A source has told Reuters that India will be one of the founding beneficiaries of the new initiative. ""This is one of the main points of the negotiation: how to improve clean technologies and give the poorest countries access to these technologies,"" the source said. India is the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and accessing clean energy technology is at the centre of its strategy to combat climate change. It has argued that developed countries need to reduce costs and remove barriers such as intellectual property rights of renewable energy or zero-emission technologies. This will make it more accessible for developing countries.More than 190 countries will meet in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21Gates had written in his official blog back in July, ""World leaders will take another critical step this December at a major meeting in Paris called COP21, where they will discuss plans to reduce global CO2 emissions significantly.

The session convened representatives of cities, academia, the private sector, national governments and the UN family for a lively panel discussion to establish a solid connection between the new Climate Agreement and the New Urban Agenda; to discuss and raise awareness of the various challenges, opportunities and solutions related to cities and climate change; and to present and discuss the UN systems solutions and input in the field of cities and climate change that can enrich the new urban agenda.The session was moderated by Raf Tuts, Coordinator, Urban Planning and Design Branch at UN-Habitat with opening remarks given by Ambassador Maria Espinosa Garces of Ecuador. Ambassador Garces highlighted the importance of such events in paving the way for a successful Habitat III in Quito, Ecuador in 2016. The Ambassador further elaborated that the key issues is to build low-carbon cities while also combating poverty and exclusion and that Sustainable Development Goal 11 and sustainable urban development should be key issues for Habitat III and the new urban agenda.Following, Mr. Tuts introduced the first round of panellists representing different UN agencies. Christian Friis Bach, Executive Secretary & Undersecretary General of UNECE commented that the European region is drastically urbanized with 3 out of 4 people living in urban areas, and there is a need for tools and the development of indicators to test smart cities that are being sought. Pradeep Monga, Director General and Special Representative on Energy and Climate at UNIDO communicated the efforts to create climate resilient industries, and green supply chains, while also creating jobs.Focus on contributions of Urbanization to developmentMalcom Johnson, Deputy Secretary of ITU stated that ICT offers a potential of 20 per cent Green House Gas(GHG) emissions reductions by 2030. Further ITU set up a focus group on sustainable cities that is developing international standards. The first panel was closed by Dr. Joan Clos, Executive Director of UN-Habitat and Karla Slechtova, Minister of Regional Development, Czech Republic. Dr Clos talked of the need to shift conversation from the negatives of urbanization to the contributions of urbanization to development.This shift can influence policies that will convert urbanization to a tool to accelerate development. Dr. Clos argued that issue lies in the perception of urbanization as a cost as opposed to an investment. He finished his intervention commenting that what is needed is to look at what value urbanization creates, who captures the value, and how best to reinvest the captured value of urbanization. Following Dr. Clos, Minister Slechtova commented on the opportunity for the European Habitat III in Prague, to launch the Prague declaration that would feed into the New Urban Agenda at Habitat III in Quito.The Minister highlighted the role of the state to offer a legislative basis to support urbanization and assist local authorities and commented on the need for cooperation between national and local governments and business. The second round of panel discussion began with Mr. Luis Neves of Deutsche Telekom who discussed the need for a good regulatory environment to achieve both GHG reduction and economic value in cities. The discussion was continued by Professor Eugenie Birch who talked of the deficit of knowledge with regards to urbanization and the need for more data. Her intervention ended with a call for the establishment of an IPCC type body, an intergovernmental panel of sustainable urbanization to commence pooling together various knowledge on urbanization.Lord Mayor Ulrich Sumpthon of Port Vila described the current impact of urbanization and climate, and both identified recent efforts undergone with the help of various organization and reiterated his municipalitys need for further assistance to build resilience. David Jackson of UNCDF stated that the world has reached peak urban; the rate of urbanization has surpassed the rate of population growth in absolute terms.

COP 21 is seen as a crucial conference, as it needs to achieve a new international climate change agreement applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping the rise in temperature under 2C from preindustrial times.Tubiana said that it was heartening to note that a majority of the countries were focusing on upscaling renewable energy through the communication of post 2020 commitments also known as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Submission of INDCs by all countries before COP 21 will be a key component of the negotiations to achieve the Paris agreement. Many leading emitters including, China, US, EU etc have submitted their INDCs to the UNFCCC however India is expected to submit its INDCs before October, 2015. She emphasized that the increased focus on renewable energy shows that it has indeed become a major market globally.Nicolas Hulot, Special Envoy of the French President for the protection of the Planet, in his address, stated that the Paris climate change conference has to be innovative to bring all parties on board and collectively find climate solutions to ensure the future of the planet. He emphasized that, a new climate agreement must work with business to maximize energy efficiency, clean energy technology innovation and deployment and these strategies must be regarded as long term investment for the future of our planet.Susheel Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, pointed that IPR issues present the key barriers in technology transfer to developing countries. He emphasized that promoting technology innovation and technology deployment supported with appropriate financing from developed countries and focus on building community resilience is crucial to address the global climate challenge. In addition, he stressed on the need for enhanced climate finance from developed world to developing countries and suitable subvention scheme tailored for developing countries to help countries like India scale up its climate action.FICCI presented a Statement in the Run-up to COP 21, Paris to Laurence Tubiana. FICCI Statement highlighted that Paris has an opportunity to be different by setting a new benchmark for engaging business and industry. Paris can be seen as the landmark in the history of the negotiations and it should be seen as a victory for businesses as much as a successful outcome for governments. The French COP Presidency has the opportunity to steer the negotiations towards a meaningful outcome that can be delivered by business, industry, governments; it has the opportunity to engage the business presence at the COP effectively.

Coastal cities would be particularly vulnerable due to more frequent and intense cyclones and rising sea levels, she told media. Gopal has been back from the recently conducted 12-day United Nations , COP21 held in Paris.The Indian delegation to COP21 was led by Mission Director, Swachh Bharat, Praveen Prakash, IL&FS Managing Director Mahesh Babu and NBCC Managing Director Anoop Kumar and Karuna Gopal.""Our Smart Cites session at the COP21 attracted a lot of international attention and people were keen to know how our new missions like Smart Cities and Swachh Bharat would help reduce emissions and make our cities inclusive. We had to talk about our new policies on renewable energy, smart grid pilots, thrust on public transportation and waste to energy practices in India,"" she said.There has been a consensus at the COP21 that involving citizens and forging partnerships is the key to climate change adaptation and 100 Smart Cities Mission is all about collective action and co-creation involving millions of citizens from our cities, Gopal added. While public transportation can 'shrink a city' and save energy (236 km of Metro Rail and BRTS in India is reducing 0.6 million tonnes of Carbon dioxide annually), e-governance can also help reducing emissions. Saving a page of paper per e-transaction, 20 million pages of paper can be saved in India daily, Gopal said.Adressing the session through a video conference from New Delhi, Praveen Prakash said that Indian missions like Smart Cities and Swachh Bharat will effectively address climate change concerns.Government's flagship programmes will not only help make our cities sustainable but also make them inclusive. It will take government, business and civil society working together to utilise the potential of sustainability, Prakash added.As cities are primary polluters, most of the climate change mitigation efforts are the responsibility of city governments. The Indian delegation proposed how Smart Cities will revisit the 'energy mix' and treat solid waste. They also suggested the ways in which cities hosting industries can keep the environment clean and measures they should take to reduce Green House Gases.Amrut SchemePraveen Prakash said that under Amrut Scheme, Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) has approved the State Annual Plan for Rs 415.5 crore for 2015-16.

The round-the-world flight will restart after some repairs to the plane's batteries, in 2016. If Solar Impulse succeeds, it will be a breakthrough for aviation, environmentalism and human endeavor. Solar Impulse had also flown through India, making pit stops in Ahmedabad and Varanasi.Now, in the lead-up to the COP21 event, Piccard has published a manifesto of seven principles to highlight that solving climate change does not have to be an expensive exercise, requiring financial and behavioral sacrifices, but rather a unique opportunity for creating both profit and jobs. Initiator, chairman and pilot of Solar Impulse, Piccard, said: ""People don't want to hear about expensive problems; they need to be inspired by solutions, which have immediate economic returns. The CO2 emissions of today are caused by technologies which are 100 years old. If we were to replace these old polluting systems by new clean technologies that exist already today, we could divide by two the energy consumption of the world and therefore, too, the CO2 emissions. This is where we need to implement legal frameworks.""Piccard and Borschberg will participate in a number of high-level events including the official opening of the COP21/CMP11 leaders event at Le Bourget on November 30, the Solutions COP21 on December 4, re-energising the Future, and Sustainable Innovation Forum organised by UNEP. Piccard will also join Dr Ernest Moniz, Secretary of Energy, USA, in making the welcome address on Energy and Low Carbon Innovation on December 8.Borschberg, co-founder, CEO and Pilot of Solar Impulse said: ""Solar Impulse is a tangible example of the power of clean technologies. Among our records, we have accomplished a non-stop five days five nights flight, with no fuel. To be able to realize this historic first using solar energy, we had to significantly reduce our energy consumption and be extremely efficient. All the clean technologies which have been integrated in the airplane can be adopted in our daily lives. We need governments to create a favorable environment so these technologies are widely used in order to reduce CO2 emissions.""In an effort to provide a platform where the public can support and provide input into the COP 21 process, Solar Impulse has launched the 'Future is Clean' initiative, which has mobilised more than 300 supporting associations, among them business leaders, international organisations and academia, and urging governments to replace old, polluting techniques with new, cleaner solutions that are more efficient.Since the start of November 2015, members of the public have actively engaged in voting for their top solution.

"COP21","India","COP21_India62","Delta21@COP21: Delta promotes Cross-Strait Cooperation on Sustainable Cities and Green Buildings to reduce carbon emissions","December 11, 2015","Architecture Update","New Delhi, Dec 11 -- As the end of the Conference on Climate Change (COP21) nears, experts and scholars in the energy, architecture and meteorology fields from both sides of the Taiwan Strait attend the Delta21 Forum organised by Delta Electronics on December 10 at the Grand Palais. They discussed the enormous potential of green buildings in regards to energy conservation and lower carbon emissions from the policy support, energy-efficient technology and architectural design perspective. Over the past 10 years, Delta has worked with partners to construct 21 green buildings, accumulating valuable experience and defining the philosophy of ""Building Harmony with Nature"". The concrete achievements during the COP21 conference period included proposing solutions that will help traditional high energy consumption cities transform into sustainable cities. Delta also hopes to utilize COP21's international influence to remind organisations around the world to focus upon the potential value of conserving energy via green buildings as we all work together to create a smart green life. During the forum, Bruce Cheng, Delta's founder and honorary chairman, shared his experience on cost-effective designs for natural ventilation and lighting that can effectively conserve energy, optimise comfort and realise the concept of ""Building Harmony with Nature"". He pointed out that a UN report indicates the potential to reduce the carbon emissions of buildings reaches up to 90 percent. Since 2005, Delta's factories, offices and donated buildings around the world adopt green building practices, with a current total of 21 green buildings. Delta has also sponsored the ""Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition"" for ten consecutive years and has promoted the implementation of winning designs from this initiative. Delta hopes that these international contestants will accumulate knowledge and skills related to green buildings and become future urban planners and architects capable of ultimately benefiting a growing number of people with higher energy conservation and healthier living and working conditions. Ding-huan Shi, president of the China Renewable Energy Society (CRES), the organising entity of the ""Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition"", and the director of the China National Engineering Research Center for Human Settlements, Ji-shou Zhong, also participated at the forum. Ding-huan Shi emphasised that in the past 10 years, the Delta Cup competition has gradually become a multifaceted platform to lead the development of China's green building and energy industries, implement winning designs, nurture innovative talent and spread the low-carbon concept. Delta utilized a first-prize winning proposal to construct the ""Delta Sunshine Elementary School at Yangjia Town"" and the ""Delta Sunshine Junior High School in Longmen Township"" in disaster areas affected by the earthquakes in Sichuan. ""The 24 Corridors Under the Riyue Mountain"", a project recognised and supported by the Qinghai Government, also combines multiple award-winning proposals into a showcase construction project to house farmers. Zhong highlighted that industries, governments and academia across the Taiwan Strait must work closely in order to facilitate more progressive ideas that enhance innovation in green building technologies. The architect who designed the first net-zero energy campus in Taiwan, the Namasia Ming Chuan Elementary School, Ying Chao Guo, and the architect who designed the world's largest festive lantern, Delta's Ring of Celestial Bliss, Jih Pan, also shared their design expertise. Ying Chao Guo stated that, ""We are rebuilding not just the past, but the future."" In addition to serving an educational function, the reconstructed school also follows the ""Building Harmony with Nature"" philosophy while respecting the indigenous culture. The structure serves multiple complementary functions. According to Jih Pan, architecture is an external factor at any time and place, which is why architects must take special care to maintain a harmonious relationship ""between nature and humans"". He hopes that, ""Architects will remain committed to the respect for nature and humanity so that buildings can contribute towards turning the dream of sustainability into a reality."" The goal of COP21 While introducing Delta's experience in lowering the electricity intensity of its worldwide factories by 50 percent from 2010-2014, the chairman of Delta Electronics, Yancey Hai, provided the example of the renovation of its 16-year-old Taipei headquarters with smart green building solutions. The building received a diamond-level EEWH certification (existing buildings) from Taiwan. This building achieved energy savings of up to 58 percent through the use of Delta's HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) automation, power regeneration units for elevators, LED lighting, renewable energy solutions and energy management software. Not only has this green building set the record for the most significant carbon emissions reduction among Taiwanese office buildings, it has also brought significant reductions in electricity costs. Hai stressed the business potential of smart green buildings. As a global leading provider of power and thermal management solutions, Delta is dedicated to facilitating the creation of sustainable cities to counter the impact of buildings on the environment. As the week-long ""Solutions COP21"" exhibition ends today, this forum is the conclusion of the company's Delta 21 Green BuildingsExhibition, that proposes the concept of ""Building Harmony with Nature"". Delta's exhibition utilized immersive projections and interactive designs to showcase the 21 green structures Delta has constructed over the past 10 years, including Delta's own operation facilities in Taiwan, mainland China, India, and the US, as well as the 12 green buildings donated in Taiwan and mainland China. The exhibition organizer stated that Delta has actively exercised its responsibility as a global corporate citizen, working with all organizations to promote energy conservation and lower carbon emissions. Delta has committed to contribute in the global effort to slow down global warming within 2 degree celcius through solutions that are also economically valid.\l"

He admits he cannot utter a single sentence in English. ""English is not a problem as long as my work talks for me. I'm genuine and there is sincerity in my work which will speak for me. Besides, I will have a translator. As part of my talk, I will be narrating my journey from a seven-year old rag-picker to what I'm today,"" he says. He has a team of 12 members at the Jayanagar DWCC who manage an inventory of 10-12 tonnes of dry waste every month.Mansoor's talk will be translated by Kabir Arora, who coordinates Alliance of Indian Waste-pickers (AIW) - an informal network of organisations, cooperatives, and companies working on waste management with the help of waste-pickers. Hasiru Dala, which is a coalition member the AIW and an organisation of waste-pickers and waste workers, is sponsoring Mansoor's 10-day trip.""The team from Hasiru Dala asked me if I was interested in going to Paris for a conference. I was elated and immediately said yes. My passport and visa had to be made,"" says an excited Mansoor. He flew to Delhi from Bengaluru on Monday and will reach Paris later in the day.Mansoor operates the Dry Waste Collection Centre (DWCC) (recyclables and inorganic waste aggregation and sorting unit) in ward 168 of Jayanagar in. He went door-to-door in the area around the centre to encourage residents to segregate their wastes and drop it at the DWCC.The daily collection of the DWCC is about 120 kg from waste-pickers. The DWCC receives one tonne of waste from apartment collection. Mansoor uses a rotating fund of Rs 3,000 to buy wastes from the apartments.COP 21.The IYCN is a network uniting Indian youth and youth-oriented organisations who are concerned about climate change and environment issues. The network works to generate awareness about and establish consensus on what role India should play in the global debate of climate change and how it should address its domestic issues.Mansoor was just a seven-year-old when he began helping his parents collect waste by sorting it. At that time, he used to manage around 500 kg of waste every month.He attended a small government school near his home but had to drop out of school in Class 5 when his father passed away.He is the oldest among nine siblings (he has six sisters and two brothers), and the burden of responsibility to take care of them brothers and sisters feel upon his young shoulders.He joined the informal waste sector with his mother to help supplement the family income.They ran a small scrap shop near their home where all the waste-pickers from their slum would bring their daily collection. They would manage around 500 kg of waste every day.Working with waste has therefore been the only job that Mansoor has known, but it has provided for him and his family. Thanks to the use of technology and people his people-management skills, Mansoor has been able to scale new heights.He says he is eager to learn the concepts of solid waste management followed in Paris and will find ways to implement it at his centre too.From the conference, he wants the countries to pursue the agenda of recycling (Waste to energy) in their climate action commitments as opposed to incineration of waste - which is currently being proposed as a climate solution by many governments. Incineration is being perceived as a threat to Mansoor's and many other green entrepreneurs' livelihood.For his visit, he was asked to buy a pair of thermal wear as Paris would be freezing at this point of time. ""I didn't know that we could find thermal wear here. I was asked to buy them; but one pair costs Rs 2,000. But it's going to keep me warm when I land there. I have already purchased my formal wear two months ago. I am too excited about my trip. It all feels surreal,"" he says.With his contagious smile he has been easily able to build excellent relationships with his customers to whom he provides waste collection services. The last few days he has been flooded with congratulatory messages from them for this prestigious trip.Today, with the Paris trip materialising, he feels his hard work has paid off although he claims never to have imagined that he would be able to visit a foreign country. ""This is my first visit to a foreign country...and in an airplane. I'm feeling ecstatic and proud. Never in my life had I imagined that I would get such an opportunity. This would not be possible if it were not for the people who supported me throughout my life. I really want to thank my well-wishers, friends and relatives,"" says Mansoor, who has three children: two boys and a girl.He has enrolled his children in Oxford School in JP Nagar. And his aim now: To give his children a solid education ... and the freedom to follow their dreams.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

The handover coincides with the opening of the first hydrogen refuelling station in Paris, launched as the world focuses on COP21, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, held in the French capital.The delivery of the five ix35 Fuel Cell makes the world's largest fuel cell taxi fleet, and is the first step in establishing a hydrogen-powered electric taxi fleet called ""hype"" (Hydrogen Powered Electric), serving the Greater Paris area. The fleet is planned to increase up to several hundred vehicles within five years, with the refuelling infrastructure to be gradually installed in 2016, to meet the increasing demand for hydrogen.Thomas A. Schmid, Chief Operating Officer at Hyundai Motor Europe, said: ""With this pioneering project, Hyundai Motor and STEP are bringing new sustainable mobility to the streets of Paris. The ix35 Fuel Cell taxis will provide not only a clean solution for the city, but also a practical, comfortable and reliable choice for drivers and passengers.""Compared to a diesel-powered taxi with CO2 emissions of 135g/km and an annual mileage of 100,000 kilometres, the ix35 Fuel Cell vehicles will save around 70 tons of CO2 per year in exhaust emissions. The only emissions from the tailpipe of the ix35 Fuel Cell during driving are water vapour.The high-frequency usage of these cars on the 'hype' fleet will also showcase the reliability and all-day usability of fuel cell vehicles. To support this, Hyundai Motor will introduce and certify a specialised Hyundai fuel cell dealership, to service the growing taxi fleet.With this latest delivery of fuel cell electric vehicles, the number of ix35 Fuel Cell on European roads has passed 250 units. The ix35 Fuel Cell was the first hydrogen-powered car to be mass-produced and offered for sale in Europe. The examples already on European roads have covered more than 1.2 million kilometres.

"COP21","India","COP21_India79","The politics of climate change: COP 21 and emerging economies","December 24, 2015 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 24 -- The recently-concluded has, once again, reignited the debate over climate change negotiations. For the first time in twenty years of UN negotiations, the aim was to achieve a universal agreement on climate change. The main objective of the Paris climate change conference was to achieve - firstly, legally binding provisions aiming to keep global warming below 2degC target and secondly, extracting commitments for financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund that each country is likely to make. ""Climate atmospheric stabilisation"" and ""climate finance"" have emerged as two crucial components of COP21. The stakes are high for the ""emerging economies"" as these countries require large amount of energy to generate and maintain growth and economic development.The international political response to climate change began with the Rio convention at the Rio Earth Summit 1992 that adopted the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Convention sets its general goal, namely ""stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" It further states this level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.Climate atmospheric stabilisationClimate atmospheric stabilisation targets the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) with limiting global temperature to 20 C to pre-industrial level. At current rate, the average global temperature could rise by two to three degrees within the next 50 years or so, with several degrees more if the same emissions continue. At the Paris Deal 2015, pledges were made to limit the GHG emissions below 20 C and a more ambitious goal of 1.50 C was set. This is a tall order that requires developed countries to massively reduce their emissions and provide huge financial support to developing countries.Top 10 emitters contribute 72 per cent of global greenhouse gases (GHGs). On the other hand, the lowest 100 emitters contribute less than 3 per cent. While universal climate action is necessary, significant mitigation actions are needed by the largest emitters, taking into account that they have different capacities to do so. Highly industrialised countries with large GHG emissions would have to contribute most to problem solving as they are likely to suffer least from climatic changes because they have a high capacity for adaptation. Developing countries, in contrast, are much more likely to suffer from climatic changes because of their smaller capacity for adaptation. Even if they reduce their economic growth to zero, they could not contribute significantly to solving the problem (with the exception of emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil).However, the large emerging economies whose commitment to GHG reductions is essential, have a different take on the issue. India has said that it has no problem in freezing carbon emissions at current levels to avoid any further rise in global temperature over 0.80 C but that will impede growth. Developed countries have already occupied two-thirds of the three gigatonne carbon emission space available to stop a rise in temperature above 20C.India is the third largest emitter with 5 per cent contribution to global emissions and one-seventh of the coal consumption compared to top two emitters - China with 27 per cent and the US with 17 per cent contribution to global emissions. The demand is to vacate the carbon space to create room for others to develop and achieve emission reduction in accordance with the rate of time preference than that required by the rich, industrialised economies. This assumption is based on the notion of ""survival emissions"" required for development in the developing economies rather than ""luxury emissions"" for the developed countries. Reduction in carbon emissions requires application of technologically advanced, alternative methods of emission reduction in the form of clean energy and ensuring sustainable way of life to develop a low carbon economy.Climate financeCurrently, GHG emissions are primarily a function of economic output. Development is the resultant factor that is locked in fossil fuels that are cheap, compared to alternative forms of energy. The goal is of course to delete emission trajectories from economic growth. This means that almost automatically, for the time being, all are engaged to emit GHG inspite of their position on the development ladder. The large economies are large GHG emitters. And, with the exceptions of China, India, Brazil, and emerging economies, these large economies are also the richest and technologically most advanced countries capable financially to deal with climate change.It is estimated that to limit emissions to 20C, an investment of US $16.5 trillion in low carbon technologies is required over the next 15 years (International Energy Agency: Special Report on Energy and Climate Change 2015). The bulk of these investments target the climate change vulnerabilities of countries. While for countries in East Asia and the Pacific region, the number stands at 46 per cent of total adaptation finance (US $12 billion), for sub-Saharan Africa the number is 13 percent (US $3.3 billion) and for Latin America and Caribbean, the investment is 12 per cent (US $3 billion) of total adaptation finance respectively .The majority of finance flows remained within the country of origin. In 2014, about 74 per cent of total climate finance flows and up to 92 per cent of private investments were raised and spent within the same country as suggests the same report.A Climate Policy Initiative Report (Nov 2015) titled ""Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2015"", states that global climate finance flows reached at least US $391 billion in 2014 due to increase in public finance and private investment in renewable energy technologies. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) raised within the framework of the UNFCCC acts a mechanism to assist developing countries to adapt and counter climate change. It is intended to raise climate finance of US $100 billion a year by 2020. The present initial capitalisation of GCF amounts to only US $9.3 billion (including nearly US $1 billion from France). The member countries have taken the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) pledges in the post 2020 scenario to create capabilities and adopt low carbon economies and to build climate resilience. With no legally binding principles emerging from COP21, it has made the agenda of contribution to climate finance very weak.COP 21 has emerged more in favour of the developed economies than in favour of the developing economies. The climate policy analysts are of the view that the Paris Deal 2015 is a major political loss for the developing countries, including the emerging economies because it disregards the responsibility of historical emissions, at the same time occupying a larger share of the carbon space. According to World Resources Institute, the already existing historical emissions (1850-2011) baggage for the world to carry comes from the contribution of US (27 per cent), the European Union (28 per cent), China (11 per cent), Russia (8 per cent), Japan (4 per cent), India (3 per cent), Canada (2 per cent), Mexico (1 per cent). Denying the historical baggage means disregarding the principle of equity and justice in owning and sharing the liabilities towards the future generations.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP21","India","COP21_India81","COP 21: Will the Paris Agreement suffice?","December 21, 2015 Monday","Assam Tribune (India)","Guwahati, Dec. 21 -- On December 12, the representatives of 196 nations signed the 'Paris Agreement' at the UN Climate Conference. After two weeks of intense negotiations and behind-the-scene manoeuvring, we finally have a global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The historic agreement is being seen as a giant step forward by some, while others see it as a weak document that will be unable to accelerate action needed to quickly mitigate anthropogenic climate change and impacts. However, all would agree that the agreement is expected to unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future.During the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2009, about the only thing world leaders could agree on was that global temperatures should not be allowed to rise more than 20Celsius over pre-industrial levels. Since then, numerous studies have emphasized the dangers, as well as the imminent probability of cascading effects in a two-degree warmed world. So when the talks began at Paris, over a 100 countries, including the United States, European Union, China and the island nations announced their support for limiting warming to 1.50Celsius. Developing countries like India, apprehensive of compromising their development aspirations and goals, wanted a more plausible target.The Paris Agreement marks a change in direction; it retains the two-degree target, while recognizing the importance of pursuing 1.5 degrees, to protect the island states, which are the most threatened by the rise in sea level. The agreement also directed the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change to draw up a report by 2018 on how to limit global warming to 1.50Celsius. According to a recent study from Nature Climate Change, to keep warming below 1.50Celsius by 2100, humanity will have to stop emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2060. Therefore, the final agreement is an important compromise between the developed nations, developing nations and small island nations.The agreement document, which runs into 32 pages, for the first time binds all nations into a common cause based on their historic, current and future responsibilities. One of the main principles of climate negotiations is that countries have common but differentiated responsibilities when it comes to climate change. The agreement establishes an obligation for industrialized countries to fund climate finance for poor countries, while developing countries are invited to contribute on a voluntary basis. The agreement acknowledges that $100 billion will need to be raised each year from 2020 to finance projects that enable countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change like rise in sea level, droughts, etc., and to reduce greenhouse emissions.Millions of people have already been hit hard by climate change, ranging from fishing and farming communities impacted by unpredictable seasons to coastal settlements threatened by sea level rise. Who should pay for the infrastructural damage and livelihoods lost? Developed countries, which are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere right now and are responsible for that warming, have said they want to help but could not agree on the quantification on compensation and liability. A section of the Paris Agreement addresses loss and damage, as climate-vulnerable countries wanted and lists the various ways in which developed countries could assist and recognizes the importance of funding for loss and damage without defining the terms of liability for climate reparations.The Agreement 'recognizes that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat' to the planet and mankind, and has set the goal for the world's atmosphere to be a net zero of pre-industrial levels by 2100. To get there, nations will have to submit their objectives later next year and submit updated actions every five years thereafter. By establishing a process where countries will meet every five years to review their progress in cutting emissions, the Paris Agreement creates a way to ensure everyone's living up to their promises. The Paris Agreement therefore asks all countries to review these contributions every five years from 2020; they will not be able to lower their targets and are encouraged, on the contrary, to raise them. In addition, emissions should peak as soon as possible and the countries will aim to achieve carbon neutrality in the second half of the century. Just as important, this window creates an opportunity for civil society groups and citizens to keep the pressure on governments to increase their commitments to cutting emissions.Besides action at the government level, the Paris meet also saw unprecedented support from other entities. Exciting new initiatives were announced to give cities, companies and private citizens a bigger role in making the transition from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. Nearly 400 cities, with the collective potential to avoid nearly 750 million tonnes of emissions annually, signed up to the Compact of Mayors coalition to measure and reduce emissions by 2030. Over 150 big businesses from the US, accounting for nearly 11 million employees and more than $4.2 trillion in annual revenue pledged support for climate action.While the Paris Agreement is a very ambitious undertaking with very specific goals, it is not binding upon the signatory nations. The agreement will be open for signing by the countries on April 22, 2016 in New York. The agreement can only enter into force once it has been ratified by 55 countries, representing at least 55% of emissions. Yet, we now have an agreement with acknowledged targets and an ambitious goal to move away from fossil fuels for good. The implementation of this historic agreement in letter and spirit represents the best hope to avoid catastrophic warming that could destroy the natural ecosystems, hasten the extinction of species and endanger future human generations.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Assam Tribune.

"COP21","India","COP21_India83","COP21: Whither consensus!","December 30, 2015 Wednesday","MINT","New Delhi, Dec. 30 -- Notwithstanding the bonhomie between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama post COP21 in Paris, the fineprint in the much-touted agreement has very little legally binding for the parties to adhere. All that countries are expected to do is to put out their planned emission reduction targets to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change every five years. There is neither an obligation to set ambitious goals nor do they have to achieve them. Article 28 gives countries an exit clause to get out of the agreement by giving a written notification; any party that withdraws from the convention shall be deemed having withdrawn from this COP21 agreement. Because there are no penalties for non-compliance, there is very little incentive for any party to depart from the convention in the foreseeable future.All international agreements need to be ratified by each country's legislature, and there is no guarantee that local and domestic politics will not kick in and many of them may not ratify them at all. If not ratified by the member's legislature, the country executives cannot do much other than just simply talk platitudes on international fora for the sake of face-saving. One has to hope against hope for the sake of posterity, and all countries will behave responsibly to save the planet for future generations.It is widely accepted that a 2 degree rise in temperature is unachievable without aggressively cutting down on carbon emission by the end of this century. Aspiration is now set at a 1.5 degree rise in temperature, largely at the behest small island nations who stand threatened with their disappearance due to rising sea levels, and this had no effect on the final agreement in Paris. Sea levels have been raising by one, two, or three millimeters a year depending on whose data you believe. The vulnerability of coastal regions around the world will no doubt steadily increase. Floods, hurricanes and typhoons and excessive rain will continue from time to time as it happened in Chennai just recently. Countries will have to get ready to alleviate the sufferings and losses on their own right now and in the near future. Rich countries will not help, no matter what. This is where India needs to wake up for drafting a national mission for coping with climate change on its own now and even find resources to tackle it.The UK seems to be the only country whose committee on climate change that sets five-yearly carbon budgets has advised that more than half of new cars would have to be powered by electricity within 15 years, and by 2030s, almost all electricity would have to come from low-carbon sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and nuclear. If electric cars have to have any impact, the non-carbon or low-carbon sources of electricity have to come within 25 years. It is also becoming clear that solar and wind energy do little to reduce emissions when there is a fair mix of sources generating power. This should lead to the obvious choice of new technology and nuclear power. Nuclear power is another contentious source for the environmental lobby in India, and although India is still going ahead to establish more nuclear power plants, the going will not be easy. For India to successfully establish nuclear power plants as planned and as is necessary, it becomes imperative for all Indian political parties to agree to this one point common agenda for the nation. However, by looking at the state of political affairs of domestic politics at the moment, it will remain a dream. India will have to engage the environmental lobby with scientific and technologically reasoned arguments to bring them on board. Consensus on new research and more nuclear power is good a news for all, but needs lots of convincing to do. This move augurs well as it has the potential to actually move away from fossil fuels. To the extent all these developments are not convincing enough for climate alarmists, anything that provides a secure and affordable energy future must bear good news.During COP21COP21 agreement should meet lots of disappointment. On balance, we may see a shift to nuclear and R&D on new energy generation, protection of vulnerable communities and energy savings and storage. India, like all other countries, must choose a pragmatic and yet environmentally responsible path to energy development. Any euphoria that COP21 will trigger the end of fossil fuels, will be like Mark Twain's eulogy!Published by HT Syndication with permission from MINT.

"COP21","India","COP21_India85","Beyond CoP-21: Bottom-up Approach Holds The Key","December 10, 2015 Thursday","New Indian Express","Chennai, Dec. 10 -- The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference underway in Paris, also known as the CoP-21, is the greatest human gathering in history where leaders from all over the world are pondering on the very question of our survival in the future. Climate change is certainly the greatest threat to the existence of planet earth. In terms of its impact, it may not be an exaggeration to place this issue above any other that bothers humanity including problems like poverty and even terrorism. The predominant goal of the Paris Convention is to diminish greenhouse gas emissions so as to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degC above pre-industrial levels.It is indeed an ambitious goal that the humankind has set for itself, yet its achievement has become more pressing than ever before. James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist along with his team, has predicted that mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted, that is, 10 feet by 2065 - fifty years from now. This would have an adverse impact over the coastal population and would even threaten the survival of entire island nations, who may be the last generation dwellers on their landmasses now. Not to mention the other devastating effects that such a phenomenon would have such as the salinisation of water across the globe that would have result in serious health hazards for all living beings. Therefore, it can be established with certainty that the threat of climate change is undeniably very real and what the world commits to at the Paris Conference could define the fate of posterity.More than two decades have passed since the first international level discourse on sustainable development took place at Rio in the Earth Summit, 1992. The value of this idea of sustainable development lies in the fact that it seeks to address all the problems that are faced by the world today, encapsulated in form of the 'three pillars' or the 'three focus areas of sustainable development' - social, economic and environmental. Indeed, these three issues are intertwined.Illustrating the interlink-age of environmental issues with economic ones, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated that the ""global mean losses could be 1 to 5% of GDP for 4degC of (global) warming, but regional losses could be substantially higher"". While some environmental issues like land degradation and loss of marine life, besides others, have a severe economic impact, other issues such as water stress and occupational pollution may create negative social impact. Therefore, it is no surprise that in a study titled ""Is Blood Thicker than Water?"" Bros and Couttenier have shown a clear causal link between the sources of water supply in public infrastructure and the atrocities committed against the scheduled caste population. Climate change can affect the way human beings relate to one another and the way human society functions.The three problems of the society, the social, economy and the environment, in their turn exist on three levels - local, regional and global. For example, in the realm of economics, penury of a group of people could be considered to be a local problem, which on the regional level could be termed national poverty and when it extends to a global level, could take the form of large-scale economic depression.In similar parlance, the manifestation of a social problem of oppression could be an isolated murder on a local level, on a national or regional level it could be genocide and on a global level - ethnic cleansing. Hence, in the domain of environment, one could consider issues like waste management as a local problem, droughts and floods regional or national ones, and climate change as a global issue.All these problems have in essence, three solutions - these are: agreement (a will in the minds of the people to address the problem), technology (the availability of appropriate means to address the problem) and execution (actual action towards addressing the problem). Hence, in order to have sustainable development in the true sense of the term, there would have to be firstly local bodies working on the three issues of environment, economy and society using the three tools of technology, agreement and execution.On the second level, there would have to be regional bodies or nations working in their own capacity on these issues using the three tools; and finally in a concerted manner, there would have to be a committed global community working on the same issues using the aforementioned three tools. At each level, whether global, regional or local, a transfer of technology, a common agreement and coordinated execution would be required to find a holistic solution to the problem, thereby culminating in a 3 X 3 X 3 model of environmental action. However, with reference to the problem of the environment, the trend of solution finding from the time of CoP'3 at Kyoto, which resulted in the Kyoto Protocol, had been following a top-down approach.While the Kyoto Protocol in essence marks a watershed in the history of a united front to address a global challenge such as climate change, it essentially can be summed up as a global gathering trying to persuade individual nations to commit to certain targets with the hope of bringing about changes at the grassroots level. Yet the fact is that truly sustainable change can only come about employing a bottom-up approach. It is when local bodies identify their environmental issues and begin to see their link with the national level environmental problems and in their turn, the nations feel urged to improve the state of their environment, only then an intrinsic force would take birth to trigger an operative effort for the cause.This intrinsic trajectory of the environmental concern travelling from the grassroots to the global level shall obviate the need for the 'dictation' of targets. Precisely on this theory of intrinsic motivation is the concept of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) based. Yet a true culmination of a united action to save the environment would only occur when the nations, in their own turn solicit targets from within their constituent regions and states, and the states from their grassroot level districts. While this last lap of the inclusion of grassroot level agreement is yet to be covered, the signs look positive.Perhaps, one could hope that in years to come, individual Parliamentarians would be submitting their district level targets and looking at micro-environmental issues in their constituencies as part of the macro climate change problems. It is only after achieving such a stage that an end-to-end concerted effort would be possible to bring about a paradigm shift in the current state of affairs relating to the environment. Hence, it can be hoped that the Paris conference will facilitate the evolution of the environmental movement to become a truly persistent force which is seamlessly linked with the grassroots.The author is a TRS MP and a member of the Indian chapter of GLOBE InternationalPublished by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian Express.

Following the World Health Organization (WHO) call to push the impact of climate change on human health to center stage, Sanofi has decided to actively contribute to COP21 in order to raise awareness on this issue, but also to take action to prevent its consequences.""We need to urgently support the mobilization of the entire health community, public and private stakeholders, starting with life sciences companies, who are responsible for contributing to the advancement of health,"" said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. ""If we act now, we can mitigate the consequences of climate change on the health of the world's population. Health must be part of the Climate debate.""Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress, between 2030 and 2050, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The direct effects of climate change on health include illness, death and morbidity during extreme weather events (heat waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes or storms). The indirect impacts go much further including the influence of climate on microbial populations, consequences on non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular or respiratory diseases and distribution of vector-born diseases.As highlighted in the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change Report, published in June, ""the links between climate change, vector populations and hence malarial range and incidence may become significant in areas where the temperature is currently the limiting factor, possibly increasing the incidence of a disease that causes 660,000 deaths per year.""Sanofi is actively engaged in a number of activities whose aim is to address health issues exacerbated by climate change: Medications and Awareness: Sanofi provides medicines and vaccines but also raises populations awareness, strengthens surveillance and enhances diagnostic and treatment capacity. In the field of malaria, for example, Sanofi has pursued strategic partnerships with National Malaria Control programs in several African countries to provide affordable medicines and to support local stakeholders in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of malaria. Carbon Footprint: Implementing a low carbon economy requires a collective effort. The health sector as a whole contributes between 3% and 5% to OECD countries emissions. Sanofi is committed to achieving a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions stemming (industrial and R&D sites) from 2010 to 2020. By the end of 2014, Sanofi achieved a 15% reduction. Global Collaborations: As a global healthcare leader, Sanofi is in a unique position to program the impacts of climate change on health on the public agenda in a collective approach. That is why Sanofi is pursuing collaborations with governments, non-governmental organizations and the scientific community to find responses to limit the negative consequences of climate change on worldwide health.Additionally and within the COP21, to mobilize the public and to help adapt to the consequences of climate change, Sanofi will launch a social networks campaign #HealthCOP21. From December 4th to 10th 2015, Sanofi will also host public on its booth at Solutions COP21, located in the Grand Palais, a public exhibition in the heart of Paris.Source: Sanofi\l"

""At the same time, it is obvious that a more 'comprehensive' approach is necessary to address all the aspects that affect emissions during the use phase of a vehicle,"" Erik Jonnaert, ACEA Secretary General explained. Such an approach seeks to reduce CO2 emissions more effectively by drawing on a full spectrum of solutions, whether this relates to the vehicle itself, alternative powertrains, faster fleet renewal, intelligent transport systems (ITS), improving infrastructure, decarbonising fuels, or altering driver behaviour. The need for a comprehensive approach to further reduce CO2 emissions from road transport should be reflected in the EU's implementation of the COP21 agreement.ACEA expresses the hope that the outcome of the climate negotiations forms the basis of a new long-term and predictable policy framework. Policy makers should also ensure that the COP21 talks result in equivalent conditions for all major emitting economies and industrial sectors around the world, recommends ACEA.Jonnaert: ""Only a level playing field between countries, as well as industrial sectors, will allow the EU automotive industry to make the long-term investments that are necessary to tackle the climate change challenge.""\l"

It was also the 11th session of meeting of the parties to the Kyoto protocol known as Conference of Member Parties (CMP 11). The conference had begun on November 30, 2015 with several heads of states/Governments participating in the opening of the conference. At the conclusion of the summit 195 participating countries agreed to a set of responsibilities and aims to mitigate climate change which was announced on December 12, 2015 and is named as 'Paris Agreement'. Paris Agreement As per the Paris Agreement the participating countries resolved to keep the Global temperature rise this century (2000-2100) below 20c. And drive efforts to limit the temperature rise at below 1.5oc above the pre-industrial level. The agreement made has provisions for putting in place strong mechanism for financial flow to achieve the aim of mitigating global temperature rise and also calling for stronger action by developing countries keeping in view their national objectives. The participating countries resolved on the following objectives to be achieved collectively- Taking steps to mitigate and reducing emissions fast enough to achieve temperature goals. Establishing a transparent system and a global stock take to account for climate action Strengthening the abilities of the countries to adapt to changes of climate change. Strengthening ability to recover from the impacts of climate change. Providing support to countries to develop clean and environmental friendly technology So far 188 countries of the world have been submitting national action plans on climate change. The agreement has included the clause that such countries should not come up with action plans which are less ambitious than the previous ones. The agreement also calls for updating of climate action plans known as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC's) every 5 years. The agreement also aims at resourcing 100 Billion US $ for financing plans to mitigate climate change. The agreement also includes- Recognising that the least developed countries and small island countries both have special needs. A global stock take will be started in 2023 to assess the collective progress towards the goals of agreements. A committee of experts will also be formed to overview the compliance actions being taken to mitigate climate change in a non-punitive manner. The 'Paris Agreement' document will be opened for signature on April 22, 2016 on Mother Earth Day.

Addressing the business community at an interactive session organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Ms. Tubiana highlighted that Paris agreement must send out a clear and long-term signal on the future direction of the global policy so the business are confident about the much needed global and national actions on climate change. France will be hosting and presiding the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from November 30 to December 11, 2015. COP 21 is seen as crucial conference, as it needs to achieve a new international climate change agreement applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping the rise in temperature under 2\'b0C from pre-industrial times. Ms. Tubiana said that it was heartening to note that a majority of the countries were focusing on upscaling renewable energy through the communication of post 2020 commitments also known as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Submission of INDCs by all countries before COP 21 will be a key component of the negotiations to achieve the Paris agreement. Many leading emitters including, China, US, EU etc have submitted their INDCs to the UNFCCC however India is expected to submit its INDCs before Oct, 2015. She emphasized that the increased focus on renewable energy shows that it is indeed become a major market globally. Mr. Nicolas Hulot, Special Envoy of the French President for the protection of the Planet, in his address, stated that the Paris climate change conference has to be innovative to bring all parties on board and collectively find climate solutions to ensure the future of the planet. He emphasized that, a new climate agreement must work with business to maximize energy efficiency, clean energy technology innovation and deployment and these strategies must be regarded as long term investment for the future of our planet. Mr. Susheel Kumar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, pointed that IPR issues present the key barriers in technology transfer to developing countries. He emphasized that promoting technology innovation and technology deployment supported with appropriate financing from developed countries and focus on building community resilience is crucial to address the global climate challenge. In addition, he stressed on the need for enhanced climate finance from developed world to developing countries and suitable subvention scheme tailored for developing countries to help countries like India scale up its climate action. FICCI presented a Statement in the Run-up to COP 21, Paris to H.E Mrs Laurence Tubiana. FICCI Statement highlighted that Paris has an opportunity to be different by setting a new benchmark for engaging business and industry. Paris can be seen as the landmark in the history of the negotiations and it should be seen as a victory for businesses as much as a successful outcome for Governments. The French COP Presidency has the opportunity to steer the negotiations towards a meaningful outcome that can be delivered by Business, Industry, Governments; it has the opportunity to engage the business presence at the COP effectively. FICCI hopes the French COP Presidency will use innovative means to engage businesses in dialogue during the COP, to have business forums both as part of the official process and on the sidel"

In a signed declaration submitted by Boston-based advocacy group Ceres to the leaders of 190 nations at COP 21, the companies acknowledge that climate-change mitigation and innovation are essential not only to the health and wellbeing of the people who make their products, but also to the future supply of materials required to create said products. The negotiations which began on December 1 will culminate with a possible international agreement on December 11. Adidas, Eileen Fisher, Gap, H&M, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp. are among the multinational apparel brands calling for a robust global deal that will stem the rise of climate-altering greenhouse-gas emissions. More than altruism, the appeal is a matter of self-preservation, as well. ""From the farmers in cotton fields to the workers in garment factories, we know that people in some of the least climate-resilient regions are being negatively impacted by a warming world,"" the statement said. ""Drought, changing temperatures, and extreme weather will make the production of apparel more difficult and costly."" The signatories are among the planet's largest consumers of cotton, according to Ceres. VF Corp. alone buys about one percent of the world's cotton for its stable of 30-plus brands, which include The North Face, Timberland, Vans, and Wrangler. ""At VF, we support a low-carbon, energy-efficient global economy and are doing our part to contribute to meaningful and measurable progress in the fight against climate change,"" said Eric Wiseman, the conglomerate's chairman and CEO. The statement enjoins world leaders to craft an agreement that will ""accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy"" and ensure net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions ""well before the end of the century."" It also calls for national carbon-emission mitigation commitments that are strengthened every five years, starting in 2020, along with adaptation funding for building climate-resilient economies and communities. At the same time, the companies are pledging to pursue energy efficiency in their operations, advocate for ""meaningful"" climate change and energy policies at the global, national, and state/regional levels, and engage their respective trade associations in ""thoughtful"" discussions on climate and energy policies and advocacy campaigns that promote the long-term health of both the apparel industry and the global economy.

The worst part about this is that some of the youngest and most vulnerable citizens of our world are bearing the most unfair burden of climate change, said Perry in a news release issued by UNICEF. In her weather report, Perry highlighted the extreme weather patterns that are emerging across the world and forcing millions of children and families to flee their homes. According to a major report launched by UNICEF in November, over half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million live in high drought severity areas. The report also revealed that of the 530 million children in flood-prone zones, some 300 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty, surviving on less than $3.10 a day; and of those living in high drought severity areas, 50 million are in countries where more than half the population lives in poverty. UNICEF stressed that climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions, which can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. Further, the climatic activities can create a vicious circle. For example, a child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. In the exclusive weather report, Perry called on viewers to share their story on how they are helping reduce climate change as part of the #FightUNfair campaign. Lets encourage our world leaders to take this issue seriously. []Together we can help change the forecast for millions of children, said Perry, who was appointed as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2013 with a special focus on engaging young people to improve the lives of the worlds most vulnerable children and adolescents.

"COP21","India","COP21_India104","Planned in phases: Paris shows way to clean air","June 22, 2015 Monday","The Times of India (TOI)","PARIS: The blue, clear skies this summer in Paris hardly indicate it has an air pollution problem. But the top agenda for the Paris municipality- Marie De Paris-is dealing with tiny, respirable pollution particles or PM 2.5 that can get lodged in the lungs or enter the bloodstream of residents.Paris, which will be hosting the United Nations climate change conference or COP21""We are telling the car industry that by 2020, diesel cars can't run in Paris. It's a tough call. We have a very powerful auto industry in France. Residents have six years to change,"" Patrick Klugman, deputy mayor of Paris for international relations, told Indian journalists during a media visit organized by the French ministry of foreign affairs.Phasing out diesel vehicles is only one of the many strategies the city is adopting to improve its air quality. For a year now, Paris hasn't been allowing half its cars to ply whenever there are two consecutive days of high air pollution levels. It has massively increased the share of electric and hybrid vehicles and is planning to have a Sunday without cars in September. This would be a message to residents to change their lifestyle as soon as possible to keep up with the new policies on air pollution. About 75% Parisians have supported the policies on phasing out diesel-run transport, according to Klugman.Even more surprising is what Paris considers to be a high air pollution day. According to scientists from the French National Centre for Scientific Research, it's a very poor air quality day when concentrations of PM 2.5 or PM 10-coarse, pollution particles-go up to 100 micrograms per cubic metre, which is the safe standard or prescribed limit for PM 10 in India.On the other extreme, levels of PM 2.5 routinely go over 200 micrograms per cubic metre and levels of PM10 also go up to 300 to 400 micrograms per cubic metres in Delhi with no emergency pollution mitigating measures in place. While comparing Paris and Delhi may be difficult because of demographics, economy and urban infrastructure, the two cities are facing a similar challenge.The latest Airparif report on air quality shows that Paris region regularly exceeds limits set by the European Union. They reach almost twice the regulatory limit set by the European Commission directive. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels exceed the limit near main roads and in the heart of Paris.Paris has zeroed down on traffic for its air pollution problem. Since more than 75% of its electricity is from nuclear energy sources, the pollution cannot be due to thermal power plants. According to Paris's road traffic pollution action plan, two-thirds of NO2 emissions and 55% of particle emissions are from road traffic. ""The Parisian population used to love cars. There was a highway around the Seine. Now a large part of Seine has been converted to pedestrian areas. France has one of the highest proportions of diesel cars,"" added Klugman.Paris will host 1,000 mayors just before COP21 to discuss the role of cities in mitigating climate change where air pollution will also be on the agenda. Paris municipality is urging Indian mayors to join the discussion.Recently, the National Green Tribunal, too, ordered that diesel vehicles over 10 years old be phased out in the NCR.

However we also take adaptation seriously and in 2014 signalled our intention to develop a climate change adaptation strategy through the Adapting to a Changing Climate: Directions for the ACT policy statement. A draft Climate Change Strategy for the ACT will be released for public consultation in early 2016.A recent review of the ACTs climate change strategy, AP2, indicated that adaptation actions contained in the strategy had either been completed, or are ongoing in their implementation.By signing up to the RegionsAdapt initiative the ACT has committed to:Adopt a strategic approach to adaption and prioritize adaptation actions, e.g., through adopting or reviewing a regional plan or strategy on climate change adaptation within two years of joining the initiative; take concrete action on adaptation in at least one of the key priority areas identified by the regions. These could include: water resources and management; resilience and disaster risk reduction; agriculture and zootechnics; forestry, protected areas and biodiversity; infrastructure (including transport and the energy sectors) and territorial planning; economic impacts and opportunities; social adaptation and impacts; and report data on the progress of the adaptation actions on an annual basis through the Compact of States and Regions reporting platform.A strong adaptation response at the subnational level is critical because subnational governments can play a fundamental role in improving coordination and cooperation between governments, Mr Corbell said.Taking early action and putting in place long-term plans are important for the ACT to be prepared both practically and economically for the unavoidable impacts that climate change, even if restricted to less than 2?C, will have on our local environment.\l"

Global warming is indeed a serious issue which imperils the future of humankind and the life span of the world. Meteorologists, environmentalists and climate change experts have been warning for four decades regarding the hazards of ozone depletion owing to green house gas emissions and the resultant global warming consequential droughts, inclement weather and natural catastrophes.It was not till 1995 that the first Conference of Parties (COP) was held and another three years elapsed before the Kyoto Protocol was adopted at COP3, a nonbinding agreement by 192 parties to lower greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Eight years later, at COP11 the Montreal Action Plan was generated to ""extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol beyond its 2012 expiration date and negotiate deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions"".Set in this backdrop, COP21 assumes great importance since this year leaders of 150 nations, along with 40,000 delegates from 195 countries, attended the conference of parties for climate talks to adopt major steps towards setting up legally binding mechanisms which will keep the world at bay from crossing the 2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise barrier.Some previous conference of parties ended in a fiasco because the major industrialised nations refused to abide by the rules and take cognitive steps for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example the 2009 Copenhagen COP15 is deemed a failure for it concluded without reaching any agreement. COP21 held greater promise because of the dynamic participation of the Chinese President, who has been actively canvassing for reining in this peril to nature and humanity.In 2014, President Xi Jinping took the bold step of signing a joint statement with the United States on climate change sending strong political signals to the world through its solemn promises demonstrating its determination to take a green, low-carbon and sustainable development path. So far, China has signed a series of bilateral statements on climate change with India, Brazil, the European Union (EU), the United States, France and others, and submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2015 the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which details China's own contribution to combating climate change for the sake of all mankind.China itself has also included the fight against climate change in its 13th Five Years Plan for national socioeconomic development in the 2016-2020 period, which demonstrates its serious commitment to support the protection of the environment and its attitude towards climate change. China also supports a comprehensive review every five years of the progress made towards the achievement of the approved long-term objectives, which also demonstrates China's capability for and confidence in meeting its commitments.

"COP21","India","COP21_India108","'India lacks contingency plan for natural disasters'","December 7, 2015","Free Press Journal (India)","Pravin Mote (in pic) is a social activist and researcher on environmental economics and climate change issues. He works with forest and mining affected communities in Chandrapur and Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. Pravin spoke with Chitra Sawant on India's stance at the ongoing United Nations in Paris.Q: India has submitted its plan at the COP 21 UNConference on Climate ChangeA: The government has submitted its Plan titled as 'India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution' (INDC) to the UN Climate Convention in October. However, it was not nationally determined and it does not contribute in any way towards solving the climate crisis, it can only help worsen the crisis. For such an important document touching upon a number of crucial areas of public policy, a draft should have been introduced and discussed thoroughly in Parliament. The government should have asked for inputs from various organisations. The previous government had a National Action Plan on Climate Change and the state government had prepared a document, as our politicians are aware that we are not ready for any crisis-like situation like Chennai or the Mumbai deluge of 2005.Q: What will be the impact of climate change on Mumbai?A: There have been studies conducted in the past which state that climate change impacts will lead to economic losses for various sectors. It will cause the temperatures to rise resulting in rains and floods, and have consequent effects on health. The other consequences such as rise in deaths from vector-borne diseases, dislocation due to floods and sea-level rise have been shown as projected economic losses. The Maharashtra government does not any have assessment and vulnerability plan in place.Q: Can you shed light on Carbon emissions, which is the main aspect of the conference and are we as a developing country ready for the climate policy mitigation?A: The most crucial aspect of climate policy is mitigation, which hinges on the extent of carbon emissions, and its control. At the centre of India's INDC is the proclamation that India intends ""to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels"". India's emissions in 2007 were about 1.9 billion tonnes. Even based on conservative estimates of GDP growth over the period 2005-2030, it implies that India's emissions in 2030 will shoot up to at least five billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent, very likely more. Nothing can be more false: though India's electricity generation capacity has trebled over the past decade - to 2,34,000 MW by 2014 - electricity access for the poor has been limited. The INDC and government policies are largely business-as-usual, there's no reason to believe that the poor will benefit significantly from a much higher emissions development trajectory. On the contrary, it is the under-classes that will disproportionately pay the costs of higher emissions in terms of climate impacts, as we have witnessed in the Uttarakhand disaster, in cyclones, and in agriculture sector.Q: The Government of India is committed to mobilise climate finance from internal resources as well from corporates to form clean energy investment coalition. How will it help in curbing climate change?A: In the beginning of the INDC, it seems that the government has taken a bold step by trying to mobilize climate finance mostly from internal resources, including budgetary support. But towards the end it reveal that India is well short of mobilizing climate finance if it has to implement its proposed climate change actions between 2015 and 2030. INDC states that India requires up to $ 2.5 trillion between 2015 and 2030. The current financial mobilization and future estimates are actually nowhere near this whopping target. INDC does not mention clearly the market mechanisms that it wants to experiment with and very strangely failed to record also external finance and credit facilities that it is currently accessing. The submission, therefore, lacks clarity on resource mobilisation with a clear distinction between adaptation and mitigation fund.Q: Can you comment on the present status of forests in relation to carbon sink?A: The funding of the country's most ambitious afforestation and eco restoration programme to develop India's forests as a huge carbon sink (to justify increasing emissions) for future carbon trading is deeply problematic. Afforestation programme and the current fund of $ 6 billion earmarked for this programme has been mobilized on the basis of collecting Net Present Value (NPV) out of deforestation and diversion of forests for non-forest activity. If this continues India will see more deforestation, more mega projects, since the INDC text has projected a figure of $12 billion to be mopped up by 2019-20 for funding the development of India's carbon sink. What this really hides is in order to turn the India's forests into carbon sink it will continue deforestation, earn and fund this programme to develop a carbon market within the country.

""It's an absolutely positive sign that so many countries are coming together for environment and they realise that we are all on the same page,"" Karuna Singh, Director Earth Day Network (EDN), India told IANS. ""With nations like India having a strong voice, we can envision an Environment Democracy. For the event, great responses are coming and several organisations have pledged to plant 36 million trees in India by 2022,"" Singh added. For India the CAMPA bill is more of a necessity than a diplomatic move to impress the UN climate change countries as over 1.4 million citizens died in 2013 due to air pollution, according to the EDN. China, the world's largest contributor of carbon emission lost 1.6 million in the same year, says the Earth Day Network. According to the EDN, China and India are the largest CO2 emitters in the world. However, India, with 17 percent of the world's population, maintains that it is responsible for only three percent of the global carbon emission. Karuna said that the EDN arrived in India in 2010. Now, neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and others are approaching the global network for guidance, which is another good sign for the environment. The first earth day was observed as an environmental movement across colleges and schools in the USA on April 22, 1970. Now, it is marked across the world with volunteers urging people to plant trees, to go paperless, promote car pooling, buy organic food and in other ways. ""We expect to connect more and more people. For that, different programmes are being organised, including for the first time in Afghanistan, where they would have a awareness campaign. In Delhi, ambassadors of 20 countries will plant trees in parks in Delhi,"" Karuna said. ""Best responses comes from the youth and women, because they are the ones who suffer the most with climate change."" The Earth Day Network (EDN), one of the world's largest recruiter to the environmental movement, has set a goal to plant 50,000 trees across the globe on Earth Day, for which it had managed to raise $32,000 against a target of $50,000. ""We are hopeful of a better future and an environment democracy, as the seriousness for the Kyoto Protocol still exists,"" Suresh Chauhan, TERI Fellow, told IANS. The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that binds its 132 member countries to work for reducing green house gas emission. It was adopted in 1997 and bought to force in 2005. It is part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), formed in 1992. ""We are encouraged by the Indian effort, in terms of forest policies or the National Action Plan on Climate Change - the Green India Mission, that aims to increase the forest cover to 33 percent. Similarly, under the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of UNFCCC, India aims to reduce three billion units of carbon emission. However, we also feel that the policies must be more feasible,"" Chauhan said. ""Government of India is perhaps diverting ample funds, also meant for CAMPA, to other projects like its rural employment guarantee programme MGNREGA, which is not a very good sign,"" he said. ""I think the funds should be spent properly, policies must be implemented and simplified in order to achieve clean environment,"" he said, claiming that with the COP21 agreements ratification at UN on Saturday, the Earth Day has indeed become special. The United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP-21 The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degree Celsius.

"COP21","India","COP21_India110","Meaning COP-21","June 23, 2015 Tuesday","Indian Express","It is a term that will be heard and talked about very frequently in the coming days. The reference will be to the climate change conference scheduled to take place in Paris in November and December this year. An annual meeting, this year it is expected to deliver a major agreement on the action plan for saving the planet from the disastrous consequences of rising average global temperatures.The term 'COP' stands for Conference of Parties. 'Parties' is a reference to the (now) 196 signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, as it is called. The Framework Convention came into force in 1994, two years after its text was finalised at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.Every year since 1994, the 'parties' to the UNFCCC have met at different venues at the end of the year to discuss a global agreement to cut emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main reason why average global temperatures have been rising.The Paris meeting will be the 21st in that series, hence the name 'COP-21'.It was COP-3, in Kyoto, Japan, that gave rise to the Kyoto Protocol, that placed international obligations on the set of rich and industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by assigned amounts. The Kyoto Protocol, which came into effect only in 2005, has since run into trouble, with some countries, which were obliged to take emission cuts, having walked out of it. Though the Protocol continues on paper for the time being, the current negotiations at the COPs are about bringing in an agreement that will demand some kind of action from all countries, not just the rich and industrialised. The actions expected from the countries are supposed to be in accordance with their capabilities.An earlier attempt to forge such an agreement was made at COP-15 in Copenhagen in Denmark in 2009, but it failed spectacularly. After two years of further negotiations, the countries had decided that a global agreement on climate change must be delivered at the COP-21 in Paris in 2015. However, with fewer than 200 days to go for the Paris conference, deep differences persist on several issues, and the frantic pursuit of a compromise continues.\l"

With this pledge, Avery Dennison, a global leader in labeling and packaging materials and solutions, is joining more than 140 companies who have voiced support for a strong outcome at the United Nations being held in Paris from November 30 to December 11 and have underscored their commitment to reducing emissions from their operations, it said in a press release. ""Signing the pledge was an easy decision because we're already doing the things that the pledge asked of us,"" said Dean Scarborough, Avery Dennison's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We unequivocally support an agreement coming out of Paris that takes a strong step toward a low-carbon future. We are cutting our own carbon emissions and taking additional measures to tackle climate change."" Building on a 2009 pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, indexed to net sales, by 15 per cent from 2005 to 2015, Avery Dennison has pledged to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by at least 3 per cent annually, and by at least 26 per cent overall, between 2015 and 2025. It has also pledged to eliminate deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities by 2020, in alignment with the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests and purchase 100 per cent of its paper from certified sources by 2025. The company will purchase at least 70 per cent of its paper from FSC-certified sources by 2025 and develop long-term business plans that align with the deep decarbonization necessary to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2\'b0C. Scarborough will speak in Paris next week as part of the Sustainable Innovation Forum, which will run concurrently with the climate talks. Avery Dennison supports an agreement that will cut emissions enough to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the release said. Scarborough said his company supports strong and immediate efforts to curb emissions for reasons both ethical and commercial. ""Climate change is an imminent global threat that demands urgent action from all segments of society-including business- while we still have time to act,"" he said. ""It poses risks to people, communities, ecosystems and, obviously, our business. Responding to climate change by reducing emissions is, above all, a moral imperative. It's consistent with our company's ethics and guiding principles. And if we want to stay in business for the long term, then addressing the risks posed by climate change is simply sound strategy.""\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India117","COP21: An aspiration to reality","January 1, 2016 Friday","Columnists India/Pak","Lahore, Jan. 1 -- JUST after the Paris attacks the world leaders demonstrate a coalition gesture with a two-week summit of 196 states that none of the murderous adversaries would dare sabotage the climate deal. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, geo-political transition with rapid natural alteration in climate with man-made repercussions is casting hazardous impacts to our mankind and climate. It's not only the global players with their apotheosis industrial boom, require to implement the carbon reduction policies but also the whole world needs to opt for the domestic policy framework of decarbonisation in order to keep the world safe from the disastrous future implications through their collective contribution.The COP21COP21 was based on the four pillars, as position those factors which will achieve the preliminary energy related global releases; Secondly, to evaluate the five-year contributions that boost the ambition for climate change; Thirdly, engaging the short-term obligations to longer-term prospects to climate change and Fourthly, structure an arrangement to track the accomplishments of energy-sector. Developing states committed to an agreement to switch from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels with much of a cost bearing agreement, though 84 states participated in the protocol for a major cut off. In the protocol 55% of the states agreed for a reduction of 55% carbon emissions and this was the 55/55 target at the COP21. Largest emitters incorporate states, therefore, held several policies of reduction.Switzerland in accordance with the 2012 decree of reductions in the CO2 emissions committed to level down its emissions to the extent of 1990 level or below by limiting the emissions in energy sector, as from buildings 78%, industry 93% and transport not to overreach by 100%. To trim the greenhouse gas, targets by 2025 is 35%, whilst 50% or below to the level of 1990 by 2030. Objectives of 40% domestic reductions for European Union as according to the 2014 framework of Climate and Energy Policy, achievement of 27% renewables and energy productive goals with 40% reductions in emissions of GHG by 2030. Same as Norway in compliance to the 2015 White Paper areas of priority, Norway to minimize its GHG emissions by industry and the transport, emphasis on renewables and shipping of low-carbon. United States opted strategy for new and prevailing industries to comply with the carbon pollution norms, as reduction of about 40-45% in methane proportion from the oil and gas and to implement the fuel effective norms for the heavy-duty vehicles after the 2018. Moreover, US committed for the net reductions of 26-28% GHG releases relative to the 2005 level by 2025.According to the 2012 Climate Action, Gabon planned in reducing the 50% emissions of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and methane by 2025 and to cut down releases from the sectors of energy production and forestry. Russia opted for its 2010 energy policy till 2030 as to reduce the intensity of energy. Russia in its primary energy demand opted to use the non-fossil fuels to a wider capacity as 13-14% by 2030. Furthermore, to level down the GHG releases of 25-30% by 2030 and 15-20% by 2020 lower than 1992 level. Japan in 2015 held decisions in the cabinet and took a divergent energy planning strategy for the betterment of energy saving functioning of buildings. And through nuclear power plants, aimed to generate the electricity and to lower down the 25% GHG releases by 2020. Greater number of green house gas emissions is widely seen in Korea due to routine business activities. So Korea is narrowing down the emissions to 30% by the year 2030.China set up its five year strategic plan and developed plans for Climate Action and Energy development from year 2014 to 2020. Consumption of primary energy of 4.8 billion tones of coal and 20% by non-fossil fuels with a trim of 62% quantum of coal is targeted by 2020. India as the world's fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter marked to increase the number of renewables by 175 GW and 100 GW of solar by 2020 with accordance to the National Action plan of 2008 on Climate Change. BRICS as Brazil, Russia, India and China, these four member states were considered as the five largest CO2 emitters including the US. Brazil has now opted a ten year strategic plan of energy effective and energy expansion with aim to reduce the number of green house gases by 36% till 2020 through reductions from business. Phenomenal changes in climate are occurring across the world.In the last five decades extreme heat waves have doubled its frequency with prolonged heated days. The drastic weather conditions are turning disastrous due to human activities as by combustion by likely producing immense greenhouse gas emissions. For the last three decades, bushfire situations are occurring rapidly in densely populated regions as in many parts of Australia and Tasmania. Triple times increase in the sea levels at Sydney and projection of double the number of people deaths in Australian cities would occur due to extreme heat over the coming four decades. At the COP21 conference China agreed to the principle fact that the first world states are liable for the vulnerable situation, irreparable loss and for the long term impacts of climate change though supporting a 1.5C goal.Believing to the facts that richer states need to do more than the poorer states with finance and differentiation, it would come as a great challenge to decarbonise the systems. The structure of five-year appraisal (2016-2020) that set up as a segment of Paris Pact would make a difference, if the national pledges for the climate change are consciously followed up. So by the end of this century 2.7C or 3C warming will hopefully be reduced.Mahrukh A MughalPublished by HT Syndication with permission from Columnists.

Climate action is an extraordinarily complex issue, and the national delegations tasked with reaching a global plan face a myriad of difficult political, economic, diplomatic, social and cultural challenges.The single overarching goal is to make it possible for more countries, companies and communities across the globe to transition from carbon-based energy such as coal, oil and gas, to something that is both renewable and less damaging to the planets ecosystems. This is a huge task which requires both political leaders, the industry, regulators and investors to take action.Henrik Poulsen, CEO of DONG Energy, said: ""With a global climate agreement at COP21, I hope that the world's political leaders will join us in making an effort to ensure that in the future, it will simply be too expensive to choose those energy technologies that pollute our environment. If political leaders, the industry, regulators and investors provide a final push, the world will see a major breakthrough within the next decade where green energy becomes cheaper than black energy.""DONG Energy is constantly working to reduce the costs related to renewable energy, such as offshore wind power and bioenergy. We have a strategic goal of reducing the costs of offshore wind power by 35-40 per cent by 2020, and we are well on the way to achieving this. The wind turbines are getting bigger and more efficient and we are developing a standard model for an offshore wind farm based on a uniform design with standardised components.If green energy is to become cheaper than fossil energy, CO2 emissions must be priced at a level that more fairly reflects the damage they inflict on the planet. The industry must ensure a significant downward pressure on the costs of renewable energy, and the political leaders must ensure that the use of the fossil fuels that pollute our environment become more expensive. In DONG Energy, we hope the political leaders will take an important step in the right direction with a global climate agreement at the COP21 in Paris.\l"

Five sessions over the course of the day drew hundreds seeking IEA insight on subjects ranging from how to halt growth in greenhouse gas emissions to detailed analysis of national climate pledges.In his introduction, Dr. Birol presented the Agency's key messages for COP21, detailing how the IEA can help countries develop low-carbon energy sectors. The four key messages call for a Paris accord whose short-term actions fit with long-term emission goals; adoption of actions that can freeze energy emissions by 2020; greater energy innovation; and increased energy-sector resilience to the effects of climate change.The five sessions opened with an update on IEA analysis of the climate pledges more than 150 countries delivered before the start of the Paris talks. Building on a World Energy Outlook Special Briefing on the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), Director of Sustainable Energy Policy and Technology Kamel Ben Naceur detailed the pledges' impacts on the energy sector as well as global warming.Then the IEA presented its five key actions to peak global energy emissions. Along with representatives from the Environmental Defence Fund and the Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group, Agency experts detailed how increased energy efficiency, phasing out least-efficient coal-fired power plants, investing more in renewables, ending fossil-fuel subsidies and cutting methane emissions can limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.The next session described how best to speed development of low-carbon technologies, including greater collaboration between emerging and OECD countries, a cornerstone of the IEA modernisation introduced by Dr. Birol. Marie Donnelly, the European Commission's Director for New and Renewable Sources of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Innovation, joined experts from across the IEA to explore paths to improve technologies as well as lower costs.Industry participants from Africa and Asia joined the IEA for the fourth session, ""Using the Paris agreement to drive short-term actions consistent with long-term emission goals."" They focused on the need for five-year review cycles to be part of a climate accord so countries can regularly measure progress on short-term targets as well as keep oriented towards longer-term transformation of the energy sector.The final session looked at what the energy sector must do to improve resilience to the effects of climate change. Not only does more extreme weather threaten infrastructure like offshore oil platforms, but more droughts from global warming can create water stress, affecting hydropower and limiting resources for drilling.Even before IEA Technical Day, the IEA was busy at COP21.

More than 20,000 U.N. participants from 195 countries are expected to attend the 21st annual Conference of Parties (known as COP21), from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11.""COP21The quick and standard EV charging stations will use renewable and extremely low-carbon electricity from EDF, enabling the Renault-Nissan fleet to cover more than 400,000 km in two weeks. The quick charging stations will recharge EVs from 0 to 80 percent capacity in about 30 minutes.EVs consume any form of electricity used in the power grid, including hydropower, solar and wind energy. As countries reduce dependence on fossil fuels and increase reliance on renewable resources, EVs become even greener.Small carbon footprintThe COP21 charging stations in the Paris region will use electricity with a small carbon footprint. The French power grid distributes electricity with a very low average of CO2 emissions per kWh: less than 40 g in 2014, compared to the European average of 325 g of CO2 emissions per kWh. Renewable energy accounted for about 19 percent of France's electricity last year.""EDF supports the development of electric mobility, which is a cornerstone of countries' efforts to minimize urban pollution. EDF produces extremely low-carbon electricity in France, which enables a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and thus reinforces the favorable ecological footprint of this new generation of transport,"" said EDF Chairman and CEO Jean-Bernard Levy.In addition, EDF is offsetting the remaining CO2 emissions through carbon credits generated by projects certified by the United Nations. That means the Renault-Nissan EV fleet will use electricity considered fully ""decarbonized.""Fourteen of the 27 quick chargers installed will remain after the climate change conference and will be available for the public to use. These include two at Charles de Gaulle Airport, two on the Paris peripherique highway and one at Orly Airport.France already has about 10,000 quick and standard charging spots.

The session was aimed at discussing the role of oil and gas technologies and research & development in Gulf Cooperation Council as well as the OAPEC countries towards combating the effects of Climate Change and raise resilience for Response Measures.Al-Muraikhi noted that this US$ one billion environmental project will result in a 90 per cent reduction, equivalent to annual Green House Gas (GHG) savings of 1.6 million tonnes of CO2.The project will help recover 29 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) of gas per year which is enough gas to produce 750 MW of electricity or to power 300,000 homes.The JBOG facility was built and is operated by Qatargas. It started operations in October 2014 and recently achieved a major milestone marking its 1000th loading, safely recovering approximately 535,000 metric tonnes of LNG.As the -160oC LNG is loaded onto the LNG ships, around one per cent of the LNG evaporates due to the difference of temperature between the LNG and the ship tank. JBOG collects the boil-off gas and transports it to a central compressor area. The gas is compressed, and then sent back to the LNG plants to be used as fuel gas or converted back into LNG. The compressor, specially built for the JBOG facility, is the first of its kind and the largest managing such low pressures and high volumes.As part of the Common Facilities at Ras Laffan Industrial City (RLIC), the JBOG facility is led and operated by Qatargas on behalf of Qatar Petroleum and the LNG producers in Qatar. It is the biggest project of its kind and one of the largest environmental investments in the world.Qatargas is committed to being a key contributor in the realization of Qatars National Vision 2030 to have a proactive and significant international role in assessing the impact of climate change through the responsible production of LNG while protecting the environment.\l"

It also revealed the great opportunities that are presented by making the transition to a low-carbon economy.Nearly six months on, the challenge is to ensure the Paris Agreement has translated into concrete and swift steps forward. What actions have been taken so far? What remains to be done to ensure pledges are carried out?COP21 and the signing of the Paris Agreement.Why, for example, is it so vital that multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the EBRD take a leading role in stepping up green finance and encouraging the governments of the countries where they invest to make the transition to low-carbon economies?The Paris Agreement placed a major emphasis on the transfer of finance to support climate investments in emerging and developing economies. This is particularly relevant for the EBRD.Our regions average carbon intensity continues to be high almost 5 times higher than the EU-28 average.As a result, the Bank has been scaling-up its climate finance activity over the past year. Cumulative EBRD climate finance since 2006 has reached close to 20 billion and 1,100 projects, with a private sector share of 67 per cent.The EBRD is continuing to support the countries where it operates in implementing their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions under the COP21 accord which are the steps they are planning in order to reduce their own carbon emissions.In order to achieve its ambitious climate finance goals, the EBRD launched its Green Economy Transition approach with the goal of green finance comprising 40 per cent of total Bank investments by 2020. This is the highest target share across MDBs and reflects the EBRDs commitment to make a major contribution in addressing urgent environmental challenges.Lord Stern shares this sense of urgency when it comes to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy and believes that processes for strong acceleration are vital to making the Paris Agreement work.From 1994-99 he was Chief Economist at the EBRD and from 2005-07 was adviser to the UK Government on the Economics of Climate Change and Development, reporting to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Head of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.\l"

The spaces serve as an open public arena where a wealth of innovative ideas on renewable energy and climate adaptation were showcased, with informative stalls where one could learn about the experiences of communities coping with the impacts of climate change from across the world. On Wednesday, while speaking at the launch of this unique space, placed right next to the main venue where the climate treaty was being negotiated, Segolene Royal, France's Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, said that without the participation of civil society there cannot be any change on the ground with regards to addressing the climate change challenge. Both the negotiators who were working on the Paris agreement and people on the ground were equally important for addressing the challenge as one cannot exist without the other, she said. Nicolas Hulot, the President of France's special envoy for the protection of the planet, said that a few days ago when Paris was attacked by terrorists, the sound of their gun fires were heard, but what went unheard was the silence of the survivors who fought back valiantly during the crisis. Emphasising that similarly, the voices of those who were valiantly fighting back the climate crisis world over ought not to be missed, and hence the open space for people to meet, interact and listen to the stories of victims of climate change was created. He stressed that the climate talks would be a failure if civil society did not get a change to be heard and understood, as the problem was identified by them long before governments themselves had recognised it.

Indian Environment, Forests and Climate Change Minister Prakash Javadekar, who is heading the country's delegation, here did not seem to be too upbeat about an agreement. ""Unfortunately, the commitment made by the developed countries on finance and technical support has not come,"" he told a press conference called by the four-member BASIC group of Brazil, South Africa, India and China. He said the basic principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change should not be tinkered with and the requirement of differentiated responsibility should not be done away with. ""It's for the developed world to give money and technical support, and it's for the developing countries to receive,"" Javadekar said adding that it's because ""they have it"" and the developing countries are the ""have nots"". He said that no much headway has been made in finance or technical support. These are the two pillars or the agreement, if one were to emerge in Paris, which would determine the success or otherwise of the conference. So far, the chances seem low. Earlier, Javadekar had told IANS that negotiations were proceeding well, but added that if countries stick to their stated positions, as they had done in the beginning, no agreement could be reached. ""You have to change your positions. If it remains the same, what's the point in negotiating,"" he said ahead of his meeting with the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. For his meeting, he had noted a few points including that the Western countries must show flexibility at this point if the world is to see a Paris agreement. NGOs protest at CoP21 He apparently also told Fabius that India had not yet officially got the text of a possible agreement that had been widely talked about, although the text had been circulated unofficially.

The idea behind the project, she said, is for young people to show the link between climate issues and the impacts they see every day that are affecting their health and access to education. The UN agency recently reported that more than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrences, while 160 million are in high drought severity zones. They see all the contributions from other young people, explained Abaakil, and they understand that the issue is a global one, that they are all connected around the same problem, but also learn from each other, look at the best practices that have been done from different places, and connect. Seven UNICEF youth ambassadors have travelled from all corners of the globe to attend COP21, display their findings, and exchange stories this time in person. One of them is Andozile Simwinga, a driven18-year old Zambian student who said the impacts of climate change on his country are affecting his self-esteem. Things, they dont actually move the way theyre supposed to move and young people are not happy the way they should be, he said energetically. Despite talking about an issue that clearly causes him distress, Simwinga couldnt hide the enthusiasm he feels being in Paris and contributing to this global event. [The effect of climate change] has really made me feel low I go out of my house every day and I look at the environment. People have cut down trees, theres deforestation everywhere. I want to do environmental studies but what am I going to address? What am I going to talk about? What am I going to tell [] my children and also the future generations? We had trees here; we had different types of animals. So it really has affected my self-esteem. Meanwhile, 22-year-old Bellinda Raymond traveled from Malaysia to attend the Conference of Youth prior to heading to COP21. She described herself as an active citizen, someone who engages with members of her indigenous community, especially ahead of major weather events that have the potential to destroy homes and vital surroundings. She said her grandparents werent affected by climate change in the ways she is today. As an indigenous person, we depend on the forest and rivers for our daily life and we also have our traditional system, also related to the climate. The weather is now unpredictable and we need to adapt to the environment thats changing, Raymond said. Asked what the worse effect of climate change has been on her community, she answered floods. Because last time, when the rain came, it was still okay for us, but now just two hours of rain [and] its already flooding and has caused a lot of damage; people cannot go to work, and its difficult to access the outside. As youth ambassadors celebrated Young and Future Generations Day at COP21 on Thursday, government delegations continued to negotiate a new climate agreement which the worlds people hope will be ambitious enough to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, and prevent further degradation of the planet.

Developing world will be tested for planning comprehensively for achieving SDGs and utilise properly the funds provided by the developed world,"" Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said here at the thematic debate on SDGs on Thursday. ""Both groupings will be tested on how they walk the talk and eradicate poverty,"" he added. Javadekar is here to sign the landmark Global Climate Agreement. He said that the processes for follow-up and review of SDGs implementation must remain voluntary, country-led, positive in nature, and should reinforce mutual learning and exchange of best practices. SDGs are 17 individual goals, which were adopted on September 25, 2015 by the UN and target eradication of poverty and hunger, protecting the planet, ensuring prosperity and justice to all. The targets are set to be achieved in the next 15 years. These 17 SDGs and another 169 targets, under '2030 Agenda' are interlinked with the historic Paris climate deal. Javadekar reiterated that $5-7 trillion per annum is required to meet the SDGs globally. ""Total investment needed in developing countries alone could be about USD3.9 trillion per annum, mainly for basic infrastructure, food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, health and education,"" he said. ""For India, as per preliminary estimates, the average financial requirement is USD 565 billion per annum for next 15 years to achieve SDGs,"" he said.

To reach this goal, the Business Dialogue supports among other things a generalization of carbon pricing signals and the development of mature and breakthrough technologies (see below the 10 recommendations in total).The creation of the Business Dialogue was based on the conviction that, in the fight against climate change, the role of the Business Community is key. That creating a solid platform allowing the business sector and the public sector to share opinions on the issues at stake and solutions regarding climate change would allow both parties to have a better understanding of what the already existing solutions that need to be scaled-up are, and where the needs for innovation are.The aim of the Business Dialogue is also to share understanding between public and private leaders on the issues at stake in the negotiations challenges and on barriers to low carbon technologies solutions.Business DialogueFour sessions were programmed, with different partners each time :A first session organized in Paris on May 20th launched the Business Dialogue and allowed an initial discussion on the main issues and progress of climate negotiations and the role of the private sector.It was prepared with the Global Compact and the World Economic Forum.The second session, in New York on September 26th, focused on carbon pricing, sharing implementation experience and exchanging views on possible developments.The third session organized in Tokyo on October 6th focused on the role of technologies in the future agreement and the transition towards low-carbon societies.A fourth session will be held early next year in Morocco, which will organize the COP22.This initiative aims to create an open and flexible exchange ahead of the COP21 and continuing afterwards, with the aim of building a long-term institutional relationship between public and private sectors.\l"

The session, titled ""Sustainable Energy Solutions in the Built Environment - A Dialogue"" is organized by Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), the International District Energy Association (IDEA), Euroheat & Power and Empower Energy Corporation, and will take place from 18:00-18:45 in Agora Hall.The session will be a dynamic discussion between city and business representatives, focusing on the solutions-oriented approach that has enabled cities to utilize clean sustainable fuel sources while implementing and modernizing district energy systems that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. District energy systems involve highly reliable and resilient energy infrastructure that provides efficient, low carbon thermal energy supply to multiple buildings in a city, community or campus. Robert Thornton, IDEA President & CEO, will facilitate the discussion.To help accelerate the ongoing global sustainable energy transition, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) launched the District Energy in Cities Initiative in late 2014 within the framework of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform. This initiative provides capacity building and technical assistance to local governments and their partners, promoting the transfer of policy, finance and technical knowledge to help overcome barriers facing deployment of district energy infrastructure.During Thursday's session, an overview of the District Energy in Cities Initiative will be presented by Maryke van Staden of ICLEI, followed by dialogue among prominent city leaders, including: the Honorable Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, Mayor, City of Malmo, Sweden; Peter Krahl Rydberg, Environmental Strategist, City of Gothenburg, Sweden; Anne Hunt, Environmental Policy Director, City of Saint Paul, Minnesota; along with industry leaders Ahmad Bin Shafar, CEO of Empower Energy Solutions, Dubai, UAE and Paul Voss, Managing Director of Euroheat & Power, Brussels, Belgium.Last week, IDEA released a video outlining how district energy enables a low carbon city through the aggregation of heating and cooling loads of hundreds of buildings, enabling precise control, the adoption of low-carbon technologies, and much higher efficiency than is otherwise possible. The release of this video closely aligns with the emphasis on city-scale planning and local action that will be seen at COP21 in Paris.Rob Thornton, President & CEO of IDEA says, ""It is pretty clear that while climate change is a global challenge, it must be addressed at the local level through more efficient and resilient energy infrastructure in our cities.

But there are some success stories where farmers are leading the way and are finding potential ways to fight climate change. According to the recent study by Lanzhou University in China, the dryland area of the world continues to expand by global warming, and if global emissions continue to rise, dryland area is expected to cover 56 per cent of the world's land surface by 2100. In the deserts of Rajasthan, women farmers are adopting farming methods, which show there is hope to combat climate change impact in the drylands, the ecosystems most adversely affected, and move out of poverty. These efforts are part of the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems, where work is underway in three states of India (Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) to empower farmers and local institutions to build resilient and sustainable farming systems that cope with the vagaries of current and future climate. As reported by Al Jazeera, women leaders like Mani and Rameshwari from the Derasar village in Rajasthan, have been leaders in their community and taken on many innovations such as improved crop varieties including pearl millet and other crops suited to the region; fruit trees to provide nutrition and income; constructing embankments to capture rainfall and prevent runoff and soil erosion; and planting grasses and fodder trees to provide fodder for cattle. Interestingly, new institutional arrangements have been implemented to enable communities to better manage common property resources such as the common grazing lands or to form women's self-help groups to weigh and market livestock for higher income. This success is due to the partnership of different organisations coming together to work for a common cause. Local community and a grassroots organisation GRAVIS (Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti) along with scientific expertise from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) worked closely with the local community. Funding has also been critical coming from CGIAR donors around the world under the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems.

Its my pleasure to address you at the Green Council 15th anniversary ceremony and Hong Kong Green Awards 2015 presentation dinner gala.As we enter the month of December, I cannot help but notice that we have yet to experience the cool temperatures of a typical winter. Indeed, I have not put aside my summer clothes, and perhaps some of us will be disappointed in missing out on the chance to wear the latest winter outfits. But of course the disappearing winter is far more serious than a wardrobe choice; it implies that climate change is an imminent challenge for all of us.In this regard, I am grateful for the work of the Green Council in helping in the fight against climate change. Since its establishment in May 2000, the Council has put forward inspiring green incentives for the industrial and commercial sectors to follow. The Council has awarded its Hong Kong Green Label to environmentally qualified plastic products, electrical appliances, construction materials and more to encourage businesses to supply green products. The Hong Kong Green Award is a further recognition of corporations efforts in green procurement and management practices.Green building is the way forwardI am sure you are aware that today so happens to be Buildings Day, a highlighted feature of the United Nations () in Paris.Buildings Day tells us that the building and construction sectors can play a key part in fighting climate change. New buildings of today are the existing building stock of tomorrow, and failure to pursue sustainable building would lock in growth of greenhouse gas emissions for decades. Indeed, more than 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are building-related, and emissions could double by 2050 if we do nothing with our buildings.International collaborative efforts in ParisAs we speak, more than 190 countries at COP21More than 50,000 participants from governments, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations are discussing possible reform measures to make this goal a reality. In particular, we expect green buildings will be at the top of their agenda.Hong Kong is also a member of the global village, and that is why the Secretary for the Environment is co-ordinating a party of 10 as part of the Chinese delegation at COP21.As a prelude to COP21, our nation unveiled its climate pledge in June this year. China will lower carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 per cent by 2030 from the 2005 level, together with a pledge to peak carbon emissions around 2030. This shows our commitments in the global green movement.Green buildings in Hong KongBack in Hong Kong, we intend to learn from the experiences at , and put them into practice by adopting green building reforms. This is a step forward to meet our Energy Saving Plan pledge, which targets a 40 per cent reduction in energy intensity by 2025 using 2005 as the base. Allow me to elaborate further on four aspects.First, the Government has taken the lead in promoting green government buildings. To meet this Energy Saving Plan pledge, we will strive to reduce electricity consumption in government buildings by 5 per cent by 2020 using 2014 as the base year, based on a host of measures.New government buildings with construction floor area above 5,000 square metres are to achieve a high grading under recognised green building labelling schemes. We have also extended the maximum payback period for energy efficiency measures for new government buildings from nine years to 12 years. The longer payback period encourages the use of more new and innovative energy efficient features, such as building management systems.Second, we strive to extend the life span of existing buildings by turning them to other uses. This is to avoid extensive demolition and reconstruction works.As we all know, the 27-storey Murray Building was where the Development Bureau was situated before it was relocated to the Central Government Offices at Tamar. When Murray Building was vacated in 2012, it was largely retained and subsequently sold for conversion into a hotel, retaining much of its architectural merits and energy efficient features.Three government buildings in Wan Chai, namely Revenue Tower, Wanchai Tower and Immigration Tower, will also have their 10,000 staff relocated to create new Grade A office space. We envision that the towers will not be torn down, which would result in much wastage, and the towers will be refurbished instead to suit future commercial needs.Indeed, retrocommissioning can help improve the energy efficiency of equipment and lighting systems in an existing building. A building upgrade can even help rectify problems that stem from the design and construction stages.The commercial sector has also done its part in green buildings with regard to its developments. Taikoo Place, one of Hong Kongs best-planned business hubs, offering 550,000 square metres of prime commercial place, has been recognised for its excellence in urban planning and environmental sustainability. Two International Finance Centre, with its almost column-free floors to maximise natural light penetration, was awarded Gold Certification by the US Green Building Council.Third, it is not just buildings that need reworking. With a broader regional perspective, we seek to apply district-wide green technology like the District Cooling System (DCS) in Kowloon East to reduce power consumption. The DCS is an energy-efficient air-conditioning system which consumes 35 per cent less electricity compared to traditional air-cooled air-conditioning systems and 20 per cent less electricity than individual water-cooled air-conditioning systems using cooling towers. The system helps us achieve the new Energy Saving Target by reducing energy intensity.Finally, we are working to expand the green concept from development areas to our comprehensive Hong Kong development framework.The Government is now updating Hong Kongs holistic development strategy, known as Hong Kong 2030+: Towards a Planning Vision and Strategy Transcending 2030. We have aspirations to make Hong Kong a smart, green and resilient city, and aim to optimise the use of transport infrastructure to reduce commuting demand. More integrated green and blue spaces will be explored as part of planning for a more sustainable Hong Kong.In the process, we will not sacrifice housing demand for green developments. Rather, an environmentally friendly city creates synergy among communities, and provides the necessary green spaces for citizens to settle comfortably.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, I am sure you will agree with me that green buildings can not only revitalise a city, but also make a substantial difference to the world.Last but not least, I wish the Green Council every success in the years to come, and congratulate all awardees for your dedication to the green movement.

However, an audio-visual address of hers was delivered by her senior-most disciple.Representing Amma - as the spiritual leader is fondly known amongst her legion of admirers - at the summit was her most senior disciple, Swami Amritaswarupananda, who is vice-chairman of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, founded in the Kollam district of Kerala.The swami noted that the expertise of 62-year-old Amma's global organisation, embracing the world, in sustainable development and its long-standing history of interfaith cooperation has made it an important partner and voice in the conversation on how faith organisations may assist in modelling a pivot towards sustainable decision-making for the faithful, as well as for corporations, governments and society as a whole.Overall, the Paris summit of the world's major spiritual, religious and moral leaders emphasised the urgent need for a strong universal appeal and support for effective policies prior to the COP21 conference taking place in the French capital later this year.Amma was recently one of the spiritual leaders invited by Pope Francis to sign the Faith Leaders' Universal Declaration against Slavery at the Vatican in December 2014.

This investment indicates our broader business case for restoration which encompasses the value of the ecosystem services and the need to have an inclusive approach with the community. As we learn and evolve our approach, we continue to deliver environmental benefits, economic opportunity through jobs and infrastructure, as well as social progress for local communities,"" said Anderson Tanoto, Shareholder of APRIL Group and RGE Director.The RER restoration area has been largely protected from burning during the last fire and haze season, one of the worst to have hit Southeast Asia, which indicates the effectiveness of APRIL's landscape approach, supporting the case for further investment.APRIL Group's conservation and restoration activities delivered and committed now account for 400,000 ha - 150,000 in restoration and 250,000 in conservation - of forest in Indonesia, an area close to six times the size of Singapore, while nearly matching its commercial plantation area. This 1-for-1 goal of conservation to plantation is one of the commitments made by the company under its strengthened Sustainable Forest Management Policy (SFMP) announced six months ago, which ensured deforestation was eliminated from its supply chain.The RER programme, which was established by APRIL Group in partnership with Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and local NGO Bidara in 2013, protects and restores important peatland areas on the Kampar Peninsula in Indonesia's Riau Province under eco-restoration licenses granted by the Indonesian Government.""The partners involved in the RER project hope that it will be a living, working blueprint -- an evolving example of what other public and private sector organisations can achieve more broadly through strong partnerships and bold vision,"" said Dr.Tony Whitten, Asia-Pacific Regional Director at Fauna & Flora International.Indonesia's peatland areas are some of the most sensitive ecosystems in the world, while the Kampar Peninsula landscape is one of the largest peatland areas in Southeast Asia. Kampar's tropical forests are rich in biodiversity and support endangered wildlife species, including the Sumatran tiger and sun bear.Drawing on the expertise of APRIL Group, FFI and Bidara as well as local communities, RER employs a four-phase model of protection, assessment, restoration and management to rejuvenate previously degraded areas of forest and peatland. This model, complemented by APRIL's Fire Free Village Programme and water management strategies, ensured that the Kampar Peninsula largely remained free of fire during the recent haze crisis.Source: APRIL Group\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India173","COP21","October 15, 2015 Thursday","Tendernews.com","Belgium ,Oct. 15 -- As both energy producers and consumers, local and regional authorities are crucial to help creating a European Energy Union that is resilient and competitive. Their full involvement is essential for the success of this project, something which should be reflected through their participation in the energy regulatory authorities at national and European levels. This is what emerges from the position of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) on the Energy Union package adopted today, which also calls for a European definition of energy poverty and for ambitious action to promote smart grids. Last February the European Commission launched one of its flagship initiatives: its strategy for the creation of a European Energy Union intended to give Europe a secure, affordable, competitive and climate-friendly supply of energy. According to the CoR rapporteur Pascal Mangin (FR/EPP), Member of Alsace Regional Council, The Energy Union is a tremendous opportunity to reshape energy policy at the European level. By taking account of the involvement of local and regional authorities and operators and of Member States' powers, the EU aims to offer energy at competitive prices to our fellow citizens and companies, while making the Union less reliant on fossil fuels. The Committee of the Regions intends to participate fully in this work through the expertise and capacity for action of the authorities it represents"" . This is the aim of the opinion adopted at today s CoR plenary session. Engage local governments to ensure that the territorial dimension is incorporated into the future Energy Union, the CoR calls for local and regional authorities to be represented in national regulatory authorities and in the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. The CoR also wishes to be involved in the work of the Energy Infrastructure Forum that the Commission will be setting up in the near future. The CoR in addition suggests considering the creation, in close cooperation with the Covenant of Mayor, of a ""territorial forum"" that would draw together local initiatives, disseminate best practices and encourage innovative financing. Energy efficiency and funding at local level the CoR welcomes the priority attached to improving energy efficiency but emphasises that this requires sound financial tools and a favourable regulatory environment for projects carried out at the local level. The CoR therefore calls for funds and financial instruments from the EU and the EIB to support not only large infrastructure projects but also smaller projects, whilst taking into account their added value for local authorities. Putting consumers at the heart of the strategy the CoR draws attention to the needs of vulnerable consumers and therefore calls for a common definition of energy poverty and for European indicators in order to develop targeted policies for each region or territory. The Committee also emphasises the need for concerted action on smart grids and smart metering, as tools to benefit consumers. Key role of research and innovation.The CoR acknowledges the strategic role of innovation in energy technology with a view to the successful decarbonisation of the EU's energy system. It reiterates that innovation and research in renewable energies, soft mobility, the modernisation of existing energy infrastructure and the construction of smart electricity plants should be promoted at the local level.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India174","Will climate-induced migration feature at COP21?","November 20, 2015 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 20 -- One of the biggest events coming up in Paris, only two weeks after terror attacks on November 13, is the 21st meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP) for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In a span of 23 years from the 1992 Rio Conference and COP21 in 2015, global leaders have met almost annually. What is surprising is the complete silence on the issue of climate-induced human migration.Any follower of climate change negotiations will be familiar with the much discussed terms of ""mitigation"" and ""adaptation"" to cope with climate change. But there is hardly ever any agenda on ""migration"". It is worth discussing whether migration can be considered as a failure of adaptation or as a part of adaptation strategy. The UN High Commission on Refugees is yet to consider climate-induced migrants as ""climate refugees"". But logically speaking, they do qualify as a new category, besides other forms of refugees resulting from religious or ethnic conflicts or partition of a country.In India, the UPA-led Central government had announced the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008 with eight targeted missions to be achieved by 2020. Four other missions were added to the list by the NDA government in 2014. None of these 12 missions are focused on dealing with climate-induced human migration. Even the State Level Climate Change Action Plan (SAPCC), developed by 28 out of 29 states (except the newly born Telangana), one does not find any mention of this vital issue.In reality, thousands of people are forced to migrate after every climate-induced disaster. Unfortunately, neither the state government nor academic institutions have conducted any empirical studies on such human migration, except for some studies carried out by academicians and NGOs post-cyclone Aila in the Indian Sundarbans Delta after 2009 and on migrants from islands facing rising sea levels in the same region before 2009.Data indicates that such victims face several hardships and an uncertain future. Since most of them are farmers and fishers, they have no option but to work as unskilled labour when they migrate. Ensuring skill development of these vulnerable people is, therefore, the most vital need.The Delta Vision 2050 document of WWF-India predicts the migration of 1.2 million people from the Indian Sundarbans Delta. It is time to look into these areas and develop an action plan. Globally, if one were to look at the small island nations or the most vulnerable deltas inhabited by millions of people who perhaps had no role in the greenhouse gas emissions that are changing the world's climate, a much larger picture of probable human misery would emerge.

(AP)After two weeks of intense negotiations and years of acrimonious debate, more than 190 countries Saturday adopted a new agreement on climate change that could force lasting changes on economic activities across the world and on the way people lead their lives.Countries had come to Paris promising to deliver an agreement, and late Saturday evening succeeded in doing that after almost 48 hours of backroom negotiations since Thursday night.""It is the moment of truth,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who presided over the conference, said earlier in the day as he released a draft agreement text, the fifth and the last one that had come out during the course of this climate meet.There were ecstatic reactions across the conference venue in Le Bourget just outside Paris, as Fabius announced that the agreement had been adopted. Ministers and negotiators from across the world stood up and clapped to welcome the announcement.""We are happy to note that all concerns of India have been taken on board,"" India's Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said earlier in the evening.As negotiators gathered in the meeting room for the final time Saturday evening, the body language of the ministers and negotiators suggested that no further obstacle was being seen.There were hugs and kisses, and selfies, all around, with the US Secretary of State John Kerry and former US Vice President Al Gore much in demand. Delegates, including Javadekar, went around the meeting room, shaking hands and congratulating each other.The climate agreement is aimed at reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, sufficiently fast to keep the global average temperatures from rising beyond 2 degrees, possibly 1.5 degrees, from pre-industrial times.The Paris agreement, as it will be called, is much more comprehensive than the Kyoto Protocol which was limited to assigning greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for developed countries which are held responsible for global warming because of their uncontrolled emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution.This agreement asks every country to take climate actions - emission reductions or even just adaptation efforts - and inform the world about what it is doing.Developed countries are supposed to do more than the developing countries and are required to take absolute emission reductions. Developed countries are also required to mobilise financial resources and help the developing world in dealing with the impacts of climate change.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India176","Include health in the COP21 agenda","December 5, 2015 Saturday","Hindustan Times","New Delhi, Dec. 5 -- The figures speak for themselves: The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2030, we will see hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide annually due to climate change - be it from the effects of natural disasters, malnutrition, or the rise of infectious diseases. The consequences of global warming are already in evidence today, as highlighted in the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change Report, published in June. From heat waves to floods, from hurricanes to storms, extreme weather events are intensifying and affecting every continent. These catastrophes not only cause immediate death by the thousands, but are also the root cause of many deaths due to polluted water sources and drinking water contaminated by cholera, a disease that kills 120,000 people a year. In Europe, the heat waves of 2003 and 2015 caused thousands of deaths. Likewise, countries such as India and Australia have not been spared from similar disasters in recent years.A global temperature increase could mean the expansion of regions conducive to the spread of diseases, such as malaria. Today, nearly a third of humanity is exposed to this disease, which kills 600,000 people each year - mostly children under the age of five and expectant mothers. If we take the example of India, in 2014, there were more than 1.1 million cases of malaria.Currently, the anopheles mosquito, which carries malaria, is confined to specific areas of Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia, but an increase in average global temperatures would extend its survival zone. This, combined with the globalisation, would quickly increase the risk of malarial infection to new areas. This disease could reach the heights of Kilimanjaro or the Andean highlands and spread in Central Asia.It is the same for the tiger mosquito, which transmits chikungunya and dengue. Today, there are 50 million cases of dengue each year, and the WHO estimates that more than two and a half billion people are exposed to it. According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, in India there were 40,571 cases of dengue and 16,049 cases of chikungunya. Climate change also has serious consequences on sanitation, causing migration from the hardest hit global zones. Climate refugees, forced to leave their homes, may be exposed to new diseases. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major risk in this regard. Today, TB causes 1.4 million deaths a year and is a common disease among migrants. In 2013, WHO reported 2.6 million TB cases in India and 40% of the population had latent TB that could become active as a result of natural disaster. It's inevitable: If the mean temperature continues to rise, combined with large surges in migration, it will lead to an increased risk of the spread of disease.Those few facts outl"

Drought and competition for increasingly scarce resources caused by manmade activities also played a role in the refugee crisis which has seen thousands of people leave the Middle East and cross Europe in recent months, the Prince of Wales said. The remarks were made in an interview with Sky News recorded before the latest wave of terror attacks in Paris, which was broadcast on Monday.The Prince, 67, said: ""We're seeing a classic case of not dealing with the problem, because, I mean, it sounds awful to say, but some of us were saying 20 something years ago that if we didn't tackle these issues you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that people have to move.""And, in fact, there's very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria, funnily enough was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land"".Asked by Royal Correspondent Rhiannon Mills if there was a direct link between climate change, conflict and terrorism, the heir to the throne replied: ""It's only in the last few years that the Pentagon have actually started to pay attention to this. I mean it has a huge impact on what is happening. I mean the difficulty is sometimes to get this point across ? that if we just leave it and say, well there are obviously lots of, there are endless problems arising all over the place therefore we deal with them in a short term way, we never deal with the underlying root cause which regrettably is what we're doing to our natural environment.""The Prince is expected to deliver a keynote speech at the United Nations climate change conference or COP21He drew comparisons between the current state of the environment and the global financial crisis, and said: ""The trouble is if we don't, this is the awful thing, if we don't it's going to get so much worse, then life will become very, very complicated indeed, and what we're experiencing now will be as nothing to the problems. ""I mean the difficulties in 2008 with the financial crash ? that was a banking crisis. But we're now facing a real possibility of nature's bank going bust. If you see it like that, we've been putting so much pressure on the natural systems and all those aspects of nature that we take for granted.""Obviously I try to be as optimistic as possible, but sometimes you think that ? do we really have to face catastrophes and chaos before we understand that real action needs to be taken?

It becomes more so when it directly or indirectly affects public health and causes premature deaths. According to an estimate by the World Health Organization, climate change alone is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths every year.According to the international health agency, there is every reason to worry as people are dying as a result of heat waves, floods, deteriorating air quality, shortage of food and water supplies and poor sanitation-all brought about by climate change.Against such a backdrop, the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21Deaths and climate changeFurther, it has been predicted that climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. The most vulnerable groups will be children, women and the poor in lower-income countries.AK Ghosh, director of the Centre for Environment & Development, a Kolkata-based non-profit, admitted that climate change is a ""major issue"", particularly so in India, as there is a huge concern about the rise in vector-borne diseases due to it. He cited the instance of the housefly which can increase in number due to poor sanitary conditions and cause enteric diseases. As a result of climate change, ""there is a high price to be paid in the public health sector"", he said.Under such circumstances, combating climate change can bring about health gains. By reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (black carbon and methane) and by achieving higher vehicle emissions and efficiency standards, approximately 2.4 million lives can be saved per year year.Looking forward to climate actionIn the backdrop of COP-21, countries have made important commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and scale up adaptation measures to fight climate change, but more needs to be done.The profiles show that a combination of emissions and weak protection measures will expose an additional 7 million people annually in Bangladesh to coastal flooding and its associated health risks between 2070 and 2100. In Nigeria, implementing measures to reduce pollutants can prevent almost 70,000 premature deaths per year from outdoor air pollution from 2030 onwards.But there is also a way out. Declining carbon emissions will help reduce climate change, Ghosh said.According to him, people also suffer from lack of nutrition due to climate change. He gave the example of Sundarbans where lands became fallow post Aila and were deemed unfit for paddy cultivation. People were forced to buy food which increased their debt burden. The situation gave rise to malnutrition due to food shortage and the former is linked to diseases.

But there are some success stories where farmers are leading the way and are finding potential ways to fight climate change, says the city-based International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT).Citing a recent study by Lanzhou University in China, the ICRISAT says dryland areas of the world continue to expand by global warming, and if global emissions continue to rise, dryland area is expected to cover 56 percent of the world's land surface by 2100.However, in the deserts of Rajasthan, women farmers are adopting farming methods, which show there is hope to combat climate change impact in the drylands, the ecosystems most adversely affected, and move out of poverty.The Thar desert, spread over an area of 320,000 sq km, covers 60% of the state. The region faces water scarcity for 9 to 11 months in a year and frequent droughts (1 in 2.5 years). These efforts are part of the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems, where work is under way in three states of India (Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) to empower farmers and local institutions to build resilient and sustainable farming systems that cope with the vagaries of current and future climate.Women leaders like Mrs Mani and Mrs Rameshwari from the Derasar village in Rajasthan, have been leaders in their community and taken on many innovations such as improved crop varieties including pearl millet and other crops suited to the region; fruit trees to provide nutrition and income; constructing embankments to capture rainfall and prevent run off and soil erosion; and planting grasses and fodder trees to provide fodder for cattle.Interestingly, new institutional arrangements have been implemented to enable communities to better manage common property resources such as the common grazing lands or to form women's self-help groups to weigh and market livestock for higher income.This success is due to the partnership of different organizations coming together to work for a common cause. Local community and a grassroots organisation GRAVIS (Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti) along with scientific expertise from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) worked closely with the local community. Funding has also been critical coming from CGIAR donors around the world under the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems.""The strategy takes women's needs into account by working directly with them.

It was widely agreed that the new policy must include energy transformation and a stable and more predictable regulatory framework for projects.Energy leaders made wide ranging contributions, including European Commissioner Violeta Bulc who described in a keynote speech the importance of energy transformation, the national challenge of low carbon transport and the opportunities for new projects.The Minister for Energy, Peter Gaspersic, said: ""We are committed to incorporating the national energy goals and the ambitious targets set at the Paris COP21 talks into our national energy policies and into the Energy Concept of Slovenia, which is in preparation.""Franc Zlahtic, Chair of the Slovenian member committee, is convinced that: ""The Slovenian energy industry is in good economic health and able to deliver energy transformation and the new projects that are needed.""Representatives from industry went on to highlight some of the challenges they thought needed to be addressed which included fragmentation and lack of connection between projects. This was then followed with examples from European countries where energy companies have overcome these challenges as in Germany where they have integrated energy projects and in this way transformed their activities.Finally, Sibil Svilan, Director of the Slovenian Bank, Slovenska izvozna in razvojna banka, (SID), a national financial hub, talked about how to use European funds and instruments such as the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) which can yield finance for energy related projects.The conclusions resulting from the conference, which was also supported by the Slovenian Ministry for Infrastructure and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, were: Establish a sustainable and environmentally friendly national energy policy that provides a predictable regulatory framework for project managers.

Here, IESS would become an effective tool for understanding implications of the choices made.Dr. Bibek Debroy, Member, NITI Aayog, said that IESS would soon be available as a mobile app. IESS would allow sensitivity analysis with its contingent of future assumptions. The tool provides hundreds of scenarios with different combinations of levels/efficiencies of energy demand and supply sectors, enabling to define the future energy consumption.Y.K. Modi, Past President, FICCI and Executive Chairman & Managing Director, Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited, said that IESS 2047 aims at providing a clearer picture of the emerging energy demand scenarios in India. In comparison to its first version, the new version includes updated data sets, new technologies, additional sectors gaining importance and also additional implications like costs of energy choices to the economy.Sashi K. Mukundan, Regional President and Head of Country, India, BP Group, said that the twin challenges in the energy sector are rising dependency on imports and increase in greenhouse gases owing to India's move towards becoming a developed nation.Hence, it becomes imperative to look for right energy mix and IESS would allow the government, industry to think tanks to identify alternate policy options and also quantify the outcome of those policies for sustainable and clean growth.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Kashmir Images.

"COP21","India","COP21_India183","United Arab Emirates : Innovative Smart Meters to make Power Grids Smart and Secure","January 8, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","As smart electric meters are rolled out across the globe to improve power grid reliability and energy efficiency, an important feature of the smart meter is being explored by Masdar Institute researchers: security.Smart electric meters measure and record electricity usage at hourly intervals and send that data to both the utility and consumer at least once daily, helping them track and analyze energy consumption to achieve greater energy conservation. Smart meters also play an extremely important role in integrating electricity generated by renewable energy sources, like the sun, into national power grids by managing renewables intermittent supply on a decentralized distribution network.As more and more countries increase their share of clean electricity following from the pledges made recently in Paris during the (), smart meters will become essential, underscoring the need for reliable and secure smart metering systems that are resilient against security threats.Smart meters will bring significant benefits to the utility companies that provide electricity, the customers that use them and the governments that employ them, but if not safeguarded properly, the data delivered back and forth through smart metering systems could potentially be accessed by the wrong people and misused, explained Dr. Zeyar Aung, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Masdar Institute. He was part of a team of researchers studying how to improve the security of smart meters with a technology known as machine learning. Their results were recently published in the IEEE Systems Journal.Dr. Aung tackled this security issue by programing a smart meter with data mining and machine learning algorithms, which allow it to detect an intruder, or any abnormal activity that might indicate someone is trying to access the data illegally.The algorithms are designed to analyze network traffic on the smart meters and predict whether the traffic is normal or abnormal.Once an attack is detected, the smart meter can do two things; either we can program it to automatically shut down the connection or we can program it to notify the network administrator about the event, Dr. Aung said. Either method will help reduce the incidence of intrusion into consumers smart meters.Programming these smart meters to be smart enough to detect intruders is not as easy as it seems. The challenge lies in smart meters severely limited internal computing resources and capabilities. Smart meters are less powerful than our smart phones, said Dr. Aung. They are equipped with very slow processors and a small amount of memory, so we had to design algorithms that can perform data analysis with these very limited resources.Dr. Aungs intrusion detection system has outperformed several other smart meter security systems in terms of detection rate, which serves to demonstrate Masdar Institutes strong research capabilities in the critical and evolving research areas of machine learning and data mining. Research in these areas is helping to solve increasingly complex problems with applications in energy management, environmental forecasting, and several other sectors that involve incredibly large data sets.As smart meters gradually replace older, conventional electric meters around the world in the UK, all homes are expected to have smart meters by 2019, and an estimated 65 million smart meters are currently installed in the United States the smart meters market is expected to reach US$18.2 billion by 2019, according to a report by MarketsandMarkets. Smart meter installations in the UAE are also increasing, with 120,000 smart meters currently linked to the national power network and Dubai planning to have one million smart meters deployed by 2020.Masdar Institutes research in information science with applications to secure smart metering could prove to be a valuable resource for the UAEs emerging knowledge economy. The work gives the country a significant understanding and capability in the advanced aspects of smart meter operation and contributes to the UAEs excellence in sustainability and valuable high-tech markets.\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India191","COP21 climate conference: The long road to Paris","October 25, 2015 Sunday","DNA","It has been a good year so far with global political and community leaders and business decision makers opening up on the climate change issue. Following up on his 'first of a kind' encyclical on environmental degradation, the Pope went a step further during his recent visit to the US, by clarifying that ""climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation"". Whether the legions of fossil fuel advocates dismissing climate change (including some of USA's leading Republican Presidential contenders) now risk damnation is a matter of papal jurisdiction.Moving away from matters of purgatory, the world is heading to Paris this December for the 21st annual Conference of Parties (). An estimated 50,000 participants from across 190 countries - including government delegates, business leaders, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society representatives - will come together over a two-week period with the aim to secure a legally-binding and universal agreement on climate change. The COP21 agenda is straightforward: secure human wellbeing by addressing the threats posed by climate change and identify solutions to keep global warming below 2C.Don't let the simplicity of the economic and humane rationale behind the need for safeguarding vulnerable populations and livelihoods fool you. It has taken decades of arduous convincing for political and business decision-makers to finally acknowledge and comprehend the nature of such risks. Consider the following.In 1972, governments first came together to sign the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Better known as the Stockholm Declaration, this was the first document in international environmental law to recognize the right to a healthy environment. In subsequent decades, the Vienna Convention of 1985 and Montreal Protocol of 1987 proved the potential of international cooperation in addressing planetary challenges. But it was not until 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that civil society actors in consensus with global governments were able to display the necessary political will to give shape to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). One of the key binding aspects of this treaty was that it required its signatories to meet annually at a Conference of Parties (COP) to assess global progress in addressing human activity driven climate change.While COP has received fair bit of criticism in its effectiveness in addressing climate change issues, from time to time we have witnessed moments of negotiating nous and multi-sectoral cooperation emerging to lend strength to global efforts in adapting to and mitigating climate change (see figure).The first COP in 1995 culminated in the adoption of the 'Berlin Mandate' and in establishing that developed countries were responsible for a large share of historic and existing levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It laid the ground for future negotiations on the premise that any potential solution would require significant efforts from developed nations as opposed to forcing developing countries to undertake mitigations detrimental to their developmental goals. The first real breakthrough was achieved in 1997, at COP3 in Kyoto, Japan, in the form of the 'Kyoto Protocol', which introduced voluntary targets on capping GHG emissions for 37 developed countries effective up to 2008 and 2012. Subsequent COPs have attempted to negotiate and resolve technical aspects such as establishing binding GHG targets, extending the Kyoto targets post its expiration in 2012, and adopting a framework for post-2012 international climate change cooperation.As expected, the most defiant challenges to international climate change solutions have been from the largest emitters. Between President Clinton signing the Kyoto Treaty, the US Congress not ratifying it, President Bush rejecting it outright, and President Obama's rather inadequate attempt at salvaging COP15 with the help of BRICS nations - the US has swayed between displaying political will in addressing climate change to rejecting it outright. Moreover, even amongst emerging economic giants such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (together the BRICS) there has been significant recalcitrance to establishing legally-binding commitments to emissions reduction targets. Despite past failures in bringing on-board the largest historical emitter and the current large emitters; the COP remains the one platform that continues to offer opportunities for future negotiations.To get the world on to a 2C emissions path requires a fundamentally different investment landscape. The failure of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has raised only $10.2 billion out of the proposed $100 billion in pledges, is another issue that requires urgent attention. With global economies underperforming in the face of persistent shocks, excuses for failing to raise requisite finances for GCF are only going to get pronounced. Let us not forget that in 2013 alone, fossil fuel subsidies totalled $550 billion - more than four times those to renewable energy. This is what needs to change.There is much that needs to be done when it comes to safeguarding current and future generations from climate change. It is characteristic of climate change that the countries with populations most vulnerable to it are also the countries which are seeking and are yet to see the benefits of a globalised economy. Developed countries need to step up to fill this chasm if there is to remain any chance of reconciliation. We are already witnessing the adverse impacts of climate change shape up at a rate much faster than what scientists earlier predicted. Forget adhering to the 2C above pre-industrial level limit; failure to achieve significant consensus on a framework for tackling climate change might throw us onto a 4C trajectory - a cataclysmic shift for vulnerable communities and possibly, entire countries. Any agreement at the global level must achieve binding region-specific emissions targets and ensure 'equity' in responsibility. Developed nations have to lead the way. Indeed many are.Table.1. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Emissions Cuts Proposed by Key CountriesChina 2005 2030 C02 60-65%European Union 1990 2030 GHG 40%Japan 2013 2030 GHG 26%Switzerland 1990 2030 GHG 50%United States 2005 2025 GHG 26-28%What about India?Key countries party to climate change negotiations have already pledged deep emissions cuts into the future (see Table.1.). But where in all this does India figure? Although not required to commit to any binding target as a result of its status as a developing 'non-Annex' country; India's fast growing economic status coupled with its vulnerability to climate change and regional and international aspirations dictate that the country be a significant and contributing partner to any future climate change framework. Historically India has failed to acknowledge its own contribution to climate change - pointing to its low per capita emissions (estimated at 1.56 MT in 2010) as scientific evidence. This is a statistical misnomer at best, considering that approximately 69% India's population still resides in rural regions with intermittent, if any, access to electricity and public infrastructure and lives fairly rudimentary lifestyles dependent on direct access to nature for fuel, food and fibre. It is inevitable that India's total and per capita emissions will continue to increase at rate beyond which is sustainable as rural populations begin to demand better lifestyles and share of benefits of India's economic growth. Table.2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Emissions Cuts Proposed by IndiaDescription Base Year Target Year Measure Depth of cut/ increase Decrease Emisison Intensity of GDP 2005 2030 GHG 33-35%Increase Cumulative electric Power Installed Capacity from Non-Fossil Fuel Sources - 2030 0 40%Create Additional Carbon Sink - 2030 CO2 equivalent 2.5-3 billion tonnesCOP21. Rising to this challenge, India's INDC (released on the October 1, 2015) embodies a bold action plan for the future (see Table.2.). But merely making bold statements are COP21 is not enough. Key for India will be to deliver on its promises by building necessary capacity in renewables at regional and national levels; revise existing policies concerning natural resources extraction; and establish a process of continuous monitoring and evaluation with accountability to ensure these targets are achieved on time and that consistent defaulters are penalised for their failures.In the coming weeks, readers can look to this space for further analysis on key sectors and policies, including impacts of existing practices and recommendations for addressing climate change.It has taken the world a long time to arrive at this juncture - twenty one years to be precise - and all roads lead to Paris this December.

Nuclear power has a low impact on human health and the environment, as compared to other sources of electricity, especially fossil fuels.Future nuclear technologies can further reduce the volume and radioactivity of high level radioactive waste. However, nuclear energy does require a significant amount of water for cooling, but higher efficiencies in advanced technologies can reduce these needs in the future, Stankeviciute added.Nuclear energy also contributes to sustainable development in a societal context, said Stankeviciute. It creates economic growth and new jobs. Skilled labour is necessary to design and operate nuclear power plants. The IAEA is currently working on a detailed report on the nexus between nuclear power and sustainable development.This echoes the statement by IAEA Deputy Director General Mikhail Chudakov earlier this week to consider nuclear energy as sustainable energy because it has low life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and has the potential, with innovative technologies, to serve humanity and bolster development effectively for a very long time.By addressing key Sustainable Development Goals, nuclear energy has potential macro-economic benefits, said David Shropshire, Head of the Planning and Economic Studies Section of the IAEA, at the side event. The IAEA is looking at developing tools, training courses and expert and review missions to help Member States analyze these macro-economic benefits.

"COP21","India","COP21_India198","COP21: Technology Innovation is Key to Meeting Stringent Environmental Targets","December 7, 2015 Monday 6:30 AM EST","India Energy News","Dec. 7 -- With the United Nations meeting in full swing, all eyes are on global climate change targets and policies. As energy production accounts for two thirds of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, reduction of carbon emissions in the energy sector is of paramount importance.The International Energy Agency (IEA) has recently released its latest World Energy Outlook report (November 2015). This follows the previous report released in June, which revealed some of the key pillars that are being focused on, during the hopefully successful COP21: Continued investment and innovation in renewable energy technologies Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas productionWhat has become clear throughout this process is the vital role energy efficiency is playing in achieving vital carbon emission reductions. In fact, the latest report from the IEA suggests that energy efficiency of new equipment bought worldwide in 2030 can be increased by a further 11%, whether this is across transport, or the manufacturing of energy intensive products such as steel or plastics. While 2030 may seem like a long way into the future, many steps are already been taken to increase efficiencies across multiple industries, with technology being the key driver. Below are two key examples.Emissions reductions and fuel efficiency in the marine sectorAchieving carbon emission reduction goals will require hard work and the introduction of new technologies to increase energy efficiency in industry, construction and transportation. Progress has already been made on this, with efficiency measures in OECD countries reducing demand growth to 60% of what would otherwise be expected.The sheer scale of the international shipping industry, however, means that greenhouse gas emissions are high. Vessel owners are already taking a number of steps to reduce emissions through initiatives such as installing electric power and propulsion systems, and switching to alternative fuels, which can dramatically reduce fuel consumption and operating costs.Electric propulsion is not new - it has been used in ships since the early 1900s - originally to facilitate the reversal of the ship propeller at a time of limited gearbox manufacturing capability, but its importance is even more crucial today as fleet costs soar and emissions targets become more stringent. And its use is proven, with the US Navy predicting lifetime fuel savings of around $250 million through the implementation of electric propulsion on its amphibious assault ship, the USS Makin Island - drastically reducing the carbon emissions emitted through decreased use of fuel. Even upgrading existing systems such as dynamic positioning can save operators up to 10% in fuel usage which over time can significantly reduce a ship's carbon footprint.Increasing innovation and continued investment in renewablesAccording to the IEA report, renewables accounted for nearly half of all new power generation capacity in 2014. Investment remains strong at $270 billion and is set to increase to $400 billion by 2030. Although considered zero carbon, there are still efficiency measures which can be taken across the renewables industry to increase output and reduce the cost of energy.Advances in inverter technology, for example, are making substantial contributions to lowering the cost of solar production, with 1.5kV inverters now on the market that can help increase output capabilities by up to 50% compared to the industry standard 1kV inverters. Technologies such as this are set to contribute to global solar capacity reaching 930GW by 2040.It is critical that we get the future of energy right, but the journey to get there is as important as the destination itself. With the measures proposed by the IEA and the various ways in which we are working towards meeting these proposals, we have based our journey on solid grounds which gives us the confidence of reaching our destination and meeting stringent environmental targets.Source: Converteam India Private Limited (GE Energy)\l"

Since its launch in May 2013, the Group has offered its assessment of the energy market situation in Europe and made constructive proposals to the European Commission and political leaders on how to remedy the identified problems relating to the functioning of the internal energy market and emission trading system.The Magritte Group organized a conference in Paris on 8 December in the context of the COP21 meeting and issued the statement below, calling for comprehensive implementation of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme as the main tool to combat climate change. It also calls for an ambitious international climate agreement and a carbon price signal to boost fair competition and investments in low-carbon power generation.For a global deal in Paris - Supporting the momentum generated at COP 21, today, CEOs from major European energy companies show their commitment towards a global deal on the fight against climate change. It is time for action as global warming could lead to catastrophe and inflict permanent damage on the balance of life on Earth. Keeping global warming below 2C is an absolute necessity, widely supported. Therefore the Magritte Group is calling for a far reaching and ambitious international climate agreement at COP 21 to provide the general framework for the long term as well as visibility and coherence to climate policies. The role of a carbon price signal, should also be acknowledged as a tool to ensure a level playing field worldwide.From a damaged European carbon market to a swift recovery - In the past two years, CEOs have raised their concern about the losing credibility of the European carbon market. They have played an active role in its reform and strongly welcome the agreements reached on back-loading1 and on the Market Stability Reserve. These agreements constituted important first steps towards the deeply needed restructuring of the European carbon market.Further pursuing this mobilization, the Magritte Group stresses the need for a strengthened European CO2 market signal with the aim of providing industry with a visible scenario for its present and future long-term investments. This is a prerequisite to restore confidence in the system and activate its full benefit to climate policy.Concrete commitment of the energy industry to combating climate change - CEOs are committed to shaping a low carbon energy future and investing in low carbon and efficient technologies to reach the climate goals. Research, technological development and innovation have a key role to play in the process of a competitive low carbon path which is becoming possible through the development of concrete projects and products such as smart technologies, renewables, energy storage, demand-side response, power to gas, distribution grid modernization, alternative fuels infrastructure for transport, etc. COP21 represents the opportunity to showcase and share best practices in this regard.\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India216","France : IFC Hosts a CEO Panel at COP21 to Discuss Climate-Smart Investments in Emerging Markets","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","TendersInfo","IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, convened a panel of CEOs from five prominent emerging-market companies that have championed innovative climate-smart solutions in their respective countries. The panel, which took place as part of the Caring for Climate Business Forum at COP21 in Paris, explored new approaches to scaling up green investments in emerging markets.IFC, the largest global development finance institution supporting the private sector in emerging markets, has been at the forefront of climate change mitigation efforts in the past decade, with a total of $13 billion in long-term finance in projects in renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, green buildings, and adaptation. Through its advisory work, IFC has enabled a further $5.4 billion in climate-related investment projects.IFCs climate-related interventions last year alone are expected to reduce 9.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent to taking more than 2 million passenger vehicles off the road.Fighting climate change requires the full buy-in and participation of the private sector. It also offers a triple-win: its good for business, good for society, and good for the planet, said Dimitris Tsitsiragos, IFC Vice President for Global Client Services, while offering opening remarks at the panel. We, at IFC are committed to supporting the private sectors response to climate change and as part of the World Bank Group, have committed to doubling our investment volume by year 2020.An increasing number of companies are acting to address the challenge, either by reducing their own emissions or expanding their businesses in a way that contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Companies at the event shared valuable insights and perspectives from a diverse set of industries: International Housing Solutions of South Africa is boosting the affordable energyefficient housing market; Azure Power of India is responding to the governments challenge to install a hundred gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2022; Hexagon of Turkey is championing a creative waste-to- energy and fertilizer model; Solar Power Company Group of Thailand is transforming the countrys renewable energy capacity with utility-scale solar farms; and Indias Mahindra Group is showcasing its leadership in corporate carbon pricing.Our experience working in emerging markets globally points us to vast opportunities for innovation, both in terms of increasing climate-smart investments in emerging markets, and also in implementing new tools to help meet the enormous climate finance gap, said Christian Grossmann, IFC Director for Climate Change. We hope these exchanges throughout COP21 will translate into actionable next steps for IFC and our partners.""\l"

The European Parliament was present at the summit with a delegation made up of 15 MEPs. We asked delegation head Giovanni La Via, an Italian member of the EPP group, what the next steps will be and how Parliament will be involved.What was the delegation's role at the climate conference?We met representatives from developing and developed countries, indigenous people, NGOs and parties involved in the process. We listened to their views on the possible agreement in order to support the other European institutions in reaching an agreement.You already attended several other climate change summits. How was COP21 different from previous climate change conferences?This COP was different for many reasons, but the most important thing is that we have achieved an ambitious agreement. During the previous COPs, we discussed many times the issues of mitigation, adaptation and finance. This time we were able to reach an ambitious agreement, but also to discuss all these points. The final deal will be useful for the next generations.How will the agreement affect Parliaments work?What are the next steps?This is the start of a long process. Over the next year all COP partipants have to look at how they will implement the agreement. We will have to discuss the results of the negotiations with the member states, but also within the Parliament.We, as the European Parliament, have to ratify the agreement and I hope that a large majority will vote in favour of the final deal, which includes one of the main points Parliament has asked for. This agreement sets out a clear course for climate policy over the next century.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India218","Governance - COP21: Climate justice served","January 5, 2016","gfiles","India returned from COP21 having played a positive and proactive role in evolving a consensus on contentious issues and at the same time not compromising on the issues that mattered in preserving our development space and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.Few things have generated as much interest worldwide as the climate change negotiations in Paris in December 2015. Seldom in the history of the modern world have over 150 heads of state and government got together as they did on November 30, the day the fortnight-long high-voltage, high-decibel negotiations commenced. Le Bourget, an erstwhile airfield, was converted into a convention complex to host the 40,000 delegates that had registered to witness what could be a historic compact or catastrophe. The shadow of Copenhagen loomed large and so did the manoeuvres of the developed countries and the aspirations of the developing world.The challenge before the developing countries, or the non-Annex countries, was to maintain the sanctity of the principles enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Annex countries, or the developed countries, on the other hand, wanted to do away with the 'bifurcation' represented by the division of the world into Annex and non-Annex countries. Their sole effort was to dilute the differentiation denoted by 'common but differentiated responsibilities' and erase the concept of historic responsibility. Their argument was that the world had changed in the last two decades and that many non-Annex countries could no longer be characterised as 'developing'. The argument propagated by India was that despite economic growth witnessed in the past 20 years, there continues to be wide disparity in the world and the developing countries have a long way to go in providing a decent standard of living to their citizens. It was this 'right to development' that couldn't be compromised even while developing countries were committed to following a low emission pathway. It was in this pursuit of growth that they required technology and technology transfer, capacity building and financial support both for their mitigation as well as adaptation efforts in order to deal with the challenge of climate change.The Paris Agreement on climate change was adopted on December 12, 2015. It is a legally binding agreement that covers all countries, developed and developing, with the aim to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.The salient features of the Paris Agreement are as under:(a) It acknowledges the development imperatives of developing countries. It recognises the developing countries' right to development and their efforts to harmonise development with environment, while protecting the interests of the most vulnerable.(b) It recognises the importance of sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption with developed countries taking the lead, and notes the importance of 'climate justice' in its preamble.(c) It seeks to enhance the 'implementation of the Convention' whilst reflecting the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.(d) The objective further ensures that it is not mitigation-centric and includes other important elements such as adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology, capacity building and transparency of action and support.(e) Parties' contributions under the Paris Agreement are defined as 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs), and a top-down approach of undertaking mitigation ambition has been avoided. The NDCs are country-driven and comprehensive.(f) It maintains differentiation in mitigation actions of developed and developing countries.(g) It recognises that the timeframe for peaking will be longer for developing countries.(i) It mandates developed countries to provide financial resources to developing countries. Other parties may also contribute, but on a purely voluntary basis.(j) The accompanying decision to the Paris Agreement also lays down that US$100 billion mobilisation of funds per year by developed countries will be scaled up after 2020 and before 2025, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries.(k) It also establishes a new technology framework. This framework notes the importance of fully realising technology development and transfer in order to improve resilience to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The framework also strives to support collaborative approaches to research and development, and facilitating access to technology, in particular for early stages of the technology cycle, to developing countries.(l) A global goal has been established to increase the adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation has also been accorded equal importance as 'mitigation' as demanded by developing countries.(m) In addition to adaptation, the Paris Agreement includes the concept of 'Loss & Damage' and recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and extreme weather events, and identifies various areas of cooperation and support.(n) A global stocktake, covering all elements, will take place every five years to assess the progress in addressing climate change.(o) Implementation of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) mechanism has been anchored in the Paris Agreement.(p) A new market mechanism to provide opportunities for voluntary cooperation in the implementation of the NDCs has been agreed.(q) An enhanced system for transparency has been agreed to. This will cover not only mitigation and adaptation actions, but also the support provided by developed countries.(r) A separate Capacity Building Initiative for transparency to help developing countries has been agreed to in order to build institutional and technical capacity. (s) A new institutional arrangement, viz. Paris Committee on Capacity Building, will be established for enhancing capacity building activities in developing countries under the agreement. Developed countries are to provide financial support for capacity building to developing countries.(t) Pre-2020 actions are also part of the decisions. The developed country parties are urged to scale up their level of financial support with a complete roadmap to achieve the goal of jointly providing US$100 billion by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation by significantly increasing adaptation finance from current levels and to further provide appropriate technology and capacity building support.The Paris Agreement acknowledges the development imperatives of developing countries. It recognises the developing countries' right to development and their efforts to harmonise development with environment, while protecting the interests of the most vulnerable.The Conference of Parties also witnessed the launch of the historic International Solar Alliance (ISA), conceived as a coalition of solar resource-rich countries to address their energy needs and will provide a platform to collaborate on addressing the identified gaps through a common, agreed approach. This alliance was jointly launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande on November 30 with representatives of more than 70 countries, including 33 Heads of State and Heads of Government, attending the launch ceremony. Prime Minister Modi also participated in the launch of Mission Innovation, the public-private initiative for collaborative research and development in cleaner frontier technologies.The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change set up a pavilion which was the cynosure of the COP. It hosted 25 events and attracted over 6,500 visitors, who appreciated the story of India's multifarious initiatives and the manner in which the story was told. 'Parampara', a book on traditional Indian climate-friendly lifestyles, was launched by the Prime Minister at the pavilion. All in all, India returned from COP21 having played a positive and proactive role in evolving a consensus on contentious issues and at the same time not compromising on the issues that mattered in preserving our development space and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. As PM Modi said: ""The outcome of the Paris Agreement has no winners or losers. Climate justice has won and we are all working towards a greener future.""The writer is Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India219","Work out climate change agenda for Mumbai, now","December 2, 2015 Wednesday","Hindustan Times","umbai, Dec. 2 -- There is no Planet B,"" read a few placards at the protests that have marked COP21, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where, if all goes well, 150 world leaders will hammer out a plan to save our planet and us from the adverse impacts of climate change. It may turn out to be the most memorable message yet on cl i mate chang e.For the two decades that climate change has been around in popular lexicon, the phenomenon has consumed environmentalists and a section of scientists. But it failed to elicit concrete action from global leaders, heads of states, large multi-national corporations and other agencies that collectively determine our future and that of our planet. The idea of climate change impact was initially denied by most of them.Irrespective of the outcome in Paris, it is now imperative for countries and cities to evolve their responses to climate change impacts. Three of India's largest and important metropolises - Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata - are among the most vulnerable coastal cities in the world, according to studies by a range of institutions such as the World Bank, IIT Bombay and India's official agencies.Mumbai re gistered a mean temperature rise of 1.62 degrees Celsius between 1901 and 2007 and the sea level around the city is rising by 2.4 mm every year, revealed a recent study by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. These, together, would ""unleash a chain of disasters such as flash floods, disease outbreaks, building collapses, dislocation and death,"" it warned and estimated that Mumbai could face economic damages worth lakhs of crores by 2050 because of climate change.The IIT Bombay study earlier this year warned the urban heat island effect - a phenomenon in which the city turns warmer than surrounding areas as temperature is raised by heat-absorbing concrete and asphalt, high population densities and pollution -- was evident. An independent risk analysis report in Washington placed India - and Mumbai - in the ""extreme risk"" category where economic impacts of climate change will be felt by 2025.The writing is on the wall. Unseasonal rain, extreme weather events, higher summer and lower winter temperatures, thunderstorms are evidences of climate change. There must be an integrated response plan and it has to be put to work. But the state government, its multiple autonomous agencies, the municipal corporation, influencers such as the real estate lobby have been negligent or half-hearted in their attempts so far. In fact, climate change hardly ever gets time and mind space in the many discussions on Mumbai's development.The effort has to begin with the recognition that rapid and unsustainable urbanisation is a major cause for climate change. Cities contribute to it and suffer from its impacts. But for Mumbai, specific information has been sorely lacking. A start was made last year when the MMRDA initiated, through environment improvement society, an interactive website to provide climate change indicators, and educate people about the relationship between their life choices and climate change.A key factor in climate change in cities is the land-use pattern. Densely built-up areas act as stressors. Mumbai's every available inch is built upon, the real estate lobby covets more, successive governments have sanctioned buildings, infrastructure projects, and reclamations without much consideration to their impact on climate change. The Development Plan 2034 does not give importance to climate change impact, neither do landmark documents such as Vision Mumbai.It is time urban planning seriously accounted for climate change.Moreover, building surfaces must be regulated because it is proven that chrome and glass exteriors raise surface temperatures in a city, sometimes to 56 degrees Celsius. Large open areas and wetlands have to be increased rather than acquired for construction. The number of vehicles and their emissions must be regulated.It may already be too late but better now than later. There is no other Mumbai.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

This will empower solar-rich countries, lying fully or partially between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn, which share common challenges and opportunities.As an initial step, Ministers agreed to start analysing and sharing the needs, objectives, and obstacles to deployment at scale along the value chain, for those applications for which they seek the benefits of collective action under the Alliance. On this basis, they will design innovative Programmes leveraging initiatives from the ground.The Two Programmes of the ISA ""Affordable finance at scale""; and Programme ""Scaling solar applications for agricultural use"", were launched during the event.While announcing the programmes, Shri Piyush Goyal expressed his confidence that these programmes will serve the interests of the farming communities in the prospective ISA member countries and ensure that there is sufficient flow of affordable finance for solar projects. He further stated that the ISA will provide a vibrant platform to bring together countries with rich solar potential to aggregate demand for solar energy globally, thereby reducing prices; promoting collaborative solar R&D and capacity; and facilitating the deployment of existing solar technologies at scale.The International Steering Committee of ISA which had met in New York on 21 April 2016 had approved the Programmes on Agriculture and Finance. Prospective member countries will begin work at the earliest and the process of implementation will be reviewed at the Founding Conference of the ISA scheduled to be held in the near future in New Delhi.\l"

In December a new international climate agreement will be sought at a special UN summit in Paris. On Wednesday the environment committee adopted a report setting out Parliament's aims for the negotiations. After the Committee vote, EP rapporteur Gilles Pargneaux (S&D, FR) talked to us on the goals agreed upon. The plenary vote is foreseen for October 14.The report suggests that Parliament advocate a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2030. How do you convince China, the US and, of course, the European Union and its member states to accept this ambitious target?It is a negotiation process. My report was adopted this morning by the ENVI committee and the plenary will vote on it in on 14 October in plenary . It is the official position of the European Parliament.The Parliament will be present at the COP21 in Paris. From the moment we have our position - a position that exceeds other countries', like China, in ambition, our objective will be to convince. We will be an official delegation, we will be in contact with third countries in the COP21, an international summit, to not only dialogue, but decide.Your report calls for additional sources of climate finance to support greater efforts for greenhouse gas reduction and adapt to climate change impacts. How should the money for these measures be raised?We need a credible finance package, hence the proposal for a roadmap to supply the Green Climate Fund with $ 100 billion per year, which will allow us to support the most vulnerable countries that do not have the means to fight against climate change.The fund will consist of state contributions. The report also proposes a certain number of innovative recipes linked, for example, to new energies to supply the fund with. The financial package will clearly be the cornerstone of the Paris agreement. If we fail to find an agreement on the Green Fund and on how to provide it, I think that unfortunately, we will either end up with either a non-agreement or a half-failure.What role will the European Parliament have in the COP21 negotiations?We believe that the European Parliament should be at the forefront to ensure success at the COP 21, as this is the battle of the century. If nothing is done, we will have an increase of the average global temperature by above 2 degrees. We will see natural disasters and food crises multiplied. If nothing is done, experts say we are looking at almost 200 million climate refugees in the world.\l"

Credit Agricole SA is one of the main investors of the tap, in the context of its recent commitment to invest EUR 2 billion in high quality Green Bonds.EIB's CABs have been awarded a Sustainability Bond Rating of 'b+' from Oekom, one of the leading ESG rating agencies worldwide. This is the highest rating so far assigned by the agency.The transaction, which takes the total CAB issuance to EUR 11.8bn, highlights EIB's commitment to the sustainable growth of the Green Bond market by increasing the liquidity of EIB's EUR Green Bond curve. The EUR 1.5bn CAB due 11/2023 provides a benchmark of intermediate maturity between the EUR 3bn ECoop CAB due 11/2019, currently the largest Green Bond outstanding, and the EUR 1.25bn CAB due 2026 - the longest outstanding Green benchmark. In EUR, CABs are distributed in mini-benchmark / ECoop format. This means they have a EUR 500m minimum size, and EUR 250m minimum for re-openings upon actual demand.As in 2015, EIB is first to issue a Green Bond in 2016, thereby drawing attention to their relevance in the current policy and market context. Transparency and accountability are among the key features of the recent Paris agreements of COP21. The delivery of climate goals is not only a question of volume; it implies a wide-ranging transformation of business practice, and the credibility of climate finance is crucial for the effective involvement of capital markets.Green Bonds enhance the transparency of climate finance and promote the debate on definitions, impact assessment methodologies and impact reporting principles, permitting stakeholders to increasingly engage for higher comparability and improvement in these fields. This engagement is essential for a shift from financing climate activities in incremental ways, to making climate change - both in terms of opportunities and risk - a core consideration and ""lens"" through which institutions deploy capital.A synopsis or recent initiatives in these areas is provided by a report published by International Financial Institutions (IFIs, including the EIB) during COP 21, which details five voluntary principles for mainstreaming climate change considerations within Financial Institutions, illustrated by relevant test cases (thereunder Green Bonds on p. 51):Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions.

We would take it up,"" Javadekar said here after releasing a document titled ""India's action on climate change after the Paris agreement"". He, however, said officials from the ministry of commerce and industry will be the ones who would decide and take the final call on the WTO issue. Javadekar said that India along with over 130 countries, would ratify the Paris agreement at a high level signing ceremony at the UN headquarters in New York on April 22. He will be leaving for the UN on Wednesday and will also attend the Major Economies Forum on April 23 and 24. The minister on April 7, along with Brazil, South Africa, India and China, had welcomed the adoption of the Paris agreement on climate change -- the 21st Conference of Parties (COP-21) -- in December last year. China, which is eyeing the Indian solar market, had extended its support to New Delhi against the WTO ruling. The WTO on February 24 ruled against India's 'Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission' on the plea that New Delhi's efforts towards the indigenous production of solar cells violated WTO rules. The ruling came on a 2013 complaint filed by the US. The US had said India violated domestic content requirements (DCR) rules. India appealed against the WTO ruling, claiming its compliance with laws required to promote sustainable development. India also argued that its solar programme was helping it to meet its commitments under the UNFCCC. India's solar energy programme is considered one of the world's largest and fastest renewable energy programmes. The country had also scaled up its target to produce solar energy by pushing ahead the 20,000 megawatts of solar electricity generation to 1 lakh megawatts by 2022. Meanwhile, Javadekar also called upon the developed nations to declare their enhanced action plan for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol and mobilising $100 billion towards climate change. ""We have levied a clean environment cess of $6 per tonne on coal. If the developed world follows India in taxing its coal production, $100 billion can be raised,"" he said. He also said the developed world must provide technological support to the developing nations in the fight against climate change. In the UN climate change conference COP 21 in Paris, 195 countries adopted the first universal, legally binding global climate deal. The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

The conference is expected to attract close to 50,000 participants including 25,000 official delegates from government, intergovernmental organisations, United Nation agencies, NGOs and civil society.The main objective of the conference is to devise a new international agreement on climate change, applicable to all, to keep global warming below 2C by the virtue of stabilising atmospheric concentrations of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). However, the mechanisms employed for a conclusion to materialise remain extremely obscure. The civil society seems ready to embrace change; the question is; do the leaders have what it takes?The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted during the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992. This Framework Convention is a universal convention of principle, acknowledging the existence of anthropogenic (human-induced) climate change and giving industrialised countries the major part of responsibility for combating it.The venue for the climate conference (COP21) is Le Bourget, on the outskirts of the French capital. The venue is bifurcated into two zones; the conference centre (blue zone) for the affiliated and accredited parties and the other for the civil society which is known as 'Generation Climat.' Generation Climat consists of different groups of environmentalists from diverse backgrounds and various nationalities along with forums for debates, sets of stands for different environmental purposes, ecological conferences and documentary screenings. Generation Climat provides a platform to the civil society to discuss and exhibit innovative solutions to tackle the global issue of climate change.The Generation Climat explores various facets of the issue, ranging from the preservation of sustainable and traditional lifestyle of indigenous communities, innovative solutions to clean up the oceans, food security, forest conservation as well as development of organic and urban farming.Agriculture has been a prominent feature of the agenda. However, over the years, little attention has been paid at negotiations on the highest levels to impact our diets and farming practices. Energy is indeed the top source of greenhouse gas emissions, the food system is a close second. Estimates suggest that industrial agriculture and livestock account for as much as a third of the total emissions. This situation has its roots in decades of unsustainable agriculture, particularly excessive meat consumption (more than a quarter of the Earth's land is now used to raise animals for human consumption), monoculture farming and nitrogen fertilizers.We can continue to feed ourselves using millions of gallons of fossil fuels or we can support modernorganic and regenerative agriculture.Hemal ThakkerFinal-Year studentSchool of liberal studies PDPU\l"

""While multiple sources for climate financing exist including global climate funds from public and private sectors and multilateral development banks, the resource gap is still wide"", he said. ""There are many countries that need technical assistance and capacity building to be able to develop and deploy climate- smart technology as well as trainingon how to implement international agreement and integrate them into their national climate action plans"", he added.According to Dr. Ali, the IDB Group, in 2014, launched its Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction Program to address the energy challenges of its member countries via application of renewable energy resources. He stated that the Bank will continue to work with other multilateral development banks (MDBs) in order to improve climate resilience of transport systems, and increase awareness on the need to protect transport services by building a more systematic approach to mainstreaming climateresilience in transport policies, plans and investments.The IDB Group President called on the participants to further exchange expertise on climate change issues in order to bridge the resources gap.

Super Typhoon Haiyan, or Yolanda, which hit the Philippines in 2013, painted a very grim picture of exactly what climate change is all about, he said.Not too long ago, if everybody recalls, there was even a debate as to whether or not there was climate change. Here, I think there was nobody that I heard who was denying that climate change is a problem, the President said in an interview with the Philippine media here on Friday.It was really just a question of whether the two-degree goal or the 1.5-degree goal is the central topic. So the negotiations are still ongoing.We hope that there will be very, very substantial results differentiated from the 2009 Copenhagen efforts, he added.It is widely viewed, based on recent science, that a 2 degree rise in global temperatures will have disastrous impacts on the global weather system, the environment and societies.There are also assumptions that even a 1 degree rise is now expected to be as great as those previously assumed for a 2 degree Celsius warming.Another good thing is that Germany and France, which are both industrialized countries, have added their voice to the 1.5 degree Celsius above industrial levels, calling for higher emission cuts especially for major polluters.The Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of vulnerable countries, has become a major force in calling for the world to take action.The President said that before they left from Manila, the conference came up with a statement, espousing 1.5 degrees, and this was later ratified in Paris.It started out as a group of small, Pacific island nations, numbering about 10 or 11. When we joined in, it reached 20. Before we left for Paris, it had become a group of 43, he said.There is a clamor from vulnerable countries for the industrialized nations to shoulder the burden of building the resiliency of those affected as well as facilitating the transfer of technology to address climate issues and cut emissions, the President said.So one is hopeful that in the negotiations we really will have something more of substance, he said.COP 21, which is considered make or break conference, runs from November 30 to December 11. Countries attending the conference in Paris are expected to come with a binding climate agreement to prevent irreversible damage to the planets weather system.\l"

What happens if we decide to set a minimum wage that is simply much higher than the formal economy is willing to offer large numbers of people? The answer is that large numbers of people will go off and work in the informal economy where they get the wages that people are willing to offer them. Given that the alternative to taking the informal wages is no wages this is a deal that people really will take. Perhaps the poster child for this argument is South Africa: there's a series of minimum wages which are higher than employers are willing to pay, also higher than people are willing to work for. So, what happens is that people go and work in the informal economy where they can in fact get a job.The example today comes from Bangladesh. A photographer has gone looking at these informal rag trade factories, the basement end of the global textiles trade, and found that children are working in appalling and hugely unsafe conditions for very much less than the local minimum wage:These are the photographs that show the grim reality for thousands of children in Bangladesh who are forced to work long crippling hours stitching labels into clothes.Despite improved safety standards in formal factories, unregistered sweatshops like these are not inspected.Those informal factories are not inspected because, obviously, they are not part of the formal economy. Which is something of a problem if we'd like to improve working conditions of course: if regulation is what is going to improve them then it does have to happen that regulation covers them.Children and adult employees earn as little as \£36.50 a month, or less than 800 Bangladeshi taka. At best, they can expect 1,950 taka (\£316) .That is significantly less than the 5,300 taka (\£341.80) minimum wage for entry level garment workers set by the government in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster, in which more than 1,100 people died, mostly women.This will sound very brutal. In fact it is brutal but then that's the way the world is. If wages are set above the market clearing price then some people will be left without jobs at that high minimum wage. They would, obviously, prefer not to starve. Thus they will go to work for companies offering less than that minimum wage. Which is exactly what is being described here. Don't forget, this is a country where not having a job does not mean unemployment insurance, food stamps and housing vouchers. This is a place where no income can and often does mean death.It would probably be better to have a lower minimum wage and then have all of those informal workers inside the protections for the formal economy. And do note, this isn't a function of lax enforcement: it's a function of poverty. All greater enforcement would do is push these people and children even further out into the informal economy, possibly in even worse conditions.As for us, yes, of course, it's an extreme example. If anyone were silly enough to propose a $50 an hour minimum wage for the US then this is the sort of thing that would happen: vast growth in the informal, as opposed to formal, employment sector. At present it only exists to a small extent: sure, 50% of black teens are listed as unemployed but do we all really believe that they're doing nothing in the informal economy at all? Which brings us back to the same point. Perhaps we actually should have a lower minimum wage so that all get the chance to have both the opportunities and protections of taking part in formal employment?Courtesy: Dhaka Tribune, December 2, 2015Published by HT Syndication with permission from South Asia Monitor.

It is not a smart decision at all - Hyderabad will be remembered as an epic story of wasted promise.""The Telangana government on Tuesday dropped Hyderabad from the list of cities proposed for development under the Smart City Mission. Of the 98 cities listed for the Smart Cities, only 85 submitted proposals which does not include Hyderabad. The State government informed the Union Ministry that they will propose another city in place of Hyderabad.An advisor on smart cities, she elaborates, ""Being a part of the Smart Cities Mission of government of India is not just about getting funds but about being a part of a prestigious mission - one that promises to 'brand' the city internationally, attract investors and make Hyderabad economically vibrant and inclusive. Most importantly by opting out of this mission the government is letting it's citizens down because a smart city is where every citizen, not withstanding his financial and other status, gets a chance to maximise his own potential.""While Hyderabad is flush with funds, Karuna feels this is just one side of the story. ""Hyderabad has the potential to become a smart city but it is far from being one. It takes enormous efforts, a great vision and strategies for equity, economic progress and sustainability. Will that be possible without metrics, peer learning and citizen involvement? By not aligning with the national mission , we are choosing to become orphans with no guidance and peer support,"" she opines.Smart and stringentThe mission insists on citizen involvement, access to water and power, congestion-free roads, low-cost housing and categorically states that availability of funds is contingent on provision of the above. Will Hyderabad be so tough on itself? Will it be so stringent with rules? were some of the pertinent questions that were raised soon after the city was touted to be a part of the mission.""A city that aspires to become smart on its own can have 'very different' goals - may not conform to the goals of inclusion prescribed by the 100 Smart Cities Mission. Such a city may experiment and craft bombastic plans only to see them boomerang in the long run,"" Karuna says and questions, ""Can we afford such a fate for Hyderabad?"".Gopal who was represented the Union Ministry of Urban Development as a speaker at the Smart Cities Session of COP 21, at United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this year adds that while Hyderabad has a reputation for being ahead, there is a lot more that it has to learn. ""Have we understood ISO 37120 smart city standards at all?,"" she questions.""Hyderabad need not 'reinvent the wheel' if it is a part of the mission. For instance some cities have great models for affordable housing, PPP (Public Private Partnership) frameworks, concession agreements while others have built IT platforms for citizen engagement and city dash boards that monitor crime, critical infrastructure like water supply, air pollution, drain bursts real time. Some cities researched on predictive analytics and big data for traffic congestion,"" she expresses.The green leader adds, ""Tell me how will we access their knowhow, investment models and innovative practices if we are out of the mission?

IESS would enable decision makers to take a detailed view of India's emerging energy scenario, and help in effectively deciding the right mix of appropriate technology interventions and measures towards maximizing indigenous fuel supplies towards meeting the country's energy challenges.Alluding to the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference, Paris COP 21 On the occasion Dr. Panagariya felicitated the leads from partner institutions and IESS Team.Dr. Alexander Evans, Deputy High Commissioner, British High Commission, New Delhi, said that IESS website is user-friendly and reflects innovation and fresh thinking. The number of assumptions available with respect to demand and supply of energy and energy guzzling sectors, would facilitate the Indian government, industry and stakeholders to formulate a holistic energy policy and an appropriate energy mix for the future.In his presentation on IESS, Mr. Anil Kumar Jain, Adviser (Energy), NITI Aayog, said that detailed examination of the tool would reveal how changes in choices of energy demand and supply, yielding different levels of energy import can help a planner to decide the sector(s) in which interventions can be more effective to meet the desired policy objectives. He added that a new feature has been added in Version 2.0 which is cost information and captures the difference in cost of the chosen pathway vis-a-vis the default pathway.Dr. V K Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog, said that the county was dealing with the issues of depleting resources and growing energy demand. Also, India was looking forward to becoming a developed nation, which meant that energy demand would increase, making it imperative to increase the share of clean energy and use of carbon efficient fuel for sustainable growth. Here, IESS would become an effective tool for understanding implications of the choices made.Dr. Bibek Debroy, Member, NITI Aayog, said that IESS would soon be available as a mobile app. IESS would allow sensitivity analysis with its contingent of future assumptions. The tool provides hundreds of scenarios with different combinations of levels/efficiencies of energy demand and supply sectors, enabling to define the future energy consumption.Mr. Y.K. Modi, Past President, FICCI and Executive Chairman & Managing Director, Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited, said that IESS 2047 aims at providing a clearer picture of the emerging energy demand scenarios in India. In comparison to its first version, the new version includes updated data sets, new technologies, additional sectors gaining importance and also additional implications like costs of energy choices to the economy.Mr. Sashi K. Mukundan, Regional President and Head of Country, India, BP Group, said that the twin challenges in the energy sector are rising dependency on imports and increase in greenhouse gases owing to India's move towards becoming a developed nation. Hence, it becomes imperative to look for right energy mix and IESS would allow the government, industry to think tanks to identify alternate policy options and also quantify the outcome of those policies for sustainable and clean growth.Source: Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India245","Global warming: Not just another economic or political crisis","March 17, 2016 Thursday","DNA","Scientists believe that our planet is warming up because of an increase in greenhouse gases - which trap heat from the sun, in the atmosphere. To respond to this threat, in November-December of 2015, world leaders from 195 nations gathered in the suburbs of Paris for a United Nations Climate Change ConferenceCOP21Air pollution is a situation which India is apparently already facing. Billions of tons of greenhouse gases and particle emissions cloud the sky every year. These gases trap sunlight, and an increase in this is slowly warming up the atmosphere, which in turn is resulting in climate change, ablation, and change in pattern of precipitation. Apparently, these problems are not visible in our daily lives, but eventually, they will bring nature's wrath upon us. Even a rise in the sea-level by a meter will flood major coastal regions of India. Nations across the globe are identifying this problem and taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit its threats. The point, here, is that the pollutants do not identify national boundaries and affect the atmosphere globally. This is the reason why nations are indulged in negotiations. Truth is that developed nations contribute the most to greenhouse emissions, and therefore, their responsibility doubles when speaking on a 'climate change' deal. Hence, the representatives at the Paris deal agreed upon limiting global warming temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius when compared to pre-industrial levels. However, the deal is not legally binding yet as it will require a minimum of 55 countries that account for over 50 percent of global greenhouse emissions to make it so. In the adopted agreement, parties agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase at 1.5 degree Celsius. The scheme appears to be convincing, but on other hand, many scientists believe that this goal will require zero greenhouse gas emissions between 2030 and 2050. And if this were indeed the case, then just capping emissions by a measly 2 degrees Celsius is conjecture as actual temperature increase will be 3-4 degrees Celsius, which scientists' term as dangerous.Considered as a developing nation, India's emission of greenhouse gases does not equate with US or European countries, but eventually, we will reach that level if immediate changes are not incorporated. India did make all efforts during the Paris deal to grab little relaxation being a developing nation, but it still had to sign up with the 1.5 degree Celsius limit. It also failed to get a deal which obliged rich countries to provide clean technology, free of intellectual property rights, to poor ones, and thus, the Paris deal did not bring much for us in terms of global climate cooperation. On a national level, India made its first effort for the cause by releasing the National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2008. Apart from this, India has also made various efforts to promote sustainable development and for the introduction and use of clean-energy technologies by initiating the National Clean Energy Fund in 2014.Global warming and climate change is not an economic or political crisis that will subside only by efforts from governments. It is a threat which all humans contribute to and it needs a collective effort to deal with. Our dependency on fossil fuel is the mail contributing factor. We - as individuals, need to make efforts and minimise our contribution to green house emissions. At the moment, we are not considering the future, but if we do not change our lifestyle, the inevitable will happen. This is already evident from the rise in temperatures, change in weather patterns, water scarcity, droughts and numerous other signs.Every time a harvest fails, farmers look up to the sky and hope to flourish next year and that next year will be unpredictable unless we stop interfering with nature. We have pushed nature to its limits and now it is pushing back.The author is a Teaching and Research Associate, Gujarat National Law University\l"

Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Cisco France announces its association with the Comit 21 and Club France Sustainable Development, to highlight innovative technological solutions to fight climate change and its effects on cities, businesses and people. The sole technology company to join the action program Solutions COP21, Cisco will exhibit its Eco City solutions in the Grand Palais in Paris from December 4 to 10.Cisco believes that technology can improve our daily lives and transform the way people work, live, play and learn. For this transformation to be long lasting and impactful, Cisco has placed sustainable development issues at the heart of its business. Cisco addresses energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission priorities through innovation, in order to reduce waste and improve the energy efficiency of technology productswhose energy consumption represents up to 90 percent of the carbon footprint in their life cycle.From December 4 to 10, Cisco, the only information and communications technology (ICT) company to partner with Solutions , will interact with visitors at the exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris to share its innovations in urban mobility, energy-saving buildings, remote administrative services and telepresence.Introducing So Mobility: A new approach for a smarter cityMobility is a major issue of our collective daily lives. Local mobility is essential to city movements, with residents commuting to their place of work or to study, shop or spend their leisure time. It is therefore essential to provide concrete and sustainable solutions in urban planning, traffic management and the environment as the cities of tomorrow are developed.To help tackle the questions posed by urbanization on a global scale, Cisco launched the So Mobility initiative with partners, notably in the building, energy, transport and infrastructure industry, to demonstrate that a viable, holistic, cross-industry approach can address the needs of modern citizens.To make the concept of the smart city a reality, So Mobility will focus its efforts on improving road traffic, citywide parking and work to anticipate new modes of transport. The plan is to a make a lasting impact for how people get around their city by 2020. These will be demonstrated at the Grand Palais through a connected street and traffic management demonstration.Intelligent buildings for energy savingsThe need to address environmental concerns as well as regulatory and societal developments requires buildings to adapt and become intelligent. Buildings can now install an intelligent IP network and converged electronics system to control the services, mechanical and electronic devices, heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and lighting systems of a building. Together they enhance energy efficiency by transforming the way they are constructed, operated and occupied.Cisco will offer the public an opportunity to discover how its energy management solutions, which are part of an intelligent connected building project, visualize and measure energy consumption and waste in each element connected to the network. The net result is the ability to arrive at a set of actions that will contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gases.The Cisco Remote Expert for Government Services solution: Reducing the need for travel while facilitating access to public services.The Internet already allows citizens to perform certain administrative tasks onl"
"COP21","India","COP21_India250","Hundreds of Governments, Businesses, Financial Institutions Commit to Major Action on Energy Efficiency at COP 21, Finds Accenture, SE4All","December 10, 2015 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","India Energy News","Dec. 10 -- Leading companies have pledged to enhance their energy efficiency with an estimated impact of 62,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) over the next five years, enough to power the city of Paris for nine months, according to a report by Sustainable Energy for All and Accenture (NYSE:ACN). However, many companies are facing challenges in turning commitments into effective strategies.Some 775 companies, more than 130 national, regional and local governments and over 100 financial institutions have committed to ramping up energy efficiency measures and investments under SE4All's 100/100/100 campaign, contributing to both economic growth and the fight against climate change.The details of private sector commitments are published in 'Sustainable Energy for All, We Commit.'The campaign by SE4All, a unique multi-stakeholder partnership backed by the United Nations and World Bank to catalyze action for universal access to sustainable energy, is building momentum to double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 - one of SE4All's three objectives and a target under the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 on energy. The International Energy Agency estimates that targeted energy efficiency measures have the potential to contribute up to half the savings in greenhouse gas emissions needed to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius.The campaign's effort to drive private-sector engagement, 'We Commit,' was led by Accenture, which has developed a framework that accepts a range of energy efficiency commitments from companies. The framework prioritizes quantifiable commitments to improvements within companies and their supply chains, but also includes non-quantifiable commitments, such as robust energy efficiency strategies.In just six months, the private-sector segment of the 100/100/100 campaign has secured commitments from around 100 large corporations and 675 small and medium-sized enterprises in 33 countries across all continents. Of these, 75 pledges that can be quantified and tallied represent a total energy saving in 2016-2020 of 62,000 gigawatt hours (GWh), resulting in large cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.In the financial sector, more than 100 banks and institutional investors, managing close to $4 trillion in both developed and developing countries, have committed to a major increase in energy efficiency lending in their portfolios in a drive led by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United Nations Environment Programme.""Energy accounts for 60 percent of today's greenhouse gas emissions and global demand for energy continues to rise,"" said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, group chief executive, Accenture's Resources operating group. ""Direct emissions from energy usage are expected to double or triple by 2050 compared to 2010. To help offset that expected impact, the efforts and commitments of private sector companies through this program will help achieve SE4ALL's goal of doubling the rate of energy efficiency.""""Whether it's better equipment, cleverer systems or new business models and new financing, we need faster results,"" said Rachel Kyte, designate Chief Executive Officer of SE4All and Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Sustainable Energy for All. ""Energy efficiency is essential in growing low carbon economies and in allowing us to meet the goal of energy access for all. We can live in a cleaner world and business can compete to be resource efficient and succeed,"" added Ms Kyte, who is currently the World Bank Group's Vice President and Special Envoy for Climate Change.""The report notes that although many companies have set carbon reduction targets, they often struggle to implement strategies to achieve them, principally due to operational and structural challenges. The report suggests that doubling the rate of energy efficiency can only succeed if individual commitments are accompanied by cross-industry efforts. It calls on multi-national companies to collaborate on setting targets and on designing effective implementation programs.The commitments under the 100/100/100 campaign build on a range of initiatives that were announced at the 2014 Climate Summit in New York, including SE4All's Global Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform. This offers one of the biggest global platforms supporting energy efficiency action across the public sector, private sector and civil society, with a particular focus on reducing energy use in six key areas: appliances, lighting, buildings, industry, vehicle fuels, and district energy systems.Read more on Accenture's insights into the COP21 climate change conference.Source: Accenture\l"

The company will advocate the introduction of a price for carbon as the most effective market mechanism to channel investments in sustainable products and services, and will also call for a reform of subsidies for fossil fuels, which amount to more than 550 billion dollars a year according to the International Energy Agency.To prevent global warming from crossing the 2C barrier - the limit marked out by the scientific community to prevent catastrophic changes to the climate - it will be necessary to reduce emissions between 40% and 70% up to 2050 and achieve a level close to zero emissions by 2100.ACCIONA strongly believes that renewable energy sources will be a key factor in the fight against climate change, as the energy sector is currently responsible for more than two-thirds of CO2 emissions worldwide.In this direction, it is also important to point out the opportunities that a low-carbon economy opens up for companies and countries.ACCIONA will be an observer of the multilateral negotiations in the Climate Summit and will take part in a number of forums involving the private sector and civil society organizations in Paris to support an agreement that will lead the planet in a new direction of sustainable and non-polluting growth.ACCIONA is present in the main world forums on sustainability such as the High-level Group on Sustainable Energy for All sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, whose Renewable Energy Committee is chaired by ACCIONA President Jose Manuel Entrecanales. The company is also on the Management Committees of Global Compact LEAD and the Caring 4 Climate platform of the United Nations Global Compact, and has also signed up to the CEO Climate Leadership Group in the World Economic Forum de Davos and the We Mean Business coalition aimed at driving the climate agenda vis-a-vis COP21 in Paris.ACCIONA has promoted a number of initiatives in these forums to urge international governments to make a strong commitment to reaching agreement in Paris. For example, ACCIONA recently signed a letter from the Corporate Leaders Group (CLG) and nine other international business organizations calling on the Treasury Ministries of the G20 countries to create a legal, fiscal and financial framework to promote a low-carbon economy, together with another letter from the CLG to the Environment Ministries of EU countries urging reforms to the CO2 emissions trading market to encourage companies to invest in technologies that contaminate less.According to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World, ACCIONA is a leader in climate strategy, achieving the highest rating in terms of Policies, Environmental Management Systems and Biodiversity.

And it will enter into force once 55 countries accounting for at least 55% of emissions ink it. Here are the highlights of the deal:1. Goal: The long-term goal is to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees celsius over pre-Industrial Revolution levels, and to try for 1.5 degree if possible.Impact: Will push out fossil fuels from economies.2. Peak: The world will aim for climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions to peak ""as soon as possible"", probably in second half of the century.Impact: Will provide affordable green technologies to developing countries.3. Climate action: Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to be reviewed again in 2023 and then once every five years to reflect highest possible ambition as per the individual capabilities of countries.4. Emission reduction: Developed countries to take economy-wise absolute emission reduction (no target) and developing countries to enhance their mitigation efforts.Impact: Introduces cooperative effort to reduce emissions, with higher burden on richer nations.5. Loss and damage: The agreement includes a section recognising ""loss and damage"" associated with climate-related disasters. The US was worried it would lead to claims of compensation for damage caused by extreme weather events . It was included with a footnote specifically stating that loss and damage does not involve liability or compensation.Impact: Most vulnerable nations will be partially covered for loss because of disasters. It is a victory for small island nations threatened by rising seas.6. Finance: Developed countries to take lead in providing financial assistance with floor of $100 billion by 2020 from variety of sources including ""significant role"" of public funds. Expansion of donor base to be considered in future.Impact: Countries like India, say after 2030, will have to contribute.7. Transparency: Technical Expert Review of climate action plans for all parties with different level for developed and developing world depending on national capability and circumstances. Biennial update in form of established International Assessment and Review for rich nations and International Consultation and Analysis for developing world.Impact: Brings all countries on single accountability platform.8. Taking stock: First of climate action plans to happen in 2023 and then every five years with an aim to enhance voluntary commitments by each country. India has committed emission intensity reduction by 33-35% and a 40% non-fossil energy use by 2030 in its first climate action plan submitted this October.Impact: Gives permanency for periodic enhancement of climate action plans.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Hindustan Times.

The dust is beginning to settle on the COP 21 agreement. Leaders and negotiators have gone back to their homes, calling it a ""historic turning point"", and that they have ""taken vital steps to ensure that our children and grandchildren will see that we did our duty in securing the future of our planet"".Let us look at what really happened: An agreement was arrived at which, for the first time, articulated the need to hold the ""increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degC above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change"" (Article 2 of the Paris Agreement).This is a significant step, moving away from the ostrich-like attitude of the past where leading historic greenhouse gas contributors notably the United States, were in denial.The INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) are meant to provide the way forward to achieve this goal. This is where things start falling apart and the disconnect begins. Even the Paris Agreement ""notes with concern that the estimated aggregate greenhouse gas emission levels in 2025 and 2030 resulting from the INDCs do not fall within least-cost 2 ?C scenarios but rather lead to a projected level of 55 gigatonnes in 2030, and also notes that much greater emission reduction efforts will be required than those associated with the INDCs in order to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 ?C above pre-industrial levels by reducing emissions to 40 gigatonnes or to 1.5 ?C above pre-industrial levels by reducing to a level to be identified in the special report referred to in paragraph 21 below (Section II, 17 of the Paris Agreement)""We have a problem right from the start. The disconnect between the intent and the commitments to meet this intent continues to get wider-globally and nationally. Another significant point to note is that there are no legally binding requirements in the Agreement.What were the solutions discussed in Paris to meet the INDCs? At the COP 21, solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change were being provided by corporations and technology providers who are contributors to climate change. They were on display in the Solutions COP 21, a large platform provided for them at the COP 21. Here, corporate sponsors were pushing solutions to climate change that include genetically modified foods, privatised water, and biofuels..more of the same. All the discussions, including those around potential solutions, were held without any inputs from civil society and communities who are adapting and living lives already impacted by climate change. They had to resort to protests and sit-ins to be heard even by world media.In the context of our food systems, Solutions COP 21 continued to push the industrial, agribusiness agenda in the name of climate mitigation and adaptation. Biofuels, which have already compromised the food security and sovereignty of millions of communities all over the world, find a place in the solutions proposed in Paris. At the top of the proposed solutions are genetically modified foods, privatisation of water and other industrial agricultural solutions. To paraphrase Einstein, we are once again trying to solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.Once again, technology is being pushed forward as the solution. Instead of actively seeking integrated, social and ecological context specific solutions of which technology could be a part, the same fragmented, industrial, silo approach is being proposed!A rapidly globalising India's climate action plan is not very different from that proposed by the developed countries and the corporations. Here is a look at some of the key proposals in India's climate action plan that have significant implications for our food security and sovereignty.Actions Related to GHG MitigationOne of the proposed actions for Green House Gas (GHG) mitigation is promotion of Biofuels (Section 2.2.8). National and international experience around biofuels has clearly shown the disastrous effect this has had on food security. Large-scale promotion of Jatropha and Simarouba glauca on ""wastelands"" has destroyed common lands which are the resource base for livelihoods and food systems in arid and semi-arid dryland areas. Biodiesels, the corn-based ethanol industry and their role in the 2008 food crisis has been extensively documented. Where is the integrated energy plan for the country? What is the role of biofuels in this plan? What are these biofuels proposed to be used for? Marginal and vulnerable ecosystems and communities in rain-fed, dryland areas of the country are invariably the targeted locations for biofuel cultivation. These are also areas most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.Eight National MissionsThe plan proposes a way forward to mitigate climate change through eight national missions. One such mission that has significant implications for our food systems and sovereignty is the National Mission for a Green India (Section 3.6), which is already underway in some of the most biodiverse regions of the country.The stated objectives of the mission: ""increasing forest cover and density as a whole of the country and conserving biodiversity"". This is proposed to be done using ""fast-growing"" climate hardy trees. Whenever a programme is done in ""mission mode"", it is characterised by targets, timel"

Climate Change Conference taking place in Paris, but opinions vary as to how burdensome and costly those impacts will be.Participants in a side panel hosted today (Dec. 9) by the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements (HPCA) at COP21, shared their perspectives on the most important challenges businesses will face post-Paris.Robert Stavins, the Albert Pratt Professor of Business and Government and faculty director of HPCA, moderated the event, which included opening remarks delivered by Gian Luca Galletti, the Minister of Environment for Italy. In his remarks, Galletti stressed the need for climate negotiators to leverage market mechanisms in order to measure and monitor national goals for reducing carbon emissions, in particular as those goals change over time.I do believe that we have clear ideas as to what are clear ambitions are in the future, Galletti said, pointing to the need to set an aggregate target of lowering the growth of global temperatures to no more than 1.5 degrees in order to sustain the future of the entire planet.Stavins summarized a recent research report authored by Associate Professor Joseph Aldy which examines tools and institutions for assessing national targets, saying that such tools are critically important in order to allow for meaningful comparison of effort across countries.Simone Mori, Head of European Affairs for the Enel Group, argued that a climate agreement must take into account the fast pace of technological change.The technology revolution over the past five, eight years has really been dramatic, and it really changes the picture, he said, especially for developing countries from Latin America to South Africa.Its important to update the national climate pledges according to the evolution of the technologies, he remarked.Jeff Swartz, who manages international climate policy for the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), said that the agreement should include three important features for business: a process by which countries can cooperate on emission reductions so that they can transfer emissions credits across borders; strong and clear accounting provisions;and some form of a carbon emissions crediting system.The Italian Ambassador to France, Giandomenico Magliano MPA 1981, stressed that clear rules, simple policies, and effective governance will be important.By harmonizing standards, we may achieve efficiency, we may achieve lower CO2 emissions, he remarked.Panelists fielded a number of questions from those in the audience, including one from a young woman who identified herself as a typical Chinese teenager, who asked how to prevent politics from trumping environmental needs in the crafting of a climate agreement. Mori responded, saying that while politics is a complex gamethe direction of climate policy is very clear.The side event was co-sponsored by HPCA and the Enel Foundation.\l"

The company will advocate the introduction of a price for carbon as the most effective market mechanism to channel investments in sustainable products and services, and will also call for a reform of subsidies for fossil fuels, which amount to more than 550 billion dollars a year according to the International Energy Agency.To prevent global warming from crossing the 2\'baC barrierthe limit marked out by the scientific community to prevent catastrophic changes to the climateit will be necessary to reduce emissions between 40% and 70% up to 2050 and achieve a level close to zero emissions by 2100.ACCIONA strongly believes that renewable energy sources will be a key factor in the fight against climate change, as the energy sector is currently responsible for more than two-thirds of CO2 emissions worldwide.In this direction, it is also important to point out the opportunities that a low-carbon economy opens up for companies and countries.ACCIONA will be an observer of the multilateral negotiations in the Climate Summit and will take part in a number of forums involving the private sector and civil society organizations in Paris to support an agreement that will lead the planet in a new direction of sustainable and non-polluting growth.ACCIONA is present in the main world forums on sustainability such as the High-level Group on Sustainable Energy for All sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, whose Renewable Energy Committee is chaired by ACCIONA President Jos\'e9 Manuel Entrecanales. The company is also on the Management Committees of Global Compact LEAD and the Caring 4 Climate platform of the United Nations Global Compact, and has also signed up to the CEO Climate Leadership Group in the World Economic Forum de Davos and the We Mean Business coalition aimed at driving the climate agenda vis-\'e0-vis COP21 in Paris.ACCIONA has promoted a number of initiatives in these forums to urge international governments to make a strong commitment to reaching agreement in Paris. For example, ACCIONA recently signed a letter from the Corporate Leaders Group (CLG) and nine other international business organizations calling on the Treasury Ministries of the G20 countries to create a legal, fiscal and financial framework to promote a low-carbon economy, together with another letter from the CLG to the Environment Ministries of EU countries urging reforms to the CO2 emissions trading market to encourage companies to invest in technologies that contaminate less.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India264","Countries differ on the issue of stocktaking at COP 21","February 27, 2016 Saturday","Down To Earth","India, Feb. 27 -- As the nations of the world hammer out the draft of an agreement on climate change at the COP 21 in Paris, an emerging stumbling block is around the amount of time that is to be taken to do a stock take of the agreement's implementation.Article 10 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'s draft text provides that a periodic stock take be done to see to it that the agreement that finally comes out at Paris is implemented in the years ahead. This would be to assess the progress made towards achieving the ultimate objective of the convention, which is to control climate change.The current draft text mentions that the first global stock take in 2024 and every five years thereafter, unless otherwise decided.All parties in Paris agree to the fact that contributions by parties from climate mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation and support should be revisited according to changing times. But what is lacking is the precision, particularly in language and what will follow in the aggregate review. In particular, there is an agreed consensus among countries to stocktake mitigation and finance targets every five years but countries are more hesitant on stocktaking on adaptation. The hesitation among parties could also be because of manifestation and assessment of the results of any adaptation activity is a long-term process. The quantification and assessment are fairly complex in adaptation when compared to mitigation actions and financial support.Civil society around the world is of the opinion that waiting for the first review for around 10 years would only mean that there won't be a chance to scale up the ambition to the trajectory required and might end up wasting a lot of time to correct to stay under 2 degrees, which can be corrected in a five-year review.It is understood that emerging economies feel threatened with a shorter stocktaking period as they might be the most impacted. But as per reports, Susheel Kumar, additional secretary from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has said that India is open to considering five year stocktaking if its other concerns are negotiated.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP21","India","COP21_India266","Italy : Surge in climate change-related disasters poses growing threat to food security","November 27, 2015 Friday","TendersInfo","Droughts, floods, storms and other disasters triggered by climate change have risen in frequency and severity over the last three decades, increasing the damage caused to the agricultural sectors of many developing countries and putting them at risk of growing food insecurity, FAO warned in a new report released today ahead of the United Nations (COP 21) in Paris.Worldwide, between 2003 and 2013 - the period analyzed in the study - the average annual number of disasters caused by all types of natural hazards, including climate-related events, almost doubled since the 1980s. The total economic damage caused is estimated at $1.5 trillion.Focusing specifically on the impact of climate-related disasters in developing countries, some 25 percent of the negative economic impacts were borne by the crop, livestock, fisheries and forestry sectors alone. In the case of drought, over 80 percent of the damage and losses affected the agriculture sector, especially livestock and crop production.The FAO report is based on a review of 78 on the ground post-disaster needs-assessments conducted in developing countries coupled with statistical analyses of production losses, changes in trade flows and agriculture sector growth associated with 140 medium and large scale disasters - defined as those affecting at least 250,000 people.The report clearly demonstrates that natural hazards - particularly extreme weather events - regularly impact heavily on agriculture and hamper the eradication of hunger, poverty and the achievement of sustainable development.The situation is likely to worsen unless measures are taken to strengthen the resilience of the agriculture sector and increase investments to boost food security and productivity and also curb the harmful effects of climate change.""This year alone, small-scale farmers, fisherfolk, pastoralists and foresters - from Myanmar to Guatemala and from Vanuatu to Malawi - have seen their livelihoods eroded or erased by cyclones, droughts, floods and earthquakes,"" said FAO Director-General Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva.He noted how the international community recently committed itself to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and is expected to reach a climate change agreement at the COP 21. Measuring progress made in meeting these global targets will require accurate, up-to-date information, including on the impact of disasters, Graziano da Silva stressed.""National strategies for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation that support resilience must address the types of disasters with the greatest impact on the agriculture sector, the FAO Director-General said. He noted how sector-specific data on damage and losses are essential for effective policy and practice,"" and that the FAO study aims to contribute to national, regional and global efforts to develop comprehensive disaster data collection and monitoring systems.Drought critical in sub-Saharan Africa, flooding and storms are a scourge in AsiaDrought has an especially detrimental impact - around 90 percent of production losses - on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa where the sector on average contributes to a quarter of GDP, rising to a half when agribusiness is included. At a conservative estimate, total crop and livestock production losses after major droughts were equivalent to more than $30 billion between 1991 and 2013 in the region.Drought often has a major cascading effect on national economies as shown in Kenya where between 2008 and 2011 it caused significant losses in the food processing industry, particularly grain milling and coffee and tea processing.Many Asian countries are particularly vulnerable to the impact of floods and storms. For example, crop production losses caused by the 2010 floods in Pakistan directly affected cotton ginning, rice processing and flour and sugar milling, while cotton and rice imports surged. In this case, some 50 percent of the $10 billion in total damages and losses fell on the agriculture sector.Different disasters require different responsesBeyond production losses, the study shows how disasters can cause unemployment and erode incomes especially for small scale family farmers, thus threatening rural livelihoods. For instance, the 2010 floods in Pakistan affected 4.5 million workers, two-thirds of whom were employed in agriculture and over 70 percent of farmers lost more than half of their expected income.Directing more investments towards resilient and sustainable agricultureWorldwide, the livelihoods of 2.5 billion people depend on agriculture, yet only 4.2 percent of total official development assistance was spent on agriculture between 2003 and 2012 - less than half the United Nations target of 10 percent. Investment in disaster risk reduction is extremely low: only around 0.4 percent of official development aid in 2010 and 2011.FAO stresses that aid should better reflect the impact of disasters on the agriculture sector.Investments into disaster response and recovery should also build resilience to future shocks through risk reduction and management measures, particularly in countries facing recurrent disasters and where agriculture is a critical source of livelihoods, food and nutrition security, as well as a key driver of the economy.\l"

The upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris offers the world an opportunity to reach a strong international climate agreement and protect the health of current and future generations. The Paris treaty could be significant for public health with the potential to save lives worldwide, the WHO said. In 2012, WHO estimated 7 million people died from air pollution-related diseases, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. Climate change is expected to cause an additional 250 000 deaths per year from malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and under-nutrition between 2030 and 2050. Children, women and the poor in lower income countries will be the most vulnerable and most affected, widening health gaps, it added. Investments in low-carbon development, clean renewable energy, and strengthening climate resilience, are investments in health, it said. Pointing out that the profound consequences for health are not given sufficient attention in debates about climate change, the WHO said that the Paris climate conference is the time for the health community to lend their voice to the international climate discussion by asking countries to come together and make bold commitments to protect our planet and public health.\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India275","COP-21 must find practical, pragmatic, sustainable solutions (Column: Active Voice)","November 30, 2015 Monday","IANS-English","India, Nov. 30 -- A staggering 147 heads of state have assembled at Paris to discuss and possibly find a solution to the problem of climate change at the COP-21. The broad consensus that exists is that the global temperatures should not be allowed to breach the 2 degree Celsius change over the pre-industrial atmospheric temperatures. However, the foundations of this number as well the likelihood of averting this limit both seem shaky at present. The reason is that the limit before it become mainstream in the climate change policy discourse was used by Yale economist William Nordhaus in a 1977 paper. He used it to express ""a first intuition"" to show that these levels ""would take the climate outside the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years"". Post this, several conferences and resolutions have been passed but little serious commitment is observed from most stakeholders. In 2010, the Cancun Agreements committed the governments to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2 degrees. However, the limit in itself is arbitrary. It is used though as it serves as an important benchmark for governments to commit to measurable targets. Also, it forces the global leadership and national leadership to find solutions within this 2 degree limit. Another major problem with the 2 degree limit is that it does not take into account the historical contribution so far that countries have made. This makes it even more difficult to reach a consensus on the limit. Developing countries like India have argued that since they have not contributed to climate change in a massive way in the past 150 years, why are they being pressurized to reduce carbon emissions in the same way developed countries have been asked to do? It is a question of fairness, they argue. India goes further to talk about the issue of ""climate justice"" to its 300 million people who do not have access to electricity. The government has the mandate to resolve the ""power poverty"" of its people in this regard. Development and access to power for citizens cannot be held hostage to international relations and obligations. This is where developing countries like India find themselves in a spot of bother, as reducing dependence on coal at present simply looks impractical. This is because coal is at present the cheapest source of producing power and India has abundant reserves of it. Another important point is that governments have to subsidize new and renewable energy that make them environmentally good but financially costly. The solution that countries like India seem to look at is boosting the renewable capacity over the next few years more than the coal output increases. It is a pragmatic stance since it increases the output of Co2 emissions but at the same time looks to move towards renewable energy more so than ever before and more than coal. The leaders have already submitted their countries' Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to COP-21. India has pledged to reduce its emissions by an estimated 33-35 percent by 2030 down from its 2005 level. It aims to do so by focusing on solar and wind energy. It is estimated that the funding requirement to achieve this would be close to $2.5 trillion. The leaders that have gathered in France must find solutions that are practical, pragmatic and sustainable. The best way forward is to commit to investing in R&D and radical innovation in solar and other renewable energy sources, both in the developed and developing countries. From the point of view of developing countries, the issue of equity and access to power for their citizens are of critical importance. All the leaders must look at finding solutions by investing in energy technologies that are novel and less polluting.

In addition to the Presidium and Past FICCI Presidents, the delegation also saw participation from various industry representatives from different sectors of the economy.On the first day of the Paris Climate Summit, the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi along with the French President, Francois Hollande launched an International Solar Alliance (ISA) of over 120 solar rich countries situated fully or partially between the two tropics. The Indian initiative aims to accelerate the development and deployment of affordable solar technology across the globe with pooled policy knowledge. Leading global industry leaders attended the event. Earlier in the day, the FICCI delegation also visited the India Pavilion during its inauguration by Prime Minister Modi. The FICCI delegation also met with various business leaders and government officials at the pavilion and shared their views and pledged support on industry actions on climate change.CEOs Pledge on Climate ResponsibilityFICCI side events at COP 21On December 4, 2015, FICCI in partnership with Climate Parliament and Renewable Grid Initiatives organised an official side event on 'Climate Ambition in Industry: Towards Collective Action and Transformative Solutions'. During that event, Rita Roy Choudhury, Senior Director and Head Environment, Renewable Energy, Climate Change and Water Division, FICCI, presented the insights on Indian industry initiatives on climate mitigation and adaptation. On December 10, 2015, FICCI in association with GIZ and NABARD also organized a side event on 'Delivering a Sustainable Financial System in India and Prospects of Accessing Climate Finance in the country' at the India Pavilion. The event highlighted the ways to advance policy options that would deliver a step change in the financial system's effectiveness in mobilizing capital towards a green and inclusive economy. The kEY learnings from FICCI and UNEP joint study on 'Designing a Sustainable Financial System for India' were presented. The session also included views from leading solar companies in India on how banks, financial institutions and corporates can work together to align the financial system with the sustain ability agenda for the country. In addition, NABARD as an accredited National Implementing Entity (NIE) in India showcased how it has played a leading role in climate change initiatives in the country by accessing international finance for climate change adaptation projects.FICCI at the High Level Segment, COP 21FICCI got a speaking slot at the High Level Segment to make a statement on behalf of the Global Business and Industry. Ardeshir Contractor, Co-Chair, FICCI Solar Energy Task Force and Managing Director & CEO, Kiran Energy, presented the statement, a significant achievement of FICCI.Other Meetings at COP 21The FICCI delegation participated at the World Climate Summit which provided the solutions platform for and from business, finance, and governments to support the signing of a legally binding global climate change agreement. The delegation also got an opportunity to join the TerraWatt Initiative which is a private sector initiative aimed at meeting the ISA's objective. The delegation members had a range of engagements with various other organisations including the International Chamber of Commerce, the World Bank and German Federal Ministry of Environment (BMU)to promote business views and interests of the Indian industry and for collaboration for FICCr's events across climate change and renewable energy domains. Ir.. addition, FICCI organised an exhibition that showcased initiatives of Indian industry in driving economic growth while reducing emissions and promoting inclusive development.Snapshot of implications & opportunities for industry from Climate Change AgreementThe Paris climate change agreement includes many positive indicators for business and industry to move on a low carbon path and gradually move towards low carbon technologies and fuels. In the context of India, the Paris outcomes present a great opportunity for the government to work constructively with the private sector to implement India's climate commitments. As the governments have decided to go climate neutral by the end of the century, markets have got a clear indicator and direction in which way the global economy is headed. Principles of climate justice and differentiated responsibilities - win-win for government and businesses: The Principles of 'Equity' and 'Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities"" has been retained which is a big factor in the success of the outcome, as these are the underlying principles that India and Indian business and industry saw as bridging the trust deficit and ensuring climate justice. Potential in scaling up renewable energy applications: The signal from Paris is clearly for a shift away from fossil fuels to clean energy by the end of the century, and the adoption of climate smart policies and innovative technologies. Like all other signatories, India is now required to periodically report on its pledged targets and performance under the Agreement and update and implement its intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) by 2020. Avenues for PPP in green infrastructure: The Government of India has an opportunity to enact enabling policies and frameworks which encourages private sector involvement in sectors such as green buildings, sustainable transport, clean water, sustainable agriculture and sustainable urban development.\l"

Brown Jr. today announced that the United States will host the seventh Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM7) in San Francisco, California in June 2016. The announcement was made at an event in Paris during the COP21 UN Climate Negotiations. The annual meeting of energy ministers and other high-level delegates from the 23 CEM member countries and the European Commission, taking place on June 1-2, will provide an opportunity for the major economies to collaborate on solutions that advance clean energy globally and demonstrate tangible follow-up actions to COP21.COP21 as a key implementation forum to help countries deliver on their respective national clean energy goals and build capacity to increase ambition even further over time. That discussion included Ali Ibrahim Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabias Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Ibrahim Baylan, Swedens Minister of Energy, Amber Rudd, United Kingdoms Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and Lars Christian Lilleholt, Denmarks Minister of Energy, Utilities and Climate.Holding CEM7 in San Francisco is an exciting opportunity for the United States to showcase one of Americas prime technology innovation ecosystems that is providing real-world solutions to combat climate change and drive the clean energy revolution in the U.S. and around the world, said Secretary Moniz. CEM is a key forum following COP-21 for energy ministers and other distinguished leaders to gather and implement the clean energy goals set forth in Paris.The announcement that San Francisco will host CEM7 follows President Obama's video message at CEM6 in Mexico last May that the United States would host CEM in 2016. The combination of the city and states role in advancing clean energy policies along with the concentration of clean technology companies, research and development, and the business community in the region were key deciding factors. San Francisco and the broader Bay Area, which encompasses Silicon Valley, is known as a global hub of the clean energy industry and is home to some of the most innovative technology companies that are playing a crucial role in advancing clean energy globally. California recently signed into law climate and clean energy legislation that sets aggressive targets for the share of the states electricity from renewable sources and for energy efficiency savings in buildings.""I can think of no better place than California to play host to the world's clean energy leaders,"" said Governor Brown.The CEM was launched in 2010 with the goal of accelerating the global transition to clean energy. The United States hosted the first ministerial meeting in Washington, D.C. with subsequent meetings hosted by the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, India, Korea, and Mexico. The CEM pairs the annual meeting of energy ministers with year-round policy-targeted technical initiatives and high-visibility campaigns to deliver high-impact on-the-ground results and enable proven policies and technologies to realize broader, faster, and lower-cost diffusion and replication among CEM and non-CEM countries.In addition to Secretary Moniz, CEM7 is expected to include global energy leaders such as Chinas Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang, European Commissioner for Climate and Energy Miguel Arias Caete, and Indias Minister of Power, Coal & New & Renewable Energy Piyush Goyal. Leaders from the business and investment community working in clean energy are also expected to participate as well as leaders from international energy organizations, foundations, research institutes, and academia.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India280","No action, just a war of words at COP 21","December 4, 2015 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 4 -- There seems to be little progress towards a climate agreement in Paris. On the fourth day of COP 21, developed and developing counties locked horns on the review of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) before the much-anticipated Paris Agreement kicks in 2020. INDC are pledges by respective countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.In the heart of the fight between developed and developing countries is the ex-ante review (or before the event review) of these INDCs submitted by the countries.Before the 2020 climate change deal kicks in, the draft text of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform, prepared in Bonn in October this year, has an option for a facilitative review of the INDCs.The European Union proposed during a contact group meeting that the facilitative review of the INDCs must be broadened to include adaptation measures by developing countries, which set the cat among the pigeons.India said that it was agreeable to a facilitative review of the developed countries collective pre-2020 actions to reduce emissions. The developed countries did not agree to this proposal.It was finally agreed that the provision of updating the commitments by all countries was dropped from the ADP text. There is also no provision of countries taking on more stronger targets in the ADP text.Developed countries only want the INDCs of every country to be inscribed in the final Paris agreement, but do not to talk about key elements necessary for developing countries like finance and technology to implement the INDCs.The issue of historical emissions also does not find any mention in the negotiating text of the ADP.Differentiation between developed and developing countries was another big issue where sharp divisions remain between the two groups.Developed countries including New Zealand, Norway, Japan, US and the EU have been pushing for self differentiation, where countries can choose their own targets.The issue of finance, too, cropped up with developed countries proposing that ""any country in the position to do so,"" in other words middle-income economies should also contribute to finance.This was again objected to by the developing countries, quoting common but differentiated responsibilities.The first week of the negotiations are almost over, but the conference has moved very little in substance beyond COP 20 held in Lima.The old differences between developed and developing countries continue to hold ground which makes the prospect of a strong and ambitious deal in Paris increasingly difficult.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP21","India","COP21_India281","COP21: Africa requires curricula review, green economy to tackle unemployment","December 10, 2015 Thursday","Pivotal Sources","France, Dec. 10 -- African governments have been urged to review their education curricula to have relevant skills and human capital development for green growth and climate adaptation and green jobs on the continent.Speakers during a discussion on the 10th day of the UN climate change conference (COP21) in Paris, France, observed that most education systems in Africa are rigid and must be reviewed for the continent to move towards a low carbon development and create vibrant green economies.Anthony Nyong, Manager of the Compliance and Safeguards Division at the African Development Bank (AfDB), noted that green growth is the pathway Africa must take. ""We need to adopt green economy if we are to create more jobs for our youth. This calls for inclusive and innovative ways to develop the necessary skills we need,"" Nyong said.Guy Ryder, Director-General of International Labour Organization (ILO), noted that solving climate and employment crises are global challenges that must be addressed to combat climate change.""Today, 200 million people, with majority of them being youths, are unemployed. In order to create 600 million jobs by 2030 to reach 100% employment for all, we should handle climate change well, as it has potential to achieve this,"" Ryder said.He called for Africa's preparedness to tackle the challenge. ""Most African countries are not well equipped for green jobs, but have the comparative advantage. We need to restructure our education systems which focus on primary education much to the expense of higher learning,'' he said.""Vocational and technical trainings should be promoted. We must carry out skill upgrades to create new jobs as we focus on relevant higher levels of qualifications,"" he added.Winnie Lichuma, the Chair of Kenya's National Gender and Equality Commission, called for an inclusive approach in tackling climate change challenges.""We need to bring on board all those affected - men, women, youth and persons living with difficulties - and appreciate their different roles, so that we come up with a common front to deal with climate change. Any other approach will fail,"" Lichuma said.Goodness Morategi, a 20-year-old South African university student, called for innovative ways to involve youth in climate change management.""African governments should involve youths in all policy engagements so that they know from the onset the issues they are facing. Now, governments make policy and expect youth to adhere to them as passive recipients. This is wrong,"" Morategi said.Noting that social media is loved by the youth, she urged decision-makers to arm the youth with right technological tools and skills to make them appreciate climate change.""Education on our continent is rigid. Climate change is communicated in a hard science language. We should be more fluid to change our education system and align it to the current needs of the human race. This will help us create a green economy,"" Morategi said.Bukar Hassan, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of the Environment in Nigeria, echoed her sentiments, pointing out that the youth are the implementers of the agreement that will be reached in Paris.""For governments to reach a zero carbon environment, governments must be flexible to align education to emerging labour markets. This can be achieved by governments, the private sector and the youth working together,"" Hassan said.Senegal's Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development, Abdoulaye Balde, called on African governments to create green employment strategies and institutions to implement them.""In Senegal, we already have this and next week we are launching a green growth blue-print which aims at creating 4,000 green jobs directly and 6,000 jobs indirectly,"" Balde said.The lack of adequate skills and human capital remains one of the key obstacles for many African countries to adapt to climate change and to achieve their full potential for green growth, decent work and green job creation and eradication of poverty.Building the right skills will enable African countries to create new jobs in a range of economic sectors, to attract investments and to create sustainable, decent and green jobs for a growing labour force. It will help increase productivity of the workforce and make African economies more competitive.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Pivotal Sources.

Importantly for our work, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by world leaders in September, contain explicit recognition of the importance of science and technology for development, he said. The SDGs cover many areas in which the IAEA contributes a great deal, Amano continued. He added, These include energy, food security and nutrition, human health, protection of the oceans and management of water resources, as well as climate change. The SDGs are a set of universal development goals, targets and indicators that countries can use to frame their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years. They were adopted by the UN General Assembly in September. Amano said Member States may choose to reflect SDG targets in their development plans, which could be reflected in their IAEA country programme frameworks. The Director General also briefed the Board on the progress of plans to modernize the IAEAs nuclear applications laboratories in Seibersdorf, near Vienna. The Insect Pest Control Laboratory will be the first of two new laboratory buildings scheduled for construction under the Renovation of the Nuclear Applications Laboratories (ReNuAL) project. Modernization of the labs will improve the IAEAs ability to help countries use nuclear science and technology to achieve the SDGs, Amano said. Construction of the first laboratory is expected to begin next April. Amano told the Board that the construction of the second building, the Flexible Modular Laboratory, will begin once the required funding is available. So far, some 13.9 million euros has been provided or pledged by 20 Member States for the ReNuAL project, he confirmed, thanking them for their support. However, we still need an additional 6.7 million euros. I again call on all Member States in a position to do so to contribute generously. Turning to nuclear energy, Amano noted that the IAEA will be participating in side events at the United Nations , COP21, that begins in Paris next week. The objective of the conference is to reach an agreement on combating global warming. Many countries expect nuclear power to play an important role in their energy mix in the coming decades, Amano said. He said, It is one of the lowest emitters of carbon dioxide among energy sources, considering emissions through the entire life cycle. On nuclear safety, Amano noted that his report on the Fukushima Daiichi accident and the final report on the implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety had been published in September. Work is underway to incorporate the output from these major undertakings into the Agencys regular nuclear safety activities, he said. In the area of nuclear verification, the IAEA is conducting preparatory activities related to the verification and monitoring of Irans nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), agreed between Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union in July this year.

Clean diesel technology will be a key aspect of the strategy to help achieve not only these commitments but also carbon reductions from other nations, according to Allen Schaeffer, the Executive Director of the Diesel Technology Forum.""We don't need to wait for diesel technology to significantly reduce C02 emissions,"" Schaeffer said. ""Diesel powered equipment in the field right now and diesel vehicles on the road today deliver substantial greenhouse gas reductions and air quality benefits.""Leaders from around the world meeting at COP21 this week are making commitments to reduce carbon emissions, which will require proven technologies - ones that can feed a growing population, enhance economic development and opportunity and improve personal mobility in all parts of the world.

Because energy accounts for a substantial share of such human-induced emissions, the energy sector will be instrumental to success in implementing these commitments.Effective implementation will depend on sensible policy action. Fundamental to this is the acknowledgement of practical realities, one of which is the increasingly essential role played by coal in meeting the world's energy needs. Coal accounts for nearly 30% of the world's primary fuel consumption, and according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global coal demand is now approaching that of oil.Another such reality is that in the 21st century, electricity is fueling a wave of urbanization and economic growth, lifting billions to a better quality of life. However, the energy that makes longer, healthier lives possible remains surprisingly in short supply for too many. According to independent sources, today there are still 1,300,000,000 people who do not have access to electricity.The application of advanced technologies in the use of the world's coal resources presents a ready-today solution for UN negotiators and energy policymakers worldwide. Technology is the bridge to a low-emissions future for countries experiencing increasing electricity demand within their growing economies. It is also a bridge being built rapidly in scores of projects throughout India and China, in Japan and South Korea, across Southeast Asia, and on the African continent.The increased use of all forms of energy which drives economic development, and the betterment of life, can be reconciled with lower emissions through advanced energy technologies. In the case of coal, which fuels 40% of the world's electricity, the foundation of this bridge is the development of high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) technologies for electricity generation.Deployment of HELE technologies will play an increasingly significant role in meeting greenhouse gas commitments. To illustrate, moving the current average global efficiency rate of coal-fueled power to supercritical levels could deliver the equivalent environmental benefit of reducing India's CO2 emissions to zero.Policy measures are urgently needed to accelerate development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which according to the IEA must contribute 1/6 of total emissions reductions by 2050. One option is financial incentives for the design and construction of HELE projects which are CCS-ready. Another is support for academic research initiatives on the clean utilization of coal. Given their similar greenhouse gas profiles, power generation with CCS technology should be provided with policy preferences comparable to those afforded to electricity projects fueled by solar and wind.Finally, financing support for HELE projects using coal is an important instrument for policymakers to encourage advanced technologies for electricity production. Multilateral funding sources are also beneficial, and can assist countries where the cost of deploying advanced technologies is prohibitive. Additional incentives should be provided for private sector investments which result in further increases in power generation efficiency.For more information, please visit PeabodyEnergy.com and AdvancedEnergyforLife.com.Source: Peabody Energy\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India292","Climate change disasters causing growing food insecurity, says FAO report","November 28, 2015","Food & Beverages News","New Delhi, Nov 28 -- Droughts, floods, storms and other disasters triggered by climate change have risen in frequency and severity over the last three decades, increasing the damage caused to the agricultural sectors of many developing countries and putting them at risk of growing food insecurity, FAO warned in a new report released on Thursday ahead of the United Nations (COP 21) in Paris. Worldwide, between 2003 and 2013 - the period analysed in the study - the average annual number of disasters caused by all types of natural hazards, including climate-related events, almost doubled since the 1980s. The total economic damage caused is estimated at $1.5 trillion. Focussing specifically on the impact of climate-related disasters in developing countries, some 25 per cent of the negative economic impacts were borne by the crop, livestock, fisheries and forestry sectors alone. In the case of drought, over 80 per cent of the damage and losses affected the agriculture sector, especially livestock and crop production. The FAO report is based on a review of 78 on the ground post-disaster needs-assessments conducted in developing countries coupled with statistical analyses of production losses, changes in trade flows and agriculture sector growth associated with 140 medium- and large-scale disasters - defined as those affecting at least 250,000 people. The report clearly demonstrates that natural hazards - particularly extreme weather events - regularly impact heavily on agriculture and hamper the eradication of hunger, poverty and the achievement of sustainable development. The situation is likely to worsen unless measures are taken to strengthen the resilience of the agriculture sector and increase investments to boost food security and productivity and also curb the harmful effects of climate change. ""This year alone, small-scale farmers, fisherfolk, pastoralists and foresters - from Myanmar to Guatemala and from Vanuatu to Malawi - have seen their livelihoods eroded or erased by cyclones, droughts, floods and earthquakes,"" said FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva. He noted how the international community recently committed itself to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and is expected to reach a climate change agreement at the COP 21. Measuring progress made in meeting these global targets will require accurate, up-to-date information, including on the impact of disasters, Graziano da Silva stressed. ""National strategies for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation that support resilience must address the types of disasters with the greatest impact on the agriculture sector, the FAO director-general said. He noted how sector-specific data on damage and losses are essential for effective policy and practice,"" and that the FAO study aims to contribute to national, regional and global efforts to develop comprehensive disaster data collection and monitoring systems. Drought critical in sub-Saharan Africa, flooding and storms are a scourge in Asia Drought has an especially detrimental impact - around 90 per cent of production losses - on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa where the sector on average contributes to a quarter of GDP, rising to a half when agribusiness is included. At a conservative estimate, total crop and livestock production losses after major droughts were equivalent to more than $30 billion between 1991 and 2013 in the region. Drought often has a major cascading effect on national economies as shown in Kenya where between 2008 and 2011 it caused significant losses in the food processing industry, particularly grain milling and coffee and tea processing. Many Asian countries are particularly vulnerable to the impact of floods and storms. For example, crop production losses caused by the 2010 floods in Pakistan directly affected cotton ginning, rice processing and flour and sugar milling, while cotton and rice imports surged. In this case, some 50 per cent of the $10 billion in total damages and losses fell on the agriculture sector. Different disasters require different responses Understanding the impact of different types of disasters is crucial to ensure that the most appropriate policies and practices are implemented. Floods cause more than half of the total damage and loss to crops which are also very vulnerable to storms and drought. Around 85 per cent of the damage caused to livestock is due to drought, while fisheries are overwhelmingly affected by tsunamis and storms such as hurricanes and cyclones. Most of the negative economic impact to forestry is caused by storms and floods. Beyond production losses, the study shows how disasters can cause unemployment and erode incomes especially for small-scale family farmers, thus threatening rural livelihoods. For instance, the 2010 floods in Pakistan affected 4.5 million workers, two-thirds of whom were employed in agriculture and over 70 per cent of farmers lost more than half of their expected income. Directing more investments towards resilient and sustainable agriculture Worldwide, the livelihoods of 2.5 billion people depend on agriculture, yet only 4.2 per cent of total official development assistance was spent on agriculture between 2003 and 2012 - less than half the United Nations target of 10 per cent. Investment in disaster risk reduction is extremely low: only around 0.4 per cent of official development aid in 2010 and 2011. FAO stresses that aid should better reflect the impact of disasters on the agriculture sector. Investments into disaster response and recovery should also build resilience to future shocks through risk reduction and management measures, particularly in countries facing recurrent disasters and where agriculture is a critical source of livelihoods, food and nutrition security, as well as a key driver of the economy.\l"

The outstanding arrangements reflect the character of this great nation. The world has assembled in Paris to change the course of our planet to a sustainable path. We must speak about goals and targets on carbon emissions and rise in global temperature. But, it is just as important to focus on the instruments that will make it natural and easy for the world to get there. And, they are also the most vulnerable to the consequences of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel. Access to energy and a better life is a universal aspiration. And, so are clean environment and healthy habitats. As the world's majority works its way to prosperity on a planet left with very limited carbon space , we have to do many things. We have to ensure, in the spirit of climate justice, that the life of a few does not crowd out the opportunities for the many still on the initial steps of the development ladder. The advanced countries must leave enough room for developing countries to grow. And, we must strive for a lighter carbon footprint on our growth path. For that we must come together in a partnership to bring clean energy within the reach of all. Innovation is vital for combating climate change and ensuring climate justice. That is what makes this Innovation Summit very special. This unites us behind a common purpose. We need research and innovation to make renewable energy much cheaper; more reliable; and, easier to connect to transmission grids. We can make conventional energy cleaner. And, we can develop newer sources of renewable energy. This is a global responsibility to our collective future. Our innovation initiative should be driven by public purpose, not just market incentives, including on intellectual property. That will make clean energy technology available, accessible and affordable for all. This partnership will combine the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector. We will double our investments in research and innovation; and, deepen collaboration among ourselves. We should have an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on renewable energy. Innovation must be backed by means to make it affordable and ensure adoption. The progress on clean energy technology and costs is impressive. If we raise the level of our efforts, we can transform the world. We will also lay the foundation of a new economy in new low carbon age. We will restore the balance between ecology and economy, and between our inheritance and obligation to the future. And, live up to Gandhiji's call to care for the world we shall not see.\l"

The book was presented by Mr. Modi and released by Mr. Francois Hollandein presence of Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary General, the United Nations and about 30 other Heads of States in the audience, during a house full event that was attended by several global leaders and distinguished guests.The book launch coincided with the launch of International Solar Alliance an idea conceived by Mr. Narendra Modi. The Governments of more than 147 Nations are represented during the COP21 conference to discuss a proposed new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and thus avoiding the threat of dangerous climate change.The book chronicles Mr. Narendra Modi's vision and commitment to the climate change cause and represents a big step forward in the significant efforts which India is taking to implement initiatives and transform itself into a low carbon economy, for making a real positive difference to the global environment. Building on a model of positive partnership between people, businesses, scientific community, government and NGOs, Mr. Modi's proposal calls for delivering clean energy and prosperity through site-dependent initiatives and scaling up efforts to make rapid transformation.Mr. Modi mentions in this book published by Lexis Nexis India, that, ""the Indian civilization has historically been conscious of the need to be in harmony with nature. The roots of this belief are steeped deep in Indian culture, pointed expression of which for respecting nature can be found in several Indian scriptures like the Vedas. The book is only a humble attempt to document initiatives and innovations that we have undertaken and experimented first in the State of Gujarat and now across India that have directly or indirectly but significantly, contributed and will continue to contribute to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change.""During the event, Mr. Modi emphasized on the need for convergence of economy, energy and ecology and to broaden the outlook and vision from Climate Change to Climate Justice - to take care of the concerns of the poor and future generations in the journey towards sustainable development. Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed a 'paradigm shift' on climate change, which means a more active promotion of clean technologies dissemination and development of renewable energy.

We need to adopt green economy if we are to create more jobs for our youth. This calls for inclusive and innovative ways to develop the necessary skills we need, Nyong said.Guy Ryder, Director-General of International Labour Organization (ILO), noted that solving climate and employment crises are global challenges that must be addressed to combat climate change.Today, 200 million people, with majority of them being youths, are unemployed. In order to create 600 million jobs by 2030 to reach 100% employment for all, we should handle climate change well, as it has potential to achieve this, Ryder said.He called for Africas preparedness to tackle the challenge. Most African countries are not well equipped for green jobs, but have the comparative advantage. We need to restructure our education systems which focus on primary education much to the expense of higher learning, he said.Vocational and technical trainings should be promoted. We must carry out skill upgrades to create new jobs as we focus on relevant higher levels of qualifications, he added.Winnie Lichuma, the Chair of Kenyas National Gender and Equality Commission, called for an inclusive approach in tackling climate change challenges.We need to bring on board all those affected men, women, youth and persons living with difficulties and appreciate their different roles, so that we come up with a common front to deal with climate change. Any other approach will fail, Lichuma said.Goodness Morategi, a 20-year-old South African university student, called for innovative ways to involve youth in climate change management.African governments should involve youths in all policy engagements so that they know from the onset the issues they are facing. Now, governments make policy and expect youth to adhere to them as passive recipients. This is wrong, Morategi said.Noting that social media is loved by the youth, she urged decision-makers to arm the youth with right technological tools and skills to make them appreciate climate change.Education on our continent is rigid. Climate change is communicated in a hard science language. We should be more fluid to change our education system and align it to the current needs of the human race. This will help us create a green economy, Morategi said.Bukar Hassan, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of the Environment in Nigeria, echoed her sentiments, pointing out that the youth are the implementers of the agreement that will be reached in Paris.For governments to reach a zero carbon environment, governments must be flexible to align education to emerging labour markets. This can be achieved by governments, the private sector and the youth working together, Hassan said.Senegals Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development, Abdoulaye Balde, called on African governments to create green employment strategies and institutions to implement them.In Senegal, we already have this and next week we are launching a green growth blue-print which aims at creating 4,000 green jobs directly and 6,000 jobs indirectly, Balde said.The lack of adequate skills and human capital remains one of the key obstacles for many African countries to adapt to climate change and to achieve their full potential for green growth, decent work and green job creation and eradication of poverty.Building the right skills will enable African countries to create new jobs in a range of economic sectors, to attract investments and to create sustainable,decent and green jobs for a growing labour force. It will help increase productivity of the workforce and make African economies more competitive.\l"

""The world must debate seriously the sustainable lifestyle issue, as only sustainable lifestyle can mitigate the challenge of Climate Change. Technology may bring forth some solutions, but we must ensure that needs of 7 billion people are met on a sustainable basis. Greed and unsustainable lifestyle should have no place in a new world regime to fight Climate Change and its ill-effects. Latest Earth Overshoot Report is an eye-opener. Global Footprint Network (GFN) every year presents a report on ecological footprint which maps consumption and requirement of natural resources to sustain it. Lifestyle adopted in developed countries is unsustainable and it will require five Earths to fulfil their lifestyle demands. On the other hand, Indian lifestyle is sustainable where one earth is sufficient. This is not because of poverty, but because of Indian value systems. We believe in need-based consumption and our lifestyle is against extravagant consumption. We have an ingrained sense of responsibility where wasteful consumption is abhorred. Therefore, the Paris conference must include a debate on lifestyles. The Earth Overshoot Report has indicated that the Ecological Footprint of developed countries ranges from 8 to 4 whereas India is at 0.9. India and other developing countries have priority of eradication of poverty. They cannot be asked to compromise on that goal in the name of Climate Change. Every poor of the World has the right to emerge out of poverty, and poor and developing countries need sufficient carbon space to ensure sustainable development. As Climate Change impacts the poorer and vulnerable sections severely, we must ensure climate justice. Shri Javadekar expressed concern over the recently concluded Bonn negotiations round wherein instead of discussion on draft text, there was an effort to steamroll and thrust new ideas. It also rejected proposals of developing countries. For a successful Paris summit, next round of Bonn negotiations in October must come out with a draft text, which will include all the principles of convention like CBDR and Equity, as also all elements of Convention like Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance & Technology and Capacity Building in the core agreement.

On the final day of the meet, the laureates signed the Mainau Declaration, 2015, on climate change that made an emphatic appeal for climate protection.Following the latest climate policy resolutions adopted by the G7 countries and the climate-oriented encyclical Laudato si' issued by Pope Francis, the declaration by the scholars is another urgent warning of the consequences of climate change.This is the first time since 1955 that Nobel laureates used the platform to take a stand on social policy issues.

"COP21","India","COP21_India309","Sins of emission and remission: No reason India cannot meet challenge thrown at it in COP21","December 3, 2015 Thursday","The Economic Times","WASHINGTON: Never has the expression ""the heat is on India"" been more appropriate and applicable than at the COP21, the 21st Conference of Parties currently striving for an agreement in Paris on climate change. There is also something ironical about a country that instituted firewalking having its feet held to the fire. India's fakirs and philosophers have long passed such agri-pariksha to test strength, courage, and fealty - not speak of good footwork. So there's no reason New Delhi cannot meet the challenge thrown at it in Paris.Still, there is a galling sense of disquiet, and some pique, that one of the world's poorest exploiters of resources may end up carry the can for a clutch of effete, indulgent nations that have had a head start in industrialization, and are primarily responsible for punching a big hole in the ozone layer. These mostly western nations led by the United States have milked the planet's resources to develop first and faster. They are now putting the crimp on laggards who were tied down principally by colonialism.The numbers are well known. Big industrial power polluters currently clubbing New Delhi on the head like to bellow that India is now the world's third largest net polluter. They artfully underplay the fact that the country's per capita emission is among the lowest in the world (155th), a tenth of that of the United States' and a fourth of that of China. Yet demonization of New Delhi, amplified by its own dodgy domestic dithering, indifference, and general sloppiness, has reached a crescendo at the global forum, with talk of India making or breaking COP21.""Everything about America is big"" is a familiar observation made frequently by visitors to the United States. They are awed by the size of its cars, its roads and buildings, and indeed its drink and food portions. It starts with homes. There is really no need for President Obama to drum up the Arctic Circle or invoke Martin Luther King to emphasize the gravity of the climate change situation and who is responsible for it. He only needs to look outside his modest office-cum-residence, a mansion that has a mere 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, and reflect on a country that is as rapacious as it is capacious, to appreciate the sins of emission.Owners of some of the biggest homes in the world, Americans have been expanding into even larger houses even amid crises, regardless of the slippery slope of climate change. For all his industrious campaigning in Paris, even the thoughtful Bill Gates weighs in with a 66,000 sq foot home (estimated building cost $ 64 million). It is ten times the size of the Omaha home of his mentor Warren Buffett bought in 1958 for $ 31,500, which is only a modest 4x the current American home. The AVERAGE size of homes now being built in the U.S (family size 2.4 people) has touched 2,600 square feet, an all-time high. This is twice the size of homes in most other developed countries.Contrast that with the 504 square feet that that an Indian family with a household strength of 4.8 persons cramps itself into, and you get a sense of who is sucking up resources. In fact, a report in this paper, based on the Indian National Sample Survey, computed that 32 per cent of Indian urban homes are 258 sq feet or less, and given that the urban household strength is 4.3 persons, this translates to only 60 sq ft per person. Sixty sq ft is the minimum specified for a US prison cell.None of this amounts to a get-out-of-jail card for New Delhi, which needs to drag itself up the slippery slop as much for its own citizens as for the rest of the world. But the developed world has a poor appreciation of the natural thriftiness of Indians when it comes to resources, arising from a culture of dearth. Nowhere is this better reflected than from the vantage position of a true Indian-American home, which for the purpose of this narrative (and to retain domestic harmony) should remain unidentified.Growing up in a resource-scarce environment, the Indian spouse's natural inclination, even amid American plentitude, is to conserve, sustain, recycle, and generally abjure waste, much less indulge in extravaganza or ostentation. The American spouse, despite a shared commitment to a better life and higher ideals, but with an upbringing unconstrained by shortages or deprivation, has no such compulsion or compunction, much less instinct.Some day, perhaps very soon, all this won't matter. Revolutionary technologies - to provide us with cheap and boundless energy and bounteous food and water - are close at hand. The resource cornucopia, like the storage and bandwidth bonanza which is upon us, is only a decade or two away. But until then, will the last person to leave the kitchen after dinner - Indian or American - put away the leftovers, put out the recycle bin, turn off the tap, turn down the heat, and turn out the lights, please?For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

Nasser, together with the chief executive officers of 9 of the world s largest oil and gas companies - which together provide almost a fifth of all oil and gas production and supply over 10% of the world s energymet together in Paris to declare their collective support for an effective climate change agreement to be reached at the upcoming UN Conference on Climate Change (COP21).In the milestone collaborative declaration of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), the CEOs of the 10 member companies agreed to collaborate in a number of areas and to strengthen their actions and investments, and to play their part in reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy sector. The 10 member companies are Saudi Aramco, BG Group, BP, Eni, Pemex, Reliance, Repsol, Shell, Statoil and Total.Speaking in Paris, Amin H. Nasser said:As our track record shows, Saudi Aramco is committed to playing its part. Energy efficiency has been and will continue to be a top priority in everything we do to both benefit the Kingdom and to maintain our position as the world s largest, most reliable oil and gas producer.We believe that partnerships and collaboration are essential to address global challenges. We are therefore proud to be a founding member of the OGCI, which helps to put the oil and gas industry at the forefront of solutions to climate change and help demonstrate that a technology-driven, industry-enabled approach is the only viable way forward.The OGCI also today launched its collaborative report titledMore Energy, Lower Emissions.This report highlights practical actions taken by member companies, including Saudi Aramco, to improve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions management and work toward reducing the climate change impacts of the industry. These actions include significant investments in natural gas, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy, as well as low-GHG research and development.Saudi Aramco s environmental protection policy was established in 1963 and the company s comprehensive Energy Management Program is designed to both promote energy efficiency at the national level as well as continuously improve the efficiency of company facilities, by replacing older, lower efficiency power plants with new, higher technology and higher efficiency plants. This approach will also help drive significant fuel savings in the utility sector. In addition, the company supports the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program that aims to improve the efficiency of energy use in residential and commercial settings, in addition to industry and transportation.Innovation and advanced technology are critical to Saudi Aramco s strategy and examples of energy efficiency practices and technologies include:Gas flaringSaudi Aramco s total flared gas is industry-leading at less than 1%.Zero discharge technologyIn 2014 Saudi Aramco deployed zero discharge technology at 432 well sites to enhance oil and gas recovery, enabling the recovery of 7.6bln scf of gas and 415,000 barrels of oil.Cleaner fuels and fuel efficiencySaudi Aramco has a range of advanced Research & Development projects underway, including with auto manufacturers, on fuel and engine efficiency to increase the mileage efficiency of vehicles and to reduce pollutant emissions of future engines.Carbon Capture and Storagein July 2015 Saudi Aramco launched Saudi Arabia s first CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery pilot project at the Uthmaniyah field and Hawiyah facilities. The project will inject 800,000 tons of CO2 every year. In addition, the company has invested in technology start-ups, including Novomer, which develops catalysts capable of efficiently and profitably converting CO2 into valuable products, such as polyurethanes.RenewablesSaudi Aramco is considering 300MW of wind and solar projects to replace liquid fuels in power generation, and a wind power feasibility study is underway for bulk plants.\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India312","France : COP21: Ministers and Leaders Call for a Quick Move the Zero Emissions Vehicles","December 9, 2015 Wednesday","TendersInfo","At a meeting at the COP21 in Paris, ministers and senior representatives from the vehicles industry, civil society and international organizations have called for a swift move to zero emissions vehicles as a key component of a future global climate change strategy.Currently the transport sector is almost completely dependent on fossil fuels. It contributes for one quarter to all energy related carbon dioxide emissions, which is set to grow to one-third, growing faster than any other sector.20151208_144944The meeting also recognized that zero emissions vehicles need to be seen as part of a wider strategy for a more sustainable transport sector that includes better city planning, public transport and non-motorized transport, among others. Dr. Clos, the Executive Director of UN-Habitat UNs Human Settlements Programme said: ZEVs will also reduce local air pollution in cities that is causing immense damage to health and the economy. The uptake of electric-mobility will be more feasible and also fruitful if cities adopt compact planning and measures to improve public transport.The event recognized the important role of the industry in making the global shift to zero emissions vehicles and the need to develop public private partnerships to support a wider introduction of zero emissions vehicles. In that context Ms. Dijksma, the Netherlands State Secretary for Environment and Infrastructure, said It is exciting to see that more and more car makers from all around the world are developing and producing mass market zero emission cars. The transition to zero emission mobility is in my opinion unstoppable and also absolutely necessary to make our world more safe, sustainable and liveable.The event discussed that any future climate plan would need to include major emissions reductions of the transport sector, and that zero emissions vehicles, and in specific electric vehicles, would be an essential component to achieve those emissions reductions. Dr. Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency said: Electric vehicles can drive us into a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. The IEA has shown that if global warming is to be limited to 2 degrees, at least a fifth of all vehicles on roads by 2030 should be electric.The event called for a global approach to electrification of vehicles, to ensure maximum climate and air quality benefits. Organisations present at the event promised to work together to develop such a coordinated global approach. Mr. Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said: The time has come to start developing a global push towards zero emissions vehicles. The continued use of fossil fuels for transport is costing too much climate, air pollution and economic costs. To get the necessary benefits we need to ensure this will indeed be a global shift in all regions and countries world-wide.The event found that while the world will still rely on fossil fuels for transportation needs for some time, the time is now to start a global shift to zero emissions vehicles. The event showed that zero emissions vehicles are successfully being introduced in different market segments electric 2 wheelers, private cars, and city busses.Several existing and new programs to promote zero emissions vehicles were showcased at the event, including the Clean Energy Ministerials Electric Vehicles Initiative, hosted by the International Energy Agency; the Urban Electric Mobility Initiative of UN-Habitat, and the Zero Emissions Vehicles Alliance launched by the US State of California, together with Qubec, and the Netherlands. UNEP announced a new global programme to support emerging economies to promote to electric mobility.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India313","India : Intervention by Environment Minister at the Informal COP-21 Meeting in Paris","September 8, 2015 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The following is the text of the intervention by Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar at the informal Conference of Parties (COP-21) meeting in Paris on September 06-07, 2015.The world must debate seriously the sustainable lifestyle issue, as only sustainable lifestyle can mitigate the challenge of Climate Change. Technology may bring forth some solutions, but we must ensure that needs of 7 billion people are met on a sustainable basis. Greed and unsustainable lifestyle should have no place in a new world regime to fight Climate Change and its ill-effects.Latest Earth Overshoot Report is an eye-opener. Global Footprint Network (GFN) every year presents a report on ecological footprint which maps consumption and requirement of natural resources to sustain it. Lifestyle adopted in developed countries is unsustainable and it will require five Earths to fulfil their lifestyle demands. On the other hand, Indian lifestyle is sustainable where one earth is sufficient. This is not because of poverty, but because of Indian value systems. We believe in need-based consumption and our lifestyle is against extravagant consumption. We have an ingrained sense of responsibility where wasteful consumption is abhorred. Therefore, the Paris conference must include a debate on lifestyles. The Earth Overshoot Report has indicated that the Ecological Footprint of developed countries ranges from 8 to 4 whereas India is at 0.9.India and other developing countries have priority of eradication of poverty. They cannot be asked to compromise on that goal in the name of Climate Change. Every poor of the World has the right to emerge out of poverty, and poor and developing countries need sufficient carbon space to ensure sustainable development. As Climate Change impacts the poorer and vulnerable sections severely, we must ensure climate justice.Shri Javadekar expressed concern over the recently concluded Bonn negotiations round wherein instead of discussion on draft text, there was an effort to steamroll and thrust new ideas. It also rejected proposals of developing countries. For a successful Paris summit, next round of Bonn negotiations in October must come out with a draft text, which will include all the principles of convention like CBDR and Equity, as also all elements of Convention like Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance & Technology and Capacity Building in the core agreement.Shri Javadekar also chaired a meeting of the group of Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) at the Indian Embassy and held bilaterals with UK, USA and Germany.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India314","The Other War","December 4, 2015","Open","When will world leaders act with alacrity in the battle against global warming?Paris, these days, is the focus of disquietude and contemplation. Last month, it was in this city that a war on terror was declared again. Today, Paris is centre stage as the host of a global discussion on the fate of our planet. World leaders have gathered to chart a road map, a strategy to fight this 'war' against climate change. In the sombre environment left by the barbarous terrorist attack on its soil, a battle plan is being drawn up to fight the horror that carbon emissions will wreak across the world if they are allowed to go on at their current rate.Representatives from all over the world are busy with climate diplomacy, since every country does not agree on what must be done, and pressure is high to reach a consensus. Since 1992, planet savers from around the globe have met in Berlin, Kyoto, Buenos Aires, Marrakesh, New Delhi, Milan, Buenos Aires, Montreal, Nairobi, Bali, Copenhagen, Doha and Lima. They meet, argue and shout in the hope of forging agreements and protocols for the future of Earth. Such talks in the past have given us the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.The Kyoto Protocol was treated as a watershed movement at the time in its bid to slow global warming. But the treaty finalised that Japanese city in 1997, after years of negotiations, came into force only in 2005. And the result since has been disappointing. Its commitments were not met and the world's leading economies started to backslide. Along with the US and China, India too had become a big contributor to the problem. Some of the progress that Europeans claimed to have made was on account of closing inefficient industries in the former Soviet bloc.For the past two decades now, delegates have been trying to hammer out a way to cut emissions and stop the drilling of fossil fuel wells. But in the real world, the mantra in practice is still 'drill, baby, drill' from the Middle East to the shale oil fields of North America.If fossil fuel consumption does not go down, we are warned, then a polar cap meltdown may not be very far away. Every single year so far this decade has been hotter than every single year before 1998, with 2015 being declared the hottest year on historical record. Climate patterns in India already seem to be badly affected, with Delhi's winters taking longer to set in this year and Chennai suffering a harrowing flood. The threat is dire and the clock is ticking. Climate experts say we all have about 30 years before burning more carbon causes a dangerous rise in the world's mean temperature. In the words of Christiana Figueres, a UN official, ""There's an emergency on climate, [so] let's just cut to the chase.""Now that the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is under way in Paris, the question is: will it be just another conference that ends in negotiations to be pushed forward for another year?At the onset of COP21, optimism prevailed in Paris, as we saw world leaders coming onto the same platform, singing the same hymn, and speaking of their intention to work together. That's the beginning of something concrete-being on the same page. Isn't it? But therein lies an irony, and at the end of two weeks, we might see divisions and cracks everywhere.The leaders understand the political nature and difficulties of this messy real world challenge, one they themselves have created. But the truth is that all nations care essentially only about themselves. We are selfish and conflicted, and so each country represented in Paris is concerned about limiting carbon production only to the extent that does not damage its own economy. And yet, each nation also wants all the others to limit carbon emissions in order to contain climate change.The conferences of the past have all ended in weak promises and little concrete action. But this year's summit in Paris holds out extra hope since negotiators had agreed in 2011 that a deal had to be done by the end of 2015. The delegates of more than 200 countries are thus under pressure to reach an ambitious deal to limit future emissions and slow the temperature increase. Will they succeed? Will China, India and the US, considered the supervillains of the environment, relent?After all, the risks to the planet are rising sharply and the need of the hour is a fresh start to climate diplomacy. It's a global problem, an existential threat with sweeping economic implications. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions would require the transformation of many a country's economy.Undoubtedly, the new world order is plagued with daunting problems, be it terrorist threats, armed conflicts, faltering economies, or this-climate change. They are all largely man-made. But no problem is more pressing than that of a planet in peril. The leaders who have gathered in Paris, therefore, have to end the deadlock and take swift action. If air raids and bombs can be dropped at the spur of the moment, why can't decisions on global warming be more prompt and ambitious? After all, the fate of about six billion people is at stake.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India315","Fertilizer companies will not allow meaningful action in agriculture during COP 21: report","October 1, 2015 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Oct. 1 -- A new report has lashed out at fertilizer companies, stating that the latter will block any meaningful action on agriculture vis-a-vis climate change during Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 in Paris in December.At present, chemical fertilizers contribute to 10 per cent of the world's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The report has been released by Spain-based non-profit, GRAIN, which supports small-scale farmers and biodiversity-based food system controlled by the community.The Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture formed last year at the UN summit in New York has floated a number of non-profits which are trying to influence Asian and African countries to use chemical fertilizers as a solution to climate change, the report adds.Fertlizers and emissionsThe 10-page report has termed fertilizer companies the ""oil companies of the food world"". The role of fertilizers in contributing to GHGs and climate change has been misunderstood and severely underestimated, the report says.The global fertilizer industry is dominated by a handful of corporations based in Europe and USA. Yara International, a Norwegian company, dominates the global nitrogen fertilizer market. The Mosaic Company based in USA and a few companies in Canada and Israel control the global potash supply.The report points out these companies use shale gas to produce fertilizers. It states, ""People associate shale gas, not Yara, with fracking. But it is Yara that coordinates the corporate lobby for shale gas development in Europe, and it is Yara and other fertilizer companies that suck up most of the natural gas produced by the fracking boom in the US.""The production of nitrogen fertilizers requires an enormous amount of natural gas. The supply of natural gases from fracked wells causes leakage of 40-60 per cent more methane than conventional natural gas well. Methane is more powerful than carbon dioxide (Co2) as GHG.Production, however, accounts for only a small fraction of GHG emissions generated by chemical fertilizers. Mostly, emissions occur after application of fertilizers, the report adds.The report says, ""The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that for every 100 kg of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the soil, 1 kg ends up in the atmosphere as nitrous oxide, a gas that is 300 times more potent than Co2 as a greenhouse gas, and is the world's most significant ozone-depleting substance. In 2014, this was equivalent to the average annual emissions of 72 million cars driven in the US-about a third of the US fleet of cars and trucks.""COP 21 vs smart agricultureAccording to the report, fertilizer giants coined the term climate-smart agriculture amidst allegations of contribution to climate change.""It builds upon previous, equally abstract terms promoted by the fertilizer industry to cast chemical fertilizers as part of the solution to climate change, such as climate-compatible agricultural growth and sustainable intensification.""The report states, ""Of the Alliance's (Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture), 29 non-governmental founding members, there are three fertilizer industry lobby groups, two of the world's largest fertilizer companies (Yara of Norway and Mosaic of the US), and a handful of organisations working directly with fertilizer companies on climate change programmes. Today, 60 per cent of the private sector members of the Alliance still come from the fertilizer industry.""""The fertilizer industry collaborates with the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) on various climate-smart initiatives in the south. The relationship extends to the Bill Gates-funded Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) which has several areas of cooperation with the CGIAR and the fertilizer industry, such as the African Green Revolution Forum that was established by Yara and AGRA in 2010.""World Food Prize winner Hans Herren said this strong lobby would push out those who advocate sustainable agriculture.""The international discussions were hijacked by agribusiness companies, the World Bank, the US and other climate-smart agriculture-friendly governments,"" Herren added. ""They have the money and the lobby groups. Those of us defending agro-ecology, local food systems and small-scale farming as the holistic and truly climate friendly solution were simply pushed out of the process.""Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

India has put forward new ideas and proposed debate on lifestyle issues, climate justice and green credit mechanism. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was a success for the first commitment period ending in 2012. Demand-supply mismatch and low ambition for emission reduction expressed by developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol is a major cause for the slowdown of the well-established CDM market thereafter. In addition, the unilateral decision taken by some countries to restrict the benefits of CDM to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) only, and not to other developing countries like India, has further reduced the confidence in the Market mechanism. At present, CDM is facing one of the most severe crises since its inception. Therefore, the world must discuss new ways to make it a success, with newer concepts like green credit. Carbon pricing is a major issue but we should not forget that it is a function of demand and supply. The world is now ready with respective Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), with the resolve of each country to work in the direction of green growth. Thus, the signal for the industry is positive and they should invest more and more for research and development. Research and development must also become part of the business plan, which carries a certain risk, but also generates tremendous profits for the companies. The real issue is how to make available the critical technologies for the developing world at an affordable cost. To this end, India is proposing that part of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) should be used for this purpose, which will be a win-win proposal for all the stakeholders"".\l"

India ranks seventh among the 24 countries surveyed, a statement by Ipsos said. ""India has been strongly impacted by climate change and global warming, given the sudden upheavals in weather conditions. ""There have been growing incidence of landslides, earthquakes and unseasonal heavy rainfall on the one hand and extremely high temperature and drought-like conditions on the other hand,"" Ipsos' Managing Director (India) Amit Adarkar said. ""I'm not surprised that a large majority of Indians perceive it as a serious threat.

These include emission checks, encouraging use of public transportation and moving towards alternative clean renewable energy sources. Close on the heels of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, Ipsos polled citizens around the world to gauge their opinion on climate change issues. One of the highlights of the Paris climate change agreement is the commitment of all countries to reduce carbon emissions. However, nearly 60 percent polled globally disagree that it is practical and feasible to almost completely eliminate the use of oil and gas in the next ten years. India and Latin America are still more optimistic than North America, Europe, Middle East Africa and rest of Asia Pacific countries in its resolve to reducing carbon emissions. Only 43 percent Indians disagree that it is possible for India to eliminate the use of oil and gas and to bring down emissions, with Japan disagreeing the most at 79 per cent, Ipsos said.

In the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions announced recently, India had set a target of creating an additional 2.5 to 3 billion (250 crore) tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon sink, which is a natural or artificial reservoir with ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ""In the past 24 months, 37 crore tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon sink was created. We will achieve more than our INDC target which is to create 250 crore tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon sink,"" he said after releasing India State of Forest Report-2015, which estimated an increase of 21.34 per cent and 24.36 per cent in the forest and tree cover respectively. The report showed an increase of 3,775 sqkm in the overall forest cover and 1,306 sqkm in the tree cover of the country as compared to 2013 assessment. Javadekar, who will attend the Conference where a universal agreement on climate is expected to be achieved, said India's INDC target will be achieved by aggressive afforestation, use of alternative sources of fuels, effective protection mechanism and sustainable forest management. According to the report, the present forest cover is estimated to be 7,01,673 sqkm, which is 21.34 per cent of the geographical area of the country. While, the net increase in the forest cover is a result of expansion in very dense forest and open forest, the moderately dense forest has decreased by 3,371 sqkm as compared to the 2013 estimates. The major states showing gain in forest cover include Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.\l"

Choudary.The Prime Minister urged the scientific community to focus on problems faced by India in the emerging critical areas of energy and water, among others. Modi said that the scientists should take it as a challenge to find innovative solutions for cleaning up rivers such as the Ganga.The Prime Minister highlighted the healthcare needs of the country such as the prevalence of malnutrition and the disease of sickle-cell anaemia in certain tribal areas, and said they needed immediate attention. Modi added that India must become self-reliant in medical equipment manufacturing.Modi also asked scientists to work towards revolutionizing the clean energy sector and described solar energy as the ultimate solution to India's energy problems. He then called upon scientists to come up with ideas and concepts for global leadership, as the United Nations in Paris draws closer.Modi said that more innovations are needed in the agriculture sector to reduce wastage of agricultural produce. The Prime Minister said that while science is universal, technology must be local, adding that India's import of agricultural products must be eliminated.

It was a proud moment for India as well as for Yugratna, who, six years ago, became the youngest child to address as many as 100 world leaders at the 2009 United Nation summit on climate change in New York.Yugratna was part of the conference of youths, held from November 26 to 28, prior to the conference. The programme was aimed at preparing youngsters from 66 countries to talk about climate change before world leaders during the COP 21 summit. Youths participating in the conference gave presentations on 'climate crisis and concerns about environment conservation'.For Yugratna, this was her second meeting with the prime minister. In 2010 she had visited Gujarat and had met Modi, who was then serving as the chief minister of the state. Talking about her experience of speaking in front of the prime minister, Yugratna said, ""It's a milestone achievement. It's something big to represent the country before the world on such a platform, in the presence of the prime minister. I am enthralled.""Explaining how she got shortlisted for this prestigious conference, Yugratna said that it was on the basis of her achievements and work experience at the world-level programme, 'climate strike'. ""I am the part of Climate Strike, a world-level programme to put a check on economical and ecological destruction, and to promote green alternatives. I was among the eight in the core team. On the basis of my work during this programme, UN shortlisted me to be a part of the event,"" she added.At the Paris climate conference, Yugratna found US President Barack Obama's speech the most interesting.

"COP21","India","COP21_India330","The crisis enveloping Europe","December 9, 2015 Wednesday","South Asia Monitor","New Delhi, Dec. 9 -- The combination of geo-economics and geopolitics is today fuelling a degree of paranoia. Many in Europe see the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris as the precursor to a fresh wave of violence across the continentThe world has been looking to the COP-21 (2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference) with great anticipation, hoping that the outcomes would pave the way for an equitable agreement that would satisfactorily address the issue of global warming and achieve the prescribed target of limiting the rise in global temperatures to less than 2deg Celsius. The jury is still out on what COP-21 will ultimately achieve.There was, however, an uninvited guest present in many of the same salons in Paris, where the climate change meetings have been held. Like Banquo's ghost, terrorism was an overwhelming presence, never absent from the thoughts of both leaders and other participants attending the COP-21. The incidents where there were five shootings and two bombings by gunmen and suicide bombers belonging to the Islamic State (IS) on predetermined targets in Paris on November 13, and resulting in 130 fatalities and injuries to over 200 more people, have left France in a state of shock. Worse, they have left an indelible imprint on the French ethos. This is now beginning to reverberate across most of Europe. The meticulous planning, the calibrated nature of the attacks and the use of modern communication equipment by the perpetrators have jolted France and Europe. Governments across Europe are being compelled to review and change their laissez-faire procedures and security doctrines.Jolted by ParisIf any one single act could make Europe truly understand the meaning of German philosopher general Carl von Clausewitz's phrase, that ""war is an act of force to compel the enemy to do our will"" (substitute the word terrorism for war), then it was the November 13 attacks in Paris. It has had serious repercussions in neighbouring Belgium, which shut down for a while. Meanwhile, an entire continent has developed a siege mentality.This was clearly evident during a meeting that I attended of erstwhile senior policymakers in Europe, held exactly a week after the terrorist attacks in Paris. What was apparent during the discussions was that Europe had changed. As Europe weeps over this, and is outraged by the barbaric acts of premeditated violence, indignation over the terrorist attacks, together with the uncontrolled flow of migrants/refugees into the continent from West Asia and other regions, is beginning to cast a shadow over the character of Europe, especially its approach to humanitarian and other causes.Europe has been wrestling with economic issues since the 2007-2008 economic crisis and financial meltdown. It had, consequently, put geo-economics on top of its agenda. Even as the existential crisis regarding the future of the Euro-zone is still to be resolved, and Europe is yet to fully recover from the great debt crisis, it now confronts a range of newer threats. This has required the return of geopolitics. The combination of geo-economics and geopolitics is today fuelling a degree of paranoia. Many in Europe see the November 13 terrorist attacks as the precursor to a fresh wave of violence across Europe.Beginning 2015, Europe, including France, has witnessed terror attacks with increasing regularity. Since 2008, the death toll in violent conflict has gone up in geometrical progression. It is in this milieu that Europe is confronted with the greatest influx of refugees since the end of the Second World War. Europe seems overwhelmed as a result. One immediate result is that it has led to a divided European Union. It has also given an impetus to right-wing nationalist forces in many countries. The Schengen concept is under grave threat.Living with terrorEurope, though, is no stranger to terrorism or terrorist attacks. The Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany, the Red Brigades in Italy, the 17 November in Greece and other terror groups that operated in France, the United Kingdom and Spain during the latter half of the 20th century had all wrought a great deal of fear. The 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games ranks among the most diabolical events in the annals of terrorism anywhere. Nevertheless, European strategic experts tend to think that the latest events signal a turning point in the history of Europe.It is not merely that every one of them had underestimated the threat posed by the IS - or their capacity to strike far beyond the borders of Syria and Iraq, extending further into West Asia and now into Europe. Further, they had misjudged the fallout of the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars, which had now metastasised into Lebanon, into Jordan, into Turkey and now into Europe, with thousands of refugees likely to seek asylum in Europe in the coming years. The real fear is that the combination of pressures had the potential to create a situation leading to the disintegration of a united Europe.As the crisis in Europe deepens, concerns are also being voiced at the same time over the implications of French President Francois Hollande's ""Declaration of War"" against the IS. Europe tends to be divided between those who want the state to be armed with greater powers and those who fear that indiscriminate ""war talk"" may lead to a crackdown domestically on any contrarian voices.The employment and the use of extraordinary powers under the plea that the nation and its institutions are under grave and immediate threat have serious connotations for Europe's future according to the champions of civil liberty and keepers of the European way of life. Following the terror attacks in Paris, the passing of a statute in peacetime granting the French President emergency powers is seen as far too draconian a measure, which they believe is likely to have unforeseen consequences. France's example, they think, would in turn be emulated by other European states.Emergency measures vs civil freedomsThe chasm between those who are pressing for changes in the statute and also in policies and those others who want the existing safeguards to be preserved to retain France's European character is increasing with each passing day. This has added to the sense of impending crisis. What is considered certain by most is that European intelligence agencies will be invested with greater powers for surveillance and to carry out more intrusive attacks. At present, those who insist on the importance of safeguarding civil freedoms are clearly in the minority.As Europe flounders on how to deal with a cornucopia of new problems, it is worth considering whether the developments in Europe will have an impact on global governance. Coexistence among people of different regions and the compact among those belonging to different religions across the planet - something that Europeans, in particular, are said to greatly treasure - is coming under threat. This may well turn into a major geopolitical issue.Many, and this includes those not only in Europe, express fear that the Muslim world is coming apart, enabling extreme radicalist elements like the IS to flourish. Sustaining a reasonably open and tolerant state in such circumstances, they believe, has become difficult. Most European leaders, as of now, hew to the view that an open attitude at this juncture may be too much to ask for.(M.K.

"COP21","India","COP21_India336","Paris COP21: Green pact talks hinge on finance","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","The Economic Times","LE BOURGET: The contentious issue of finance remains unresolved even as negotiators and ministers work towards framing a global agreement on climate change.A resolution must address the entire gamut of the questions on finance - starting with who provides it, who is eligible for it and what is the minimum amount of predictable finance that is being promised, to the mechanism to ensure that there is a predictable increase in amount over time and how we ensure that countries are held accountable for the finance they are providing.It is unlikely that a meaningful, durable and effective agreement will be possible without resolving these questions.Developing countries have consistently maintained that under the provisions of the UN Convention on Climate Change, it is the responsibility of the rich and industrialised countries to provide finance to developing countries so they can take measures that would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pollution and adapt to the effects of climate change.Developing countries are clear that this is not ""aid"" but an obligation - for creating a situation that has led the world on to the dangerous path of irreversible climate change.South Africa's Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, who is also chair of the 134-member strong developing country bloc G-77 and China, said, ""Developed countries are obligated to provide financial resources, including technology transfer and capacity building to all developing countries. This is a legal obligation under the (UN Framework) Convention (on Climate Change, UNFCCC).It is neither aid nor charity, nor is it the same as development assistance."" Industrialised countries acknowledge this but, with an eye on changing global realities, would like developing countries ""in a position to do so"" to contribute to the pool. This attempt to increase the donor base has been strongly contested by developing countries.""The emphasis should be on the amount of money that is being raised and not on the number of countries on the donor list. At the end, what matters is how much money is there on the table, the size of the pie, whether it is adequate to address requirements of developing countries or not. More number of countries does not necessarily mean a larger amount of money being mobilised,"" said senior Indian negotiator Ajay Mathur.There has been some attempt to soften this stance of industrialised countries. US climate change envoy Todd Stern said, ""The 'position to do so' provision has been over-read. It is not an obligation on developing countries to provide finances but a voluntary decision.""The US lead negotiator was referring to instances when developing countries have stepped up with funds, such as the eight countries that have contributed to the Green Climate Fund or China pledging $3.1 billion for developing countries.However, as a senior African negotiator said, ""Developing countries have always provided finances and other support to other developing countries to deal with climate change. But this is something we do as part of south-south cooperation and doesn't have any relationship to the climate agreement.The onus of providing finance for climate-related efforts lies solely with industrialised countries.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

All these issues will be discussed at G20 meeting...They will have to find out new source of financing (ahead of ),"" said Hulot while addressing a business interactive session, organised here by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI),The G20 countries comprises of the world's largest developed and emerging economies, responsible for 70% of the global greenhouse gas emission. The group together represents two-third of the world's population, 85% of the global GDP and over 75% of the global trade.Its members include the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, China, South Korea, Mexico, India and Saudi Arabia among others. Political leaders of G20 will meet for two days in Turkey on November 15-16 while the climate conference (COP21) will begin in Paris on November 30.Though majority of these G20 countries have already submitted their 'climate action plan', called Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in climate talks jargon, India is expected to do the same by September. The country will flag the issue of climate finance and technology transfer in its plan while committing certain 'conditional' goals.Raising the issue of intellectual property right (IPR) of low carbon cutting edge technology during the FICCI meet, Susheel Kumar - additional secretary in the ministry of environment - said France, being the host country of the next climate conference, will have to take serious note of it and try to incorporate it in the final climate agreement as how the rich nations would end this barrier.""Developing nations often feel that there is reluctance on part of countries holding IPRs to part with cutting edge technology within a short timeframe. We have to find a mechanism in which this reluctance, which is a barrier, vanishes or at least gets diminished,"" Kumar said.Referring to the issue of climate finance, he said, ""We have been saying that investment flow (which may have green benefits) is not climate change finance. Investment flow in any case happens, and that is in anticipation of return of investment.""Climate finance should either be public funding or some kind of a subvention for the industry to adopt climate-friendly technologies"".Spelling out the key elements of a ""good outcome"" of the Paris conference in December, Laurence Tubiana - ambassador for International Climate Change Negotiations and Special Representative of the French Government for COP 21 - said it should be a new ""legal instrument"" that is universal and legally binding to enable the global community address the challenges of climate change.She also highlighted that Paris agreement must send out a clear and long-term signal on the future direction of the global policy so the business are confident about the much needed global and national actions on climate change.It is expected that the political leaders from rich and emerging economies would be able to take some firm stand during G20 summit as they will by mid-November have clearer picture as to where the all INDCs together would take the world.Since many developing countries' 'climate action plan' will depend on the 'finance' and 'technology' which they would get from their rich counterparts, the outcome of the G20 in mid-November will be the guiding principles to resolve these two key issues. It will also make it clear whether the world would get some strong and effective climate deal or it will just have to content with a weak agreement.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

UNEP is confident that this agreement with WFP will assist us to mainstream improved environmental management with humanitarian and early recovery activities through the wide-spread, professional presence of WFP in Sudan, ultimately helping recipient communities build resilience to climate change, UNEP Representative Bradley Smithsaid of the agreement, signed earlier this month. UNEP and its partners are promoting innovative natural resource management mechanisms that will contribute to improved livelihoods and climate resilience, while reducing conflict over precious natural resources such as water, forests and rangeland. This agreement shows our commitment to the outcomes of the United Nations that has just concluded in Paris, WFPs Sudan Country Director Adnan Khan said. We are very pleased to have this opportunity to work with UNEP in assisting the Government of Sudan to address environmental issues and the challenges of climate change that could damage efforts to achieve Zero Hunger, especially where these involve smallholder farmers and other vulnerable groups that we assist through our programmes, Khan added. WFP supports vulnerable groups in Sudan in building their resilience to climate-related shocks and disasters while restoring livelihoods among internally displaced people, refugees and vulnerable communities. The necessity of climate analysis and disaster-risk reduction is rapidly becoming apparent in Sudan, as fears grow that delayed and insufficient rainfall caused by this years El Nio weather pattern, which brings devastating droughts or catastrophic floods to different areas of the globe, has hurt crop development in key production areas of Sudan and increased the risk of below-average yields.

That was the consensus of top government officials and scholars, including Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert Stavins, who participated at a side panel discussion at the UN Climate Change Summit (COP-21) in Paris today (Dec. 7).California is one of the most active and effective states in low carbon development, said Xie Zhenhua, China Special Envoy on Climate Change, in his opening remarks. With the support of California the two countries will make more contributions in low carbon development.California Governor Jerry Brown, who delivered the second keynote address, spoke of the promise of solar power development in his state while acknowledging the challenges of engineering more robust storage systems for alternative energy sources. California is working on storage and I hope that China and California can work together, because with greater storage, solar energy and wind energy become much more attractive, he said.China has experience with pilot cap and trade systems in seven cities and provincesand plans to roll out a national system by 2017. California has a robust state-wide cap and trade mechanism already in place. With respect to the development of carbon markets, Brown remarked that it takes technicians, it takes engineers, it takes regulators to fashion the rules that will govern carbon markets. And we are working with China on whatever it takes to help them.Matt Rodriguez, California Secretary for Environmental Protection, sounded a similar positive theme, citing several areas of cooperative efforts.California is not working on climate change issues alone. China and California are working together to work on climate change issuesIve seen the changing stations in Chinese cities , Rodriguez asserted. Ive had discussions with Chinese officials about electric vehicles. I can see a serious commitment in China.Robert Stavins, the Albert Pratt Professor of Business and Government and the faculty director of the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements, praised Californias efforts to date for addressing carbon emissions, citing the excellent design features of the states cap-and-trade system, while also admitting the system isnt perfect. He then went on to review a number of lessons from Californias experience with carbon markets that might be helpful to China.Stavins also said that whether or not the future focus of international climate change cooperation occurs under the rubric of the United Nations Climate Change Convention (UNCCC) or one of any number of alternative mechanism, the importance of carbon pricing and of the linkage between carbon pricing mechanisms will remain.The other panelists who participated in the event were: Aimee Barnes, Deputy Secretary of California Environmental Protection Agency; Zhu Xiaoming, Mayor, Zhenjiang City, China; Zou Ji, Deputy Director General, National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, China; and Angie Fyfe, Director, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy, ICLEI, Local Governments for Sustainability.\l"

He stated that the share of India in CO2 space is mere 2.8% but still it has to embark upon largest renewable program to reach 175 GW RE capacity by 2022. However, since RE is not available 24x7, India has to look for adequate balancing power from coal as India does not have enough gas and oil resources he added.Stressing that coal is not an option but compulsion for India, Shri Jha spoke about research being carried on Advance Ultra Super Critical technology by different countries to enhance efficiency of coal plants. However, there is an urgent need to cooperate and share the developments by various countries to accelerate the pace of development and in the interest of the climate change without linking this to commercial/IPR issues he added.Shri Anil Kumar Singh, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Power, Government of India, in his address highlighted that in India Coal is the main mainstay of Indian power sector with over 170 GW of the total installed capacity out of total 280 GW and a mission to deploy 175 GW Renewable Power capacities by 2022. Shri Singh said that despite renewable addition, India will need to use coal to generate balancing power so as to provide affordable 24x7 power to its people.Shri A.K Ahuja, Executive Director, NTPC made a thematic presentation on the occasion stating that while making a choice for new capacity addition, four factors availability of fuel domestically, affordability , grid stability and its impact on the climate and environment are evaluated to arrive at an optimal mix.

This outcome was agreed after extensive negotiations during the 27th Meeting of the Parties (MOP27) to the Protocol, hosted by the Government of the United Arab Emirates in Dubai from 1 to 5 November.The parties recognized the progress made at MOP27 on discussing the challenges on feasibility and ways of managing HFCs, on issues related to flexibility of implementation, second and third stage conversions, guidance to the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, enabling activities for capacity building, and the need for an exemption for high ambient temperature countries.Further progress still needs to be made with respect to other challenges. The parties will continue their deliberations in 2016 with a series of Open-Ended Working Group meetings and others, including an extraordinary Meeting of the Parties.Achim Steiner, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director, said, ""Hydrofluorocarbons may not cause direct ozone damage, like the chlorofluorocarbons they replace, but many of them contribute to greenhouse emissions. In fact some estimates put their global warming impact at up to 10,000 times that of carbon dioxide.

A report by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warned that Italy's Alpine glaciers have lost about half of their area in last 30 years.On Friday, while talking to Xinhua news agency, Gianfranco Bologna, scientific director of WWF-Italy and co-author of the new report, said current situation of Alpine glaciers is worrying as the glaciers have lost 40% of their area in just three decades.The WWF report, the Hot Ice, was released by the international non-governmental organization earlier this week ahead of a that is going to be held in November. The meeting in Paris has been scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 11.Authors of the report said that drastic measures should be considered by world leaders at the summit, so that glaciers across the globe could be saved from melting rapidly. The report stated that in 1980s, Alpine glaciers had covered an area of about 609 sq kms, but today, the glaciers are covering just 368 sq kms of area. The New Italian Glacier Inventory has provided the figures on Friday. These figures were previously presented at the 19th Alpine Glaciology meeting in May in Milan.As perthe new report said, ""Glacier melting is undoubtedly caused by human activities. The extent of interactions between the biosphere and the human species in recent centuries is unprecedented"". Alpine glaciers, also known as mountain glaciers or cirque glaciers, form on the crests and slopes of mountains. An alpine glacier that fills a valley is sometimes called a valley glacier.""The scientific community has been coordinating the collection of standardized data about glaciers worldwide since the end of 18th century,"" Bologna said.""We have seen them retreating slowly for over a century, and much more sharply in the last 50 years.""

The first leg of the drive included 46 hybrid and electric vehicles from different automobile manufacturers that were driven on the roads of Delhi. The fleet of the vehicles included two wheelers, cars and buses and this rally culminated at Gurgaon (Haryana). The drive was to promote conservation of energy and environmental benefits under the ambitious national scheme on Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles (FAME) India. FAME India is a scheme launched in the month of April 2015 for two years as an introductory phase with an approved outlay of nearly Rs. 800 Crore.Shri Anant G Geete on this occasion saidGlobally there is a paradigm shift in automobile transportation. Clean mobility solutions are being experimented and India cannot be far behind. Hybrid and electric vehicles are a need of future as they have come up as an excellent alternative solution for the petro products. They are not only environmentally friendly but are also pocket friendly for customers who are highly cost conscious in our country. In the recent years, concern about exhaust emissions from motor vehicles has been increasing despite improvements in vehicular technologies and fuel quality. Government of India is committed to work towards a cleaner environment and therefore development of alternative, cleaner fuels is paramount. The minister said the initial project for FAME India is nearly Rs. 800 crore but for its completion we require Rs. 14,000 crore, however adequate support and interest of both the buyers as well as the investors is a must requirement and hence it is imperative that widespread awareness needs to be generated for the viable utility of these new generation vehicles. The minister expressed hope that in the coming years with the increase in demand the prices of these will become more affordable. He said so far nearly 25,000 such vehicles have been sold and this trend is forging ahead.Shri G.M.Siddheswara, Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises on this occasion said that all the State Governments will be requested to bring down the VAT and registration charges on such vehicles so that incentive could be given for boosting up the sale of hybrid as well as electrical vehicles.With an objective of not keeping the campaign restricted to the bigger metro cities,3- CITIES FAME INDIA ECO DRIVEhas also been planned in Jaipur on 30th November 2015 & Chandigarh on 7th December 2015. The government has already paved the way of providing incentives to those buyers who plan to purchase hybrid and electric vehicles. Eco friendly vehicles from Tata Motors, Toyota Kirloskar Motors Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, BMW India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Hero Electric, Electrotherm and Lohia Motors were in the fleet.The event was moderated by Shri Ambuj Sharma, Additional Secretary in the M/o Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises. Dr. Rajan S.Katoch, Secretary, M/o Heavy Industries was also present on the occasion.On this occasion the message of the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) was highlighted which saidWe are proud to be associated with the FAME Eco-Drive Rally, as it is aligned to our mission of curbing one of the major environmental threats that our country is facing today - pollution. It is alarming that our country is ranked at the bottom among the 132 countries in the recent Environmental Performance Index report, and is home to 13 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world. But we strongly believe that by adopting e-vehicles, we can substantially reduce a significant amount of greenhouse gases that are hazardous to health. This will go a long way in mitigating climate change. The increased sales of EVs over the last six months are a testimony of how our citizens are becoming more sensitive towards the environment. We are certain that the numbers will grow by 200% by the end of 2016. We truly appreciate the Central government s step towards Electric Mobility and will continue to support their mission of bringing 7 million e-vehicles on road by 2020""The3-CitiesFame India Eco Drive is a public awareness campaign to promote electrification of automobile transportation to achieve objectives of the National Mission for Electric Mobility (NMEM). The initiative is being planned as a prelude to the 2015 United Nations (COP 21 or CMP 11) scheduled in Paris from November 30, 2015 - December 11, 2015. Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi is to participate in this conference.As part of the campaign, a similar rally of hybrid and electric vehicles will be held at Jaipur on 30th November 2015 (starting from Albert Hall Museum conclude at Amber Fort) and at Chandigarh on 7th December 2015 (starting from The Rock Garden and conclude at Indian School of Business, Mohali) in partnership with the respective State Governments.\l"

The exclusive video launched today of Katy Perry reading a unique weather report to draw attention to the devastating effects of climate change on the world's children has gained a lot of popularity. Katy reads the report at the United Nations held on December 7 in Paris, France, along with the gathering of hundreds of world leaders. In 2013, Ms. Perry was appointed as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador with an aim to engage young people to improve the lives of the world's most vulnerable children and adolescents.As per the report, droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions are putting children at an increased risk of disease and malnutrition, as well as destroying their families. The worst part to note is that some of the youngest and most vulnerable citizens of our world have to bear the most unfair burden of climate change. She stressed mainly on extreme weather conditions that are emerging across the globe and are making many people homeless. As per November report released by UNICEF, over half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million live in high drought severity areas.Katy reported that out of the 530 million children in flood-prone zones, some 300 million are in countries where more than 50% the population lives in poverty, surviving on less than $3.10 a day. Out of those people who are living in high drought severity areas, 50 million are in countries where more than 50% the population lives in poverty. Climate change resulting out to floods, heatwaves and other environmental conditions can cause diseases like malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, devastation and finally death. The superstar reported ""As a California Girl, I'm not the only one experiencing drought"". With the gradual increase in the field of science and technology, new industries are being developed that contribute a lot towards increasing risk of climate change.

""The situation of glaciers on the Italian side of the Alps is very worrying,"" Xinhua news agency on Friday quoted Gianfranco Bologna, scientific director of WWF-Italy and co-author of the report as saying. The Hot Ice report was unveiled earlier this week, ahead of a crucial United Nations due to be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11. The report suggested that drastic measures should be adopted at the Paris summit to prevent further deterioration of the glaciers in Italy and worldwide. With respects to the Italian Alps, the report stated glaciers currently cover a total area of about 368 sq.kms compared to 609 sq.kms in the 1980s. Friday's figures came from the New Italian Glacier Inventory, which was presented at the 19th Alpine Glaciology meeting held in May in Milan. The figures were compared with the 1989 World Glacier Inventory (WGI) based on data collected in the 1980s. The comparison suggested an area reduction of over 39 percent. Researches said glacier melting is undoubtedly caused by human activities, and the WWF report said, ""the extent of interactions between the biosphere and the human species in recent centuries is unprecedented."" ""The scientific community has been coordinating the collection of standardised data about glaciers worldwide since the end of 18th century,"" Bologna said. ""We have seen them retreating slowly for over a century, and much more sharply in the last 50 years."" The melting process is affecting the Arctic and Antarctica the most, but also glaciers around the world, such as in the Himalayas, Patagonia, Alaska, the Ural Mountains, and the Alps. Global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the main greenhouse gas produced by human activities and most responsible for global warming, have indeed risen to 35.3 billion tonnes per year in 2013 from 22.6 billion tonnes in 1990, according to the European Union Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). ""On this aspect, we must also emphasise the progressive effect of global warming,"" Bologna said. ""Firstly, ice is part of the water cycle.

UNDP, with support from donors and partners , has been a key partner in the INDC process and has directly supported countriesmany among the world s poorest and most vulnerableto finalize their INDCs. In addition to direct support, UNDP and partners have hosted regional dialogues, developed an INDC guidance document, and co-organized an INDC Global Forum in Morocco.We re incredibly pleased with the dedication and commitment by which our country partners have undertaken this process,notes Jo Scheuer, UNDP s Director for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction at the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support.To date 168 countries have submitted their intended targets, which collectively represent over 93% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is this bottom-up approach that has truly empowered the entire process leading up to Paris. UNDP is proud to have played a part in supporting this.A recent analysis by the UNFCCC of all INDCs submitted by 1 October found that the cumulative impact of all actions would keep global temperatures at around 2.7 degrees Celsius. While not yet sufficient to keep temperatures below the generally accepted 2 degree goal, the progress has nonetheless been lauded as a big step in the right direction. A key element going into the Paris negotiations will be how to establish a mechanism by which countries can regularly ratchet up support and heighten INDC ambition.With negotiations set to continue in Paris, UNDP is turning its attention towards the post-Paris period and the need to translate intended contributions into implemented actions. As many INDCs have been purposefully linked to national development plans, UNDP sees these as a key opportunity to deliver on sustainable development by integrating efforts to meet sustainable development goals and deliver on climate commitments. UNDP intends to announce a long-term plan of support for such a process at the Paris conference.With its accreditation as a key implementing agency of the Green Climate Fund, UNDP intends to leverage its existing $2.3 billion climate change portfolio and presence across 177 countries to support countries in implementing Paris commitments and scaling up efforts to tackle climate change.\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India370","France,United States : Bid to End Routine Gas Flaring Gets Huge Boost at COP21","December 8, 2015 Tuesday","TendersInfo","A global initiative to end routine gas flaring at oil production sites around the world has now been endorsed by 45 oil companies, governments and others, representing potential CO2 savings of 100 million tons a year.The Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative has had 20 new endorsements since first launched by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim in April. Altogether these 45 endorsers represent more than 40 percent of all global gas flaring.The oil and gas industry has a responsibility to cut routine gas flaring to zero, said Anita Marangoly George, World Bank Senior Director for Energy and Extractive Industries. Ending routine gas flaring not only stops millions of tons of CO2 going into the atmosphere every year, it can contribute to improving the life of the people who live around gas flare sites. If converted to power, the flared gas can produce electricity to light up the African continent. So what are we waiting for?The latest set of governments and companies committing to end routine gas flaring in existing oil fields and to no longer routinely flare in new oil fields, include: Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Turkmenistan, the State of California, BP, ETAP (Tunisia), Galp Energia (Portugal), KazMunayGaz (Kazakhstan), Niger Delta Petroleum Resources (Nigeria), Indias Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), Seven Energy (Nigeria), Sonangol (Angola) and Wintershall (Germany).They join 25 governments, oil companies and development institutions that endorsed the Initiative at the outset and over the last several months.During oil production, associated gas is produced and some of it is flared because of technical, regulatory, or economic constraints. As a result, thousands of gas flares at oil production sites around the globe burn about 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually, causing 350 million tons of CO2 to be emitted to the atmosphere every year.The move to end routine gas flaring is seen as a vital contribution to mitigation efforts as world leaders at the UN climate conference in Paris are working to seal a new global agreement on climate change. The Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative addresses a source of emissions that is relatively easy to identify and reduce. Fewer than 20 countries account for more than 80 percent of gas flaring.As more and more companies join the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, this becomes a de facto global industry standard, said Bjorn Hamso, Program Manager for the World Bank-led Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.The initiative encourages oil companies to seek economically viable solutions to eliminate ongoing legacy flaring as soon as possible and no later than 2030 and to ensure that when their new oil fields are developed, plans include gas utilization solutions that do not involve routine flaring or venting.\l"

"COP21","India","COP21_India372","United States : Joint statement by the World Bank Group and UN-Habitat on Sustainable Urban Development towards COP21, Habitat III, and the implementation of th....","October 12, 2015 Monday","TendersInfo","The World Bank Group and UN-Habitat share a vision of sustainable urban development. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a new opportunity to end poverty and ensure prosperity for all.Cities are engines of growth, innovation, and job creation. They are responsible for 80 percent of global GDP. And when they are well-planned, well-governed, and well-financed, cities drive national economic growth. Cities can also provide opportunities for employment, education, services, and upward social mobility.Good urbanization is not a passive outcome of economic growth. Benefits of urbanization are not guaranteed. Without appropriate legislation, good planning, and adequate financing, cities can fail their populations, especially the poor.Cities are also vulnerable to climate change and disasters because of their concentration of assets, people, and fragile ecosystems. Globally, 80 percent of the largest cities are vulnerable to severe earthquakes and 60 percent are at risk from tsunamis and storm surges. Many of the world s largest cities are either coastal, in a delta, or on a riverbank. Urban agglomerations are at risk of flooding due to powerful storms and sea-level rise.Cites are responsible for two-thirds of the world s energy consumption and 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Cities are beginning to take action, and they have a unique opportunity in helping the world achieve the 2 degrees target. Good and sustainable urbanization, that promotes well-designed compactness and connectivity, is good for climate change mitigation and adaptation.The challenge of our times is that most of the new urbanization is predominantly spontaneous and unplanned. Instead of positive outcomes, it often yields negative externalities such as congestion, sprawl, segregation, and pollution. Moreover, the speed and scale of urbanization brings challenges, including meeting accelerated demand for affordable housing, well-connected transport systems, and inclusive services for all.Sustainable development depends on sustainable urban development. The Sustainable Development Goals recognize the power of urbanization to accelerate prosperity and well-being. And they give cities a clear role in this transformation. To meet these demands, cities will need to enhance their financial and institutional capacities. National and local governments need to work together to leverage their respective roles and opportunities.The United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development Habitat III in Quito, October 2016 will be a unique forum for working with national governments. It will help set the basis for adequate rules and regulations, which govern people living close together and sharing common services; for better spatial planning and design, which optimize well-designed density, connectivity, and diversity; and for a financial plan, which sustains the functioning of the city and ensures economic prosperity. It is time to rethink urbanization and promote national urban policies.As we intensify our partnership towards the Paris COP21 Climate Summit and on to Habitat III in Quito, we encourage national governments, local authorities, citizens, and stakeholders to be involved in the definition and implementation of the new urban agenda. We call on development partners to join us in these efforts. We recognize the importance of effective public-private partnerships to drive the transformational role of sustainable urbanization.Now it is time to join forces and support cities at the frontl"

Their full involvement is essential for the success of this project, something which should be reflected through their participation in the energy regulatory authorities at national and European levels. This is what emerges from the position of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) on the Energy Union package adopted today, which also calls for a European definition of energy poverty and for ambitious action to promote smart grids.Last February the European Commission launched one of its flagship initiatives: its strategy for the creation of a European Energy Union intended to give Europe a secure, affordable, competitive and climate-friendly supply of energy. According to the CoR rapporteur Pascal Mangin (FR/EPP), Member of Alsace Regional Council,The Energy Union is a tremendous opportunity to reshape energy policy at the European level. By taking account of the involvement of local and regional authorities and operators and of Member States' powers, the EU aims to offer energy at competitive prices to our fellow citizens and companies, while making the Union less reliant on fossil fuels. The Committee of the Regions intends to participate fully in this work through the expertise and capacity for action of the authorities it represents"" . This is the aim of the opinion adopted at today s CoR plenary session.Engage local governments to ensure that the territorial dimension is incorporated into the future Energy Union, the CoR calls for local and regional authorities to be represented in national regulatory authorities and in the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators. The CoR also wishes to be involved in the work of the Energy Infrastructure Forum that the Commission will be setting up in the near future. The CoR in addition suggests considering the creation, in close cooperation with the Covenant of Mayor, of a ""territorial forum"" that would draw together local initiatives, disseminate best practices and encourage innovative financing.Energy efficiency and funding at local level the CoR welcomes the priority attached to improving energy efficiency but emphasises that this requires sound financial tools and a favourable regulatory environment for projects carried out at the local level. The CoR therefore calls for funds and financial instruments from the EU and the EIB to support not only large infrastructure projects but also smaller projects, whilst taking into account their added value for local authorities.Putting consumers at the heart of the strategy the CoR draws attention to the needs of vulnerable consumers and therefore calls for a common definition of energy poverty and for European indicators in order to develop targeted policies for each region or territory. The Committee also emphasises the need for concerted action on smart grids and smart metering, as tools to benefit consumers.Key role of research and innovation.The CoR acknowledges the strategic role of innovation in energy technology with a view to the successful decarbonisation of the EU's energy system. It reiterates that innovation and research in renewable energies, soft mobility, the modernisation of existing energy infrastructure and the construction of smart electricity plants should be promoted at the local level.\l"

Nuclear provided 62 percent of grid-delivered power in Ontario last year; hydro 24 percent; and wind 4 percent (solar was negligible). It was one of the key factors in helping Ontario end electricity generation from goal. Nuclear energy also provided 31 percent of New Brunswick's electricity last year, all from a single reactor.In the United States, President Barack Obama is committed to using every appropriate tool to combat climate change, including nuclear energy.Earlier this month, the White House hosted a Summit on Nuclear Energy and stated ""the continued development of new and advanced nuclear technologies along with support for currently operating nuclear power plants is an important component of our clean energy strategy.""""This nuclear foundation enables solar and wind technologies to integrate progressively into the electricity system,"" said Dr. Barrett. ""Canada has proven examples that other countries could consider.""Nuclear energy is one of the few currently available energy options already proven to be effective and implementable on a large scale. Today it provides 11 percent of global electricity.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nuclear energy since 1971 has avoided 56 Gt of emissions - equal to nearly two years of global GHG emissions.A recent IEA study said that a doubling of nuclear-generated electricity by 2040 would help the world to limit the rise in the average global temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.The IEA said such an investment would help avoid four years' worth of global CO2 emissions.The agency also called for major investments in renewable energies and carbon capture and sequestration.""Nuclear energy is clearly part of the solution,"" said Dr. Barrett.

We've being doing it longer than anyone else, we've sold more than anyone else and we've got plans for the future that are more credible than anyone else. Our pioneering partnership with ENEL is a perfect example of those plans, taking the car beyond a pure road vehicle, and using it to charge your home or office. It ultimately means that electric vehicles can now become a fully integrated part of our national electricity systems right across Europe. He also added A sustainable transportation future demands better connections between vehicles, utilities, renewable energy sources and buildings. This is why todays announcement is so important - it's the first step towards a truly integrated automotive energy eco-system. As the energy and automotive sectors converge, and as we look toward to an ever electric future, the opportunities for enhanced energy management have never been stronger. Vehicle-to-Grid technology represents a step closer to this vision and underscores Nissans commitment to the entire EV ecosystem it goes way beyond driving.The agreement with the ENEL Group will bring the first Grid Integrated Vehicles to countries where regulation allows sufficient value generation. Denmark will host the first set of trials with Germany, Netherlands and other northern European regions following suit. This endeavour is part of Enels and Nissans commitment to support the entire electric vehicle ecosystem, going way beyond the car itself and delivering new services to the power industry.Ernesto Ciorra, Director of Innovation and Sustainability at Enel Group stated: Enel is leading the power industry in developing and introducing a V2G charging infrastructure into the global market. We consider integration with electric vehicles a cornerstone of the future of the electric system, as they now have become far more than mobility solutions. Technologies like Vehicle to Grid have the potential to transform energy systems and were pleased to join forces with Nissan and move this vision forward. With increased pressure on the grid and an overreliance on fossil fuels, Vehicle-to-Grid implementation gives EV owners the ability to store and release green energy back into the grid. This is an extraordinary time for electric mobility.

This comes at a time when India is being projected by developed nations, especially the US, as a hurdle to the agreement.""The conversation focused on the ongoing Conference of Parties (CoP21) in Paris. Both leaders underscored their strong commitment to address issues related to climate change being discussed in the Paris conference through constructive engagement, without impeding the progress of developing countries,"" said a statement issued by the PMO.A new short draft, highlighting differences and points of agreement among all the countries, was unveiled at CoP 21 in Paris. The 29-page draft will now become the basis for further negotiations. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius unveiled the new draft but sticking points remain on differences among the rich and poor nations, financing developing nations to take climate resilient measures and the level of agreement. The new draft has introduced a slightly weak option to limit temperature below 1.5 degree Celsius and below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels from the previous well below 2 degree Celsius.Big bracketed text, showing disagreement among countries, revolves around carbon space. It reads: ""Noting that the largest share of historical global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.""Countries will now go through the points of the text and meet again a few hours later to deliberate on it.

The inclusion of both developed and developing countries, including those that rely on revenue from oil and gas production, demonstrates a unity never seen before on this issue.The deal requires any country that ratifies it to act to stem its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming century, with the goal of peaking greenhouse gas emissions ""as soon as possible"" and continuing the reductions as the century progresses. Countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2C (3.6F) by 2100 with an ideal target of keeping temperature rise below 1.5C (2.7F).The deal will also encourage trillions of dollars of capital to be spent adapting to the effects of climate change-including infrastructure like sea walls and programs to deal with poor soil-and developing renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. The text of the agreement includes a provision requiring developed countries to send $100 billion annually to their developing counterparts beginning in 2020. That figure will be a ""floor"" that is expected to increase with time.The agreement gives countries considerable leeway in determining how to cut their emissions but mandates that they report transparently on those efforts. Every five years nations will be required to assess their progress towards meeting their climate commitments and submit new plans to strengthen them.Is the agreement binding?The legal nature of the deal-whether it will be binding-had been a hotly debated topic in the lead up to the negotiations.

Valentino Keimbar, a 29-year-old resident of Majuro Atoll, shared his views regarding the beautiful place. He said that he loves to stay in the tiny string of atolls, but the increasing hotter weather and rising seas in Marshall Islands is making their lives not less than hell. Such harsh conditions are foringe everyone living in atolls to leave the place and go to unlikely place 6,000 miles away, Springdale, Arkansas.From past 30 years, thousands of Marshallese has been moved to the Ozark Mountains for the sake of better climate, education, jobs and health care. In 1986, a Compact of Free Association was signed by the U.S. government and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which allows Marshall Islands citizens to travel and stay in the United States. The main reason for the Marshallese to leave their native place and shift to Springdale or the United States is the increasing threat of global warming. In 2014, Kiembar travelled to Springdale to get medical treatment for his 6-year-old son. He said that now he is planning to permanently move to Springdale to secure a solid future for his children.Local residents of the Marshall Islands reported that with the passage of time storm surges are getting worse. They turn to take the form of king tides when the alignment of Earth, the moon and sun combine to produce the most extreme tidal effects. They added that such storm surges cause huge destruction to their life and property resulting in floods that contaminate fresh water, kill crops and erode land. Tony de Brum, Marshall Islands Foreign Minister, is expected to raise the concern at the United Nations scheduled to start on Monday November 30 in Paris. The meeting is about to held to find out ways to curb increasing global warming and to limit fossil fuel emissions.""We think that the more reasonable thing to do is to seek to end this climate madness where people think that smaller, vulnerable countries are expendable and therefore they can continue to do business as usual"". According to sources, about 6,000 Marshallese have been migrated to Springdale with some jokingly call the place as 'Springdale Atoll'.

The river systems that flow from the Tibetan plateau go to countries like India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam Tibetan religious head and 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje told IANS in an interview: ""Given that the rate of warming in the Tibetan plateau is at least two times greater than the global average, we know flooding and droughts are bound to worsen."" The 29-year-old Buddhist monk, the third most important Tibetan religious head who spent initial years of life in eastern Tibet, is upbeat about the United Nations . ""We are all looking forward to the Paris conference on climate change, which will begin at the end of this month to see if the world leaders will be willing to limit rising greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said. Climate researchers of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) say the Tibetan plateau is highly vulnerable to climate change. They have warned that over two-thirds of the glaciers could disappear by 2050. The plateau has seen an increase in temperature of approximately 0.3 degrees Celsius every 10 years, says a researcher. In the past 50 years, the temperature has increased by 1.3 degrees Celsius, three times the global average, he said. The Karmapa, who now resides in a monastery on the outskirts of this town, was born into a Tibetan nomad family. He loves to paint and pursues calligraphy and poetry. The Tibetan plateau in southwestern China with 46,000 glaciers makes it home to the third largest concentration of ice after the south and north poles. Known as the water tower of Asia, it directly sustains over 150 million people and affects the lives of several billion downstream dwellers. The Karmapa believes the effects of climate change on the Tibetan plateau will not occur in isolation. ""When we think about climate change impacts in mainland Asia, we should think deeply on the role of water in the region,"" the Buddhist monk said. Praying that a global agreement emerges when senior officials from almost 200 nations meet from November 30 to December 11 in Paris for climate talks, he said: ""If there is one thing we now know about climate change it's that its impacts do not discriminate on the basis of a nation's wealth or power.""

"COP21","India","COP21_India402","Paris foretold and forewarned: what to expect from COP21","November 30, 2015 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 30 -- What will happen at the Paris climate change conference of parties (CoP)? This December, as leaders gather at the 21st annual congregation to resolve the global crisis, the world has changed somewhat. There is a growing acceptance verging on unanimity that climate is changing, but it is the poor who are taking the worst hit. Parties this time want to do something about it, which is different from the past. But there is still no conviction on why they should act, which is the same as the past.There are other dynamics. The meeting is in Paris. The French government is seasoned and diplomatically sophisticated. It knows it cannot make the same blunders as the Danish government made in Copenhagen in 2009, when trust between countries had been shattered because of underhand deals and drafts. It is also US President Barack Obama's last climate conference. He will want a legacy of his own by getting the world to stitch an agreement, which the Americans are already calling historic.So, what is likely to happen? Let me use my 20-CoP past to map out the likely scenario and explain what it means for us in the emerging South that is already affected by unseasonal weather but needs its right to development.First, there will be a Paris deal. This is a given. But to make it happen the French will make some clever moves, given that the current draft has been negotiated for over four years, is more than 50 pages long and full of disagreements. They have already changed the order of things by inviting heads of state on the first day and not the last. Everyone from Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming. The French will produce (and I hope with more finesse than the Danish government) a zero draft with the bare bones of the agreement at the start of the two-week meeting. The heads of state will have little room but to endorse this broad agreement. Then for the next two weeks negotiators will idle away time till the gavel comes down on the midnight of the last day.Second, this zero draft for the Paris treaty will be minimalist and, therefore, seemingly non-controversial. It will endorse the submission of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which are voluntary commitments made by countries to cut carbon emissions. It will admit that the sum of these commitments does not add up to keeping the world below 2degC rise, which is seen to be the least risky option. But it will say that the agreement provides a stable and predictable foundation to ratchet up the commitments in the future.Third, it will not make the commitment or the expected result legally binding. Instead it will make the procedure of submitting reports binding. It will also sidestep the tricky issue of review of INDCs, which countries like India have strangely objected to. It will simply say that in five years there will be a stocktake of the aggregate of all INDCs. So no individual country's progress will be reviewed, only the sum of their actions and how close it is to keeping the temperature rise below 2degC. On the really tricky issue of additional finance it will not mention specifics, just make a broad promise. And to keep the Americans happy it will try and do the finance bit on another piece of paper. In this way, the Paris climate change treaty will be ready for signature even before the leaders leave. It will be weak but aspirational. The spin will be that it lays the ground for future action.What it means is a little more than this. The world would have agreed to a framework, pushed by the US, which is voluntary, bottom up-countries decide what they will do rather than get targets based on their contribution to the problem-and most importantly universal. It breaks once and for all the distinction between developing and developed countries. As agreed in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, developed countries had to take the first and drastic action because of their historical responsibility.It also means the US will appropriate an even greater share of the carbon budget, simply because its intended action is unambitious. The world is left with a limited space to emit greenhouse gases, if it wants to stay within a not-too-dangerous threshold. The still developing world-India and all of Africa-needs to increase emissions for its development. But by 2030, the time frame of the intended Paris treaty, almost all the carbon budget would be gone. Our future right to development will be surrendered. We will be told to find a different way to grow economically. Ours has to be a low-carbon growth and if it is expensive, it is our problem. There will be no money or technology to aid us to get there.Now the question is how the Indian government will ensure that the Paris treaty happens, but not at our cost. The treaty must be ambitious but also equitable. That is in our common interest.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

But our cities are under strainand the strain will only increase,"" said Rachel Kyte, World Bank Vice President for Climate Change. ""In just 30 years from now, the number of people living in cities will increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion, adding 2 billion more urban residents. With those bulging cities comes increased demand for services and finance.""Kyte added, ""It means we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build livable, resilient, low-carbon cities. We must seize the opportunity. Too many cities today are facing a critical shortage in tapping into the finance they need.""The report says most cities do not yet generate sufficient fiscal resources or have difficulty in accessing financial markets, blocking critical investments necessary to put them on a sustainable, resilient lower carbon path. In fact, World Bank research shows that only 20 percent of the world's largest cities have the basic analytics necessary for low carbon planning, and only 4 percent of the 500 largest cities are creditworthy in international markets.The report notes that about US$4.1 to $4.3 trillion will be needed to be spent on urban infrastructure every year just to keep up with projected growth in a ""business-as-usual"" scenario, and an estimated incremental 9-27 percent (US$0.4-$1.1 trillion) more capital investment that will be necessary to make this urban infrastructure low-emission and climate-resilient.According to Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, Senior Director for the World Bank's Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice, ""Many countries are looking at their cities as engines for advancing national growth. The World Bank is working hard to support this growth and to find ways to bridge the gap in urban climate finance. Last year the World Bank provided over US$3 billion in urban climate finance and technical assistance to help our clients build climate smart cities.""The report highlights city creditworthiness is a major challenge. In response to this need, the World Bank Group has been running ""credit worthiness academies"" - training over 500 city officials from more than 180 cities to improve their financial management practices to boost their chances of access to private capital.The World Bank is also helping governments think through the fiscal transfer policy reforms needed to support additional climate-smart investments.""We think it's possible to do more,"" said Ijjasz-Vasquez.

The world has assembled in Paris to change the course of our planet to a sustainable path.We must speak about goals and targets on carbon emissions and rise in global temperature. But, it is just as important to focus on the instruments that will make it natural and easy for the world to get there.And, they are also the most vulnerable to the consequences of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.Access to energy and a better life is a universal aspiration. And, so are clean environment and healthy habitats.As the world's majority works its way to prosperity on a planet left with very limited carbon space, we have to do many things.We have to ensure, in the spirit of climate justice, that the life of a few does not crowd out the opportunities for the many still on the initial steps of the development ladder.The advanced countries must leave enough room for developing countries to grow. And, we must strive for a lighter carbon footprint on our growth path.For that we must come together in a partnership to bring clean energy within the reach of all.Innovation is vital for combating climate change and ensuring climate justice.That is what makes this Innovation Summit very special. This unites us behind a common purpose.We need research and innovation to make renewable energy much cheaper; more reliable; and, easier to connect to transmission grids.We can make conventional energy cleaner. And, we can develop newer sources of renewable energy.This is a global responsibility to our collective future.Our innovation initiative should be driven by public purpose, not just market incentives, including on intellectual property.That will make clean energy technology available, accessible and affordable for all.This partnership will combine the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector. We will double our investments in research and innovation; and, deepen collaboration among ourselves.We should have an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on renewable energy.Innovation must be backed by means to make it affordable and ensure adoption.We have a very successful models of public-private partnership with many countries present here. India is also building renewable capacity in developing countries, including small island states. The progress on clean energy technology and costs is impressive. If we raise the level of our efforts, we can transform the world.We will also lay the foundation of a new economy in new low carbon age.We will restore the balance between ecology and economy, and between our inheritance and obligation to the future.

In December last year, officials representing more than 190 countries met in Paris to participate in the United Nations Climate Change Conference. The historic outcome from that conference was the ""Paris Agreement"" in which each country agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above temperatures seen near the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 1850s. Such a level was considered acceptable, or ""safe,"" by all participating countries, but the goal is unrealistic and almost impossible to achieve, according to a new study by researchers at the Texas A&M University at Galveston. Researchers modelled the projected growth in global population and per capita energy consumption, as well as the size of known reserves of oil, coal and natural gas, and greenhouse gas emissions to determine how difficult it will be to achieve the less-than-2 degree Celsius warming goal. ""It would require rates of change in our energy infrastructure and energy mix that have never happened in world history and that are extremely unlikely to be achieved,"" said Glenn Jones, professor of marine sciences. ""The equivalent of about 13,000 were installed in 2015. That's a 37-fold increase in the annual installation rate in only 13 years to achieve just the wind power goal,"" said Jones. Similar expansion rates are needed for other renewable energy sources. ""There will be about 11 billion people on Earth by 2100 (compared to 7.2 billion today),"" Jones said. ""Currently 1.2 billion people in the world do not have access to electricity, and there are plans to try to get them on the grid,"" he said. ""To even come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, 50 per cent of our energy will need to come from renewable sources by 2028, and today it is only 9 per cent, including hydropower. For a world that wants to fight climate change, the numbers just don't add up to do it,"" Jones said. ""If we don't worry about global warming and the 2-degree Celsius goal, we can continue to burn known fossil fuel reserves, but even here we will have to achieve more than 50 per cent renewable energy by 2054, but warming will exceed 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius,"" he said.

"COP21","India","COP21_India417","France : Efforts to reduce short-lived climate pollutants strengthened at COP21","December 12, 2015 Saturday","TendersInfo","Members of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) committed today to accelerate ambitious action to reduce short-lived climate pollutants within the next five years. The CCAC Paris Communique, endorsed today by 49 Ministers, 16 intergovernmental organizations and 44 NGOs, resolves to ""prioritise, develop and implement measures that lead to the delivery of SLCP reductions at scale in the near- to medium-term, aiming to achieve significant climate, health and numerous other benefits.""The importance of the work was matched financially with countries committing a total of $12 million to the Coalition's trust fund and 100's of millions of dollars to reduce SLCPs worldwide.Recent air quality episodes and climate disasters remind us that the fight is far from over and that we must reinforce our commitment to face both climate change and air pollution through synergistic policies that are essential for our health and our climate future.In a message delivered to delegates United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon said, ""The Climate and Clean Air Coalition is an impressive example of a partnership that can deliver results. We must act urgently to limit carbon dioxide emissions to keep global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. In addition we need immediate action to control short-lived climate pollutants, not only to mitigate warming, but to reduce air pollution and improve public health.""The CCAC also launched its Five Year Strategic Plan at the assembly. Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said SLCPs reduction had immediate benefits for the climate and livelihoods.Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change said in a statement that Short-lived climate pollutants are responsible for a substantial portion of the current rate of global warming.""Sustained reductions can help slow the rate of near-term warming, globally and in sensitive regions, such as the Arctic. As a Northern country with a vast Arctic territory this is extremely important to Canada,"" Ms McKenna said. ""As a result, Canada is pleased to commit $35 million dollars over five years to address short lived climate pollutants, with $10 million to be dedicated to the CCAC Trust Fund.""Morocco's Environment Minister, Hakima El Haite said the CCAC could make real impact for public health. ""Thanks to all of the achievements we will carry out in this sector we will be able to save millions of lives,"" she said.Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said the Coalition's emphasis on fast action was refreshing.""There is a double benefit to actions, they are good for climate change in the longer term and in the immediate short term, very good for reducing air pollution. The payback of this coalition's actions is measured in reduced air pollution, improved food security, improved energy access and better health,"" Dr Chan said. ""A healthy planet is good for the health of the people of our world.""Marcelo Mena, Chile's Vice Minister for Environment and CCAC Co-Chair said, ""We need to integrate climate policy and air pollution policy, or else we're causing massive distortions in our environmental priorities. In Chile we equally match our climate and air pollution policies. We are looking to save lives. And reducing black carbon and methane saves lives. Today. No calculation needed.""Many countries also committed to continue important work on curbing the use of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) building on an announcement last November in Dubai that would see an amendment negotiated for the phase down of these highly warming gases under the Montreal Protocol. This could achieve the equivalent to the avoided emissions of one hundred billion tons of CO2 by 2050.Gina McCarthy, Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, said there would need to be active engagement at every level. ""We have an opportunity to leverage the full strength and political leadership of the CCAC to help deliver a global HFC phasedown,"" Ms McCarthy said. ""I know we can collaborate together and with other countries to get the job done.""Drew Shindell, Professor of Climate Sciences at Duke University and Chair of the CCAC Scientific Advisory Panel, said reducing SLCPs leads to a profound slowing of the rate of near term warming. ""But we cannot get down to 1.5C without targeting both SLCPs and CO2. We can't even keep below two degrees without targeting both,"" Professor Shindell said.Moldova was welcomed as the newest member of the Coalition bringing the total number of partners to 110: 50 countries and 60 non-state organisations.\l"
"COP21","India","COP21_India418","Experts stress on energy-efficient measures","June 8, 2015 Monday","Down To Earth","India, June 8 -- Improving energy efficiency not only reduces emissions, but also increases energy savings by contributing to economic growth and social developmentDuring the second Technical Expert Meeting (TEM) on energy efficiency organised in Bonn on June 5-6 as part of the climate change conference, experts presented their ideas on energy efficiency for urban environment, especially lighting system and sustainable urban transport.TEM's objective is to assist participants with climate change by advancing the implementation of improved policy options and technologies.Various studies have shown the advantages of using smart measures for saving and reducing energy demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its report ""Redrawing the Energy-Climate Map"" published in 2013, states that ""adopting energy-efficiency measures would reduce global energy-related emissions by 1.5 gigatonne of carbon dioxide (C02) equivalent in 2020"".The fact is that more than 50 per cent of the world's population lives in urban areas and these places account for 75 per cent of energy use and 80 per cent of the world's CO2 emissions. Reducing urban emissions and efficient energy use should be high priorities for every country, participants at TEM agreed.Steps towards energy efficiencyThere is enormous potential in achieving greater energy efficiency. A transformation towards light-emitting diode (LED) can supply power to 1.5 billion households. However, participants at TEM believe that there is still a long way to go for bringing about this transformation.Klaus Gihr, who represented the German Development Bank, questioned the need for energy subsidy. ""In countries with high-energy subsidies, there is no level playing field for investors. We need to wean off energy subsidies to give a boost to energy efficiency.""The transition towards LED is not without challenges. Proper planning is the first step since implementation of this measure will take time and need political, institutional and financial support. Maryke van Staden from ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability spoke about the support available to local governments in case of Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG). It offers a robust and clear framework that builds on existing methodologies for calculating and reporting city-wide GHG emissions.Improving energy efficiency has numerous benefits. Not only does it reduce or avoid GHG emissions, but it also increases energy savings. These measures contribute to economic growth and social development by increasing economic output, employment and energy security, participants agreed.Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum from the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the public health risk associated with the use of biomass for cooking and kerosene oil for lighting. ""Many of the same actions that societies need to take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will also help to address some of our largest public health risks, particularly non-communicable diseases,"" he said.The meeting concluded on the note that energy efficiency should also be brought about to mitigate the negative effects of emissions.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

One important component of this agreement, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to combat climate change, is already known.Intense negotiations are underway, however, on such issues as equity, common but differentiated responsibilities, provision of finance by developed countries, rules to ratchet up emissions beyond INDCs and monitoring of progress in implementation. Under its INDCs, India will cut emissions per unit of GDP by 33% to 35% by 2030 over those in 2005.Additionally, it will raise its installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources to 40% and create new carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through expansion of forest cover by 2030. For comparison, the US today derives only 20% of its energy from non-fossil fuels.Today, India is the fastest-growing economy among all emerging economies with its GDP growth at 7.4% in 2014-15, the latest financial year completed. It is also the fourthlargest emitter of carbon, accounting for 5.7% of global carbon emissions in 2013.Notwithstanding its extremely low contributions to historical carbon emissions and need for low-cost sources of energy to bring electricity to all households, India has embarked upon a huge renewable programme to make its INDCs credible.Approximately 250 million Indians still live below the World Bank poverty l"

The paper, Africa s Climate Opportunity: Adapting and Thriving, explains how the COP21 climate talks in Paris in December can help Africa deal with the threat and seize the opportunity.Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time in development. COP21 presents a unique opportunity to meet that challenge,said Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group.COP21. And the voice of Africa will be heard.In Paris, the international community is expected to finalise a new global climate agreement and decide how to finance it, at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21).But the new AfDB paper argues that Africa can do much more than adapt. Adapting to climate change while minimising emissions can help drive the economic transformation that Africa needs.Climate-resilient, low-carbon development can boost growth, create jobs and lift people out of poverty. It can also bridge Africa s crippling energy deficit: 620 million Africans lack access to modern energy.COP21 must deliver the finance that will unlock Africa s potential.The current climate financing architecture is not providing the finance Africa needs,Adesina said.Much more needs to be done to increase Africa s access to climate finance.Developed countries have committed to mobilising US $100 billion a year from 2020 in climate finance for developing countries.To meet the $100 billion per annum target by 2020, we must improve the predictability and mobilisation of finance,Adesina said.In the paper, the African Development Bank spells out how it is investing its own resources and mobilising new sources of finance. The paper also shows why wider international cooperation is crucialand needs to be ambitious, efficient and properly financed.As well as increasing its own climate financing, the AfDB is pursuing public and private co-financing opportunities.\l"

They also included factors like climate change, ecology and some others that could affect water's presence.""We find that 4 billion people live in areas that experience severe water scarcity at least part of the year, which is more than previously thought, based on those earlier studies done on an annual basis"", said Hoekstra. The only way to find accurate figure for water scarcity, it was important to look month by month, Hoekstra added.The study published in Science Advances is not the first that represented worldwide figures of water crisis, but it was the most accurate one. Some previous studies had suggested that around 1.7 to 3.1 billion people around the world are experiencing severe water scarcity. The new research has also included more than 120 million American people, including areas like California and other western states.The demand of water is increasing as population is expanding, but the study suggested that the world has enough water to fulfill the demands.

"COP21","India","COP21_India426","'Indigenous communities are key stakeholders in the climate change talks'","November 18, 2015 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 18 -- You were brought up as a traditional Turkana herdsboy. In some of your interviews, you have said that the droughts you saw in your childhood while herding cattle eventually led to your becoming an eco-warrior. Can you describe these experiences?Being born and brought in the arid parts of northern Kenya, I experienced, first-hand, the harsh realities of climate change while herding my grandfather's cattle and goats. Growing up, I saw green pastures and the fact that our goats were well-fed and produced a lot of milk. Droughts were very rare and I remember very well that we had enough milk to last us for different seasons and sometimes even sell some for money. Later, droughts came, sweeping away our livestock and destroying our only source of livelihood. Those droughts and rising temperatures have persisted and are getting worse today. The rains have disappeared and months that have traditionally been cool and wet, are now hot and dry and vice-versa. After joining the University of Nairobi in 2011 for my law degree, I learnt through one of my professors who taught us environmental law that there is something called climate change which contributes to the things I witnessed in my community. I began to understand what I had experienced. At the same time, oil and gas were discovered in my home county. I knew what would happen to my people and that their environment would be worse if the oil companies were not challenged to respect our environment and community land. That is how I became an eco-warrior.Is a pastoral lifestyle a viable occupation in today's day and age?Yes. Pastoralism is a very viable source of livelihood especially in areas like ours in Turkana, northern Kenya where the environment doesn't support other sources of livelihood such as agriculture. As a young person who has seen the benefits that pastoralism has given to my community, despite the challenges of climate change, I can't imagine a Turkana where there are no animals and there is no pastoralism.You have noted that climate change in your part of Kenya (the Turkana County) has led to inter-tribal warfare over scare resources. Can you explain in detail about this conflict?When droughts and famines become unbearable, the Turkana people and their other pastoral neighbours, as a practice, move to places that have green pastures and water for their animals. During yesteryears when there were lots of green pastures and water for the Turkana and other communities because of frequent rains, they could even graze their livestock together without any conflict. And it should be noted that the Turkana are a community that has other pastoralists surrounding them. So, when droughts come and green pastures and water disappear, the communities compete for the few remaining ones because they need to feed their animals as well as water them. As a result, they clash and conflicts arise about which community owns which grazing areas. And in most cases, most of the green pasturelands that survive the harsh droughts are in the border areas and this has played a major role in causing conflict among our people.Your movement against the oil industry that has come to Turkana since the discovery of petroleum has been well-documented. You yourself worked for an oil company for some time. Why did you then start opposing them?Do you attribute any blame to the Kenyan government for the difficulties being faced by the Turkana due to climate change?Yes. The governments of the Republic of Kenya, since independence, have failed by not helping the people of Northern Kenya to adapt to the changes in the climate which has adversely affected pastoralism, their only source of livelihood. Instead of implementing projects that will help the community get enough food for themselves and for their animals, the government instead distributes corn maize and other hand-outs to our people in its programme called, ""Relief Food Programme."" This, to me, is not sustainable and encourages donor-dependency.What activities does the Lorengelup Community Development Initiative pursue so as to mitigate the impact of climate change in Turkana county, one of Africa's driest, hottest and poorest regions? We carry out tree planting in schools and in our community. We advocate against charcoal burning that has become rampant in my place as people try to get money for a living. We organise youth summits and community meetings to enlighten people about climate change and environmental conservation because we know our local community members do not understand this subject. We endeavour to localise the climate change debate so that local communities can understand that they too have a big role to play in this process. We advocate against environmental degradation and clearance of community forests by oil companies in the oil and gas exploration in Turkana. We do this through writing community protest letters and organising community protests against oil companies in order to let our voice be heard. We build schools and advocate for education so that parents can take their children to school and this helps reduce the donor-dependency syndrome that has been as a result of the droughts caused by climate change. When a kid in a family is educated and gets a job, that family becomes self-reliant in the future, and may survive the harsh famines through alternative food sources.You will be participating in COP 21 in Paris instead of attending your law degree convocation at the University of Nairobi. What do indigenous, tribal communities like yours expect from the leaders who would deliberate in Paris? Yes, I do expect the world leaders gathering in Paris to come up with a legal framework through which we can combat climate change in a more robust manner. The leaders should go beyond expressing concerns about climate change and do something about it, building from the previous tools such as United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The new tool should encourage ""inclusivity"" because as of now, local communities are fighting on their own in their small ways while the big countries are also fighting on their own. I will be taking one main message to Paris and it is that there are young people and indigenous communities in many parts of the world who are doing incredible work in combating climate change and educating their people on this critical concept. These young people and communities are key stakeholders in this process and if supported, we would be able to better fight climate change together. Right now, the feeling among local communities and activists is that the fight against climate change is a reserve of the big countries and the West generally. This notion must change and COP21 is my hope.What activities are you planning post-COP 21?I know the experience in Paris will open my eyes even more and help me learn from experiences of other young people whom I will meet in Paris. I intend to replicate these positive lessons and experiences at home after Cop21. I will disseminate the deliberations during to my local community when I come back so that they too, like the rest of the world, may know what was arrived at in Paris. My group will do this through regular youth summits and community meetings in my community throughout 2016 and beyond 2016. We have planned to plant more trees, recruit more members to join our group in this advocacy and increase our areas of advocacy work to cover more people and more communities. We plan to form environmental clubs in all primary schools in my community so as to pass the message of climate change to our next generation in liaison with education stakeholders in my place. In partnership with Radio Jambo Turkana, we plan to have a Radio Programme through which ""Ambassadors of Environment"" come together to discuss issues of environment and climate change.

These are as follows:Double Governmental Investment in Clean Energy Innovation: each participating country would try to double their investment in clean energy research and development (R&D) in the next five yearsPrivate Sector and Business Leadership: the countries are committed to working closely with the private sector and their investment in R&D for clean energy technologies. They praised the contribution made by the Breakthrough Energy Coalition.Breakthrough Energy Coalition is a network of private capital formed by 28 industry leaders from 10 countries, including India, that aims to provide large funding commitments to basic and applied research in clean energy technologies.Implementation: the countries will cooperate and collaborate to help all stakeholders in promotion, commercialisation and dissemination of clean energy technologies. They will create and enhance technology innovation roadmaps.Information Sharing: countries should volunteer on annual basis information on its clean energy research and development efforts in a transparent and collaborative manner.They also released a guide map to track various R&D efforts in the participating countries.""Solving the clean energy problem is an essential part of building a better world, we won't be able to make meaningful progress on other challenges-like educating or connecting the world-without secure energy and a stable climate,"" said Mark Zuckerberg in a statement published on Facebook.At the launch, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""We have to ensure, in the spirit of climate justice, that the life of a few does not crowd out the opportunities for the many still on the initial steps of the development ladder.For that we must come together in a partnership to bring clean energy within the reach of all.Innovation is vital for combating climate change and ensuring climate justice.""Amidst the announcement of International Solar Alliance and Mission Innovation, clean and renewable energy has been brought to the forefront at COP21.The question, however, remains whether these alliances would be able to actualise the promises they are making or whether they will be another set of alliances that do not yield any result.

However, only 19% of respondents from China were concerned about climate change, the survey said.In Africa, ""A median of 59% say they are very concerned, including about half or more in all countries surveyed.The other big global threat that has as many as 14 out of the 40 nations worried is the rise of the IS. Most of these nations are in Europe and the Middle East, from where many citizens have travelled over to Syria and Iraq to join IS militants. Lebanon sees the consolidation of IS as its biggest threat. In Europe, the IS is viewed as a major threat in countries like Spain (77%), France (71%), Germany (70%) and Italy (69%).Besides European and Middle Eastern countries, the perception of the ISIS as the gravest global danger extends to the United States (68%) and Canada (58%).The report said that 41% of those surveyed from India were very concerned about the IS.Climate change and ISIS aside, global economic instability, given the recent situation in first Greece and later China, is cited as a top concern in five countries, mostly in Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine. Nearly half the respondents in India (49%) rated global economic instability as their biggest worry.The historic nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which was struck this week wasn't seen as much of a threat except, expectedly, in Israel, where more than half of those surveyed (53%) spoke of their worry. Iran's nuclear deal came in for some strong condemnation from Israel, whose prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it as a ""historic mistake for the world.""India, with much to gain from the Iran deal, has only 28% respondents perceiving Tuesday's developments as a threat.The Pew Research Center survey was conducted in 40 countries among 45,435 respondents between 25 March and 27 May, 2015.Published by HT Syndication with permission from MINT.

"COP21","India","COP21_India434","Green Climate Fund races to get its show on the road before COP 21","June 10, 2015 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, June 10 -- Fund members attempt to address concerns raised over its operationalisationGreen Climate Fund (GCF) has been one of the most talked about topics in this year's climate change conference at Bonn. Apart from multiple side events, the GCF secretariat organised sessions to provide clarifications over many questions raised regarding the fund itself and its operationalisation.GCF was created with the objective of making a substantial contribution to global efforts to combat climate change and of achieving the goal set out by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The fund was formally established during COP 16 in Cancun in 2010. The fund has set a goal of raising US $100 billion per year by 2020.As of now, pledges of only $ 10.2 billion have been made to the GCF for the period from 2015 to 2018 and only 60 per cent of pledged resources had been contracted until May 2015.What separates GCF from other environmental funding institutions is that it has the mandate to invest in projects or countries that focus on transformation. Brandon Wu from ActionAid, who is the developed country active observer on GCF, said, ""GCF is looking beyond the business-as-usual investments, and wants to promote a transformative paradigm shift in climate action and GREEAT (Global Renewable Energy and Energy Access Transformation) perfectly suits its criteria.""GCF is the only fund which includes gender co-benefits as its investment core criterion. One of the participants from Malawi said, ""Taking gender seriously is truly transformational for a fund since women can act as £gents of change' to facilitate the transformation.""The fund also emphasises that all projects and supported plans would be country-driven. This essentially translates to funding proposals in the context of national strategies and plans. ""The fund intends to support country-owned or country-guided proposals that would reflect nations' needs and priorities. This feeds into the support for capacity building,"" said Henrik Harboe (Norway), one of the co-chairs of the GCF board.The board is in a hurry to get the fund operationalised. Before Paris, the fund needs to approve a project or proposal to showcase that the fund is ready for business. However, the South African member of the board, Zaheer Fakir, explained, ""We should focus on not repeating the mistakes of Climate Investment Fund. In a haste to fund a project, we should not compromise on quality.""Before the projects get funding, GCF should help the national designated authority with their readiness and capacity building. There needs to be clarity on long-term predictability of the fund. Funding is available for three years and would not be able to support infrastructural investments that developing countries are looking to finance with this fund.""All the countries need to realise that investing in GCF is investing in future of the world,"" explained Swedish Climate Ambassador Anna Lindstedt. Sweden has committed the largest amount to GCF-about $ 580 million.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

It precedes the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) Summit in New York and the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris. By emphasizing the multiple benefits of both the post-2015 development and the climate agendas and showcasing best practices and actions on the ground, the VEF 2015 aims to contribute to both the SDGs Summit and COP21.Energy systems can be overhauled to support a sustainable future; they need to be affordable, reliable and environmentally sound. To make economic growth and development more inclusive and sustainable, we must rapidly reform our industrial processes towards sustainability. We must promote energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy more effectively, and reduce our carbon foot-prints. We need to also work on the constructive inclusion of women and youththrough their economic empowerment and entrepreneurship development in order to firstly address inequalities and secondly to unlock the full potential of the countries and society to innovate and motivate for solutions. We must use our scarce resources more efficiently and effectively. And lastly, we must also advance our cleaner production abilities.Referring to energy as thecentral nervous system of the world economy , Michael Linhart, Secretary General of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs (BMEIA), added:The programme of this year s Vienna Energy Forum reflects the manifold ways in which energy comes into play: as a nexus with other sustainable development goals, as a driver for urban development and as part of mutual linkages with gender equality and the empowerment of women. Developing successful business models and smart policies will be key in making sure that sustainable energy can make a major impact on inclusive development. Austria has a long tradition of know-how and expertise in renewable energy and energy efficiency which it is willing to share.Nebojsa Nakicenovic, Deputy Director General of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), speaking at the opening session on behalf of Director General Pavel Kabat said: This year s Forum comes at a key moment in the lead-up to agreements later this year on climate and sustainable development. It is impossible to ignore the fact that energy is at the heart of sustainable development, and inextricably linked to climate change.

As per Californian seismologists, their state is ripe for a mega earthquake.A study conducted by the US Geological Survey calculated there is a 7% change of a magnitude 8 earthquake in California within the next 30 years. Another 2008 study showed that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas Fault could kill about 1,800 people and cause $213 billion in damage.In an interview with Sky News, Thomas Heaton, Director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at Caltech, said, ""We're trying to make it so that it is a functioning system but at this point the budget to actually turn it into a system that we would unleash on all Californians has not been approved so it is up to the politicians"".The KLFY notes that, if governments are serious about the global warming targets they adopted in Paris, scientists say they have two options: eliminating fossil fuels immediately or finding ways to undo their damage to the climate system in the future.The first is politically impossible - the world is still hooked on using oil, coal and natural gas - which leaves the option of a major cleanup of the atmosphere later this century.In other news OceanSidePost reported, The Paris agreement provides, ""Parties recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage"". ""The problem is not solved because of this accord"", President Obama said following the deal. We want to avoid the worst impacts of climate change falling on the poor and vulnerable.When U.S. President Barack Obama arrived at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, he began by apologizing to the world for how America has helped cause global warming. He said he had come ""as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter to say the U.S.A. not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.""Two weeks later, a 32-page climate paper in hand, the president called the summit a ""turning point"" for the world-and a defining moment for his administration. ""The American people can be proud,"" President Obama said. ""Because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership. Over the past seven years, we've transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change."", reports TheTrumpet.

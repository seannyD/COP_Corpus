"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria1","COP24: Groups Expose Fossil Fuel Sponsors Of Climate Change Conference","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","At the negotiations at the Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in Poland, Corporate Europe Observatory and Corporate Accountability have released a new infographic that exposes what they describe as 'green fa\'e7ade' by the conference' sponsors.Just days before the conference began in Katowice, the COP Presidency announced that a number of the meeting's corporate sponsors would be from the coal, gas and fossil fuel financing industries. A statement released by Climate Justice groups including Corporate Accountability and Friends of the Earth International warned that the fossil fuel industry's overbearing presence through trade and other groups was undermining the talks and promoting false solutions to the climate crisis.The infographics noted that the slogan for the climate talks - Black to Green effectively captures the fact that Big Polluter sponsors have wrapped themselves in green branding while their core business digs up and burns coal, oil and gas, which is incompatible with the Paris Agreement and a liveable planet.Sriram Madhusoodanan, deputy campaigns director at Corporate Accountability said: 'The fact that the negotiations charged with solving the global climate crisis are being bankrolled by Big Coal is absolutely unacceptable. Big Polluter sponsors like JSW are not only able to use sponsorship to greenwash their images, but also sponsorship will likely buy them access to the talks themselves - a massive conflict of interest. It's like a gun control policy meeting being paid for by the National Rifle Association. Or public health talks bankrolled by Big Tobacco.Such sponsorship raises serious questions about what access and influence sponsorship buys and could risk calling into question the legitimacy of these talks before they even begin. Big Polluters have no place bankrolling or participating in the UN climate talks. Period.It is precisely for this reason that a global movement has issued the People's Demands and specifically called for governments to protect the talks from Big Polluter interference.'Akinbode Oluwafemi of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria said: 'The fact that the corporate sponsors of the talks are from the same polluting industry responsible for the climate crisis, leaves room for doubt on the directions the talks will go. The People's Demands are explicit on the need to exclude Big Polluters from the discussions. No other way will lead to pro-people outcomes.'The infographics list eight companies that are sponsoring the COP24. They are Tauron Polska Energia S.A - Poland's second biggest electricity generator and supplier from coal and gas, JSW - one of the largest tar producers in Europe, Polska Grupa Energetyczna - the largest energy sector company, and PZU - the lead insurer of the Polish coal sector.Others are PKO Bank - one of the largest fossil fuels financier, PGNiG - leading gas corporation. Grupa LOTOS S.A - which is into extraction and processing of crude oil, and PKN Orden - the largest oil conglomerate and petrol retailer in Poland.\l"

Fast growing and quick to mature, bamboo can be used to make an increasing number of heavy-duty materials such as pipes, scaffolding and housing.'Bamboo plants and products can also store more carbon than certain species of tree: new research shows they can sequester up to 630 tonnes of carbon per hectare,' Friederich notes, adding that bamboo renewable energy is being used to reduce deforestation across parts of Asia and Africa.\l"

Speaking on behalf of President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Minister said climate change was a matter of life and death for Africa, hence the need for its leaders to speak with a strong unified voice and be heard whenparticipating in multilateral climate negotiations and other global issues. ""We have all experienced the devastating and unprecedented impacts of climate change on our peoples' lives and livelihoods as well as our national economies. Africa is the most vulnerable continent despite contributing only about 4% to global greenhouse gas emissions but when we go to argue our case we speak in tongues and come back with no deal,"" he said. ""We need to make sure that we have a unified voice as we proceed to COP24. We should showcase our own solutions to climate change solutions that are developed and customized to fit our own situation."" He said given Africa's shared ecosystems and that natural resources know no boundaries, it was essential that we continue to speak in one voice to safeguard the basis of our development and seek transformative solutions'. Mr. Tobiko said the theme of this year's forum, ""Policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa"", reflects Africa's collective engagement and commitment to strengthen climate change actions in the context of its development priorities. Climate change threats, he said, however present opportunities for innovative and green investments for Africa. ""This is why implementation of the Paris Agreement remains a priority for the continent in order to adapt to the inevitability of climate variability and change. It is however important to emphasize that achieving the goals of the Agreement require committed leadership from state and non-state actors,"" the Minister said. Commenting on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Global Warming of 1.50C special report and its impacts in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty', Mr. Tobiko said limiting global warming to 1.50C would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. ""Operationalisation implies that adequate and predictable resources be mobilised and made available to support adaptation and mitigation action in Africa and other developing world,"" he said, adding it was important that discussions and outcome of CCDA-VII contribute to build momentum towards the upcoming COP 24 and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Local communities, women and the youth, he said, should be engaged in Africa's efforts to combat the vagaries of climate change. Mr. Tobiko shared with participants Kenya's priority climate actions and how its devolved governments were helping fight climate change. ""There are numerous practical and innovative solutions at community, sub-national, national and international level that we should never ignore in Africa. Climate change affects all of us but it affects doubly the most vulnerable members of our communities so we should always engage them because they also have the knowledge and solutions,"" he said. The Minister said as part of efforts to tap into opportunities in biodiversity, Kenya will be hosting its first Sustainable Blue Economy Conference between the 26th and 28th November 2018 to promote sustainable investments in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. The meeting has attracted over 700 participants from member States, climate researchers, academia, civil society organizations, private sector, youth, women and local government leaders, among others.\l"

'This is an opportunity to share lessons and good practices in water security management, to share lessons and good practices on enhancing water and sanitation resilience to climate change,' he said in a statement.One of the objectives is also to create an opportunity to contribute to developing strategies on raising adequate and sustainable financing of water and sanitation agendas.The 7th Africa Water Week brings together over 1,000 participants from governments, regional institutions, international partners, the private sector, the scientific community, civil society, and the media, particularly from AfricaGabonese Minister for Water and Energy, Patrick Eyogo Edzang, lauded Prof Mbarawa's statement, saying that accomplishing water security is imperative to safeguarding sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water to maintaining livelihoods, human wellbeing, and socio-economic development.The Africa Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Sacko Eyogo Leonel Correa, urged all African governments to include more water sanitation and hygiene projects in their National Determined Contributions (NDC) to unlock more climate-related financing mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, AfDB Climate related Funds, and a host of other sources of funding.Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) is a term used under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that all countries that signed the UNFCCC were asked to publish in the lead-up to the 2015 United Nations in Paris. Once the agreement is ratified, the INDCs automatically changes to NDCs.'I also want to congratulate AMCOW on the launch of the 2018-2010 strategy and, therefore, I call upon our ministers to take action, and they should not keep this important document on their shelves,' said Correa, calling on development partners to help in implementation of the tool.\l"

And yet the battle against climate change is far from over. The signatory countries have not yet committed to concrete measures. Enumerating them is a goal of COP24, taking place December 3-14 in Katowice, Poland.Despite these steps, it would be a mistake to think that governments alone will be able to stem global warming. The latest report by scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is absolutely clear: to limit our impact on the climate, we must all commit to ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.""For companies, setting out to achieve these goals has become a moral duty requiring swift action. It is also a great opportunity for them to rethink their business models and place in society. In the United States, many in the private sector understand the stakes and are stepping up to lead the climate battle after the US administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The commitment of former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who promotes low-carbon financial innovation in the Wall Street capital markets, is just one example.In recent years, companies around the world have combined profit-making with respect for the environment. Some are supported by local governments, while others are struggling against all odds. But they must go even further. They must become the spearhead of the ecological big bang, accelerating and scaling up concrete solutions to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions.To limit the devastating consequences of climate change and ensure sustainable living conditions for the planet's different species \- including human beings \- we must reduce our CO2 emissions from 2010 levels by 45 percent ahead of 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In other words, every gram of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere will have to be offset by environmentally friendly practices.The mission is not impossible, according to the IPCC scientists. Some of the measures necessary for us to stay below a 1.5\'b0C increase are already underway, but it is vital to scale up and accelerate their implementation. Amplifying the impact of already effective technological solutions is a first step. But companies have yet another challenge \- to create value and jobs without overconsumption. As the World Bank points out, a green technology future that improperly manages natural resources, especially rare metals, could be at odds with Sustainable Development Goals.<figure><figcaption>Christian de Boisredon, Founder of Sparknews</figcaption></figure>That is why Ventures Africa joins Sparknews and 19 other major business newspapers around the world on December 3, during COP24, for the media project Solutions&Co, exploring solutions that reconcile ecology and economy.

The president urged Fijians to conserve and preserve marine areas, such as the 250 traditional tabu sites protected by the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network. His message on the World Oceans Day 2018 was oriented around conservation and preservation and of ambitious climate action. In a related development, Meg Taylor, secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, also urged the Pacific Islanders to make a pledge for healthier oceans. We share one ocean, we benefit from it immensely, from food on our tables to our economies as forum members, and I believe we should feel some sense of responsibility for its well-being. The Ocean is our home and will be key for our childrens and young peoples future, Taylor noted.\l"

Sentiment, speculation and even rumours have been known to drive the market. The situation can be further complicated by computerised or automated trading, with algorithms, Big Data and AI playing important roles.""Energy outlooks are an antidote for this post-factual age. Indeed, our common currency, as it were, is fact-based data. Our industry is currently under siege from multiple fronts. Yet, some of these comments have tended to mischaracterise our objectives and misrepresent market realities.""A classic example of this is the persistent notion that oil is on the verge of demise. According to this belief, renewables are about to completely replace hydrocarbons and those who seek to discuss the nuances of this idea are downplaying the climate challenge.""He said: ""At OPEC, we are acutely conscious of the challenge of climate change. Our member countries continue to take appropriate policies, implement programmes and projects to tackle the challenges of climate change.COP24 in Katowice, OPEC reiterated that it remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement.Indeed, some of our member countries heavily invest in alternative sources of energy. For example, Saudi Arabia plans to generate some 59 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from solar and wind by 2030, and eventually produce upward of 200 GW from renewable sources.""He said: ""However, this is not a race to renewables alone; it's a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, OPEC emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and its great enabler, technological innovation.""Given how our industry can be mischaracterised, the need for dialogue is all the greater. Consider the Ancient Greek roots of the word: 'dia' meaning through and 'logos' meaning reason or speech. And reasoned discussion, based on factual analysis, is crucial in this age of £lternative facts.'""Dialogue fosters transparency, which is another priority for our organisation.

On the morning of Wednesday, 20 March, the week will be formally opened by the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo; Ghanaian actress and television personality, Joselyn Dumas; and COP24 President Micha Kurtyka.This curtain-raising ceremony will introduce a series of discussions throughout the course of the day that will feature prominent leaders, seeking to unlock barriers around enhanced national climate ambition, as well as issues relating to carbon pricing and markets. A new in-depth program, detailing Wednesday's activities and also the sessions for the remainder of the week, has now been published here.To date, the event has attracted upwards of 1,500 registrations  far surpassing previous attendance figures and hinting at the renewed significance of the Climate Weeks in relation to driving regional action to implement the Paris Agreement.The Climate Week will attract Ministers, policymakers, and non-Party stakeholders from businesses, community initiatives, financial institutions, and city municipalities across the African continent.To support these record participation numbers, United Nations Volunteers today put out a call for energetic people to facilitate the delivery of the Climate Week. Full details of the tasks involved, as well as information on how to apply, can be found here.The Accra event will act as a focal point for actors to showcase groundbreaking solutions to climate change. For example, a Pitch Hub and Knowledge Corner \- located in the heart of the Convention Center \- will provide a stage for specialists from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), climate change initiatives, and civil society organizations to share ideas with attendees.Meanwhile, the youth will enjoy a strong presence at the Climate Week \- leading on a number of side events to highlight youth-led initiatives, and will also convene a climate march to coincide with Wednesday's high-level segment.Africa is being severely impacted by climate change. From floods in the Lake Victoria basin to drought in Somalia, to environmental degradation in the Sahel region, climate change is a particular threat to continued economic growth and to livelihoods of vulnerable populations across the continent. However, while Africa is one of the lowest contributors to global emissions, it is leading the way by mitigating and adapting to climate impacts through climate action initiatives \- examples of which will be displayed at the conference center.The upcoming Africa Climate Week in Accra is the first 'Regional Climate Week' to be hosted this year which will be followed by the Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific Climate Weeks. Collectively, these Climate Weeks will serve as critical stepping stones in the lead-up to the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019.Africa Climate Week is being co-convened by UN Climate Change, UN Environment, the West African Development Bank, UN Development Programme, World Bank Group, African Development Bank Group, and International Renewable Energy Agency, in collaboration with Climate Technology Centre & Network, UN Food and Agriculture, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, West African Alliance, Adaptation Fund and Climate and Clean Air Coalition.

But we also aspire to connect governments looking for new solutions to the innovators that are working on them'', Durant said.""With this agreement, UNCTAD and the World Alliance will work together to introduce concrete solutions to Africa in support of Sustainable Development Goal 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.""Piccard said: ""Clean energies and technologies are able to provide social wealth, peace and stability to developing countries. The Solar Impulse Foundation and the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development are going to prove it through a collaboration that will bring profitable and clean solutions, to help with environmentally friendly growth, to the regions who need it the most.""UNCTAD's Least Developed Countries Report 2017 found that more than 40% of businesses operating in these countries are held back by inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable electricity. On average, they suffered ten power outages per month, each lasting around five hours, costing them 7% of the value of their sales.More than 60% of the population in LDCs on average lacks access to electricity. Moreover, LDCs as a group have around just 8% of the capacity of other developing economies to generate electricity for each person, and barely 2% of that of wealthier nations.""There can be little economic activity and few development prospects, with such an absence of electricity,"" Ms. Durant said. ""No entrepreneur, no multinational, no digital infrastructure, no start-up can properly function without it.""Ms. Durant and Mr. Piccard also pledged to hold a joint workshop to link selected innovators with concrete solutions to an audience of African diplomatic representatives at the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland.UNCTAD is the United Nations body that supports developing countries to access the benefits of a globalized economy more fairly and effectively. Based in Geneva, UNCTAD provides analysis, facilitates consensus-building, and offers technical assistance to developing countries so that they can use trade, investment, finance, and technology as vehicles for inclusive and sustainable development.The World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, established by the Solar Impulse Foundation, assesses solutions submitted by its members and, with the help of independent technical and financial experts, selects promising ones to be presented to governments, businesses and institutions to encourage them to adopt more ambitious environmental targets and energy policies.Psychiatrist and aviator Bertrand Piccard was the first person to fly non-stop around the world in a balloon and was the pilot of Solar Impulse, a solar-powered aircraft that circumnavigated the globe in 2016.

Guterres gave the warning at the 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland on Monday. He told parties to the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) that the world could not afford to waste any more time before taking action on climate change. The 197 countries collectively agreed to keep global temperature rises to no more than two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels, and if possible, to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees centigrade. ""Now in Poland, they have to agree on how they will achieve this collectively, we cannot fail in Katowice,"" the UN chief said. He highlighted four key messages for the thousands of representatives of the world's nations, non-profit organisations, UN agencies, and private sector companies gathered in Katowice. According to Guterres, climate change is already a matter of life and death for many people, nations and countries of the world, as the science is telling us we need to move faster. ""Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption. ""Last year, I visited Barbuda and Dominica, which were devastated by hurricanes. The destruction and suffering I saw was heartbreaking,"" he said, noting ""these emergencies are preventable. ""If we fail, the Arctic and Antarctic will continue to melt, corals will bleach and then die, the oceans will rise, more people will die from air pollution, water scarcity will plague a significant proportion of humanity, and the cost of disasters will skyrocket"", he warned.

Worldwide air pollution situation which poses a serious environmental threat globally.'The NESRA boss added: 'NESRA in its duties, has the responsibility to enforce compliance with provisions of international agreements; one of such agreement is the United Nations Frame Work Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which led to the adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement.'Under the agreement, each countries submitted an emission reduction proposal known as the Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC's), at the conference, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari pledged that Nigeria would reduce its greenhouse emissions by 20% conditionally and 45% unconditionally.'He reiterated the commitment in subsequent COPS and even at COP24 in Poland this year. As part of Nationally determined contribution (NDC) strategies, is considering 30% of energy efficiency in industries, homes, businesses vehicles and renewable energy.'The commitment strives to build a climate resilient society across the diverse terrain of Nigeria. It involves measures being considered in setting standards for appliances, generators, buildings and climate smart agriculture.'Anukam further explained that the NGCP, is a strategy aimed at cutting down emission of pollutants from generators (stationary source). He said that the programme is being implemented under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) and will involve periodic testing of generators for toxic emissions.He stated: 'Considering the urgency of the Federal government to see that the implementation of this programme begins, it has become pertinent to give serious consideration to the timeframe and the proposal kick-off date of January 2019 for the full implementation of the programme.'To ensure that the NGECP becomes a reality, NESREA cannot do it alone, therefore, we are calling on all our respective stakeholders and the general public to join hands with NESREA and make it a reality.'\l"

A lot of the unpaid work that women do, such as collecting firewood and water, and caring for the family, are massively affected by climate change \- so we have to make sure adaptation initiatives address their needs, vulnerabilities and potential.""Women as agents of changeStudies show that when women are part of decision making, ratification of multilateral agreements on the environment are more likely, adds Mafalda Duarte, head of the $8.3 billion Climate Investment Fund, one of the largest climate financing instruments in the world.There is also strong evidence that women play a vital role in dealing with disasters by mobilising communities \- something that will become increasingly important as climate change advances, she says.""Discourse is quite tilted to considering women as victims of climate change \- but we are agents of change and if we are perceived as such this will make a big difference,"" says Ms Duarte.""Our empowerment represents greatly under-utilised opportunities to build our economies and tackle climate change.""When women are empowered \- given access to finance, assets and decision making \- there are big impacts across sectors, she adds.""Renewable energy is traditionally seen as a male sector but if you are deliberate in giving access to women, they become entrepreneurs and help us push forward that agenda,"" says Ms Duarte.Women can drive business and technology solutionsWhen women are empowered equally to men there is a massive leap forward in economic gains: a recent McKinsey study found that if women were participating economically as much as men, they would be adding 28 trillion dollars to global GDP by 2025.In Africa, lack of access to finance has resulted in an estimated $42 billion financing gapfor women entrepreneurs across business value chains.Yet unlocking African women's ingenuity and giving them access to finance could generate technological advancements that help deal with climate change, believes the African Development Bank.As mobile phone technology has proven, Africa is capable of leapfrogging into an era of digitisation, which minimises risks and cuts costs of doing business.African women have shown potential to compete in this digital work-space \- Mfarm, AppsTech, JuaKali, Nandimobile, Hehe Ltd, Obami, DotNxt, are only a few of the women-led tech startups in Africa listed by Forbes.""If we women are given the right platforms, we will achieve the change we wish to see in the world,"" says Ms Duarte.Unlocking investment in African women holds incredible return and transformational impactpotential.

But when it comes to the location of your headquarters, very many excuses emerge.''Those who talk about insecurity in the Niger Delta forget that they are secure enough to work on oil fields in different communities.''This level of injustice is not good for any country. I hear that majority of your workers receive their salaries in Lagos and Abuja, with their taxes deducted at those locations.''We want you to return to our states and energise our communities with your presence. I am interested in the revenue that will accrue to this state and other Niger Delta states by the presence of your headquarters.''If this oil was in the North or in the West, would the headquarters of the oil majors be located in the Niger Delta? Certainly, not'', Governor Wike said.On next year's general elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governor urged oil workers to participate in the process to ensure the emergence of quality leaders who will rescue the country. He accordingly commended the staff of Shell for keeping the company afloat despite the undisclosed numerous operational challenges the company was said to have faced.Okunbor had earlier commended Governor Wike for his commitment to creating the right operational environment in the state and also thanked him for working with stakeholders to ensure that one of their major facilities closed for one year was opened through peaceful means.Shell is one of the world's largest polluters and has a long track record of obstructing climate policymaking. In 2013, the giant oil corporation was found guilty of environmental crimes in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's polluted oil region.''We have a message for Shell and companies that pretend the solution to the climate catastrophe doesn't demand the end of fossil fuels.

It announced $200 billion to tackle the menace.In his welcoming remarks, Poland's President Andrzej Duda told delegates that the location where a coal mine was once operated was specifically picked for the conference.He said Katowice had become one of the greenest cities in Poland.Addressing other world leaders at the opening, President Buhari warned that the challenges of climate change, including rising temperatures, desertification, floods, low agricultural yields and drying up of water bodies, were enormous and evident to all.He spoke in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu.Citing the receding Lake Chad, the President noted that the effects of climate change were felt more on vulnerable communities, which lacked the capacity and technology to address such challenges.He said: 'Obviously, no country can confront the phenomenon alone. In this regard, Nigeria believes in joint and cooperative efforts to tackle the problem.''We urge that efforts to address the challenges of climate change be pursued within multilateral frameworks. Concerted efforts should be made to strengthen sub-regional and regional organisations, to serve as hubs for Climate Action and partnership.''Speaking on Lake Chad, the President reaffirmed that Nigeria was committed to saving the Lake, which is a source of livelihood to 40 million people.He said Nigeria would build on the success of an International Conference held in February in Abuja to create additional awareness globally on the serious environmental and security challenges facing the Lake Chad region.The President told the audience, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, that a consensus was reached at the Abuja Conference that an inter-basin water transfer from the Congo Basin remained the most sustainable option available to resuscitate and safeguard this precious water body that was once the sixth largest fresh water Lake in the world.On behalf of the member countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), President Buhari thanked the Italian government for donating 1.5 million Euros towards completion of the feasibility studies on the proposed inter-basin water transfer project.He said: 'I once again call on the international community to support this worthy project, for the benefit of nearly 40 million people that depend on the Lake for their livelihood, and to guarantee future security of the region.''I would like to reiterate Nigeria's commitment to constructively supporting multilateral action aimed at addressing climate change.'We must rededicate ourselves to the task of rebuilding and restoring the healthy environment we inherited for future generations.'Buhari used the occasion to highlight what Nigeria had done and doing on climate change after adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015.He said: 'We in Nigeria have commenced the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.'In the next 15 years, we aim to achieve 20 per cent emissions reduction below Business as Usual (BAU) and 45 per cent emissions reduction with the support of our international partners by 2030. ''Our efforts include the review and introduction of new responsive legislation/policies, strengthening institutional and manpower capacities, and encouraging gradual transition to low carbon economy.''Nigeria has also recently ratified the Doha Amendment and will soon deposit the instrument for ratification.''The President pledged that Nigeria would continue to pursue industrialisation and economic development, with sound environmental management and best practices.According to him, Nigeria has unlocked the potential of its sovereign green bond to galvanise private capital to finance environmentally sustainable projects.''In support of our NDC aspiration, we have embraced the issuance of green bond as an innovative and alternative source of funding projects that would reduce emissions and provide robust climate infrastructure like renewable energy, low carbon transport, water infrastructure and sustainable agriculture that our country needs,'' he said.He restated Nigeria's belief that technology could be a powerful solution for simultaneously addressing climate change and advancing development, stressing the need for developed countries to accelerate the finance for research and development, in addition to promoting access to climate-friendly technologies.He said: ''In addition, there is the need to raise global climate action in the pre-2020 period, in terms of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation.''For us in Nigeria, we are promoting technologies and practices, such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency and clean energy.''We have also developed insurance-based initiatives to deal with loss and damage, as well as adaptation to internally acceptable practices.''\l"

Prevention must be at the centre of all we do,"" stressed Guterres.""This session of the General Assembly is a real opportunity for progress.""'Two epochal challenges'In his speech, Guterres made particular reference to climate change and the risks associated with advances in technology, referring to these two problems as ""epochal challenges.""Noting scientific evidence that the planet is getting hotter, increasing concentration of carbon dioxide, Guterres underscored: ""Climate change is moving faster than we are \- and its speed has provoked a sonic boom SOS across our world.""""If we do not change course in the next two years, we risk runaway climate change  We need greater ambition and a greater sense of urgency,"" he said.Underscoring the need to ensure full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Guterres urged world leaders to make maximum use of upcoming such as the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or COP24, in Poland in December to strengthen global resolve against the threat.He also announced that he will convene a Climate Summit next September, to bring together countries and cities, as well as political, business and civil society leaders, ""to focus on the heart of the problem.""""There are many mutually beneficial solutions for digital challenges. We need urgently to find the way to apply them,"" he said, calling on the global community to use the United Nations as a platform to draw attention to the risks and benefits of technological advances and to nurture a digital future that is safe and beneficial for all'Winds of hope'""Despite the chaos and confusion in our world, I see winds of hope blowing around the globe,"" said Guterres, noting the recent signing of the historic peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the start of the peace process between Djibouti and Eritrea, and other positive developments elsewhere.The approval of a compact on refugees and another on migration also represent signs of hope, he said, highlighting also the promise offered by the world's young people, gender equality gaining ground and growing awareness of discrimination and violence against women and girls.He also stressed that the UN must lead the way in pursuit of gender equality.""For the first time in United Nations history, there is full parity in our Senior Management Group and among Resident Coordinators leading country teams around the world. We are firmly committed to equality and empowerment everywhere,"" said the Secretary-General.In conclusion, Guterres recalled the words of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in which Annan said that the world shares a common destiny and that everyone can master it only if they face it together \- that is why we have the United Nations.""Our future rests on solidarity,"" said Guterres, calling on everyone to help repair the broken trust.""We must reinvigorate our multilateral project. And we must uphold dignity for one and for all.""Source: UN News Service\l"
"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria68","Inside feud between Kogi governor, deputy","March 2, 2019 Saturday","Weekly Trust","The feud between Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and his Deputy, Elder Simon Achuba, took a new twist recently following the withdrawal of all the security aides of Achuba allegedly on the orders of the governor's ADC.There has been a strained relationship between the governor and his deputy for quite some time, and perhaps the withdrawal of the deputy governor's security details would be the last straw that broke the camel's back.The APC governorship candidate in the election, Prince Abubakar Audu, was already coasting home to victory when he suddenly died, prompting the nomination of Alhaji Yahaya Bello as his replacement. Bello was nominated because he had emerged second during the primary earlier conducted by the APC.He was subsequently declared winner of the election by INEC after the earlier election 'inconclusive'.However, the running mate to the late governorship candidate, James Abiodun Faleke, refused to accept the deputy governorship position, insisting that he ought to have been declared winner of the election having run on a joint ticket with the late Audu.After series of consultations, horse-trading and political maneouvering, a deputy governor eventually emerged in the person of Simon Achuba, who hails from Ibaji Local Government Area. He was sworn in at the Government House, Lokoja, on Tuesday, February 10, 2016, by the state Chief Judge, Justice Nasiru Ajanah.However, not too long into the 'political honeymoon', some cracks and cold war began to manifest between the governor and the deputy. It all started with reports of alleged sidelining of Achuba in the running of affairs of the state.Those close to Achuba said Bello seemed to have more confidence in his Chief of Staff, Edward Onoja, and as such, delegated more responsibilities to him than to his deputy.The governor, on many occasions, described Onoja as his 'twin brother', apparently an open declaration of his confidence and trust in his chief of staff.Political watchers are of the view that the deputy governor's office has been less active or largely 'redundant' for a greater part of the administration.Perhaps, one of the earliest signs of the existence of a crack between the governor and his deputy was when the former (Bello) travelled out of the country for about two weeks to seek medical attention sometime in November, 2016. There were indications that the governor did not hand over power to his deputy before travelling out, thus sparking concerns of existence of a crack in their relationship.Another scenario was when the governor went on a trip to Poland in December, 2018, alongside President Muhammadu Buhari, for the United Nations (UN) .The governor handed over power to the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, to hold forte as acting governor. The development created an uproar from some stakeholders, but within 24 hours, a circular granting the deputy governor a two-month leave was released.Dramatic enough, the deputy governor was said to have applied for and was granted a two-month annual leave almost the same period the governor was away from the country.Analysts, however, observed that the development was an indication that all might not be well between the governor and his deputy. They said it was unusual for a deputy governor to have proceeded on leave at the same time as the governor.According to them, for a deputy governor to have gone on such a 'long break' at the peak of campaigns for the general elections was an indication that things were falling apart. The deputy governor was never visible in most of the APC meetings and campaigns held across the state in the build up to the general elections.He was also observed to be conspicuously missing in most of the important public functions held at the government house for quite some time.Achuba and the Chief of Staff, Onoja, were recently embroiled in a war of words over allegations that the deputy governor collected a kickback from a contractor to sabotage the construction of a road project to Ibaji, the country home of the deputy governor. The deputy governor has since denied the allegation and has asked for a retraction and public apology from Mr. Onoja.Achuba's ordeal, it was learnt must have heightened following his alleged secret hobnobbing with the opposition PDP.The deputy governor was particularly accused of having secretly visited the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, who is the Director General of the Atiku Presidential Campaign Organisation, at his official residence in Abuja in November, 2018.Many had expected that Achuba would return to the PDP where he hitherto belonged, but he has chosen to stay put in the APC against all odds.The face off became public after Achuba addressed a press conference last weekend where he opened up on some of the predicaments he had been battling.Achuba, at the press conference, raised alarm that his life and those of his family members were in danger following the withdrawal of his security details.According to him, he was set to go to his village at Iyano in Ibaji for the 'postponed' elections when all his security aides were withdrawn.He alleged that the ADC to the governor had summoned all his security details to the government house on February 15, 2019, for a briefing and kept them in detention without any explanation.'As I am speaking, my life is in danger because I cannot understand why my security personnel can be withdrawn on the eve of elections. As a member of the APC, I don't know what level of division or misunderstanding that can lead to that.'My advice is that security agents should not succumb to individuals' political interests,' he said.Achuba called on the Inspector General of Police to prevail on the Kogi State Commissioner of Police to restore his security details to him.Although the security details of the deputy governor have been fully restored, there are still indications that the feud is far from being over.The deputy governor, while speaking on some of his predicaments, said electricity and water supply to his official residence had been cut off for months.Besides, he also raised concerns that his travelling and other allowances had not been paid for months.He said he had informed the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other top APC stalwarts about his unpaid allowances but that nothing positive had been done.When asked why the deputy governor's security details were withdrawn, the Director General on Media and Publicity to the Governor, Kingsley Fanwo, said, 'It is not the responsibility of the governor to give security, even to himself. The security heads do. So the governor is not responsible for posting security to the deputy governor. So if his claims are true, kindly get in touch with the security agencies to give explanation.'When asked why the governor had reportedly sidel"

"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria71","Climate change: Katowice and house divided against itself","June 7, 2018 Thursday","Nigerian Tribune","IN December, the world will convene in Katowice, Poland for the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP) to discuss climate change, commitments to reduce emissions to 1.5 degrees below pre-industrial levels, to further the Talanoa dialogue, and to finalise on the Paris rulebook and implementation. This meeting will bring together government leaders, industry practitioners from the private sector, and non-profit players. One thing this anticipated COP seems to do is foist a deja vu of COP 19, the UNFCCC Conference of Parties held in 2013 in the same country, Poland, in its capital Warsaw, a country which at the same time was playing host to the global coal summit. Poland has been listed as one of the EU's most inefficient economies, with its carbon dioxide emissions per capita above the EU's average emissions. In fact around 90 percent of the country's electricity is derived from burning coal. According to a Greenpeace recent report, the coal-powered plants are responsible for almost 5,400 deaths a year and the massive Belchatow coal-powered station in Poland is the single largest polluter in the entire EU.COP 19 was not particularly successful, as we did not seeany major progress on the Loss and Damage agenda, which was meant to be the one of the highlights of the summit. On the contrary, in the last few weeks before the COP in Warsaw, members of the Polish government in several official statements clearly stressed the role and the importance of continued coal use for the Polish economy and its competitiveness. Poland is also known for blocking any more ambitious climate policy instruments in the EU. Most alarming was the fact that the sponsors of the climate talks in Warsaw were big polluters; coal and crude oil companies, whose interests indeed came to fore at the negotiations. One would have hoped that after the summit in Warsaw in 2013, the country will adopt a more progressive approach, cut down on the use of coal and make for a climate-friendly economy, yet the coal capital still continues to be that- a coal capital. It makes one wonder why for the second time in five years, they have offered to host the COP. Indeed the agenda pushed at the COP 19, and at the coal summit that held concurrently during the second week of the COP in Poland was that of clean coal technologies and the future of Poland's coal. Clearly, the coal capitalwas bringing everyone to its country to convince them that they would not drop their coal, but would try to make it clean.The question on everyone's mind remains the same as what it was in 2013- what happens at the COP in Poland? The presidency of the has been announced- Polish minister of Energy of a country where energy is dominated by the coal industry. Michal Kurtyka will be taking up the most critical role since the Paris Agreement in 2015 and will be playing a huge part in the furtherance of the Paris rulebook. What remains unspoken here is whether the politics and power play of coal and his role within the Polish government will determine his disposition during the talks, as the climate politics of Poland is at the lower end of ambition. It is even more disturbing because the role of the presidency is critical; as critical, if not even more than the seat of the climate talks because the President steers the conferences and brokers deals when there are deadlocks. At COP 19 President, then Poland's environment minister got fired because fracking was not happening fast enough. In other words, he was not pushing the country's agenda fast enough. We await to see what will happen in December in the Silesian city of Katowice.The hosting of the COP 24 climate talks by Poland is akin to an unrepentant sinner playing priest, taking confessions of sinners from behind the confessional, and offering reprieve for their sins. Apart from it being antithetical that a coal-powered city is hosting the climate talks, it is simply the case of a house divided against itself, and usually such cannot stand. Either the country will take the hit from this negotiations or the negotiations will. Yet, some have argued that the climate summit happening in Poland might just be a harbinger of good things, as it may mean that the coal-powered country is ready to truly commit to curbing emissions and driving a climate-friendly economy.We cannot forget too early, however, that the Polish government has continued to iterate that it will continue to depend on coal as its major source of energy. Understandably, it is not an easy process to shift from the mainstay of a country's economy, as it will affect jobs, energy supply and the economy in general, yet the demand is for countries like Poland to make conscious efforts towards reducing gradually their fossil fuel emissions by finding more low carbon and renewable energy options and giving them pre-eminence in the energy mix. More especially because coal is a much dirtier fuel than other fossil fuels, and apart from the environmental hazards, it places heavy demands on water resources, causes grave health hazards and emits more greenhouse gases than any other fuel. As the COP approaches, the apprehension of a conference that will be marred by conflict of interest and a coal agenda is palpable. However, optimism says to anticipate a better outcome in Katowice than Warsaw. Whatever the case, it might be too early at this stage to tell.\l"
"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria72","With weaker climate consensus, expect elevated climate change","December 27, 2018 Thursday","Business Day","As representatives from more than 100 countries debated climate change in the COP24 - the 24th UN climate change conference - held in Katowice, Poland, the outcome could only be divisive.In the past, collective consensus by major economic powers - U.S., the EU, Japan and China - fueled success. Now the planned withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Accord resulted in a hollow consensus, supported by big-oil opposition.Like the recent G20 Summit, which welcomed trade but did not reject protectionism that undermines trade, Katowice agreed on a 'compromise,' which welcomed the alarming climate UN (IPCC) report, but not its actual findings. The price could be the virtual extinction of small island states as seas rise, followed by soaring costs of climate change in emerging and developing economies.Katowice's £dministrative' compromise virtually ensures that the extreme urgency required by the 'rule book,' which would allow countries to implement the Paris Agreement, will be ignored.The planned Trump exit from Paris AccordRisks have escalated since June 1 2017, when President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement - an international pact intended to reduce the effects of climate change by maintaining global temperatures 'well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels.'The Accord was negotiated by almost 200 parties and adopted by consensus in December 2015. Based on the UN convention on climate change, it focuses on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in 2020.However, Trump calls the pact a 'bad deal' for the U.S. and sees the withdrawal as a key piece of the 'America First' stance. The White House began to pave the exit path in March 2017, when Trump signed an executive order to start the formal process of repealing President Obama's climate agenda.The withdrawal split the White House, the Congress, and the nation. A few powerful lobbying groups, energy giants and billionaires effectively hijacked the fight against climate-change, which most Americans and U.S. cities support.More recently, the White House ignored a new government report, which concluded that, in the absence of significant steps to subdue global warming, U.S. economy will take severe hits and cause the death of thousands of Americans by 2100.It is within the U.S. president's constitutional authority to withdraw from the Paris deal without first receiving congressional or senatorial approval. But legal questions linger as to how the Trump White House can execute the withdrawal and what role the U.S. can play in future international climate meetings.The role of China, emerging and developing economiesSince the early 2010s, it has often been said that China is the 'world's greatest polluter.' That's true but only in aggregate terms. By default, big nations pollute more than small ones.Moreover, emerging economies that are still industrializing generate relatively more pollution than advanced nations, which industrialized over a century ago.The simple fact remains that, on per capita basis, the U.S. and major European economies remain the greatest polluters by far, however.According to research, China contributes barely 10-12% of human influence on climate change. That figure has remained fairly steady over the industrial period. It is lower than might be expected for the world's largest aggregate emitter.As the major advanced economies, including the U.S. and Europe, have been emitting far longer, their net contribution on climate change remains relatively far higher. Climate change is not just cumulative but accumulative.If the U.S. exit will materialize, global climate risks will intensify dramatically, particularly in emerging and developing economies.The 10 countries most affected by climate riskBetween 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar ranked highest among the countries that have been most affected by climate change. Less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialized countries. Yet, even, high income countries feel climate impacts more clearly than ever before.Regarding future climate change, the new Global Climate Risk Index can serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change. The 10 countries most affected in the past two decades feature mainly poorer economies in Asia (Myanmar, Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand) and Americas (Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua and Guatemala).The Index measures long-term global risk as a function of death toll, deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, absolute losses in US$ millions, losses per unit GDP in percentage and total number of climate events from 1998 to 2017. In this regard, there are differences among the most affected countries.In the case of Puerto Rico, the top rank was driven by a very high death toll and costly economic losses, but the number of events was low relative to other countries. In Myanmar, the high death toll explains the score. In Dominica, Puerto Rico and Haiti, the losses per unit GDP drove high rankings.In international comparison, the Philippines death toll has been relatively high in the past two decades, while its economic losses were among the highest. But it is the number of total events in the Philippines (over 300) that was the highest among the top-10 countries.Only Vietnam and Bangladesh come close, but even they had just two-thirds of the climate events in the Philippines. And in the top-ranking Puerto Rico and Honduras, total events were less than a 10th and 5th of those in the Philippines.Toward accelerated climate changeSince the 1980s typhoons that strike East and Southeast Asia have intensified by 12-15%, with the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 having doubled, even tripled. Under increasing greenhouse gas forcing, the projected ocean surface warming pattern suggests that typhoons striking Asia will intensify further.Ironically, global climate change will penalize particularly those economies where living standards remain low and that are most vulnerable to collateral damage. The more poor economies will lose lives, the more that will bespeak about the effective indifference of advanced nations toward real human rights.Timing matters. Under the agreement, the earliest date of the U.S. withdrawal is November 2020 - the last month of the Trump presidency, in the absence of a prior impeachment. That's when Americans have to decide whether they really prefer energy profits, at the expense of future generations in the U.S. and elsewhere.Furthermore, time is running out. According to estimates, current climate policies virtually ensure that the increase in global temperatures is on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. That does not bode well for the future.\l"

Participants from various ministries, the private sector and the civil society attended the event. The European Union also announced a new support of EUR 3 million to strengthen research and innovation capacities in agriculture to face the challenges of climate change.According to Marjaana Sall, Ambassador of the European Union to the Republic of Mauritius:\- ""I am proud that the first ever High Level Policy Dialogue on Climate Change with the Government of Mauritius is taking place today. The European Union is a strong supporter of multilateralism, and as such, we remain committed, with our Member States, to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We believe that there is an unprecedented urgency to step up global efforts to halt and reverse climate change, in particular for Small Island States like Mauritius. As a concrete result of our dialogue, we have jointly agreed on a Management Framework that will allow us to step up our cooperation on climate change and to monitor progress in the fight against climate change. It will be a continuous exercise.""She added: -"" I take this opportunity to announce our new support to the Government of Mauritius for an amount of 120 million rupees to boost innovation in agriculture to be more resilient to the effects of climate change.""Stakeholders from several ministries dealing with climate change issues, the private sector and Non-Government Organisations involved with climate change mitigation and adaptation participated in the High Level Policy Dialogue on climate change. The Dialogue was cochaired by the Minister of Social Security, Reform Institutions, Environment and Sustainable Development and the EU Ambassador, in the presence of the French Ambassador and the British High Commissioner.The Dialogue provides a structured platform to discuss on key climate-related policy issues in the framework of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that Mauritius presented inParis in 2015. It is also an occasion to discuss how the European Union, including its Member States, can further assist Government in meeting its mitigation and adaptation commitments. This is a continuous dialogue, to monitor progress and see how the EU and Mauritius can work together.The EU and Mauritius have agreed on a Joint Management Framework on Climate Change which is focused on six objectives that will be jointly monitored:To comply with Nationally Determined Contribution target to mitigate climate change, subject to support from International sourcesTo improve coastal zone resilienceTo implement an effective national disaster risk reduction strategyTo enhance resilience against high intensity rainfall eventsTo increase native forest cover to enhance the climate resilience of natural ecosystems (including mangroves).The High Level Policy Dialogue takes place less than one week after the COP 24. It illustrates the commitment of both Mauritius and the European Union to join forces to address climate change and meet their commitments made in Paris 3 years ago. The Policy Dialogue follows the EU-Mauritius Political Dialogue, when it was agreed to hold a dedicated policy dialogue on climate change.

"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria77","Bonn climate talks: The good, the barred and the oily","May 16, 2018 Wednesday","Nigerian Tribune","ON 30th April, 2018, the Intersessionals- a climate preparatory session done earlier in the year ahead of the main United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP), kicked off in Bonn, Germany and ended on the 10th of May 2018. While the meeting is a United Nations meeting, the issues discussed concern every local community, every family, every individual. The purpose of the meeting was to prepare the ground on salient issues ahead of the COP 24 negotiations to be held in Katowice, Poland in December. While many issues were discussed at the meeting, certain items have caused a lot of buzz because of how important they are to the success of the negotiations, one of which is the proposal for a Conflict of Interest (COI) policy.The issue of Conflict of Interest simply refers to the presence of fossil fuel industries at the negotiation table, either by themselves or through Business and Industry NGO's (BINGOs) representing their interests, and how they use that to negatively influence and stall the climate talks. This has been a recurring concern since the COP 22 in Marrakech. Repeatedly, this part of the conversation in the negotiations is pushed further to the coming year.In the lead up to the COP 23 last year, Corporate Accountability International (CAI), an international think tank, reported the involvement of about 250 BINGOs admitted to the climate talks, and they often use their presence to weaken the climate talks rather than to strengthen it. It is even more worrying, because, Conflict of Interest, the main issue for discussion during the first week of the Intersessionals was deliberately omitted in the draft of the conclusion from the meeting, not even acknowledging the fact that it was discussed. Clearly, the influence of Big Polluters on this fundamental issue is a lot, and just like the discussions were abandoned in May last year in Bonn, there has been another deadlock again one year later.Throughout the Conflict of Interest deliberations last week, various delegations called for a Conflict of Interest policy document, and as always, the push for it was intense with Ecuador, Cuba, Small Island States and the Africa group for it, while the USA, EU, Canada, Norway and Australia was against. CAI has suggested a stringent and transparent process to determine who or what organisation gets admitted into the climate negotiations by ensuring that they are motivated by public rather than private interests.

It is essential too, to constantly keep at the front-burner of the conversation, the fact that these polluters should stop polluting, pay and clean up for the pollution they have done and to make the transition to low carbon energy.

"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria78","Bonn climate negotiations and other matters","May 16, 2018 Wednesday","The Sun (Nigeria)","Caleb Adebayo On April 30, 2018, the Intersessionals- a climate preparatory session done earlier in theThe post Bonn climate negotiations and other matters appeared first on The Sun News.Caleb AdebayoOn April 30, 2018, the Intersessionals- a climate preparatory session done earlier in the year ahead of the main United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP)- kicked off in Bonn, Germany and ended on the May 10, 2018. While the meeting is a United Nations meeting, the issues discussed concern every local community, every family and every individual.The purpose of the meeting was to prepare the ground on salient issues ahead of the COP 24 negotiations to be held in Katowice, Poland, in December. While many issues were discussed at the meeting, certain items have caused a lot of buzz because of how important they are to the success of the negotiations, one of which is the proposal for a Conflict of Interest (COI) policy.The issue of conflict of interest simply refers to the presence of fossil fuel industries at the negotiation table, either by themselves or through Business and Industry NGO's (BINGOs) representing their interests, and how they use that to negatively influence and stall the climate talks. This has been a recurring concern since the COP 22 in Marrakech.Repeatedly, this part of the conversation in the negotiations is pushed further to the coming year.In the lead up to the COP 23 last year, Corporate Accountability International (CAI), an international think tank, reported the involvement of about 250 BINGOs admitted to the climate talks and they often use their presence to weaken the climate talks rather than to strengthen it.It is even more worrying because Conflict of Interest, the main issue for discussion during the first week of the Intersessionals was deliberately omitted in the draft of the conclusion from the meeting, not even acknowledging the fact that it was discussed. Cleary, the influence of Big Polluters on this fundamental issue is a lot, and just like the discussions were abandoned in May last year in Bonn, there has been another deadlock again one year later.Throughout the conflict of interest deliberations last week, various delegations called for a Conflict of Interest policy document, and as always, the push for it was intense with Ecuador, Cuba, Small Island States and the Africa group, while the USA, EU, Canada, Norway and Australia was against. CAI has suggested a stringent and transparent process to determine who or what organization gets admitted into the climate negotiations by ensuring that they are motivated by public rather than private interests. A key question to tackle though, is how to properly determine private or public interest at that stage, as some of those interests are revealed subtly upon admittance to the negotiations, and are even done through NGO's who do not necessarily bear on the surface any connection to the fossil industries.There have been arguments, especially from fossil interests that preventing business interests from participating in the climate talks will be counter-productive, as apart from stifling their possibility of contributing to the Paris commitments, it raises issues of freedom of speech as the outcome of the negotiations affects their businesses and business practices greatly.

The climate change is an existential threat to world's poorest and most vulnerable. The new targets demonstrate how seriously we are taking this issue , investing and mobilizing $200 billion over five years to compact climate change'The Bank said the fund is made up of approximately $100 billion in direct finance from he World Bank and approximately$100 billion of combined direct finance from the International Finance Corporation IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as well as Private Capital mobilization by the World Bank groupThe call is coming on the heels of the leaders observations that the zeal with which the 2015 Paris agreement for a sustainable global action against climate change, has weakenedThis is also coming against the backdrop of revelation by the World Meteorological Organization, that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years.The Secretary General of the United Nation's Organization, Antonio Guterres in his welcome speech, said recent special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that warming could reach 1.5 degrees as soon as 2030, with devastating impacts.' The latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report tells us that the current Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement will lead to global warming of about 3 degrees by the end of the century.'There was also revelations that concentration of carbon dioxide is the highest now, than it had been in the last 3 million years.The 2015 Paris agreement was aimed at raising Increased transparency for the action to mitigate against global climate change even as the leaders observed that Global green house gas emission is rising againThe United Nation's Secretary General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, minced no words in sounding the warning with his observations that the world was indeed in troubleand called for urgent actions to tackle climate change.' We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change' Guterres said.The concern expressed by the world leaders emanates from the fears that the climate change is running faster than the world is acting' We must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late'Breaking heat, increased fire outbreaks, desertification, melting glaciers and other forms of unpredictable weather conditions are seen as danger signals calling for urgent action to mitigate the challenge.According to Guterres ' It is hard to overstate the urgency of our situation, as for many people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life and death.'He noted that the world was not yet doing enough 'even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world'' nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption'The leaders called for a deep and just solution to the climate change frame work, aimed at removing the planet from a great danger.The Katowice dialogue is expected to hopefully lead to a new sets of agreements on how to operationalize the Paris agreement in a more realistic and firm manner.Guterres in his message, listed four areas of concentrations that should guide actions such as , science demands a significantly more ambitious response, the Paris Agreement provides the framework for action, so we must operationalize it, we have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos, to consolidate the financial commitments made in Paris and to assist the most vulnerable communities and nations and four, climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better.For him ' even though the 'IPCC's Special Report tells us that we still have time to limit temperature rise, that time is running out.'He noted that Paris success was achieved because negotiators were working towards a common goal, and urged the Katowice summit 'to maintain the same spirit of urgent collaboration here in Katowice with a dynamic Polish leadership in the negotiations.''Katowice must ensure that the bonds of trust established in Paris will endure.'Incredible opportunity exists if we embrace a low-carbon future and unleash the power of the Paris Agreement.'But we must start today building the tomorrow we want.'The Katowice Climate Change Conference is the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC, the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1-3).The conference also include the 49th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), and the seventh part of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-7).The conference will amongst other things help to finalize the rules for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change under the Paris Agreement work programme (PAWP, as well as a number of high-level events, mandated events, action events and roundtables.\l"
"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria80","How Africa's billionaire's investments are contributing to climate change","August 22, 2018 Wednesday","Business Day","Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote, chair of Dangote Group, worth $14.1 billion according to Forbes as at March, 2018, is set to float the world largest single-train oil refinery in Lagos, which would also include a petrochemical and urea fertilizer plant. He also has large investments up to hundreds of millions of dollars in the Nigerian coal industry; a major financier of the coal plant in Kogi and the reviving coal plant in Enugu. His cement factories across Nigeria are also powered by coal. While these projects bring about enormous economic benefits, the Nigerian government, the billionaire investor and various stakeholders seem to have turned a blind eye to the environmental effects of investing in these dirty fuels as well as the emission reduction commitments under the Paris agreement to which Nigeria is a signatory.President Muhammadu Buhari, in September 2016 while addressing one of the Side Events of the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA71) enthused 'My signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has demonstrated Nigeria's commitment to a global effort to reverse the effects of the negative trend.'In December last year, at the One Planet Summit, President Buhari again stated that 'Government is actively promoting technologies and practices such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency, clean energy, and skills for reducing greenhouse gas emissions among others.'These statements clearly show continuing support for emission reduction and combating climate change, but are in stark contradistinction to the fossil fuel projects happening on a large scale in the country. The refinery project by Aliko Dangote, a project estimated to cost somewhere between $12 billion to $18 billion is one of such projects, set to encourage and scale fossil fuel dependency for decades to come, while the coal projects are also contributing inch by inch to our increasing carbon profile. In a business conference in October, 2016, the billionaire admitted with regards to his cement companies that ' All our cement plants have been converted to coal' and that they would use 12, 000 metric tonnes of coal per day.These developments are worrying, as they have increasingly negative effects on the environment and enhance the spate of climate change, which in turn is negatively affecting our agriculture, food security, health and economy. Apart from the effects on climate change, there are the adverse effects of fossil fuels on the immediate life of the communities; their livelihood, water, atmosphere and health.According to Greenpeace UK, globally, coal is the greatest climate threat we face. The Climate Reality project points out that while coal is one of the cheapest forms of energy, it is the dirtiest, and the one that contributes most to greenhouse gases. In a comparative study done by Elsevier, it was also discovered that coal has a high rate of related health hazards from the point of mining to preparation, transporting, waste storage and combustion. Crude oil closely follows behind, its havoc rap sheet already popular in Nigeria, especially in the Niger Delta.The story of the Okobo people in Kogi State where coal mining is done will immediately bring tears to one's eyes. Okobo is a small town in the Enjema district of Ankpa local government in Kogi state where coal mining is done in Nigeria. The only stream in the community is polluted with the presence of heavy metals and the air is contaminated with carbon and coal particles. A Global Rights Nigeria report reveals that children and women, especially pregnant women are plagued with various illnesses and the death toll is on the rise. This suffering is what would be extended to the communities in Enugu where the coal power plant wants to be revived. A 'Coal Kills' report estimates that coal accounts for over 800, 000 premature deaths every year around the world, and many million more serious and minor illnesses. The burning of coal in this community emits serious hazardous wastes that pollutes their water bodies, contaminate crops and release toxins into the atmosphere, thus damaging cardiovascular and nervous systems, increasing their risk of respiratory and heart diseases. It also releases a lot of hydrocarbons, especially methane and carbon dioxide that contribute to climate change, which in turn affects the health and livelihood of the people.The Niger Delta communities are no strangers to negative effects of oil exploration and production, as it has repeatedly taken its toll on their environment, health, water and livelihood. According to the Journal of Scientific Research and Reports, there is an average of about 700 oil spills in the Niger Delta annually. The oil industry has also damaged the environment through the oil spills, gas flares and release of effluents and smog from refineries. Rivers State still continues to suffer from the black soot which has lasted since early 2017 as a result of the activities of refineries, among others, putting over six million people in danger of cancer and respiratory problems, according to experts, as well as releasing hydrocarbons into the atmosphere.With the realities of fossil fuel effects staring her in the face, should Nigeria then be encouraging investment in coal and oil, or in renewable energy forms that falls in stride with its international climate change commitments, and which are healthier and safer for the communities? No doubt, oil continues to provide most of the country's revenue and foreign exchange earnings, and coal is a cheap way to industrialise, yet if Nigeria continues big billionaire investments in dirty energy, where then lies the fate of her sustainable development?Ahead of the 24thConference of Parties (COP 24) later this year, Nigeria has to come to a firm decision on whether it wants to follow through with its commitments under the Paris Agreement, and if it does, then certainly it cannot keep investing or encouraging investments in fossil fuels.\l"
"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria81","Culture And Behavior Can Have Answers For Climate Change Response","September 6, 2018 Thursday","News Chronicle (Nigeria)","Behavior acculturated to ancestral norms, originally necessitated by occupation, is the focus of a new study in China with interesting ramifications for climate change. In general, farming requires more stable relationships than, say, herding with the constant movement of animals. Now the authors have taken farming a step further:They observed that northerners were three times more likely than southerners to push an obstructing chair in a Starbucks out of the way; southerners eased themselves around in order not to inconvenience whosoever had placed the chairs. The behaviors were true to type as northerners are considered brash and aggressive, while southerners are conflict averse and deferential.The authors ascribe the behavior to ancestral occupation. Wheat is farmed in the north, and such dry-land farming is more individualized than rice farming in the south. The latter requires complex irrigation systems for paddies and forces cooperation and coordination among multiple families. The interdependence also means it is crucial not to offend anyone. This ancestral culture prevailed despite the fact that most descendants were no longer farmers.The question of which people change their environment and who change themselves is an important one at a time when the world has to face the existential challenge of climate change. In the last couple of years we have seen a cooperative Europe facing a quintessential maverick, as in Donald Trump.Mr. Trump lives in his own world ignoring the mounting research and irrefragable evidence for climate change with its human fingerprint that can no longer be disputed. Worse still are the consequences and the inevitable danger of conflict fueled by resource needs. Thus the melting of Arctic ice has made possible new sea pathways, opening up oil and gas exploration, and pitting Russia, the U.S., Canada and other Arctic countries against each other.China is now in virtual control of solar panel manufacture through a heavily subsidized industry against which producers in other countries are unable to compete. The U.S. imposed tariffs in 2017 and India might follow suit.As electric car use increases, the demand for the rare minerals necessary for their batteries has begun to soar. Unfortunately the Congo with its incessant tribal wars is by far the largest producer of cobalt. Nickel has varied sources including Indonesia and the Philippines although the largest reserves are in Australia, Brazil and Russia. Chile has the highest reserves of Lithium followed by China, while Australia is the top current producer. The scramble for these resources is underway and producer countries have begun to guard their reserves through tariffs and controls.Perhaps the most fraught issue is that of sharing water. For millennia one country has relied on the Nile. The annual flooding in ancient Egypt brought new alluvial soil yielding rich harvests. Even now more than 95 percent of the country's mostly farmer population lives on the river's banks in an area approximately 5 percent of Egypt's land mass. That whole way of life could be in jeopardy depending on how quickly Ethiopia chooses to fill a huge reservoir behind a vast damn it is constructing.China shares the Mekong with six other countries and is the only one not a member of the Mekong River Commission. The problem is upstream dams and delicate negotiations for the equitable treatment of downstream farmers and fishermen.Then there are India and Pakistan, perennial enemies, now nuclear supercharged. They share the Indus and some of its tributaries. Thanks to the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, they have never fought a water war although there have been others. Now India is planning upstream dams. The situation can only worsen if the sources in the Himalayas diminish with global warming.How should humans respond to these environmental challenges? Should diffuse bodies deal with associated problems, and/or should there be a world environment court as a last resort against individualistic mavericks?The Montreal Protocol, dating back to 1987, protected the depleting ozone layer through the control of substances, chlorine and bromine, causing the problem. The culprits hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were to be phased out and replaced by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The latter lacking chlorine are safe in this regard.Governor Jerry Brown is independently hosting the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco (Sept. 12-14) next month to ""put the globe back on track to prevent dangerous climate change and realize the historic Paris Agreement.""Then there is the New York Declaration on Forests (2014) which pledges to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020 and to end it by 2030. It resulted from dialogue among governments, corporations and civil society following the UN Secretary-General's Climate Summit in New York.Meanwhile, China produces 20 percent of emissions and it will need to address the consequences of its Belt and Road Initiative. However, an agreement between China and the US, the two largest polluters, could open the intriguing possibility of the US returning to the Paris accord.Such diffuse bodies dealing with the myriad problems emanating from climate change and the evident cooperation of different actors relegate an out-of-sync Trump into a discordant minority. While the US remains a hugely important party responsible for 18 percent of global emissions, a hopeful sign is that other politicians in the country are clearly not following President Trump's lead.These ad hoc arrangements might work for the present. But what of the future? What of environmental degradation leading eventually to mass migrations, even wars for scarce resources? We have the benefit of Europe's experience with large numbers of refugees from America's wars in Libya, the Middle East and Afghanistan; the welcome mat has been gradually rolled back. How effectively will the UN Security Council counter environmental wars, particularly those involving China or other countries with veto power ? That all such questions need to be addressed and soon is a no-brainer, and COP 24 (Dec 3-14, 2018) could be an appropriate venue to begin the discourse.Author's Note: Aside from minor changes, this article first appeared on Counterpunch.org.Dr Arshad M Khan ( HYPERLINK /index.html) is a former Professor based in the U.S. whose comments over several decades have appeared in a wide-ranging array of print and internet media.

"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria82","President Buhari's Major Principles on Climate Change, by Garba Shehu","December 6, 2018 Thursday","Nigerian Tribune","This year's annual conference of the Parties to the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is currently taking place in Katowice, Poland. It opened on December 2nd and will run until the 14th.There are about 22,000 delegates from 200 countries at the conference, including President Muhammadu Buhari who joined other world leaders for the high-level meeting on December 2 and 3.As an aside, the choice of Katowice by the Polish hosts of the conference is a deliberate one, aimed at bringing home the lessons of the devastation caused by climate to the global environment.Katowice is the coal mining and steel making stronghold of the country. Coal powers 80 per cent of Poland's electricity, on account of which Katowice is the 36th of Europe's 50 most polluted cities. Smog, manifesting air pollution can get so bad that it would sometimes be difficult to breathe.It's perhaps on account to avoid the air that many delegations chose to stay in Krak\'f3w, a distance of 80.4 km (someone hour-drive) from Katowice, for their residency while attending the conference.Beyond this, there is everything positive to say about infrastructure in both cities, much of it put in place during the communist era, attesting to claims that in some ways, communism did work for the people.Tagged 'COP24The Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015. The global action plan set out in Paris is to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C.The agreement came into effect on 4th November 2016 and has since been signed by nearly 200 counties including Nigeria.Signatories also include the United States, Australia and Argentina, three countries that are now reversing their acceptance of the terms of the agreement.In the specific case of Donald Trump's America, he doesn't even believe that global warming has a connection with carbon emissions, a sin visited on the world by rich, industrial nations led by America.This year's climate conference came at a time of growing concern about the deteriorating global climate situation. It has been determined that in carbon dioxide levels, the year 2017 was the highest they have been in 3-5 million years.According to the National Agency for Space Administration, NASA, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880; the Arctic was warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth in 2017 and sea levels are rising at the fastest recorded rate in 2,000 years.As enunciated by President Buhari in his speech at Katowice, the consequences of this are seen in the rising global temperatures, erratic rainfall, sandstorms, desertification, floods, cold waves, low agricultural yields and drying up of water bodies. 'It is no surprise that the effects are felt more on the vulnerable communities that lack the capacity and technology to properly address such challenges,' he said.In that speech, President Buhari made it clear that we in Africa contributed little, if any to the climate change menace but were suffering its consequences.He graphically cited the case of the Lake Chad, down from 25,000 square kilometres to 2,500 sq. km, ten per cent only of its established size and with that, jeopardizing the livelihoods of 40 million inhabitants of the basin found in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.The consequences of these on the ecosystems are extreme poverty, the displacement of people, and support for banditry and terrorism.In calling for international support to recharge Lake Chad with waters from the Congo Basin in Central Africa, President Buhari made clear that Nigeria remains committed to saving the Lake from possible extinction.In the search for solutions, he revealed that an International Conference held earlier in February this year in Abuja has helped in creating additional awareness globally on the serious environmental and security challenges facing the Lake Chad region.Furthermore, he said, 'A consensus was reached at the said Conference to the effect that an inter-basin water transfer from the Congo Basin remains the most sustainable option available to resuscitate and safeguard this precious water body that was once the 6th largest freshwater Lake in the world.'The President also did his duty of projecting Nigeria as a responsible nation-state, playing by international rules, taking upon herself the ambitious 'Nationally Determined Contributions' targeted to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions up to 20 per cent by 2030 and, given international support, by 45 per cent in 20 years.It is clear that the Nigerian leader has cast himself in the role of an activist and global environmental champion to the admiration of many including Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General. His support for the Paris Agreement is unmistakable, partly on account of his view of it as a vehicle for the remission of past ills visited on the environment that led to the consequences of climate change imposed on Nigeria and other African countries.He sees the risks to our farmers who are involved in frequent deadly attacks against each other with herders; he is concerned about rising oceans that threaten our communities along the thousands of kilometres of coastl"
"COP24","Nigeria","COP24_Nigeria83","OPEC Within Global Energy Transition","March 28, 2019 Thursday","Naija 247 News","Perhaps, now more than ever before, the world needs the guiding principles at the heart of the Atlantic Council: international cooperation; innovative thinking; fact-based policy making; the generation of bold ideas and the multitude of benefits that come from reaffirming historical alliances.Let me stress that OPEC shares these values. Our encouragement of international cooperation and support of the multilateral system are 'front and centre' of everything our Organization stands for and the actions we take.Given our common values and shared interests, I welcome the opportunity to share perspectives with you today and encourage exploring all other possibilities for further strengthening relations between our two organizations.Next month, OPEC celebrates a very special and historically significant occasion. We will commemorate the 60-year anniversary of the First Arab Petroleum Congress, which took place in Cairo, Egypt. On the margins of this event, two kindred spirits, Venezuela's Juan Pablo P\'e9rez Alfonzo and Saudi Arabia's Abdullah al-Tariki who had originally met as students in the US, sat down with representatives from Iran, Kuwait and Iraq, at the Maadi Yacht Club in Cairo.There the 'Gentlemen's Agreement' of Maadi was forged, which encouraged the signatories' governments to establish a formal consultation commission as a means of countering the arbitrary decisions of oil companies and sought to secure better concession terms for oil producing countries.It was what I might term a first 'crossroads moment' for our Organization.The unstoppable momentum generated in Cairo would eventually culminate in the foundation of OPEC in Baghdad on 14 September 1960 by the five founding fathers of our Organization: Abdullah al-Tariki; Perez Alfonzo; Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala£t al-Shaibani of Iraq; and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait.It was perhaps no coincidence that a US citizen, the legendary energy reporter, Wanda Jablonski, also played an important role in bringing these five founders together, helping bring about the initial consultations in Cairo.I think this, alongside the fact that Alfonso and al-Tariki first met in the US, is symbolic of the crucial, interactive role that OPEC and the oil industry in the US would have over the subsequent six decades. I also believe it represents how our fortunes are closely intertwined.OPEC has a vested interest in sustained US economic growth and prosperity. We are friends of the US. Equally, I feel that the US stands to benefit when OPEC prospers. OPEC's Statute and mission is to help achieve a sustainable stability in the oil market; and this is not stability for stability's sake: this is because we are cognizant of the diverse range of economic and social benefits that came from sustainable oil market stability.When we succeed in our mission, this benefits both US producers and consumers.One of the clearest examples of the interconnected nature of our fortunes was during the last global energy market downturn, what some call the 'Great Bust' of 2014-2016. This downturn was as devastating for OPEC Member Countries as it was for US producers, especially tight oil producers.I would like to commend the author Bethany McClean, who vividly described the impact of the bust on the US industry in her book, 'Saudi America'.The consequences of the downturn were various: the rig count in the US fell from 1,920 rigs in late-2014 to a low of 480 in early-2016. This is a huge drop of around 75%! By mid-2016, US oil production had decl"

The Ministers welcomed South Africa's Chairship and looked forward to the 10th BRICS Summit to be held under the theme, ""BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution"" and committed themselves to work together for a fruitful Johannesburg Summit.The Ministers recalled the BRICS tradition of outreach to extend its cooperation to fellow developing and emerging economies. In this respect, the Ministers welcomed South Africa's two-pronged outreach approach through the BRICS-Africa Dialogue and the BRICS Plus cooperation, to be held during the Summit.The Ministers expressed their gratitude to South Africa for hosting the Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations, contributing positively to the BRICS cooperation.

South Africa's upcoming term as an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 2019-2020 presents an opportunity to enhance cooperation on peace and security. As part of our commitment to stronger global governance, we support the process of UN reform, including efforts on the comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council and the revitalisation of the work of the General Assembly. We agree that enhanced cooperation will be vital in multilateral fora addressing global challenges and crisis situations. We agree to coordinate positions, where feasible, in view of the upcoming G20 Summit in Argentina.We are determined to promote free, fair and inclusive trade and the rule-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being at its core, and serving the interest of all its members.

From the Executive to the Legislature and to the Judiciary, 2018 presented its challenges, hiccups and some good news.A look at the high points in the three arms of government in 2018 showed it all while Nigerians believe that a lot of works still need to be done.The Bill for parliamentary governmentThe ExecutivePresidency's year of mixed feelingsAs the year winds down, there are certain events that defined President Muhammadu Buhari's Presidency in 2018.The unforgettable moments came in their numbers, not one and not two. Collectively, they determined how the country fared in the year under review and probably may shape events in the New Year, 2019.Health issuesUnlike in 2017, where the president once spent 154 days (May 7 to August 19, 2017) in London, undergoing medical treatment for an undisclosed ailment, this year was an exception. He went to London on April 9, nine days before the 25th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, also known as CHOGM 2018, to ""enable him rest"" before the commencement of the event on April 16 \- April 20, according to the presidency.Not too long after his return his visit to Washington DC to meet with President Donald Trump of the United States, in May he embarked on what his media handlers called ""a four-day trip to the United Kingdom, to see his doctor.""Buhari had also seen his doctor in London on his trip back from the US, over what the presidency called ""technical stop-over for aircraft maintenance in London,"" disclosing that his doctor had asked for a meeting.Senate's refusal to confirm Magu as EFCC substantive chairmanAnother issue that characterized Buhari's Presidency in 2018 was the refusal of the Senate to confirm the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, as the substantive chairman of the anti-graft agency.The Senate first rejected his confirmation in April 2017 and the second time in April 2018, citing his indictment by the Department of Security Service (DSS).Padded budget disagreementWhile signing the budget in July, Buhari said he was worried that up to 6,403 projects initiated by the lawmakers were smuggled into the budget. First, he alleged that they removed some priority projects of the Federal Government and replaced them with theirs. Secondly, he accused them of sabotaging the executive's effort of regularising the country's budget on a January-December financial year.Excess crude account crisisThe year is ending with controversy trailing the depletion of the Excess Crude Account, which balance in November stood at about $2.319 billion to only $631 million within three weeks. Excess Crude Account is a special account established to warehouse excess revenues from the prevailing crude oil price at the international market. Income generated above the approved crude oil benchmark price in the annual budget is saved in the account. Withdrawal from the account is subject to the approval of the three tiers of government and the Executive Council of the Federation (FEC). It was not clear when the decision to draw from the account was taken and for what purpose.Skewed appointmentsControversies also trailed Buhari's appointments since 2015, when he mounted the saddle as president. In the year under review, the controversy came to a head in October in the Senate, as the senators were divided along regional l"

PREAMBLE We, the Heads of State and Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met from 25 \- 27 July 2018 in Johannesburg, at the 10th BRICS Summit. The 10th BRICS Summit, as a milestone in the history of BRICS, was held under the theme ""BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution"". We are meeting on the occasion of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela and we recognise his values, principles and dedication to the service of humanity and acknowledge his contribution to the struggle for democracy internationally and the promotion of the culture of peace throughout the world. We commend South Africa for the Johannesburg Summit thrust on development, inclusivity and mutual prosperity in the context of technology driven industrialisation and growth. We, the Heads of State and Government, express satisfaction regarding the achievements of BRICS over the last ten years as a strong demonstration of BRICS cooperation toward the attainment of peace, harmony and shared development and prosperity, and deliberated on ways to consolidate them further. We reaffirm our commitment to the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, democracy, inclusiveness and strengthened collaboration. As we build upon the successive BRICS Summits, we further commit ourselves to enhancing our strategic partnership for the benefit of our people through the promotion of peace, a fairer international order, sustainable development and inclusive growth, and to strengthening the three-pillar-driven cooperation in the areas of economy, peace and security and people-to-people exchanges. We recommit ourselves to a world of peace and stability, and support the central role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and respect for international law, promoting democracy and the rule of law. We reinforce our commitment to upholding multilateralism and to working together on the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals as we foster a more representative, democratic, equitable, fair and just international political and economic order.

We express satisfaction at the outcomes of Ministerial Meetings that have been held (Annex 1) and look forward to the remainder of meetings to be held under the 2018 BRICS Calendar of Events.II. STRENGTHENING MULTILATERALISM, REFORMING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND ADDRESSING COMMON CHALLENGESWe reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations, as the universal multilateral organisation entrusted with the mandate for maintaining international peace and security, advancing global development and promoting and protecting human rights. We reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and support for the United Nations as the universal intergovernmental organisation entrusted with the responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, advancing sustainable development as well as ensuring the promotion, and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reiterate our commitment to the strengthening of multilateral institutions of global governance to ensure that they are able to comprehensively address global challenges. We also recognise the inherent strength of regional initiatives in support of the objectives of the broader multilateral system. We further reaffirm our commitment to the centrality of the universal collective security system enshrined in the UN Charter. We recognize the importance of working towards an international system based on international law, with the UN Charter as its fundamental cornerstone, which fosters cooperation and stability in a multipolar order. We note the long overdue outstanding task of ensuring the adequate representation of African States in the UN, especially in peace and security matters. Faced with international challenges requiring our cooperative efforts, we reiterate our commitment to shaping a more fair, just and representative multipolar international order to the shared benefit of humanity, in which the general prohibition of the use of force is fully upheld and which excludes the imposition of unilateral coercive measures outside the framework of the UN Charter. We emphasise the indivisible nature of peace and security and reiterate that no country should enhance its security at the expense of the security of others. We recall the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirm the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN. We underscore the importance of sustained efforts aimed at making the United Nations more effective and efficient in implementing its mandates. We encourage further collaboration amongst the BRICS countries on a better resourced UN, on its administration and budget, on preserving the UN's Member State-driven character and ensuring better oversight of and strengthening the Organisation. We express our support for continued cooperation of BRICS members in areas of mutual interest including through regular exchanges amongst their multilateral Missions. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to provide equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions \- economic, social and environmental \- in a balanced and integrated manner, towards the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. We pledge our support for the important role of the United Nations, including the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in coordinating and reviewing global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, to reform the UN Development System with a view to enhancing its capability in supporting member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. We urge developed countries to honour their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments fully in time and to provide additional development resources to developing countries. Regarding Climate Change, we welcome the progress towards finalizing the Work Programme under the Paris Agreement and express our willingness to continue working constructively with other Parties to conclude its related negotiations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) towards the 24th Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC COP24) to be held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018. We call upon all countries to fully implement the Paris Agreement adopted under the principles of the UNFCCC including the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and urge developed countries to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to enhance their capability in mitigation and adaptation. We undertake to strengthen BRICS cooperation in energy, especially in transitioning to more environmentally sustainable energy systems supportive of the global sustainable development agenda, balanced economic growth and the collective socio-economic wellbeing of our citizens. We continue to strive toward universal energy access, energy security, energy affordability, reduced pollution and environmental conservation. We reaffirm that the diversification of energy supply sources, including renewable and low carbon energy sources, investments in energy and energy infrastructure, energy industry and market development and intra-BRICS collaboration for access to primary energy sources will continue to underpin our energy security. We recognise the need to accelerate energy transition including in transportation, heating and industry uses. We acknowledge the importance of energy efficiency and the popularisation of an energy efficient life style in virtue of its potential contributions to energy security, industrial competitiveness, emissions reduction, economic growth, job creation and other areas when introduced.We acknowledge that the BRICS Ministers of Energy agreed to establish the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform and to develop its Terms of Reference, and note the ongoing discussions for that purpose.We reaffirm and support the establishment of the BRICS Agricultural Research Platform (ARP) initiated by India in 2016. We appreciate the fundamental importance of research, development and innovation in global sustainability and competitiveness. We endeavour to strengthen the agricultural research collaborative networks among the BRICS countries to enhance the resilience of the collective agricultural and food systems in the face of the changing climate. We recognise the need for follow-up steps in implementing the aims and objectives of the ARP. We commit to step up intra-BRICS collaboration including within the frame of the Agriculture Research Platform and the Basic Agriculture Information Exchange System (BAIES).We acknowledge the outcomes of the 4th BRICS Environment Ministers Meeting which was held under the theme ""Strengthening cooperation amongst BRICS on Circular Economy in the context of the Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP)"". We note that the circular economy approach represents enormous potential to reduce waste, to forge more environmentally sustainable processes, diversify our economies whilst contributing to economic growth and job creation.We acknowledge the outcomes of the successive BRICS Environment Ministers' Meetings including the implementation of the Environmentally Friendly Technology Platform, Clean Rivers Umbrella Programme and the Partnership for Urban Environment Sustainability Initiative. The progress in the establishment of the BRICS Environmentally Sound Technology (BEST) Cooperation Platform is acknowledged, which is intended to be practical and results orientated, and would include partners, science organisations, civil society, private sector and financial institutions.We welcome the commitment to enhance cooperation in the field of water on the basis of sustainable development in an integrated way, addressing the themes of water access flood protection, drought management, water supply and sanitation, water and climate, systematically facilitating water pollution prevention and control, river and lake ecosystem restoration and preservation, ecosystem conservation, and water resources management.We acknowledge the BRICS Meeting of Heads of Disaster Management in Buffalo City, wherein the Action Plan 2018-2020, was adopted and the first meeting of the BRICS Joint Task Force was held to further enhance our cooperation in this field.We reaffirm the intention to enhance cooperation and collaboration amongst BRICS countries in the field of biodiversity conservation, sustainable use and equitable access and benefit sharing of biological resources, and also undertake to promote our cooperation in biodiversity-related international conventions and fora including on endangered species and amongst our National Parks authorities.We recognise the vast potential in cooperation and collaboration in advancing the Oceans Economy amongst BRICS countries, which encompasses multiple sectors, including the strategic areas of maritime transport, shipbuilding, offshore oil and exploration, aquaculture, port development, research and technology, conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, marine and coastal tourism, financial and insurance services, as well as coastal industrial zone development.We remain committed to the continued implementation of the Agenda for BRICS cooperation on population matters 2015-2020, which was agreed to by the Ministers responsible for Population Matters in 2014, because the dynamics of population age structure changes in BRICS countries pose challenges and present opportunities, particularly with regard to gender inequality and women's rights, youth development, employment and the future of work, urbanisation, migration and ageing.We deplore the continued terrorist attacks, including in some BRICS countries. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever. We urge concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis and express our conviction that a comprehensive approach is necessary to ensure an effective fight against terrorism. We recall the responsibility of all States to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories.We call upon the international community to establish a genuinely broad international counter-terrorism coalition and support the UN's central coordinating role in this regard. We stress that the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international refugee and humanitarian law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reaffirm our commitment on increasing the effectiveness of the UN counter-terrorism framework, including in the areas of cooperation and coordination among the relevant UN entities, designation of terrorists and terrorist groups and technical assistance to Members States. We call for expeditious finalisation and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) by the United Nations General Assembly.To address the threat of chemical and biological terrorism, we support and emphasise the need for launching multilateral negotiations on an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism, including at the Conference on Disarmament.We firmly believe that those responsible for committing, organising, or supporting terrorist acts must be held accountable. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, which should include countering radicalisation, recruitment, travel of Foreign Terrorist Fighters, blocking sources and channels of terrorist financing including, for instance, through organised crime by means of money-laundering, supply of weapons, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, dismantling terrorist bases, and countering misuse of the Internet by terrorist entities through misuse of the latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).We reaffirm the importance of the elaboration under the UN auspices of rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States in ensuring security in the use of ICTs.We embrace the undeniable benefits and new opportunities brought about by the advances in ICTs, especially in the context of the 4th industrial revolution. However, these advances also bring with them new challenges and threats resultant from the growing misuse of ICTs for criminal activities, the increasing malicious use of ICTs by state and non-state actors. In this regard, we stress the importance of international cooperation against terrorist and criminal use of ICTs and therefore reiterate the need to develop a universal regulatory binding instrument on combatting the criminal use of ICTs within the UN. We acknowledge the progress made in promoting cooperation according to the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs or any other mutually agreed mechanism. We also acknowledge the importance to establish a framework of cooperation among BRICS member States on ensuring security in the Use of ICTs and, in this regard, BRICS member States will work towards consideration and elaboration of a BRICS intergovernmental agreement on cooperation on this matter.III. STRENGTHENING AND CONSOLIDATING BRICS COOPERATION IN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITYWe reaffirm our commitment to collective efforts for peaceful settlement of disputes through political and diplomatic means, and recognise the role of the UN Security Council as bearing the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. We express our concern over the ongoing conflict and heightened tensions in the Middle-East region and our conviction that there is no place for unlawful resorting to force or external interference in any conflict and that, ultimately, lasting peace can only be established through broad-based, inclusive national dialogue with due respect for the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of each of the countries of the region. We agree that, in each of the countries in the region, citizens have legitimate aspirations to fully enjoy civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and fundamental freedoms, especially with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian situation.We agree that the conflicts elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa should not be used to delay resolution of long-standing conflicts, in particular the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. We reiterate the need for renewed diplomatic efforts to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid Principles, the Arab Peace Initiative and previous agreements between the parties, through negotiations with a view to creating an independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. We reiterate that the status of Jerusalem is one of the final status issues to be defined in the context of negotiations between Israel and Palestine. With regard to the situation in Gaza, we reiterate our support to the UN General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/ES-10/20) on the protection of the Palestinian population and call for its full implementation.We reiterate our support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). We commend its vital role in providing health, education and other basic services for almost 5.3 million Palestinian refugees and underscore its relevance to bringing stability to the region and the need for ensuring a more adequate, sufficient, predictable and sustained funding for the Agency.The ongoing conflict and major humanitarian crisis in the Republic of Yemen are also causes for further concern. We call for unhindered access for the provision of humanitarian assistance to all parts of Yemen and urge the international community to expeditiously provide the necessary assistance. We urge all parties to fully respect international law, to cease hostilities and to return to the UN brokered peace talks, leading to an inclusive Yemeni-led dialogue towards the achievement of a political solution to the conflict.We also call on all parties directly involved in the current diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region to overcome their dissensions through dialogue and welcome the efforts of Kuwait in this regard.We reaffirm our support for the process of an ""Afghan-led, Afghan-owned'' national peace and reconciliation process. We express our concern over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan particularly the increase in the number and intensity of terrorist-related attacks on the Afghan National Security Forces, the Government and civilians. We call on the international community to assist the government and the people of Afghanistan with the objective of working towards the realisation of peace. We also welcome the Parliamentary elections that are scheduled to be held in October 2018 and the Presidential elections in 2019.We reaffirm our commitment for a political resolution of the conflict in Syria, through an inclusive ""Syrian-led, Syrian-owned"" political process that safeguards the state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, in pursuance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015) and taking into account the result of the Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue in Sochi. We reiterate our support for the Geneva process and the mediation offered by the UN, as well as the Astana process which has been showing signs of positive developments on the ground, and stress the complementarity between the two initiatives. We reaffirm our commitment to a peaceful resolution in Syria and our opposition to measures that run contrary to the UN Charter and the authority of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and that do not contribute to advancing the political process. We also highlighted the importance of unity in the fight against terrorist organisations in Syria in full observance of the relevant UNSC Resolutions. We reiterate our strong condemnation of the use of chemical weapons by any party, for any purpose and under any circumstances and renew calls for comprehensive, objective, independent, and transparent investigations of all alleged incidents. We call for enhanced efforts to provide necessary humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, bearing in mind urgent reconstruction needs.Recalling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear programme we call upon all parties to fully comply with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and security.We welcome recent developments to achieve the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and maintain peace and stability in North East Asia. We reaffirm the commitment for a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation.We express our serious concern about the possibility of an arms race in outer space and of outer space turning into an arena for military confrontation. We reaffirm that the prevention of an arms race, including of the placement of weapons in outer space, would avert a grave danger for international peace and security. We emphasise the paramount importance of strict compliance with the existing legal regime providing for the peaceful use of outer space. We also reaffirm that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce this regime. We welcome the newly established Group of Governmental Experts to discuss possible elements for a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space including inter alia, on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space. We stress that practical transparency and confidence building measures may also contribute towards non-placement of weapons in outer space. We reiterate that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, has the primary role in the negotiation of a multilateral agreement or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects.We welcome South Africa's hosting of the Meeting of BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations in Pretoria on 4 June 2018. The Ministers exchanged views on major global political, security, economic and financial issues of common concern and on strengthening BRICS cooperation. We look forward to the forthcoming Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations on the margins of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly.We welcome the 8th Meeting of the BRICS High Representatives for Security held on 28 and 29 June 2018 in Durban, and commend them for enriching BRICS' dialogue on the global security environment, counter-terrorism, security in the use of ICTs, major international and regional hotspots, transnational organised crime, peacekeeping, as well as the linkage between national security and development issues.We emphasise the important role of United Nations peacekeeping to international peace and security, and the contribution of BRICS countries in this regard. We recognise the need for BRICS countries to further enhance mutual communication and cooperation on peacekeeping matters at the United Nations and the South African initiative for a BRICS working group on peacekeeping in this regard.We commend the African Union for its efforts aimed at resolving and managing conflicts on the continent and welcome the strengthening of the cooperation between the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council. We commend the African Union's commitment to the ""Silencing of the Guns by 2020"" and support efforts to strengthen the African Peace and Security Architecture. IV. BRICS PARTNERSHIP FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY, REFORM OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS, AND THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONWe welcome that the global economy has continued to improve, while noting that growth has been less synchronised and that downside risks still remain. This is reflected in a variety of challenges including rising trade conflicts, geopolitical risks, commodity price volatility, high private and public indebtedness, inequality and not sufficiently inclusive growth. We understand the critical importance of ensuring that the benefits from growth are shared in a more inclusive manner. We further stress the importance of a favourable external environment for sustained growth of global trade. BRICS economies continue to support global economic expansion and outlook. We advocate continued use of fiscal, monetary and structural policies in concert, to forge strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We express concern at the spill-over effects of macro-economic policy measures in some major advanced economies that may cause economic and financial volatility in emerging economies and impact their growth prospects adversely. We call on major advanced and emerging market economies to continue policy dialogue and coordination in the context of the G20, FSB and other fora to address these potential risks. Recalling the Johannesburg Summit's focus on the 4th Industrial Revolution and the outcomes of the BRICS Meetings of Science and Technology and Industry Ministers, we commend the establishment of the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR). To commence the full operationalisation of PartNIR, an Advisory Group will be set up, comprising of respective representatives of BRICS Ministries of Industry, in consultation with appropriate Ministries, to develop, as a first step, the Terms of Reference and a Work Plan aligned with the 4th Industrial Revolution priorities, to be submitted to the BRICS Chair. The PartNIR aims at deepening BRICS cooperation in digitalisation, industrialisation, innovation, inclusiveness and investment, to maximise the opportunities and address the challenges arising from the 4th Industrial Revolution. It should enhance comparative advantages, boost economic growth, promote economic transformation of BRICS countries, strengthen sustainable industrial production capacity, create networks of science parks and technology business incubators, and support small and medium-sized enterprises in technology intensive areas. We believe that the initiative to establish the BRICS Networks of Science Parks, Technology Business Incubators and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises is a promising step in that direction. We recognise the critical and positive role the internet plays globally in promoting economic, social and cultural development. In this regard, we commit to continue to work together through the existing mechanisms to contribute to the secure, open, peaceful, cooperative and orderly use of ICTs on the basis of participation by all states on an equal footing in the evolution and functioning of the internet and its governance, bearing in mind the need to involve the relevant stakeholders in their respective roles and responsibilities.We recognise the importance of BRICS scientific, technical, innovation and entrepreneurship cooperation for sustainable development and to enhance inclusive growth. We welcome the dynamic development of BRICS cooperation in science, technology and innovation and attach special importance to the advancement of our joint work in this area. We affirm the value of implementing coordinated BRICS scientific projects aimed at promoting BRICS science, technology and innovation potential as a contribution to our combined efforts in addressing the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.We commend the progress of ongoing BRICS IPR cooperation. We recognise the importance of the development and transfer of technologies, including to developing countries, contributing to long-term sustainable and balanced global growth, and in this regard stress the importance of strengthening cooperation in intellectual property rights which contributes to innovation and the advent of new technologies to the benefit of society as a whole.We are convinced that trade and technology are vital sources of inclusive growth, including through economic integration and consolidation of global value chains in sustainable and equitable ways. Technological progress will have wide ranging implications for production of goods and services as well as incomes of people. Appropriate policies and measures need to be taken to ensure that the developing countries benefit from the advantages of technological progress and do not suffer from lack of its early adoption. It is essential to develop effective policies to bridge the digital divides, including through supporting people to learn and by adopting new technologies and ensure effective mechanisms for transfer of relevant technologies.We strongly acknowledge that skills development is critical to addressing the emerging mismatch between the new skills demanded by an increasingly technology-and knowledge-driven global economy and the older skill set of many workers. The pace, scale and scope of present-day economic change make it that more challenging. In this regard, we support measures including policy recommendations proposed in the G20 Initiative to Promote Quality Apprenticeship and the BRICS Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation and Reduction through Skills, to further facilitate vocational training, lifelong learning and the training that is relevant to the fast-changing demand of growing economies and world of work.We reaffirm the centrality of the rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, as embodied in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), that promotes a predictable trade environment and the centrality of the WTO, and recognise the importance of the development dimension, and will make all efforts to strengthen the multilateral trading system. We recognise that the multilateral trading system is facing unprecedented challenges. We underscore the importance of an open world economy, enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalisation, which should be inclusive and support sustainable development and prosperity of all countries. We call on all WTO members to abide by WTO rules and honour their commitments in the multilateral trading system.We recall that the WTO Dispute Settlement System is a cornerstone of the multilateral trading system and is designed to enhance security and predictability in international trade. We note with concern the impasse in the selection process for new Appellate Body Members that can paralyse the dispute settlement system and undermine the rights and obligations of all Members. We, therefore, urge all Members to engage constructively to address this challenge as a matter of priority.We acknowledge the need to upkeep WTO's negotiating function. We, therefore, agree to constructively engage in further developing the current legal framework of the multilateral trading system within the WTO, taking into consideration the concerns and interests of all WTO members, including in particular the developing members.We acknowledge the importance of infrastructure development and connectivity in Africa and recognise the strides made by the African Union to identify and address the continent's infrastructure challenges, inter alia, through the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). We support the importance of stimulating infrastructure investment on the basis of mutual benefit to support industrial development, job-creation, skills development, food and nutrition security and poverty eradication and sustainable development in Africa. We therefore reaffirm our support for sustainable infrastructure development in Africa, including addressing the infrastructure financing deficit.Keenly aware of the need for Africa's industrialisation and the realisation of the African Union's Agenda 2063, we commend African countries and the African Union on the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The AfCFTA is an important step to economic integration on the continent and the unlocking of the tremendous potential of intra-African trade and in addressing its socio-economic challenges. In this regard, we reiterate our support for Agenda 2063 and efforts to promote continental integration and development.We advocate for a strong Global Financial Safety Net with an adequately resourced, quota-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) at its centre. To this effect, we reaffirm our commitment to conclude the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula while protecting the voice of the poorest countries by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings. Governance reform of the IMF should strengthen the voice and representation of the poorest members of the IMF, including Sub-Saharan Africa. We welcome and congratulate Governor Lesetja Kganyago of the South African Reserve Bank on his appointment as the Chair of the International Monetary and Financial Committee.We note the steps undertaken on strengthening and ensuring the operational readiness of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) and welcome the completion of a successful test run of the de-linked portion of the CRA mechanism. We encourage cooperation between the CRA and the IMF.We note with satisfaction the progress achieved on establishing the BRICS Local Currency Bond Fund, and look forward to starting its operation.We agree to further strengthen cooperation on convergence of accounting standards and auditing oversight of BRICS countries in the area of bond issuance, and to further cooperation in these areas.We welcome the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on Collaborative Research on Distributed Ledger and Blockchain Technology in the Context of the Development of the Digital Economy.

We welcome the upcoming establishment of the Americas Regional Office in S\'e3o Paulo, Brazil, which, alongside the Africa Regional Centre, will help the NDB consolidate its presence in those continents. We note the NDB's Board of Governors' discussions on Innovative Approaches for Development Finance at its 3rd Annual Meeting on 28-29 May in Shanghai, China, that deliberated on the NDB's future development in the changing global environment.We stress the importance of enhancing BRICS financial cooperation to better serve the real economy and meet the development needs of BRICS countries. In the regard, we reaffirm our commitment to facilitate financial market integration through promoting the network of financial institutions and the coverage of financial services within BRICS countries, subject to each country's existing regulatory framework and WTO GATS obligations, and to ensure greater communication and cooperation between financial sector regulators. We will continue to enhance currency cooperation, consistent with each central bank's legal mandate, and to explore more modalities of the cooperation. We will also further expand green financing, so as to promote sustainable development in BRICS countries.We reaffirm our commitment to support international cooperation in combating illicit financial flows, including cooperation within Financial Actions Task Force (FATF) and World Customs Organisation. In this regard, we underscore the importance of increasing mutual exchanges and data sharing. We emphasise the importance of upholding and supporting the objectives of FATF and to intensify our cooperation to implement and improve its Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation in FATF.Corruption remains a global challenge with long-lasting impact, including the undermining of legal systems of states. It also presents a threat to economic growth by discouraging the necessary local and foreign investment in a country. We reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation as envisaged in Chapter IV of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. In that context, we commit to strengthening international cooperation within the context of the BRICS Working Group on Anticorruption Cooperation. Subject to our domestic legal systems we will cooperate in anti-corruption law enforcement, extradition of fugitives, economic and corruption offenders and repatriation in matters relating to assets recovery and other related criminal and non-criminal matters involving corruption and call on the International community to deny safe haven to corrupt persons and proceeds of corruption. We regard experience sharing and exchange as key to increasing mutual understanding and enhancing BRICS anti-corruption cooperation and will continue our efforts in this aspect as we have done in previous years. We will further offer each other support in the implementation of the UNCAC by creating platforms for exchanging information and exploring convergences in multi-lateral platforms. We commend the African Union on choosing 2018 as the year of combating corruption.In operationalising the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership, we welcome the positive outcomes of the 8th BRICS Trade Ministers Meeting as supported by the ongoing activities of the BRICS Contact Group on Economic and Trade Issues (CGETI).

In this regard, we further welcome the BRICS Customs Action Plan, which identifies actions that will be taken collectively by the BRICS Customs Administrations in the short, medium and long term to achieve the stated goals and the establishment of BRICS Custom Training Centres. We recognise the potential of the BRICS Customs Cooperation Committee and call for enhanced intra-BRICS cooperation and at relevant multilateral fora, including in trade facilitation, law enforcement, use of advanced information technologies and capacity building.We acknowledge the continued support provided by the BRICS Revenue Authorities for all the international initiatives towards reaching a globally fair and universally transparent tax system. We will continue our commitment to deal with the implications of the digital economy and, within that context, to ensure the fairness of the international tax system particularly towards the prevention of base erosion and shifting of profits, exchange of tax information, both on request and automatically, and needs-based capacity building for developing countries. We commit to deepen exchanges, sharing of experiences, best practices, mutual learning and exchanges of personnel in taxation matters.

We welcome the establishment of Digital Economy Working Group within the framework of BRICS Business Council.Recognizing tourism's great potential to contribute to sustainable economic and social development, we welcome the initiative to establish a BRICS Working Group on Tourism, to foster greater cooperation between the BRICS countries and increase economic development and people-to-people relations. The BRICS Tourism work stream will exchange knowledge, experience and best practices in the areas of travel trade, air connectivity, tourism infrastructure, culture and medical tourism, barriers to tourism marketing, tourism safety and support \- financial, insurance and medical. We note with satisfaction that Intra-BRICS Tourism has grown despite the global economic downturn.V.

We commit to strengthening the coordination and cooperation on vaccine research and development within BRICS countries, and welcome the proposal to establish a BRICS vaccine research and development centre.

We emphasise the guiding role of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Agreement between the Governments of the BRICS States on Cooperation in the Field of Culture (2017-2021) for creative and sustainable cultural cooperation, and we note the various ongoing activities and initiatives of the BRICS culture experts.We acknowledge the 2nd BRICS Seminar on Governance 2018 in Johannesburg, while recognising the intention of Brazil to hold the 3rd meeting in 2019 with greater and more diverse participation of academia and thinktanks of all BRICS countries.We acknowledge with satisfaction the

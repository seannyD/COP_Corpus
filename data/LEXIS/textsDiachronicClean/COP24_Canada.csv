Following the Parti Quebecois and Quebec solidaire, the official Opposition Liberals as well as the environmental group Greenpeace have now added their voices to those calling on Francois Legault and his new environment minister, MarieChantal Chasse, to attend the COP24 climate summit taking place from Dec. 3 to 13 in Poland. Legault has thus far been reluctant to commit to attending the summit, even though previous premiers have attended similar meetings. He told the media in a news conference in Quebec City 10 days ago that his agenda is ""very busy."" While the federal government will be responsible for signing any agreements at the summit, the provinces will be responsible for implementing the measures to meet greenhouse gas emission targets. In an interview, the Liberal party's interim leader called on the premier to show his commitment to addressing climate issues by heading up a Quebec delegation comprised of representatives from all political parties as well as civil society and business. ""Francois Legault needs to show the world that Quebec is serious and that he wants to continue the leadership that we've shown over the past years,"" Pierre Arcand told The Canadian Press. Arcand said Legault's participation is doubly necessary given what he called the United States' indifference to climate issues. At least two of Legault's predecessors, Philippe Couillard and Jean Charest, attended previous climate summits. Greenpeace spokesman Patrick Bonin, for his part, said Quebec has ""a major role"" to play in a conference that is addressing ""urgent"" issues. ""It's practically an obligatory passage for a new government that has to work doubly hard because it has come empty-handed to the election campaign on the issue of climate change,"" Bonin said in an interview. Bonin said it's in the new Coalition Avenir Quebec government's interest to attend, in order to take better advantage of emerging green economies and give the new environment minister a crash course in climate issues. Contacted Friday, Chasse's office said the final decision on attendance had not yet been made. On the federal side, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has said she will attend. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not yet confirmed his presence. The UN Conference on Climate Change The legislature gets underway on Nov. 27 and in principle should be in session until Dec. 7, during which time the new government is expected to present its first bills since winning October's election. \"

Women play an important role in fighting climate change and advancing clean growth. That is why the Government of Canada is following through with this commitment by holding, with France, a training workshop on climate negotiations for 15 francophone negotiators from the sub-Saharan African region in Dakar, Senegal from October 22 to 25, 2018. The workshop, which will be offered in French for the first time, aims to help participants develop the personal skills, competencies, and knowledge they need for international negotiations, decision making, and the development of climate change policies. These skills will be especially useful ahead of the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ), which will be hosted in Poland, in December 2018. The project follows the launch of the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, in April 2018. This partnership includes several Franco-Canadian cooperation actions for 2018\- 2019, such as including climate in development assistance actions. In addition to supporting the Franco-Canadian participation in climate issues, this workshop encourages a diversity of voices at the negotiation table, by supporting the participation of francophone women. Developed and funded by Canada and France, the workshop is also a partnership with the Institut de la Francophonie pour le d\'e9veloppement durable and the Women\' s Environment & Development Organization.

It is a time for us to celebrate our forestry families, forestry communities, and our country's world-leading approach to how we manage our forests - one of our country's most important and renewable resources. By any measure, Canada is a global leader when it comes to managing our forests and the ecosystems, wildlife, and communities that depend on them. Most recently, our approach was validated at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) where the Ministerial 'Declaration on Forests and Climate'was tabled recognizing the critical role forests and forest management plays in Canada and around the world in helping us achieve global climate change targets. Today, we salute Canada's registered professional foresters who look after the country's forests. This includes not only planning and implementing harvesting and reforestation activities, but also promoting important forest values such as wildlife, biodiversity, and water protection. The meticulous planning that goes into managing Canada's forests is one of the reasons we harvest less than 0.5% of our forests annually, we replace what we harvest by planting 1,000 trees every minute.

The march was organized by a group called The Planet Goes to Parliament. Spokesperson Nathalie Roy said that the movement was born out of increasing frustration from citizens during the recent provincial election campaign. ""It started because we needed to channel the indignation we felt about the fact that, during the campaign, there was very little said about environmental issues \'e2\€  where we feel a true sense of urgency.""

Trudeau&rsquo;s Liberal government cannot go to COP24 to simply defend how they will miss their reduction targets; they must instead take the opportunity to significantly increase their action to address the most pressing crisis facing Canadians.  The report tabled a few weeks ago by the IPCC is unequivocal: if no changes are made, humanity will lose its fight against climate change. Prime Minister Trudeau has made moving speeches for three years, but because of his government&rsquo;s inaction, we already know the country will not be able to achieve the goals it has set by signing the Paris agreement on climate change, said NDP Environment and Climate Change Critic Alexandre Boulerice.  With its highly inadequate approach, the Liberal government is contributing to humanity's climate disaster. COP24 is the perfect time for Trudeau&rsquo;s government to urgently increase its action to tackle climate change. In order for the Trudeau government to increase their action on climate change, the NDP will be presenting the following motion for unanimous consent to the House of Commons: That the House asks the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to bring forward the following priorities and commitments at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: i) a climate action strategy that prioritizes reconciliation with indigenous peoples; ii) investments in a transition that leaves no workers behind; iii) robust rules for implementing the Paris Agreement that will allow Canada to increase the ambition of its GHG reduction targets in response to the IPCC report; iv) transparency and accountability mechanisms to address climate change; and v) integrating human health into Canada's climate commitments.  We are already seeing the impacts of climate change in Canada: longer heat waves, climate refugees, species extinctions, crop losses, floods, forest fires, heat islands, disruption of our ecosystems and other extreme weather events. It's simple, this is our most important fight, added NDP Deputy Environment and Climate Change Critic Linda Duncan.  Just last week we saw a media report categorizing Canada with China and Russia on the list of biggest polluters. This is wrong and shows Trudeau&rsquo;s lack of urgent action on this file. New Democrats will continue to push this government for urgent action because we know we need to defend our environment and fight climate change now.

Hosting the Press Conference was the Co-Chair of the Global Greens Parliamentarians Association and Leader of the Green Party of Canada, Elizabeth May. May who said  While the obstruction by the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait made headlines, the reality is the COP24 agenda largely bypassed the IPCC 1.5 Special Report.  As peoples of the world gather to march for climate action, the governments gathered here in Poland are continuing to leave enhancing current NDCs to future COPs, said Ewa Sufin-Jacquard, Director of the Polish Green Foundation. The focus of governments has been on getting the Paris Rule Book with clear, transparent accountability on a wide range of issues.  The young people of the world are demanding real action. It is our future that is being discounted and negotiated into oblivion, said Kim van Sparrentak from the Global Young Greens.  While the Paris Rule book is undoubtedly important, surely we were capable at this meeting of responding to the urgency of the IPCC warnings, said Lisa Badum, Green Member of the German Bundestag.  Instead, we seem determined to prove correct the IPCC comment that the only ingredient missing to ensure our survival is political will. Greens note that those governments pushing back on climate action are the same ones who increasingly reject immigration, stoke fear of the  other, and ignore the need for social justice and eradication of poverty.  In this, Greens are also united in demanding social justice, human rights and meeting the needs of the many, said Dorothy Nalubega of the Uganda Greens. It is clear that the most progressive countries working in this COP are those that have been formed with Greens in their governments. Ministers of climate, energy and environment from Sweden, New Zealand, and Luxembourg are playing prominent roles at this COP and are Green Party members.  We hope for strong results from the 2019 European Parliamentary elections, from the federal election in Canada and elsewhere in the world where Greens are poised to make gains. We need Greens elected everywhere to have any hope of placing humanity on a pathway to a sustainable world, said James Shaw, co-leader of the New Zealand Greens and Climate Change minister in the New Zealand Government.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada10","Environmental activists frustrated COP24 deal not strong enough","December 16, 2018 Sunday 8:59 PM GMT","CBC News","Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna and environmental activists are emphasizing that more action is needed to combat climate change despite Saturday's deal reached by countries at a UN climate summit. In addition, some green groups and certain countries expressed frustration that more ambitious climate goals were not achieved during intense negotiations that ran into the weekend. Nearly 200 nations at COP24 agreed upon universal, transparent rules that will govern efforts to cut emissions and curb global warming and enable countries to put into action the commitments they made in the 2015 Paris climate accord. ""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the UN Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. McKenna, who was in the Polish city of Katowice for COP24 along with other Canadian negotiators, said in a statement on Saturday that, while she is pleased with the outcome, ""more work remains over the next year."" That's because despite agreements, negotiators delayed decisions on two key issues until next year. They include a decision on the mechanics of an emissions trading system, and the issue of setting more ambitious targets in light of recent science showing a worsening trend in climate change. Fierce disagreements on those two issues were kicked down the road to help avoid an impasse on these issues, but according to some, it was a missed opportunity to send a signal to businesses to speed up their actions. ""Ambition will be at the centre of the climate summit I am convening in September,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted. ""It's time to show strengthened ambition to defeat climate change."" McKenna also said the deal made is contingent on efforts from those in the private sector, from all levels of government and from individuals. ""If we're going to be ambitious we need rules to the game, and of course we know we need to do more,"" McKenna told The National's Rosemary Barton on Sunday. ""Working with provinces, working with cities, working with business, working with Indigenous peoples ... because it's not just up to the federal government,"" she added. ""This really has to be a team approach internationally, and also here in Canada."" Tune in to McKenna's full interview with The National's Rosemary Barton tonight on CBC TV or stream it online. Climate Action Network Canada welcomed the agreement and applauded the efforts of McKenna and other Canadian negotiators, but emphasized the importance of countries following through with their promises. ""What really matters is getting that political will back home in countries to take the level of action that science demands,"" Catherine Abreu, the group's executive director, told CBC News on Sunday. Abreu was critical over the lack of specifics on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions, saying there were ""precious few specifics on how individual governments plan to respond to the devastating climate chaos of 2018 and deliver the climate action that science demands."" Poorer nations vulnerable to climate change also wanted more clarity on how an already agreed $100 billion a year of climate finance by 2020 will be provided, and on efforts to build on that amount further from the end of the decade. Greenpeace urges halt to Canadian pipelines McKenna in her statement touted Canada's ""leading role"" in the carbon market and in securing investments to tackle global climate change, but some critics dispute Canada's role as major climate player on the international stage due to its domestic policies. Daniel Mittler, political director of Greenpeace International, said Canada is ""not credible"" as a world leader in climate change while committing to building pipelines instead of shifting to renewable energy. ""[The Canadian] government is making the right steps in some ways \'e2\€  for example, getting rid of coal \'e2\€  but they're simply not credible as long as they own and build pipelines and expand fossil fuels when the science has been very clear."" Watch: Canadian government 'not credible,' says Greenpeace Mittler also criticized the COP24 deal for not doing enough. ""We should have had so much more... we've had a really terrible year of extreme weather events, of forest fires and of scientists telling the world that we are running out of time,"" he said. ""In the face of that, this agreement is morally bankrupt, it is just not enough."" However, he said the goal now is for governments to return home and show they mean business by putting the deal into action. ""Governments have in Poland, indeed, achieved a global rule book,"" he added. ""But without action, even the best rules will not get us anywhere and our children will face a very, very unfortunate climate [and] chaotic future."" \"

He told the gathering that the ""collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizons"" if no urgent action is taking against global warming. The 92-year-old TV presenter blamed humans for the ""disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the summit in Poland with an appeal to world leaders to take the threat of global warming seriously and to act boldly to avert a catastrophic rise in temperatures before the end of the century. Guterres called climate change as ""the most important issue we face."" Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the Untied Nations, speaks at the opening ceremony of the COP 24 United Nations climate change conference on December 03, 2018 in Katowice, Poland. ""Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,"" Guterres told delegates from almost 200 countries who gathered in Katowice, Poland. The UN chief chided countries, particularly those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, for failing to do enough to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord, which set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius - ideally 1.5 degrees C - by the end of the century. Citing a recent scientific report on the dire consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees, Guterres urged countries to cut their emissions 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and aim for net zero emissions by 2050. Such a move, which experts say is the only way to achieve the 1.5-degree goal, would require a radical overhaul of the global economy and a move away from using fossil fuels.

He said governments should embrace the opportunities rather than cling to fossil fuels such as coal, which are blamed for a significant share of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The remark was also directed at host Poland, which relies on coal for 80 per cent of its energy. But Poland's President Andrzej Duda told a later news conference that the coal-rich country will never entirely give up its ""strategic fossil fuel."" In order to steer businesses and consumers away from heavily polluting forms of energy, the U.N. chief urged countries to embrace carbon pricing, something few countries have yet to do. Guterres also urged negotiators not to forget that the challenges they face pale in comparison to the difficulties climate change is already causing millions around the world whose homes and livelihoods are at risk from rising sea levels, drought and more powerful storms. The two-week conference, in Poland's southern coal mining region of Silesia, is expected to work out how governments can report on their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming within the Paris accord limit. ""This is the challenge on which this generation's leaders will be judged,"" Guterres said. Andrzej Duda, President of Poland, prepares to speak at the opening ceremony of the COP 24 United Nations climate change conference on December 03, 2018 in Katowice, Poland. He later told reporters that realities about global climate are ""worse than expected, but the political will is relatively faded after Paris"" and is not matching the challenges. Guterres called for a ""huge increase in ambitions"" during the two weeks of negotiations in Poland, adding ""we cannot afford to fail in Katowice."" Duda, the Polish leader, said participants at the conference have backed its proposal of a ""just transition"" away from coal mining, which calls for helping those people, like coal miners, who are slated to lose their jobs as the world changes its energy mix. Fiji's prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's UN climate summit, said the ""just transition"" proposal shouldn't just consider the fate of fossil fuel workers but all people around the world whose lives are affected by climate change. Residents of the world's smaller islands, many of whom face catastrophic flooding from higher sea levels in a warming world, have been among the world's most vocal backers of measures to combat climate change. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada12","Political approach to climate change is alarmist","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)","In New Brunswick and across Canada, the more time passes, the less support among the public there appears to be for the\~carbon tax the federal government is imposing, especially on reluctant provinces with alternative proposals. Canada's not the only place witnessing considerable discontent and citizen anger about heavy-handed governments telling citizen's what's best for them, paying little heed to what the voters think. See street protests in France, the vote for Brexit in the United Kingdom and the province of Ontario electing populist Doug Ford. On the whole, Canadians have long been ahead of\~politicians in\~concerns about climate change and other environmental issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in agreement with the consensus among full-time environmental activists who, however well-meaning, are ideologues, not scientists. To the extent politicians in Canada have paid attention to climate change, they've largely relied on activists for proposed solutions. That usually means summarily dismissing legitimate public objections and proposed alternatives. It's how we got shortages of corn and food riots in poor nations. It was a ""solution"" ill-thought-through. The carbon tax is another case of trying to reach a positive goal (reduction of fossil fuel use) the least effective way possible,\~indirectly by changing ingrained behaviour. Political image and ethical certitudes that evolve into platitudes mean increasingly less the longer they're unsupported by concrete, effective action. Canada long ago once seemed in the lead on climate change. We made much of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol as years passed. But it was mostly talk, with minimal action. We didn't meet our Kyoto obligations, just signed on for newer ones. And we aren't meeting the new ones, either. Kyoto, a.k.a. the COP3 meetings, was billed as the international agreement to save the world. The failed COP24 meetings that just finished on Saturday in Poland heard the same rhetoric. These annual COP events have failed (the acronym is for ""Conference of the Parties,"" and the number denotes the consecutive years since the first of the United Nations Climate Change Conference held). I've argued even before the 2015 COP21/Paris meetings - which also promised to finally save the world - that we'd be farther ahead if we scrapped the costly, futile exercise and put all our focus and money on practical measures in each nation. Three years, and three conferences later, we're again simultaneously being told the climate crisis is worsening and coming ever faster, while shaky international agreements seriously crumble. And like every one of these events up to this year's, COP24 concluded with unsubstantiated hopeful news releases and assertions of progress and success, all contradicted by the inescapable fact the delegates didn't agree on their self-defined crucial items and are kicking the ball down the road. They'll do it again next year too. It's been 24 years straight now.\~ It's easy to see why. They're trying to get virtually every nation in the world to agree on complex, expensive\~and difficult solutions, muddled by so many variables that they'll never get there. It took three years since Paris for the annual event\~to even try to create a ""rule book"" for how to implement the agreement. It's not crying wolf,\~it's wheel spinning for 24 years straight. Had Canadian governments been listening carefully to the public all along, instead of wasting millions on these conferences, the nation and planet would be in better shape today.\~ Instead, we're being told again that government knows better than those who elect them. They'll decide, and we're told to go away and pay their tax grab until the next time they expect our votes. How could the public not be happy? The Trudeau government, heading into an election year, remains remains tone deaf and arrogant, mistaking a weak opposition for voter approval instead of voters holding their noses. There are alternatives to a tax, big things Ottawa could use to pull Canada's weight. Begin by declaring Canada a zero-emissions-vehicle zone by 2028. The auto industry has dragged its feet too long. Do it or lose our market. Where is investment in tidal power and\~high-speed, electric inter-urban transit across the nation? A carbon tax achieves nothing when consumers have no alternatives to use. Where are community wind or solar farms? Where is reverse metering? We have instead fibs about the tax being revenue neutral. And supposedly it ain't a tax, it's ""a price on carbon."" We'd do better without the UN and panicked activists, replacing them with community efforts at every level that genuinely get things done. Politicians will go to Doomsday ... and beyond!

David Lauren, the youngest son of the company's founder and its chief innovation officer, told The Associated Press ahead of the announcement that the new shirt is part of a broader strategy of fresh environmental goals throughout the manufacturing process. ""Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference,"" Lauren said. The Polo isn't the first of its kind. Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average 12 bottles. The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibers will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibers, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture. The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. It comes in styles for men and women in green, white, navy and light blue. The shirts are not more expensive than other Polos. Ralph Lauren has taken on environmental initiatives over the years, but it's putting into place a more significant strategy aimed at changing both its corporate culture and how it thinks about the clothes it produces. The effort includes a new supply chain and sustainability officer, Halide Alagoz, who said more details will be released in June. ""At the moment we're refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability,"" she said. Among the company's other goals: the use of 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100% recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year. Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment. Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP24 , in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action. As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibers that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is ""much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean."" The broader question of biodegradability of such fibers remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said. ""There's so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities,"" he said. ""Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem?

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada15","'We are still not doing enough'; Leaders stress need to win support for climate measures","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Prince George Citizen (British Columbia)","As leaders attending the UN's annual climate summit heard fresh warnings about the dire consequences of leaving global warming unchecked, a new issue emerged Monday as a pressing concern: how to persuade millions of workers their industry can't have a future if humanity is to have one. Hosting the talks in the heart of its coal region of Silesia, Poland tried to set the tone for the two-week meeting by promoting the idea of a ""just transition"" for miners and other workers facing layoffs as countries adopt alternative energy sources. ""We are trying to save the world from annihilation, but we must do this in a way that those who live with us today in the world have the best possible living conditions,"" Polish President Andrzej Duda said. ""Otherwise they will say, 'We don't want such policy.""'The issue of a ""just transition"" isn't restricted to workers in energy industries who might lose their jobs. Many economists argue that ambitious curbs on greenhouse emissions require raising the cost of carbon fuels - one of the measures that triggered large-scale protests in France by motorists feeling the squeeze at the pump. Scientists say the only way to keep average global temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century is to phase out the use of fossil fuels by 2050. That is the most ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris agreement, which negotiators from nearly 200 countries have come to Katowice to finalize. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a dramatic appeal to leaders Monday to take the threat of global warming seriously, calling it ""the most important issue we face."" ""Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,"" Guterres told delegates from almost 200 countries on the second day of talks. Famed British naturalist Sir David Attenborough echoed his warnings, telling the gathering that the ""collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizons"" if no urgent action is taken against global warming. The 92-year-old TV presenter blamed humans for the ""disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years."" Without naming specific countries, Guterres chided the nations most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions for failing to do enough to meet the goals set in Paris. Citing a recent scientific report, the UN chief urged governments to aim for net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero emissions mean that any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest or new technologies that can remove carbon from the atmosphere. Such cuts would require a radical overhaul of the global economy. But Guterres said governments should embrace the opportunities of shifting to a ""green economy"" rather than cling to fossil fuels such as coal, which are blamed for a significant share of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. officials have kept a low profile at the talks so far. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced Washington's withdrawal from the Paris accord, saying it's a bad deal for Americans, and repeatedly questioned the science behind climate change. By contrast, action film star and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger drew crowds and applause at the UN conference Monday for insisting that many in the United States remain committed to the agreement. The Netherlands, a country with a long history of pumping oil and gas from the ground, is also among the places most at risk from rising sea levels caused by global warming. With millions of people in the Netherlands living in low-lying areas, ""you have your evidence and your case in point to make, sure, that you prevent sea levels from rising even further"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told The Associated Press. Asked about the recent protests in France, one of which turned into a riot in Paris on Saturday, Rutte said politicians must work to get all of society to back the measures needed to tackle climate change. ""That means talking, talking, talking,"" he said. ""With all societal organizations, politicians, all citizens being involved if they want to."" More talk is doubtlessly necessary, including at the international level. Poland's President Duda told reporters that his country, which relies on coal for 80 per cent of its energy, would work to reduce its reliance on coal but never entirely give up its ""strategic fossil fuel."" Among those addressing conference participants this week is a 15-year-old Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, who has inspired students around the world to campaign against global warming. Thunberg criticized leaders, such as Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who failed to come to the climate talks. ""I think that in the future we will look back and we will either laugh at them or we will hate them,"" she told The Associated Press. ""It's very sad, but if they don't do anything right now that is the truth."" \"

Climate and Environment Minister Ola Elvestuen says deforestation is a multi-million business for criminals that cut down invaluable tropical forests, adding ""their activities have detrimental consequences for sustainable development in rainforest nations and the global climate."" He says ""halting and reversing land degradation and tropical deforestation could provide up to 30 per cent of the climate change solution."" Elvestuen told the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum that the partnership includes Interpol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and a U.N.-supported centre combatting illegal deforestation. The three institutions will work together to share expertise, networks and efforts to jointly support countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia. The Oslo forum focuses on the role forests play in achieving the Paris accord goals to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""Environmental crime has surged in recent years, generating billions in illicit profits for criminals, who are also involved in corruption, money laundering and other forms of trafficking,"" Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock said. ""Protecting the environment's precious resources is our collective responsibility toward future generations."" The conference said organized criminals make up to $152 billion a year on illegally cutting down tropical forests. Key rainforest countries have estimated illegal logging rates at 50 per cent to 85 per cent.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada17","Province's CleanBC climate plan to take global stage","December 8, 2018 Saturday","Canadian Government News","Canada : The Government of British Columbia has issued the following news release: George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, will introduce British Columbia&rsquo;s CleanBC plan to global climate change leaders, as part of discussions at the United Nations COP24 climate change conference in Katowice, Poland.  Our message for the international audience at COP24 is that sub-national governments like B.C. can be difference-makers in the fight against climate change, Heyman said.  We&rsquo;re there to listen to ideas and to share how our plan puts our province on the path to a cleaner, better future - with a low-carbon economy that creates opportunities for all. From Dec. 10-13, 2018, Heyman will participate in a number of panels with international government and private-sector leaders, as well as provide keynote addresses on carbon pricing and sustainable transport policy. Heyman will also receive the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Momentum for Change award, on behalf of British Columbia, for its Carbon Neutral Government Program, now in its 10th year of operation. The conference is an opportunity to connect with world leaders and share what is being done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home, as well as to learn what other nations and sub-national governments are doing to combat one of the greatest challenges facing the planet. Quick Facts: Highlights of the CleanBC plan include: By 2040, every new car sold in B.C. will be a zero-emission vehicle. Government is helping people afford cleaner cars and save money on fuel with incentive programs, and making it easier to charge or fuel them. The Province is speeding up the switch to cleaner fuels at the gas pump \- with further reductions to the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. Every new building constructed in B.C. will be  net-zero energy ready&rdquo; by 2032, meaning they will be so energy efficient they will be able to produce their own power. Along the way, government will require new buildings to become progressively more efficient through changes to the building code, and by ramping up funding for renovations and energy retrofits to existing homes and offices, including $400 million to support retrofits and upgrades for B.C.\' s stock of publicly funded housing. Government is helping B.C. to reduce residential and industrial organic waste, turning it into a clean resource. The Province is helping industry lower its emissions and reduce its pollution by reinvesting some of the carbon tax paid by industry in technologies that reduce their emissions.

Since then, Greta Thunberg has inspired tens of thousands of kids around the world to leave class and protest outside their own government buildings to highlight the looming climate change calamity with her Fridays for Future movement. She has also addressed world leaders at a United Nations Climate Change Conference If she can accomplish all that in mere months, then perhaps the world should listen to Thunberg. That is especially true today when students inspired by her doggedness are planning to skip school in 1,659 towns and cities in 105 countries in the world to demand action from their governments on climate change. Indeed. There is no time to waste. In October, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has only about a dozen years to take measures to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5 C to prevent a catastrophe of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people, not to mention the extinction of species like coral and pollinating insects. Yet around the world, people continue to elect climate change-deniers such as Donald Trump. Closer to home, Ontario voters turfed a Liberal government that had brought in a greener, coal-free electrical grid in favour of a PC one that axed its carbon-fighting cap-and-trade program. No wonder the kids are rebelling. In fact, Amnesty International has warned that the failure of governments to tackle the climate change crisis amounts to ""one of the greatest intergenerational human rights violations in history."" As one of the three Norwegian politicians who nominated Thunberg for the Nobel prize put it: ""If we do nothing to halt climate change, it will be the cause of wars, conflict and refugees."" That's not new information. But perhaps it took hearing it from a 16-year-old to make it sink in. We can only hope so. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada20","Hanes: Premier Legault must reconsider skipping COP climate forum","October 30, 2018 Tuesday","Postmedia Breaking News","Fran\'e7ois Legault is without a doubt a busy guy. He's just been sworn in as premier of Quebec, is leading a party that has never governed before, has a brand new cabinet cramming to get up to speed on their dossiers, and is in a hurry to recall the National Assembly for a brief spell before Christmas to kick off his ambitious legislative agenda. So blowing off an international conference at this jam-packed juncture wouldn't be such a big deal - if the focus of said conference wasn't the fundamental challenge facing Quebec, Canada, the world and indeed all of humanity in the coming years. Legault has decided to skip the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/index.php/event/ HYPERLINK cop-24 ) in Poland Dec. 3 to 14 and dispatch Environment Minister MarieChantal Chass\'e9 instead. For a premier who wants to see Quebec assume its due place in Canada as well as internationally, this important summit would seem like a can't-miss event. His predecessors, Philippe Couillard and Jean Charest, both made a point of showing up at past editions of COP, as the summit of world leaders is commonly known. They ensured Quebec was part of the dialogue, particularly when Canada couldn't even be bothered to go under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. For a political leader who admits the environment isn't his strong suit, but who has indicated he wants to make the fight against climate change a priority, attending COP24 would be a perfect time to turn good intentions into action. It would also be an opportunity to ascend the steep learning curve of scientific data and bureaucratic language that often shroud efforts to reduce global emissions as well as exchange with experts on the best practices and strike partnerships with allies. It's not that Chass\'e9 can't do any of this, but there would be more gravitas if the premier were galvanized in the effort. Declining to participate is a missed opportunity for Legault. But more than that, it's a sign that he's not recognizing the urgency of facing climate change despite the litany of alarms blaring dire warnings.

Scientists say climate change and natural resource exploitation are two of the factors causing precipitous decline in the numbers of these iconic creatures. Many caribou roam northern Quebec.

These should serve as harbingers of a disastrous future that we do everything in our power to avoid. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change( HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html ), the main UN scientific body, found the most serious consequences will occur sooner and at a lower threshold than previously foreseen. Drought, famine, flooding, fires, food shortages and heat waves could be here by 2040 or sooner. There is still a decade left to change course, but there is no time to waste. Every city, province, state and country must do its part. Quebec is part of a cap-and-trade market. It has abundant hydro power, which is not without its environmental impact, but is less damaging than burning coal. But our major source of emissions, which continues to climb, is transportation. The timing of COP24 , a few days after the National Assembly is reconvened for two weeks on Nov. 27, could not be more inconvenient for Legault, that is for sure. In that past - in normal times - staying home to focus on domestic business would make perfect sense. But as we speed toward a grim future, as we near a point of no return, Quebec's contribution to a larger effort must be part of every initiative and action. We can make climate change our priority while there is still time to do something about it. Or it will put itself first soon enough when we are forced to grapple with its devastation taking all our time, energy and resources. But by then it will be too late. Legault should revisit his decision not to go to Poland and get used to this unavoidable reality. It must be climate first and foremost, from now on.

The house is being recalled for two weeks starting Nov. 27 for an inaugural address from the new Coalition Avenir Qu\'e9bec government and the tabling of a few key pieces of legislation. At the swearing-in of his new government Oct. 18, Legault promised to do more to fight climate change. Interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand said Legault is not living up to his promises. ""He had a chance to prove (his commitment) by participating in COP24 ,"" Arcand tweeted. ""His refusal to participate is concrete proof of his disinterest in the battle against climate change."" There was a similar reaction from Qu\'e9bec solidaire environment critic Ruba Ghazal. ""Urgent action (on climate change) is needed and we are anxious to see the government assume responsibility for this issue,"" Ghasal said in a statement. HYPERLINK pauthier@postmedia.com \"

If she can accomplish all that in mere months, then perhaps the world should listen to Thunberg.That is especially true today when students inspired by her doggedness are planning to skip school in <a href="" \~ HYPERLINK https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/events/map https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/events/map "">1,659 </a>towns and <a href="" \~ HYPERLINK https://www.facebook.com/events/304570563750133/ https://www.facebook.com/events/304570563750133/ "">cities</a> in 105 countries in the world to demand action from their governments on climate change. After all, as she so starkly puts it: ""Why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more?"" Indeed. There is no time to waste. In October, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has only about a dozen years to take measures to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C to prevent a catastrophe of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people, not to mention the extinction of species like coral and pollinating insects. Yet around the world people continue to elect climate change-deniers such as Donald Trump. Closer to home, Ontario voters turfed a Liberal government that had brought in a greener, coal-free electrical grid in favour of a PC one that axed its carbon-fighting cap-and-trade program. No wonder the kids are rebelling. In fact, Amnesty International has warned that the failure of governments to tackle the climate change crisis amounts to ""one of the greatest intergenerational human rights violations in history."" As one of the three Norwegian politicians who nominated Thunberg for the Nobel prize put it: ""If we do nothing to halt climate change, it will be the cause of wars, conflict and refugees."" That's not new information. But perhaps it took hearing it from a 16-year-old to make it sink in. We can only hope so. \"

Joining thousands of students around the world, Miyawata Stout, Madison Delaat and Sarah Sinclair-Fontaine - all Grade 7 students - were among Winnipeg's contingent of youths asking for urgent changes as part of COP24 Climate Strike with Greta. The global movement was started by 15-year-old Swede Greta Thunberg, who fed up with her country's lacking of action on climate change, stopped going to school in August to instead sit outside Sweden's parliament in protest. ""It's not just us that's being affected,"" Stout said. ""It's the animals, the Earth surrounding us. I've always just found it selfish, people drinking out of straws or the need for plastic bags. It's become the norm to see trash on the ground. We see it all the time at (school)."" Some 20,000 students in 270 towns and cities across the world have participated in solidarity with Thunburg, who was invited to COP24 climate negotiations in Poland. Carr wasn't at his office during the protest, but Delaat feels the students' message got across. ""Our school was very accepting of it, cars were honking at us and giving us the thumbs up,"" Delaat said. ""Also, we had a megaphone, so that helped. It was very inspiring."" Sinclair-Fontaine said the work didn't end with the megaphone being turned off. ""We decided that we want to keep going with this,"" she said. ""We've made a club and we're meeting every Tuesday. I think, as students, it's important for us to keep on going with this so that adults can realize that we're destroying Earth."" \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada24","Climate deal still breathing","December 17, 2018 Monday","Winnipeg Sun","Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them. But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year - a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists'warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade. ""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the UN Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened. While each country would likely find some parts of the agreement it did not like, he said, efforts were made to balance the interests of all parties. The talks took place against a backdrop of growing concern among scientists that global warming is proceeding faster than governments are responding to it. Last month, a study found that global warming will worsen disasters such as the deadly California wildfires and the powerful hurricanes that have hit the United States this year. The recent report by the IPCC concluded that while it's possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, doing so would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Sun Media Corporation.

They are vocal in their concern about climate change. But like Trump, they are unwilling to undertake any action that might sacrifice jobs and the economy. A report this week from two environmental groups calculates that rising emissions from oil and gas production won't allow Canada to meet its global target. It estimates that if Canada wants to reach that target without affecting oil and gas, the rest of the country would have to cut emissions almost in half. This would be the equivalent of taking all vehicles off the road, shutting down all manufacturing and eliminating all greenhouse gases from non-petroleum industries.

These mobilized companies are paving the way to continue this vast regional campaign entitled ""Here, we're taking action for the climate! "" The $60,000 funding obtained by the CREE under the Action-Climat Qu\'e9bec program, funded by the Green Fund and implemented by the FAQDD, was able to raise awareness for almost 400 representatives of organizations in the region of the impacts of climate change and the importance of taking action. Through conferences and workshops on the theme ""Understanding and responding to climate change in the Estrie region"", these change agents were invited to act on sustainable rainwater management, the electrification of transportation and active transportation, eco-responsible practices in companies, and the energy efficiency of buildings. At the heart of this original approach, experienced experts have accompanied industries, businesses and institutions (ICI) in the region ready to act in the fight against climate change. The CREE, ADDERE Consulting Service, the Quebec Association for Energy Management (AQME), COGESAF, COBARIC and the MRC du Granit have offered their expertise to ICI by identifying their needs and providing them with the tools they need to move to action. Several measures have already been implemented as a result, such as the purchase of an electric vehicle by JL Expertise, the conversion of lighting and windows by the Sherbrooke Community Development Corporation, the organization of a bike-to-work campaign by the firm EXP, and obtaining the ICI recycle level 3 certificate by Horizon Notaires. The number of municipal councils that support the Universal Declaration of Citizens with a Climate Emergency is multiplying in Quebec (more than 150 municipalities) and the number of signatories to the Transition Pact exceeds 250,000 people. It is clear that citizen mobilization for the climate is being organized. At the same time, at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), leaders and representatives of 196 countries and states are expected to establish guidelines that will enable them to meet the commitments made at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), that is to the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming to below 2 \'b0 C. Any action undertaken, be it citizen, political or economic, is likely to contribute positively to the fight against climate change. The results of the ICI campaign show how climate can work for the climate and bring long-term positive benefits for an organization in all spheres of development. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 The Record (Sherbrooke) \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada30","Brazilian activists say Amazon deforestation is already growing","December 8, 2018 Saturday","The Times & Transcript (New Brunswick)","SAO PAULO ? Loggers in the Amazon are not waiting for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's right-wing president-elect, to take office Jan. 1 to expand their footprint in the Amazon jungle. The rate of deforestation in the Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, leaped 50 per cent from August through October as Bolsonaro emerged as a favourite in the country's presidential election, according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, which keeps tabs on the destruction of the rain forest through satellite images. Bolsonaro rode a populist wave of disgust with Brazil's traditional political parties to a presidential victory in October, waving off concerns about the environment with speeches about economic development in the rain forest. The former army captain has promised to reap the Amazon's riches for Brazil and suggested that he would cut back on indigenous rights. He criticized the government's environmental protection agency as an ""industry of fines."" That talk has quickly translated to action. Brazil withdrew its offer to host a 2019 United Nations climate-change conference , and Bolsonaro has threatened to pull Brazil out of the Paris accord on climate change. He has also pondered placing the environmental ministry under the ministry of agriculture, a department critics say is swayed by Brazil's powerful farm lobby, historically opposed to indigenous rights. As his foreign minister, Bolsonaro has tapped Ernesto Araujo, a Trump-loving diplomat who wrote in an October blog post that climate change is a ""dogma"" that serves to stymie democratic capitalist countries. ""Environmental politics can't muddle with Brazil's development,"" Bolsonaro said last week. ""Today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions."" Activists are learning that when it comes to the Amazon, the president's talk is not cheap. Even before he can implement these policies, Bolsonaro's statements are having an effect. During the last few months of the campaign, the Amazon lost 600 square miles of forest - an area two times the size of New York City. Some areas of the jungle saw deforestation rates nearly triple during the last few months of the campaign, compared with this time last year. Logging is an expensive and risky business. Because the forest is so dense, it can cost tens of millions of dollars to bring the labour and equipment necessary to cut down a few hectares of lucrative lumber in the Amazon. Brazil's illegal loggers pay close attention to developments in Brasilia before investing in deforestation projects that can be thwarted by authorities. They have interpreted Bolsonaro's statements as a green light to start chopping, according to Greenpeace. ""We measure deforestation through satellite images from the Amazon, but if we had a satellite measuring the cause of that deforestation, it would be pointed at Brasilia,"" said Marcio Astrini, a public policy coordinator at Greenpeace. Deforestation rates hit a 10-year high last year and are expected to drastically expand under a Bolsonaro administration, according to analysts. Deforestation is considered the second-largest contributor to climate change, after fossil fuel use, accounting for about 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Forests act as sponges for carbon dioxide, soaking it up and converting it into plant material. When trees are cut down or burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. ""When we are talking about illegal logging, the message is often more important than the law,"" Astrini said. ""And the message that is being sent is that deforestation is permitted."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Times &; Transcript (Moncton) \"

Alberta's New Democratic government has pledged to buy a fleet of rail tank cars to transport bitumen. The NDP minority government in B.C. wants to offer tax breaks to developers of a giant liquified natural gas project. Unlike the Trump administration, all three governments are considered progressive. They are vocal in their concern about climate change. But like Trump, they are unwilling to undertake any action that might sacrifice jobs and the economy. A report this week from two environmental groups calculates that rising emissions from oil and gas production won't allow Canada to meet its global target. The report by two lobby groups - Environmental Defence and Stand Earth - estimates that if Canada wants to reach that target without affecting oil and gas, the rest of the country would have to cut emissions almost in half. The authors say this would be the equivalent of taking all vehicles off the road, shutting down all manufacturing and eliminating all greenhouse gases from nonpetroleum industries. In short, it is something no government would do. Similarly and regardless of climate change, no government would be willing to leave Alberta's bitumen in the ground. The political costs would be too high. In that sense, we are all Trumpians. Saving the planet is a fine idea. But not if it costs us. Thomas Walkom writes for the Toronto Star.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada33","Comment on 'White Pines Cancellation'letters","December 13, 2018 Thursday","Picton County Weekly News","The subject article evoked a couple of letters from the £nti-wind'side of the debate. John Hirsch started with, ""Health"", stating 'Wind turbines also cause serious health effects in humans, even with the legal setbacks required'. Wind Concerns Ontario has helped bring to light thousands of noise complaints to the Ministry of the Environment and never acted upon;"" Indeed: Wind Concerns Ontario have certainly provided many complaints. These were dealt with locally at a Tribunal in 2010. No credible evidence was produced. After years of study, the ""Climate and Health Alliance"" state that: ""To date, there is no credible peer reviewed scientific evidence that demonstrates a direct causal link between wind turbines and adverse health impacts in people living in proximity to them."" HYPERLINK https://tinyurl.com/y85qdma7 https://tinyurl.com/y85qdma7 Mr. Hirsch then spoke of harm to birds, turtles, etc. Indeed. All human-activity takes a toll on wildlife. But he failed to mention the same applies to; farming, cars and of new home development that demands more and more energy from the Ontario grid. We all love locally produced food and wine, so why not locally produced pollution free energy? Mr. Hirsch's second point suggests that wind energy may be sold at a loss at night when energy demand is low. A point not mentioned is that the Ontario Energy grid (the grid) consists of the inflexible nuclear energy generators with their relatively consistent output at 10+MW of power, along with the hydro and gas generators. And on a very windy night, wind may produce 10 per cent of the roughly 11 to 15 MW total energy output. The nuclear stations produce 10+MW of power 24/7 -needed or not. HYPERLINK http://www.sygration.com/gendata/today.html http://www.sygration.com/gendata/today.html . His third point has some merit. He speaks about the energy costs of integrating the changing wind energy into the grid by using gas-driven generators to act as a buffer so that total generation capacity matches the instantaneously load on the grid. To prove his point he kindly refers to a great report by the 'Ontario Society of Professional Engineers'(OSPE) HYPERLINK https://tinyurl.com/ybjg5ysb https://tinyurl.com/ybjg5ysb The executive summary recommends that the 'Ministry of Energy'needs to improve the way wind energy is integrated into the grid; possibly by developing new storage, such as hydrogen generation, and also to, ""AuthorizeOPG to adjust the FIT rates and annual maximum capacity additions in each category to an affordable level that will sustain the new green energy sectors.'So it is not 'wind energy'that is the problem, but the Ontario Power Generating organization simply have not kept up with the best ways of dealing with it. Mr. Hirsch says, ""So wind energy in Ontario's system just doesn't make sense.'Well Mr. Hirsch, it makes sense to the engineers of OSPE and to anyone else that is familiar with the importance of energy in society: And it makes sense to a 12-year-old girl from Sudbury who is spearheading the Canadian branch of the growing youth-movement intent of forcing governments into action!

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada34","Smith: Let's celebrate that Canada is likely a 'net zero' polluter","January 11, 2019 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","I was reading through quotes from former prime minister Pierre Trudeau to see if I could get some clue as to why his son appears to be sleepwalking into a national unity crisis. One of the quotes described our current national unity problem well: ""Canada will be a strong country when Canadians of all provinces feel at home in all parts of the country, and when they feel that all Canada belongs to them."" Increasingly, Albertans do not feel at home in Canada or that Canada belongs to us. If I were to pinpoint the one issue that has driven the biggest wedge, it is the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. I've been watching the climate change debate become increasingly extreme since Canada first signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The practice of our political leaders has been to sign an agreement with overly aggressive targets, fail to achieve them, then sign onto even more aggressive targets. The Paris Accord marked peak absurdity, where the government agreed to reduce our emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Since signing the Paris Accord, the rhetoric has become even more alarming with environmentalists claiming we actually need to reduce emissions to 80 per cent below 2005 levels by 2050, and others saying we need to be off fossil fuels completely within 10 years if we are to survive. The extremists may believe it, but no one else does. No one is switching en masse to wind and solar to heat and power their homes - these two sources continue to make up less than three per cen( HYPERLINK https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/renewable-energy/20069#L7 https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/renewable-energy/20069#L7 )t of the grid. No one is dumping their combustion engine car for electric - of the 25 million cars registered in Canada, only 100,000( \~ HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/electric-car-sales-soaring-but-canada-still-nowhere-near-goal-set-in-2009 )of them are electric. Consumers clearly don't believe the predictions of catastrophe. Why would they? More than 22,000( https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-countries-sent-most-delegates-cop24 https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-countries-sent-most-delegates- HYPERLINK cop24 )delegates flew to Poland for the latest COP 24 meeting. If environmentalists were genuinely worried about impending doom, they'd start having their meetings on FaceTime. What is really happening is Alberta's energy industry is a convenient scapegoat, and we've just sat back and taken a pummelling without even trying to fight back. When the LEAP Manifesto( HYPERLINK https://leapmanifesto.org/en/the-leap-manifesto/ https://leapmanifesto.org/en/the-leap-manifesto/ ) was first launched - which declared that the only way to save the planet was to stop building energy infrastructure - no one in the industry took it seriously. Yet we are living it today. Northern Gateway was cancelled without a peep. Energy East was pulled with the federal government characterizing it as just a ""business decision."" Whether it is Trans Mountain, Keystone XL, Line 3 or now, the Coastal GasLink pipeline, Canada can't get anything built. The LEAPers have won. There is no other nation that is destroying its fossil fuel industry in order to meet unachievable emissions reduction targets. Other jurisdictions, notably the European Union( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6543_en.htm http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-6543_en.htm ), have said they are going to be ""net zero"" by 2050. We should make that our objective too. What does it mean? Well, rather than absurdly trying to reduce emissions from 700 megatonnes down to 200 megatonnes by 2050, we would develop strategies to capture or offset 700 megatonnes and declare Canada carbon neutral. Ecowatch( HYPERLINK https://www.ecowatch.com/carbon-sequestration-2461971411.html https://www.ecowatch.com/carbon-sequestration-2461971411.html )identified eight ways to sequester carbon dioxide, including reforestation, trapping it in farmed soils, coastal plant growth, biofuels, biochar, fertilizing the ocean, capturing it in rocks, and direct air capture like the project started by Bill Gates and Murray Edwards( \~ HYPERLINK https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/chevron-occidental-buy-stake-in-carbon-capturing-firm-backed-by-bill-gates-and-murray-edwards https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/chevron-occidental-buy-stake-in-carbon-capturing-firm-backed-by-bill-gates-and-murray-edwards ). Taking just one example: Canada has one of the highest number of trees on the planet( HYPERLINK http://greenblizzard.com/2015/09/30/how-many-trees-in-the-canada/ http://greenblizzard.com/2015/09/30/how-many-trees-in-the-canada/ ) at 318 billion (8,953 trees per person) compared to 139 billion in China (102 trees per person). A tree can sequester up to 23 kilograms of CO2 a year and one tonne over its lifecycle. That means one million trees sequester one megatonne, one billion trees sequester 1,000 megatonnes, and Canada's 318 billion trees sequester 318,000 megatonnes of CO2. Why don't we get any credit for that? If we are all to feel like we belong in Canada, we need a common strategy that doesn't pit one province against the other, one industry against the other, and one Canadian against the other. Canada could very well be the first net zero, carbon-neutral country. In fact, we probably already are. Let's confirm it, celebrate it, tell the world about it, and get on with building pipelines.

Poland relies on coal for almost 80 per cent of its electricity, more than double the global average, and Katowice is the heart of its industry. The city of about 300,000 people grew up around workshops and mills fuelled by the coal deposits abundant in the ground. At the International Congress Centre in Katowice, where thousands of environment leaders and representatives from almost every country in the world are meeting for at least two weeks, you can see the smoke stacks and plumes of coal exhaust from nearby power plants. Attendees, whose mission at these talks is to set rules for monitoring countries' progress in meeting their climate-change promises, were greeted by the Polish Coal Miners Band. Displays inside the conference hall include wire baskets filled with coal. Coal jewelry and soap are for sale. The "" COP24 "" conference's main sponsors are all coal companies, including the Polish state-owned coal-mining concern and the state-owned power company. Coal is the world's dirtiest source of electricity, producing generally twice the greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas and contributing to air pollution that kills an estimated 800,000 people a year. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this year warned of the grave impacts on the planet if the world doesn't curb emissions significantly over the next decade, and to do that, suggested 60 per cent of existing coal plants must be closed by 2030. Polish President Andrzej Duda used his opening speech at the COP24 conference on Dec. 3 to declare that coal is not the enemy of climate change action. ""The use of one's own resources - in Poland's case coal - and basing energy security on them, is not in conflict with climate protection,"" he said in Polish. Poland is not on its own. The United States, with President Donald Trump's promises to make coal king again in his country, is hosting a side meeting on how fossil fuels can be used cleanly. Russia, which has yet to ratify the Paris accord on climate change, remains a huge exporter and supporter of coal. China, which is trying to close coal plants at home, nevertheless is funding them elsewhere. Since the Paris climate-change agreement was signed in 2015, more than 92,000 megawatts of new coal power has been added to the world's energy supply and more than six times that amount is planned in new or expanded coal plants. Perhaps the single biggest move to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in Canada, the closure of coal plants in Ontario between 2000 and 2014, took about 8,800 megawatts of coal power off the grid. Canada still gets about 10 per cent of its electricity from coal. Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna shrugged off naysayers as she spoke of plans to push the Powering Past Coal Alliance at this year's climate talks. The alliance says all developed nations should phase out coal-fired power plants by 2030, and the rest of the world should do it by 2050. The group includes 28 nations thus far but faces stronger opposition from coal-dominant economies each passing day. ""Some of the countries have taken different tacks, but we know that there's a huge opportunity to reduce emissions and if we're going to meet our Paris targets we all have to phase out coal,"" said McKenna in a recent interview with The Canadian Press. She said ""we are going to be working very hard at COP"" to promote the alliance. Canada plans to phase coal out by 2030, although there will likely be allowances for plants that have mechanisms to capture and store their carbon-dioxide emissions. The United Kingdom, where coal has plunged as a source of electricity thanks to government policies including a carbon tax, is to close its last coal plant in 2025. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada36","China accelerates electric vehicle strategy with investments in B.C. clean energy firms","August 30, 2018 Thursday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","Randy MacEwen has made 39 separate trips to China in less than four years - an indication of how much opportunity the British Columbia-based executive sees in that country. On Wednesday, MacEwen, who is chief executive of Burnaby-based hydrogen fuel cell maker Ballard Power Systems Inc. announced a $208 million deal that links the company's future to China's fastgrowing clean vehicle market. Under the deal, Weichai Power Co., one of China's largest diesel engine manufacturers, agreed to purchase $163 million worth of Ballard's stock at a 15 per cent premium; and to invest an additional $45 million to form a joint venture that will manufacture Ballard's fuel cells at a plant in China, where they could end up in buses, commercial trucks and forklifts. Separately, on Wednesday, Vancouver-based Westport Fuel Systems also announced a deal with Weichai, which agreed to purchase its components and license its technology to build 18,000 natural gas engines by 2023. Taken together, the deals show how China is investing in a future that envisions a shift from internal combustion energy vehicles to loweremission, clean energy vehicles. The vast scale of those investments is enticing Canadian companies to strike partnerships and form joint ventures that send their technology across the Pacific Ocean. ""We're in the very early moments of a major global transformation of the transportation industry,"" MacEwen told shareholders on a conference call on Wednesday. ""This transformation involves the move towards zero-emission vehicles."" Many Canadian mining companies, particularly those developing lithium and cobalt deposits, have been working with investors in China, Japan and South Korea, looking to source the metals for use in batteries for electric vehicles. By contrast, Ballard is designing and building fuel cells that can convert hydrogen to electricity, also for use in transportation. Such technology is better-suited for hauling heavy loads over a long range, an area where lithium-ion powered electric vehicles struggle, according to MacEwen. In an interview with the Financial Post, he said China's vast scale makes its market very appealing. MacEwen estimated China puts 400,000 new buses on its road every year, compared to around 5,000 in North America. That Weichai, which is primarily a diesel engine company, is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology, signals China's commitment to improving air quality and fighting climate change, according to MacEwen. ""Two years ago, we wouldn't have been able to engage a company like this,"" he said. Weichai has framed its deal with Westport as a way to improve air quality in China. Its chairman Tan Xuguang said Westport's technology can cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 20 per cent, according to Westport's press release. MacEwen said the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, in which countries from around the world agreed to limit carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, has also opened up new business opportunities. Now, major cities around the globe have signalled their intention to phase out internal combustion engines in their public transportation fleets. That's compelling diesel companies like Weichai to begin investing in alternatives, he said, such as his company's hydrogen fuel cell technology. Weichai's investment in Ballard at $3.54, a 15 per cent premium to the company 30-day volume weighted trading price, gives it a 19.9 per cent position and the largest stake in the company. In addition, one of Ballard's previous shareholders, Zhongsan Broad-Ocean Motor Co. Ltd, agreed to invest an additional $20 million, also at $3.54 per share, to maintain its 9.9 per cent stake. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2018. Weichai, which is 19 per cent owned by Shandong province, and also listed on the Hong Kong and Shenzen stock exchanges, also separately announced on Wednesday it has agreed to supply 2,000 fuel cells for commercial vehicles in China by 2021. Ballard said it is hoping to supply some part or all of that order. ""China will be the largest hydrogen fuel cell market starting this year going forward,"" said MacEwen. Ballard Power was up 19.6 per cent to $4.52 per share and Westport rose 18.8 per cent to $4.44 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. HYPERLINK mailto:gfriedman@nationalpost.com gfriedman@nationalpost.com \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada39","NB Power has become a clean energy leader","April 13, 2019 Saturday","The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)","As a runner, I know how hard it is to train for a race. Imagine training for a marathon for many years. You work out, you eat the right foods, and you show unbridled commitment. You plan ahead and do everything right. Now imagine it's the day of the race and you can almost see the finish line in sight. And then someone decides to move the line - they move the finish line further down the road. In a sense, that is how NB Power feels about the carbon tax. Let me explain: In 2015, Canada and 173 other nations agreed to the Paris Accord at the United Nations Climate Change Conference . The goal? A 30 per cent reduction of 2005 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) levels by 2030. By 2017, Canada had only reduced its emissions by four per cent over 2005 levels, while New Brunswick had reduced its emissions by 24 per cent. At NB Power, our team is proud that we are doing our part to help New Brunswick and Canada meet its targets. By 2017, NB Power had already achieved more than twice the historic goal that was agreed by those nations in Paris. We did this by achieving an outstanding 68 per cent reduction over 2005 levels. We didn't achieve these outstanding results by luck. Our results came about as a result of hard work and prudent investments made on behalf of New Brunswick families and businesses. Our shareholder, the Province of New Brunswick, has also set one of the most aggressive and progressive renewable portfolio standards in the country. This standard states that by 2020, NB Power must serve at least 40 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable sources. NB Power is on track to meet this ambitious target. To achieve these results, we decommissioned fossil-fuel-fired generators. We invested significantly, but prudently, in renewable and carbon-free generation sources. We invested in smart grid and customer programs such as Energy Smart NB. And, we have done this while maintaining low and stable rates - minimizing rate increases over the past eight years (averaged slightly more than 1 per cent), and maintaining a diverse generation profile to ensure reliable power for our customers. We took these steps to build a sustainable grid for New Brunswickers and to reduce electric bills across the province through the efficient and smart use of electricity. Some key milestones on our mission to decarbonize New Brunswick's electric system are ? adding 311 megawatts of wind energy across New Brunswick starting in 2007, for a reduction of 600,000 tonnes of GHG emissions per year ? decommissioning the coal-fired facility at Grand Lake in 2010, for a reduction of 400,000 tonnes of GHG per year ? decommissioning the fossil-fuel-fired facility at Dalhousie in 2012, for a reduction of 1.9 million\~tonnes of GHG emissions per year ? refurbishing the world's first CANDU-6 nuclear reactor in 2012, for a continued reduction of 4 million\~tonnes of GHG emissions per year ? completing a series of requests for approximately 80 megawatts of new community-based wind energy in 2017, for an anticipated reduction of up to 200,000 tonnes of GHG emissions per year Looking forward, we have completed extensive public consultations and studied the Mactaquac Life Achievement Project. If pursued, it would continue to save up to 1.3 million tonnes of GHG emissions per year. On behalf of our customers, we are also working hard to develop the smart grid of the future through our Energy Smart NB program. It is anticipated that by 2042 this program will see a further reduction of up to 1.1 million tonnes of GHG emissions per year. That's 9.5 million tonnes of GHG emissions per year - the equivalent of 2.5 million cars coming off the roads. We are also pursuing alternative fuels for producing electricity by partnering with an innovative firm that is developing the use of hydrogen, an abundant and GHG-free fuel that could revolutionize the energy industry. Also noteworthy is our work in advancing nuclear energy, another type of carbon-free electrical generation, with the pursuit of small modular nuclear reactors. This work will make New Brunswick a world-wide centre of excellence in the research, development, and potential demonstration in the next generation of safe and efficient nuclear energy. We have made great progress. At NB Power, our team knows we have more work to do to further reduce our carbon footprint.\~On behalf of our customers, we are committed to achieving further reductions for future generations through an economically sustainable approach.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada40","Canadians divided on environment","January 10, 2019 Thursday","Prince George Citizen (British Columbia)","Last month, about 200 governments around the world agreed to set newer targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland. The actions of the Canadian government have been met, in the political spectrum, in the same manner as in previous years and under different administrations: it's either too much or too little, depending on who you voted for. Environmental policy was one of the cornerstones of the Liberal campaign in 2015. An ability to connect with disenchanted centre-left voters in urban centres allowed the party to win a majority, one that included their best performance in British Columbia since 1968. It is too early to tell how these voters will react this year. They may be dissatisfied with specific decisions taken under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's watch, including the approval (and later, purchase) of the Trans Mountain pipeline. The fate of the governing party will revolve around reconnecting with these voters who wanted a change in Ottawa. Last month, Research Co. asked Canadians about their views on environmental issues, economic development and government performance. The results point to a voting public that has already taken sides and one that may not be swayed by policy proposals. Across the country, three in five Canadians (60 per cent) think global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities. A significantly smaller proportion of Canadians (15 per cent) think global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by natural changes. Almost one-in-five (18 per cent) say global warming is a theory that has not yet been proven. Canadians aged 18 to 34 (68 per cent), Quebecers (also 68 per cent) and British Columbians (64 per cent) are significantly more likely to say that climate change is caused by man. These demographics are essential for the success of the Liberal Party in 2019. Younger voters may feel less inclined to vote for New Democrats or Greens in their riding if they believe the incumbent government is taking proper action on climate change. While the number of Canadians who do believe climate change is an unproven theory is small, the proportion reaches 23 per cent in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 22 per cent in Ontario and 21 per cent in Alberta. Three of these four provinces are currently governed by premiers who have opposed the federal government's carbon tax. The other - Alberta - implemented its own carbon tax a few years ago. The path to victory for the Liberal Party may not include the Prairies, where they won just 12 seats in 2015 (compared to 44 for the Conservatives), but Ontario is essential in any calculation that keeps Trudeau in power. Campaigning with Kathleen Wynne will be very different from campaigning against Doug Ford. Canadians, as a whole, are feeling positive about the economy, in spite of the usual threats (such as oil prices) and some unusual ones (Donald Trump in the White House). This feeling has not affected the views of Canadians on environmental stewardship. When asked to choose between protecting the environment, even at the risk of hampering economic growth, or fostering economic growth, even at the risk of damaging the environment, Canadians prefer the former by a 3-to-1 margin (66 per cent to 22 per cent). As expected, the environment is paramount for Quebecers (76 per cent) and British Columbians (67 per cent). Still, there are two groups that go way above the Canadian average on believing that economic growth is more important than environmental protection: Albertans (34 per cent) and Conservative voters in the 2015 federal election (40 per cent). These are not voters that will be influenced by discussions on climate change. The last layer of analysis is government performance. Half of Canadians (49 per cent) say the government is paying the right amount of attention to the environment - including 59 per cent of Liberal voters from 2015. The few Canadians who believe climate change is a theory were not primarily Liberal voters four years ago and show little signs of moving now. However, there is an inherent danger for the Liberals if younger voters decide that the environment will be their key issue this year. If they move to the New Democrats or the Greens, they may decide the size and colour of the next government. Mario Canseco is president of Research Co. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada41","At the French Ambassador to Canada's residence, Go&;#151;t de France celebrations made stars of sustainable seafood","March 22, 2019 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","It's not every day that you're served tacos on a silver plate with a flute of champagne to wash down that tasty treat. But then, it's not every day that you're invited to the residence of Kareen Rispal, French Ambassador to Canada, for dinner. Chef Ned Bell's Nordic shrimp tacos, which were served at the 2019 Gout de France / Good France dinner at the residence of the French Ambassador to Canada. On Thursday night, we were about almost 50 guests at the ambassador's residence on Sussex Drive, where those tacos, brimming with luscious, perfectly seasoned Nordic shrimp, were a prelude to the annual Go&;#151;t de France / Good France dinner, the Ottawa manifestation of a global initiative to celebrate French gastronomy. Granted, tacos are the not the first delicacy that springs to mind when you think of French fare. But the ambassador's dinner had an additional purpose, which was to raise funds for the sustainable seafood program of the not-for-profit organization Ocean Wise. One of the talented chefs cooking at the residence was Ocean Wise executive chef Ned Bell, and those tacos were his creations. Frankly, it was a challenge to turn down seconds and thirds of them, but we knew that once we would be seated in the embassy's dining room, there would be more delicious and well-intentioned food to come from the kitchen brigade that included Bell, the ambassador's chef, Laurent Provence, and a team from Le Cordon Bleu Ottawa. The Go&;#151;t de France / Good France project launched in 2015 and in past years it was not always yoked to good causes. But this year, the French-style meals served at hundreds of participating restaurants in more than 150 countries across five continents, including 24 Canadian restaurants from Vancouver to Moncton, were to be ""socially responsible... using less fat, sugar and salt, respectful of our planet and healthy eating,"" according to press release. Indeed, Rispal, speaking at the podium before dinner was served, noted that her embassy's support of Ocean Wise was in line with the aspirations of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The dinner, Rispal said, would reflect ""the fight that France, along with Canada, has taken on behalf of the environment."" The dinner's savoury courses also reflected the culinary influence of Provence, France's glorious southeastern region bordering Italy. First came (chef) Provence's eucalyptus-smoked sturgeon with saffron aioli and pieces of a miniature fougasse, the esteemed proven\'e7al bread. Smoked sturgeon with saffron aioli and fougasse, served at the French Ambassador's residence at the 2019 Go&;#151;t de France dinner Bell followed up with sumptuous fillets of wild Coho salmon, which sat on a bed of green beans, cherry tomatoes and olives that evoked the classic Ni\'e7oise salad. Salmon and Ni\'e7oise salad, served at the 2019 Go&;#151;t de France dinner at the residence of the French Ambassdor to Canada Bell too had his turn at the podium. The chef was an articulate and passionate advocate for sustainable seafood, remind people that in 2014 he cycled across Canada to raise awareness for the cause and that last year he released his first cookbook, Lure, which is devoted to sustainable seafood. ""We have one ocean it's the lungs of our planet,"" Bell said, before urging the ambassador's guests to and to question their purveyors of fish and seafood about sustainable options and to look for the logos of Ocean Wise and their peers when shopping as guarantees of sustainability. For my part, when I spoke briefly to Bell, I had just one question for him - how did he nail the perfect cuisson for the salmon, which had a impeccably rosy and moist interior? He told me that the fish, which in fact had been frozen and not fresh, was brought to room temperature before it went into the residence's top-notch ovens. After Bell's salmon came a cheese course that paired lovely rounds of goat cheese from the Loire Valley with something entirely new to me - crisp shards of sweet meringue studded with bits of truffle and black pepper - and a chutney of prunes, almonds from Provence and caramelized onions. cheese course at the French ambassador's 2019 Go&;#151;t de France dinner Somehow, we still had room for dessert - a chocolate-almond bar with apricot confit and grapefruit gel\'e9e, made by a team of Le Cordon Bleu faculty and students.

As the French like to say: ""Le bonheur est dans la cuisine"" - or, happiness is in the kitchen. Indeed it is.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada42","Fire, floods, and icebergs - the Earth is the new Titanic","December 27, 2018 Thursday","Niagara This Week - St. Catharines","Sir David Attenborough, the most experienced environmentalist and caring naturalist on the planet, opened the recent 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland last month with: ""The collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" Listening to The Current on CBC Radio I heard lifelong environmentalist Bill McKibben talk about his recent New Yorker article, ""The End of Nature."" As far back as 1988, world powers knew about the impending destruction of the Earth's environment by the massive amounts of carbon dioxide we were pumping into the atmosphere; 30 years ago, the unchecked burning of fossil fuels for heat, electricity and transportation was known to be a treacherous and looming global problem. In 1988, vowing to fight global warming with all the resources at his disposal, the late President George H.W. Bush said: ""We will fight the greenhouse gas effect with the White House effect."" He didn't, of course - that was just hot air. But Bush and other world leaders knew that the planet was heating up, and even then a carbon-based tax was talked about. As far back as 1977, McKibben's grandfather worked for Exxon and made an ironclad case to that oil giant's top executives about the impending catastrophe of extreme climate change. They believed him and the science it was based on - they acted immediately by hiring their own scientists to provide false reports and erroneous studies in order to undermine the whole of idea of climate change. The longer they could mislead world opinion, the longer they could profit from the sale of fossil fuels. And they hired the best befuddlers oil money could buy ... tobacco industry health deniers! They did such a good job of muddying the rising waters of global warming that even today 12 per cent of North Americans believe that the Earth's intense and unpredictable weather patterns are cyclical. An additional 12 per cent say that they just don't know the cause. OK, so let's say you're in that 24 per cent group, unconvinced that the world needs to take drastic measures to reduce the temperature of our planet, which every legitimate scientist in the world claims has a fever that will likely prove fatal. Instead, look at some first-hand, eyewitness testimonials. Look at Paradise, California, so that ... wait! You can't! That place is gone, burned to the ground by a wildfire so fast and so powerful, it was referred to as a ""fire tornado."" Once a rustic, treed city of 27,000 people, Paradise is now a heap of ashes described as ""apocalyptic."" That raging wall of wild flames destroyed 18,793 homes and buildings, killed 85 civilians, and left hundreds of residents still missing or homeless. Alberta's Fort McMurray fire forced 88,000 people from their homes. These are irrefutable statistics supported by gruesome video evidence. Not counting the devastation and flooding caused by Irma, Maria and Nate, Hurricane Harvey alone dumped 50 inches of rain on Texas and Louisiana in six days; that's more than four feet of water falling from the sky, totalling 27 trillion gallons. That's one million gallons of rainwater for every person who lives in the state of Texas! Make that 28.3 million people who wished they'd gone to bed on Aug. 17, 2017 wearing life jackets. Not a myth, but a flood of biblical proportions. Almost every recent summer is hotter than the one before it. Weather stations near the Arctic are recording 90 F temperatures. Europe is creeping up to an unheard of 49 C record. In Quebec, 70 people died in last summer's heat wave - 65 in Japan. Within a matter of months, France was hit by torrential rains, violent thunderstorms, heat waves and drought. In Holland, there's not enough rainwater to counter balance the sea water on the other side of the dikes. In Sweden - almost overnight - its highest peak, Mount Kebnekaise, became its second-highest peak after a glacier meltdown. In Greenland, an iceberg so huge is about to break up that it could create a tsunami. Snowstorms are routinely closing airports, and wildfires are more frequent. Hurricanes are more powerful and destructive, and oceans are drowning low-lying islands. All of this is happening far faster than the scientists predicted even a few years ago. I'm guessing that 24 per cent of the non-believers also cannot see the humanity and benefits of welcoming immigrants. The best U.N. scientific estimate has between 25 million and 1 billion migrants fleeing their uninhabitable homelands by 2050. They will seek higher and colder climates; how old will your kids be when the boats start running our shores? At this point, saving planet Earth would take a massive war effort of national cutbacks and personal sacrifice, but the will to fight off our inevitable demise is simply not there. Neither is the leadership, what with Trump reviving the coal industry and Trudeau building more pipelines. Instead, with our civilization in the crosshairs we dither and deny, stall and rationalize. We are doing little more than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, to make us more comfortable and distracted as we steam full speed ahead and into the abyss - but make no mistake about it, the house we call home is on fire, and your grandkids are up in the attic.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada43","A New Year's Resolution for global prosperity: Honesty","January 4, 2019 Friday","Oshawa This Week","The world concluded 2018 in a grumpy, uncertain mood. Despite warnings of dire and immediate climate change, negotiators at the United Nations' COP24 in Katowice, Poland faced continued foot-dragging by several countries; effective climate actions were mostly deferred. Here in Canada, our governments seem more intent on fighting each other than truly addressing climate change. In Oshawa, 2018 may well be remembered as the year that heralded the end of the city's more than 100-year history of auto manufacturing. Already 85 per cent of the city's auto jobs are gone, but the loss of the last 15 per cent feels especially difficult. How did we get here, and where do we go from here? Many struggle with this as we welcome the new year - a healthy dose of honesty might help. First, we need to recognize we are all in this transition to a low-carbon economy together. We will argue about the best method, but we can no longer argue about the need. This is not a 'downtown elites' vs. 'the working folk' argument. It's complicated, but it's not rocket science. In November, a group of 415 global investors representing $32 trillion in assets (some of it Canadian, including rural and elderly pensioners) called on governments around the world to do more to address climate change, including implementing actions called for in the Paris Climate Agreement. Second, social change needs leadership and pricing signals that work. I prefer Starbucks coffee, but mostly buy Tim Hortons - the $1 difference per cup adds up. Lowering prices for gasoline and electricity (and parking) might be good politics, but it is terrible economics, and increasingly, we know it is terrible for the planet and for our kids' futures. In December, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said that the business community is backing carbon pricing to ""play its part in the fight against climate change."" It wants governments to ""stop playing politics and waffling about it."" Change is hard. The auto and oilpatch workers (and their children) need a strategy and support to help with the changes. And we all need honesty. - Dan Hoornweg, PhD, is the Richard Marceau Chair and associate professor with the Faculty of Energy Systems and Nuclear Science at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada44","Shunned Tory MLA didn't quit, takes role with party leader","September 10, 2018 Monday","The Times & Transcript (New Brunswick)","He was pushed out by his own riding, a Progressive Conservative incumbent turfed in favour of a challenger. Brian Keirstead, the Tory politician who has represented Albert in the legislature for the last four years, lost\~the right to continue carrying his party's banner into the provincial election this past spring after being\~ousted in a rare nomination convention that toppled a sitting MLA. ""A lot of people would take the position of 'huh, that's it, I'm out of here, don't look for me,'"" Progressive Conservative Leader Blaine Higgs said in an interview. But Keirstead hasn't. Keirstead heads the party's advance team, tasked with being on the road earlier than anyone else in order to ensure press conference podiums are in place, crowds are standing ready, and the campaign bus has a place to park ahead of every stop. ""I can't be bitter,"" Keirstead said at a campaign stop over the weekend. ""I had a few people remind me of that after it happened. How would being bitter help anyone? It wouldn't, so I'm not. ""Of course you think about those things, but it's politics, anything can happen. If I can't contribute in one way, well maybe I can contribute in another."" About 300 party members, including Higgs, were on hand in April at a community centre in Hillsborough when Mike Holland won the nomination, cutting short Keirstead's political career even before getting to election day. He had grown to know Higgs well through the Conservative riding association of Fundy Royal, where Keirstead was president and Higgs a director on that board. ""I was obviously there at the event and went right over to him and talked to him and his family,"" Higgs said. ""It wasn't easy. It was tough. ""He's a trooper, and it was unfortunate, you know, but that's how democracy works. It's not easy, sitting MLA, there's a sensitivity there, so I commend Brian for his great attitude and he came and wanted to help."" Higgs added: ""He said 'how could I get involved, how could I help?'"" Keirstead said in a separate interview: ""Things happen for a reason, so maybe it was meant to be."" ""It's not something to ever be really disappointed with or ashamed of, it's you hold your head high because there are very few people that would ever take those initial steps in the first place,"" he said. ""I had four wonderful years."" Keirstead was the Progressive Conservative party's delegate at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, he was on the legislature's select committee on climate change and has represented the province at commonwealth parliamentary meetings. He was also following in his family's footsteps. Keirstead's great uncle, Harry Downey, was the speaker of the legislature and the Liberal MLA for Albert for more than two decades. His uncle, W. Wynn Meldrum, was education minister in the Louis J. Robichaud years. His oldest daughter, Erika, worked for former Conservative ACOA minister Rob Moore and Keirstead's youngest daughter, Zoe, was hired by Kellie Leitch, former Conservative labour and status of women minister. She also worked on former British Columbia premier Christy Clark's campaign. ""So she actually gives me advice on what to do,"" Keirstead said. A third daughter, Logan, ""is very astute politically, but just keeps telling me how crazy I am to get involved in politics,"" he added. ""Our role is to make sure that everything is in order, everything is in place, whether it's sound systems, podiums, backgrounds, weather, there are so many factors involved - just like life, thing don't always go according to what the blueprint says,"" Keirstead said. ""The worst thing is that when you get up in the morning it takes a second to remember what city you're in and what day is it."" Keirstead's ties to Higgs, his experience and loyalty, would likely see him considered for a job on the party's transition team or in the premier's office, if the Progressive Conservatives win the Sept. 24 election. But Higgs said that hasn't been discussed. ""I didn't promise him that, I haven't promised people that in any part of this process,"" Higgs said. ""But there are folks that are involved that I feel need to be part of the future of the province because they demonstrated their capability well in advance of part of this. ""This says a lot about his character. That's the kind of guy he is. He cares about the future of the province, no matter what role that is."" Keirstead himself said he's taking things a step at a time. ""I have no idea what the future is going to hold,"" he said. ""The door is wide open at this point in time. I still feel that I have an awful lot to offer. ""Right now, I'm just doing everything I can to ensure Blaine Higgs becomes the next premier of the province and go from there."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Times &; Transcript (Moncton) \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada46","John Ivison: On climate change, Conservatives and Liberals encourage the narcissism of small differences","July 30, 2018 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","Politics has always leaned heavily on social psychology but never more so than in these days of rabid polarization, where there is little interconnection between political tribes. Research published this month revealed the importance of what other people think when it comes to climate change policy differences between Republicans and Democrats. Those findings have profound implications for the debate in Canada. Social psychologists Leaf Van Boven and David Sherman conducted two surveys of more than 2,000 respondents across the United States on the issue of climate change. Their research, published in early July in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science and promoted in a New York Times op-ed last weekend, found that Republicans believed climate change is happening, threatens humans and is caused by human activity - and that reducing carbon emissions would help alleviate the problem. The findings suggested Republicans were in basic agreement with Democrats on the issue - but not on the policy solutions, which were viewed as being specific to the Democratic Party. ""This tribalism leads to political fights over differences between the parties that either do not exist or are vastly exaggerated,"" Van Boven and Sherman concluded. ""This implies that if the tables were turned - if Republican politicians proposed a climate policy - Republican voters might support it. In our research, this is exactly what we have found."" The authors say they were not totally surprised. A fundamental lesson of social psychology is that people are profoundly affected by what other people think. But it does suggest political polarization on climate change is less than might have been supposed - and that political parties in the U.S. and Canada are exaggerating the problem for their own gain, a classic case of the narcissism of small differences at work. According to a study last year by Abacus Data, only 2 per cent of Canadians dispute the climate is changing, and 68 per cent of people attribute that change to human and industrial causes. More than 85 per cent agree that the consequences of taking no action will be severe, very severe or catastrophic. Half of Canadians won't contemplate voting for a party that doesn't have a climate change plan and only 6 per cent prefer a party or candidate that ignores the issue. A sizeable number - 44 per cent - are concerned but would consider a party that didn't ""emphasize"" the issue. Even they are looking for a plan to make inroads on CO2 emissions. Climate-change activists dressed like polar bears demonstrate near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Dec.12, 2015, during a United Nations Climate Change Conference . The Abacus poll arrives at a similar conclusion as did Van Boven and Sherman - 85 per cent of Conservatives feel there is a moral responsibility to act; 67 per cent see a looming financial disaster if more is not done. All of this suggests the Conservative Party is in urgent need of a climate plan. Andrew Scheer and his front-bench team have made it clear they would love to fight an election on the question of Justin Trudeau's carbon tax. The Liberal plan is on the ropes, as provincial governments in Saskatchewan, Ontario and even New Brunswick howl about the cost. Judging by the polls, they'll be joined by a Jason Kenney-led Alberta before the next federal election. Will the federal government really impose the threatened backstop against the wishes of half the provincial governments in the country? (The federal government has said it will introduce a $10-per-tonne levy this year, rising to $50 per tonne by 2022 - roughly $0.11 per litre of gas - for those provinces that don't have their own system.) Trudeau's trump card is that he could levy the tax and then return the proceeds directly to households in the province where they were raised. But the perils facing the carbon tax do not absolve the Conservatives from coming up with a solution of their own. They may want to hammer the carbon tax, in the belief that when the debate is over taxes they win nine times out of 10. Scheer has committed to meeting Canada's Paris climate targets, however - emissions 30-per-cent below 2005 levels by 2030 - without a carbon tax. The Abacus poll and Van Boven and Sherman's findings suggest his own supporters are going to demand a policy response. Since a carbon tax and cap-and-trade are off the table, the plan is likely to centre on regulations that are likely to prove less noticeable to voters but more expensive for the economy than a revenue-neutral, market-based carbon price. Perhaps the smart thing for the Liberals to do is wait until the Conservatives show their hand, then steal the policy, as they have done with innumerable NDP ideas. John Ivison: Auditor's F35 lightning to strike twice - and this time the Liberals may get burned( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-auditors-f35-lightning-to-strike-twice-and-this-time-the-liberals-may-get-burned https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-auditors-f35-lightning-to-strike-twice-and-this-time-the-liberals-may-get-burned ) John Ivison: Canada, Mexico must hang together or Trump will ensure they hang separately( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-canada-mexico-must-hang-together-or-trump-will-ensure-they-hang-separately?video_autoplay=true https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-canada-mexico-must-hang-together-or-trump-will-ensure-they-hang-separately?video_autoplay=true ) They could claim, with some justification, that provincial opposition has made the carbon tax untenable and then adopt regulations equivalent to Scheer's suggestions. The rationale, based on Van Boven and Sherman's research, is that political disagreement was substantially reduced when it came to Republican-backed climate policies. In Canada as in the U.S., a climate change plan proposed by the right-of-centre party holds more promise for bipartisan agreement. .

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada48","Canadians must limit climate change, reap economic and health benefits","January 3, 2019 Thursday","Parry Sound North Star","COP24 , the UN international conference in Poland to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), has ended with the strong recognition by almost all the world of the need to act quickly. The urgency for action on climate change has ramped up in the past two months. The crisis has gone from ""sometime in the future"" to action required immediately to avoid catastrophe, with several major reports saying that the world has only about 10 years to make dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to avoid a catastrophe. An August article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) examined global tipping points that, once started, could fall like a row of dominoes affecting ""the Earth System for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially lead to conditions that resemble planetary states that were last seen several millions of years ago, conditions that would be inhospitable to current human societies and to many other contemporary species."" It showed that the world had only ""one to two decades"" to act aggressively before we lose total control over climate change. This was followed by the October report of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that showed that the world has only about 12 years to reduce its GHGs by 45 per cent and to zero by 2050 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Above 1.5 degrees the effects of climate change will be disastrous for the world. Bringing the problem closer to home, the prestigious Lancet health journal states in its November 2018 report that Canada experienced 7,142 deaths from exposure to human-produced air pollution from fossil fuels in 2015, resulting in a loss in economic welfare for Canadians valued at approximately $53.5 billion. This is almost three times Canada's predicted federal deficit of $19.4 billion in 2019. An August study shows that Canadians and Saudi Arabians are the worst per-capita polluters in the G20, and among the worst in the world. It also shows that Canada is not on track to meet its international agreement on GHG reductions. Finally, and this is the good news, a September report commissioned by seven countries, including Norway, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom, shows that acting aggressively to reduce greenhouse gases within the next three years will generate a $26 trillion economic global windfall, create 65 million new jobs and avoid 700,000 early deaths linked to air pollution. All these reports show that aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gases must start immediately, but the benefits from quick action enormously outweigh any temporary economic costs. Canadians must push our governments at all levels to respond quickly. Ten years to act is barely two electoral cycles. Alan Slavin is professor emeritus, physics and astronomy, at Trent University.

She will be replaced by Benoit Charette, the Member of the National Assembly for Deux-Montagnes. It's the first cabinet shuffle since Legault's cabinet was sworn in on Oct. 18. Chass\'e9 drew criticism after failing to meet with reporters to explain what she accomplished at the COP24 climate change conference in Poland and struggled to explain how she would reform Quebec's Green Fund after a report came out saying that millions of dollars in the fund is lying dormant. At the time, Legault said he was still confident Chass\'e9 had the potential. ""What she needs to learn is to not be intimidated by big journalists,"" Legault said on Dec. 21. But on Jan. 8, Legault said he had started having doubts over the previous few weeks and he believed it would be difficult for her when the legislature resumes sitting in February and that it would be better to make the change now. ""I met her yesterday and during that discussion we mutually agreed that it was better, for her and for the government, that she give up her responsibilities to someone else,"" Legault said. Legault said there were no internal problems that led to the shuffle and the switch was entirely because of issues concerning Chass\'e9's ability to communicate with people outside government. The shuffle leaves Legault's cabinet with 14 men and 12 women. Legault said gender parity remains ""an important goal, however, you can't be rigid, there could be an occasion where there are 14 women and 12 men,"" he said. He added that chose the MNA he thought was best-suited for the job. ""I think, honestly, when we look at the ministers I named, it's been a success,"" Legault said. ""But it's been a little more difficult for one minister, MarieChantal Chass\'e9.""

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada50","Conrad Black: Thirty years of climate hysterics being proven wrong over and over again","June 29, 2018 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","It is 30 years this past week that Dr. James Hansen, then well into the first of more than three decades as head of the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)-Goddard Institute for Space Studies, testified to a U.S. Senate committee that the then-current heat wave in Washington was caused by the relationship between ""the greenhouse effect and observed warming."" This was the starting gun of a mighty debate about the existence, cause and consequences of global warming. Hansen was embraced by the environmental movement, from authentic scientists like David Suzuki to well-meaning faddists like the Prince of Wales, to cynical interlopers from the defeated international left grasping at anything to debunk and confound capitalism, like Naomi Klein, to complete charlatans like former U.S. vice-president Al Gore. Dr. James Hansen sits for a portrait in his home in New York on April 12, 2018. In his testimony, Hansen described three possible courses for the world's climate, depending on public policy. Business as usual was the first case, which would accelerate carbon dioxide emissions, at the same rate of annual increase it had reached in the late 1980s, which, he said, would produce a one Celsius degree increase in the world's temperature within 30 years. The second case, which Hansen believed the most likely, was that emissions would increase at the same rate they had achieved in 1988, but not greater, which would produce a world temperature increase of seven-tenths of one Celsius degree by now. And the last case, which he preferred but for which he was not hopeful, was that carbon emissions would be reduced somewhat after 2000, which would cause a slight increase in temperature until 2000, and a stable temperature afterwards. It is the third result that has occurred: unchanged world temperatures since 2000, apart from 2015-2016; then the temperature rose slightly after a heavy El Nino, and then receded again although world carbon emissions have increased moderately. Parallel predictions were made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which forecast temperature increases twice as great as occurred in the period up to 2000, with accelerating increases in the years since, when the temperature has been flat (with the exception of the one year mentioned). Hansen also predicted exceptional warming in the Southeast and Midwest of the United States, which has not occurred either. As his predictions were battered and defied by the facts, Hansen reinforced his expressions of ecological gloom and in 2007 predicted that all Greenland's ice would melt and that ocean levels would rise by seven metres within 100 years. We have only had 11 years, but no ice has been lost by Greenland, other than what melts every summer and then forms again, and water levels have not moved appreciably. Undaunted, Professor Hansen pressed on like the Ancient Mariner, or Captain Bligh. Hurricanes and tornadoes, at least in the United States, would become stronger, a prediction repeated by the American left's favourite weatherman, Sen. Bernie Sanders. None of it has occurred, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, despite the strength of last year's hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. Climate-change activists dressed like polar bears demonstrate near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Dec.12, 2015, during a United Nations Climate Change Conference . In any event, Hansen's predictions have all bombed and he has not recanted. His polyglot and multi-motivated echo chamber, including Dr. Michael Mann and his infamous ""hockey stick"" of sharply rising temperatures, have had their noses rubbed in the fiction of increasing world temperatures throughout this new millennium. Every sane person is opposed to the pollution of the environment and there is a practically universal consensus to reduce automobile exhaust emissions, ensure industrial smoke goes through scrubbers, and that all contaminated water is thoroughly treated before being returned to nature. Every serious person agrees that we must, as a species, show extreme vigilance in exercising man's unique ability to tamper with and alter the environment. We are the stewards of the world and its environment and there are few who would dispute that until comparatively recently, we have not taken that responsibility very seriously. The Industrial Revolution had been thundering in Europe and North America for nearly a century, and in Japan for half a century, before even basic conservation, such as national parks, got its green foot in the public policy door. The Eiffel Tower is illuminated in green on Nov. 4, 2016, the date the Paris climate accord went into effect. But there is no justification whatever for the self-punitive nonsense of the Paris climate accord, where the administration of president Barack Obama committed to garrote American industry with costs of tens of billions of dollars to reduce carbon emissions, even as the world's principal offenders, China and India, and most other countries, solemnly declined to moderate their darkening of the skies and their putrefaction of the waters until their economic revolution, involving billions of people, had been completed. The lessons of all this are clear, but most of our political and academic leaders are so far over-invested in defending against something that is not happening, they continue to call for the sacrifice of others, the deindustrialization of the West, the self-imposition of a holy economic torpor so, in the post-industrial silence we can all contemplate the pristine serenity of self-impoverishment (and the joys of Chinese world domination). The United States is the first major power to reverse course on this issue; and as in most things, the West will follow. East and South Asia will address the environment after they have closed up centuries of comparative economic backwardness. Economic suicide is only tempting to those who have forgotten what pre-industrial life was like, when, as Disraeli said ""The world was for the few and for the very few.""

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada51","Canada to stiffen its emissions target by 2020; Minister concerned global politics may keep Paris deal rules at bay","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Medicine Hat News","Canada will be ready to set tougher emissions-cutting plans when the Paris climate-change agreement kicks in by the end of 2020, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna says. McKenna is heading to Poland next week for the 24th annual United Nations climate-change meeting, where the nations of the world are supposed to decide how each country will be held accountable for its promised cuts to carbon emissions. A secondary discussion at the meeting is on demands that countries set more ambitious goals. This month's meeting, known as the Conference of the Parties (or "" COP24 ""), comes two months after climate-change scientists warned the world that without significantly deeper emissions cuts, the planet is on course for irreversible and devastating climate changes. Canada, that report said in October, needs to cut emissions almost in half to do its part. Canada's current target is to cut them by about 27 per cent. McKenna has been reluctant to look at setting tougher goals when the country's climate change plan is still not strong enough to meet the weaker ones. But, she acknowledged in an interview, ""in 2020 everyone has to come back and be more ambitious,"" and she said Canada will. McKenna said before then, the standards to be set in Poland are needed to help the world take stock of its progress and and ensure that everyone is measuring and reporting by universally understood rules. That will give confidence that when a country says its targets are being met, they actually are. Writing the rule book at the meeting this month is made all the more difficult after the election of several governments that are less enthusiastic about the Paris agreement. The U.S. under President Trump is preparing to withdraw at the earliest opportunity - which is in 2020 - and the newly elected government in Brazil campaigned on a promise to do the same thing. The Brazilian government also just cancelled its plans to host the annual COP meeting in 2019. McKenna said in the current global political environment, the Paris accord might never have been reached. ""I think it would be much harder,"" she said. The Paris agreement, which every country in the world has signed, aims to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being spewed into the atmosphere enough to keep the increase in average global temperature to no more than 2 C, compared to pre-industrial times, and as close to 1.5 C as possible. The world's average temperature has already warmed up at least 1 C compared to the 19th century, and it is continuing to warm by about 0.2 C each decade. At the current rate of emissions, the planet will be 1.5 C warmer by 2052, scientists predict. After that, the impact on human health and ecosystems becomes far more problematic. \"

Organized by CCHS's Green Club, the ""Friday for the Future"" action is inspired by Swedish student Greta Thunberg, whose solo strike before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to protest government inaction on climate change has gone viral. At the December 2018, 24 th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Thunberg demanded that world leaders tell the truth about our climate crisis and present policies that are consistent with the findings of climate scientists, rather than what seems politically ""realistic."" Her Friday strike action has become global, with March 15 events planned in 54 countries (FridaysForFuture.org). Students are demanding government policies to limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change Ali Gourley, leader of CCHS'Green Club, said in a recent interview, ""It is our responsibility as young people to create a future that is sustainable; to create positive change."" The CCHS action will focus on local concerns in the Bow Valley: composting and waste management that, on a large scale, contribute to climate change. Gourlay believes that residents living near and within national parks have a special responsibility to protect them. The region has become a popular tourist destination because of its immense beauty, she says, putting pressure on wildlife and the physical environment. At the same time, ""this creates impetus for town to do more, set a higher standard of environmental sustainability, greenness. Gourley doesn't believe in being pessimistic. A small group of determined people can take on something big, she says, and last year she decided to take on something big: make CCHS more environmentally sustainable. She and colleague Isobel Hendry succeeded in securing funds to install 78 solar panels at the collegiate and the base to support a further 201 panels. Once fully built out, solar panels will provide 14% of the school's annual energy usage. Fundraising continues to complete the project, with KCP Energy donating the 10 th panel for every nine the students raise. While she is ""hesitantly optimistic"" about the future, Gourley says, ""we are going to have to deal with the inevitability of 1.5 C warming.

So, what happens next?","October 10, 2018 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","Now that the bad news has dropped, what is the world going to do? A report issued Sunday by 91 scientists painted a stark portrait of how quickly the planet is heating up and how serious the consequences are. In response, the UN secretary-general, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, warned world leaders, ""Do what science demands before it is too late."" The latest figures from the International Energy Agency don't suggest that many are listening: Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector continued to grow through 2017, with a projected rise for 2018, according to the agency. The next two months will be crucial. In December, experts and officials from around the world will gather in Katowice, Poland, for a new round of international climate negotiations. - What about the Paris Agreement? Every country agreed, nearly three years ago, to set its own targets to bring down its greenhouse gas emissions. That's the good news. The deal specifically aspired to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels. And, it was worded in such a way that countries would, over time, have to get more ambitious in their emissions reductions. That's not going well. And it's not just because the Trump administration announced its intention to pull out of that deal. The United States, history's largest polluter, is nowhere close to meeting its emissions reductions targets. Russia, one of the world's largest emitters, has not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions have grown recently, mainly because large swathes of forest were converted to farmland, and the leading contender in Brazil's presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, has suggested pulling his country out of Paris deal, too. Australia also appears unlikely to meet its targets under its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, a champion of the country's coal mining industry. Water escapes from pipework as a giant excavator operates at the open pit lignite mine, operated by RWE AG, in Hambach, Germany, on Friday, Oct. 5, 2018.

The report Sunday, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, looms over the December talks in Katowice, in the heart of Poland's coal belt. Whether and how the report shapes the content of the negotiations is being fought over. Some countries would prefer to keep the discussions limited to technical issues, like what kinds of rules should be established to implement the Paris accord. Others, led by small island countries like the Marshall Islands, want the meeting to go much further and consider tougher emissions targets. History will remember this @IPCC_CH( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/IPCC_CH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/IPCC_CH?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) report as the moment the world's leading experts alerted decision-makers to a fast-closing window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic climate change. pic.twitter.com/Dnn1dCnysY( \~ HYPERLINK https://t.co/Dnn1dCnysY https://t.co/Dnn1dCnysY ) - Dr. Hilda C.

There is wide consensus among scientists that a few big things need to happen, and many policymakers know it, too. They include switching electricity supply systems from coal, weaning cars and trucks off gasoline, and saving forests, because they're a big carbon sink. There's also wide agreement that there should be a price on pollution, in the form of a carbon tax. All of that has been on the table for quite some time. As President Emmanuel Macron of France pointed out on Twitter, ""The IPCC brings scientific proof: We have everything we need to combat climate change. But everyone has to act now!"" The #IPCC( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPCC?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPCC?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) brings scientific proof: we have everything we need to combat climate change.

There are political headwinds of various kinds. In the United States, Charles and David Koch, libertarian billionaire brothers with deep interests in the fossil fuel sector, have handsomely funded efforts to block a carbon tax. In Brazil, the powerful agribusiness lobby, buoyed by global demand for soybeans, has pushed to convert more forest land into farmland. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's carbon tax proposal faces intense pushback from the provinces. And China, as the factory of the world, keeps burning coal to feed its manufacturing sector. Kelly McParland: Climate change measures not working? Blame the activists( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/opinion/kelly-mcparland-climate-change-measures-not-working-blame-the-activists https://nationalpost.com/opinion/kelly-mcparland-climate-change-measures-not-working-blame-the-activists ) Stop using misleading images of polar bears and droughts to raise awareness of climate change, psychologists say( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/world/scientists-should-stop-using-misleading-images-of-polar-bears-and-droughts-to-raise-awareness-of-climate-change-psychologists-say https://nationalpost.com/news/world/scientists-should-stop-using-misleading-images-of-polar-bears-and-droughts-to-raise-awareness-of-climate-change-psychologists-say ) The one difference with China is that, for the sake of domestic political stability, China's leaders are eager to clean up the air. China is expected to reach peak emissions in 2050. The question is when does that political tipping point come for other countries? And does the science matter at all? ""There's a big gap between what the science requires and what governments are delivering,"" said Mohamed Adow, who follows climate change for Christian Aid, a London-based development charity. He called the IPCC report ""a game changer."" ""There's no excuse for governments anymore,"" he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada56","Rex Murphy: The art of politically expedient planning in an age of climate ague","October 26, 2018 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","Let us assume you are in St. John's, N.L., and devise a plan to go to Port aux Basques on the far side of the Island. Your vehicle is an 18-year-old beater, and gets, on a good day, 15 miles to the gallon (unleaded). Your plan calls for taxing - er borrowing a few bucks from your credulous neighbours and buying the gas for the trip from that subscription. You get 12 bucks, enough for two gallons, and that might, with a wind at your back, get you to Whitbourne, 50 miles from St. John's, a fine place - great pea soup, with dumplings at Monty's restaurant and worth the drive. But it's roughly 500 miles short of Port aux Basques. And that's it. That's your plan. You offer it as a blueprint for other trans-island travellers. Well, it is, technically, a plan. But you're never going to see Port aux Basque under this plan. Your plan is gallons short of a full tank. You've promised a marathon and delivered a sprint. The Trudeau-McKenna church of latter-day environmentalists have a plan for reducing Canada's ""carbon emissions,"" as they call them, to meet their promises from the Paris Agreement. It's an energy tax. (They call it a ""price on pollution,"" which is an absolute and devious deception.) They are not putting a price on pollution; they are putting a tax on all energy fuels. CO2 is not a pollutant - ask a plant. Ask a tree. Ask a human being during exhale. Sewage is a pollutant. It causes diseases. CO2 is a nature-produced life-giving and life-enhancing part of our planet's atmosphere. However, the Trudeau-McKenna ""plan"" is never going to get to Port aux Basques. It starts at 10 bucks a tonne, and rises to 50. (If they even get to that; half the provinces are in revolt.) According to the very latest report from the IPCC (the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) of the leading environmental shamans), for Canada to reach its promised commitments it will require a starting tax of 135 bucks a tonne and as time passes and apocalypse beckons may claim as much as 5,500 dollars a tonne. And that's in real money - U.S. dollars. We will never, ever see those rates. Even the greenest planet-saving Gaia-drunk cabinet in Canadian history will not approach the numbers really necessary to live up to their rhetoric. That way lies electoral oblivion, a fate worse than a burning planet. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signs the Paris Agreement on climate change during a ceremony at the United Nations headquarters in New York on April 22, 2016. In the terms of my delightful Trans-Canada Newfoundland analogy, the Trudeau-McKenna recipe will only get us to Whitbourne, and maybe a bowl of pea soup. The T-M plan does not even approach the IPCC commitment necessary to achieve their promised goal of meeting the Paris Agreement targets. It is a plan, yes. But it is a sham of a plan - inadequate, incomplete, shortsighted, and yet pretentious all the while. As to its measurable impact on the growth of all global emissions, this meagre, footling, sham of a plan promises less impact than a burp in a hurricane. Canada's minute calibrations toward reducing CO2 through an energy tax will be wiped out in a week by China's roaring industries. In the fantastical ambition to change the Earth's climate, Canada is not even a player. It is at best a ball boy on the court, delivering towels to the real players and scampering after fouls. As Mr. Trudeau said obligingly in Montreal recently, ""Even if Canada stopped everything tomorrow, and the other countries didn't have any solutions, it wouldn't make a big difference.""( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-truth-about-pms-carbon-tax https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-truth-about-pms-carbon-tax ) Change ""big"" to ""any"" and he's hit the truth. Canada could shut down all industry, all traffic, and we could all hold our breath for long periods at a time - and, according to the settled science of global warming, all would still be lost, and all we'd get for it is poverty and blue in the face. So what is the point of a plan that cannot meet its own, inadequate stated targets, and that on a global scale in the matter of absolute reduction of carbon-dioxide emission is nugatory, otiose and trivial? It's just a do-gooder's flare - it's Canada sending up its eco-Bat Signal, that we're on the case. In that phrase that more than any other overheats the cockles of every virtue-signalling politician's heart, ""we're doing something."" Something is a wonderful word, vague even to nullity; as the predicate of a plan of action it has all the obscurantist utility of a fog bank. It tells you nothing while deviously seeming to offer all. Climate-change activisits dressed as polar bears demonstrate near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Dec.12, 2015, during a United Nations Climate Change Conference . So the T-M plan is inadequate, useless on the global plain, and by the IPCC's trenchant standards insufficient even for Canada, let alone the world. Quote: ""Canada would have to cut its emissions almost in half over the next 12 years( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/canadas-goals-well-below-whats-needed-to-stop-catastrophic-climate-change-un https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/canadas-goals-well-below-whats-needed-to-stop-catastrophic-climate-change-un ) to meet the stiffer targets dozens of international climate-change experts say is required to prevent catastrophic results from global warming."" Which demands the inquiry: Why in the name of bishop Suzuki and in the names of all the lesser deities of Greenpeace and Salt Spring Island are we inflicting this mess on our country and our energy industry? To spike the personal depression rate in Alberta? To engineer collisions within the federation? To complete Donald Trump's successful march towards the U.S. being the world energy superpower? All these consequence actually flow from ""the plan."" The answer: So Canada can lead the world. So Canada can set a global example. Well, that's a beautiful dream to pronounce at a Liberal rally, though it is a gross immodesty far out of our presumed character as a modest, un-Trump-like nation allergic to boasts and braggadocio. But seriously, are they waiting in Beijing and brightly tailored Mumbai, in reckless Venezuela or the stricken regions of Africa and the Middle East, in cumbersome Europe or the stray islets of the vast Pacific, for Canada to raise a pretence of an effort, to make a journey to Whitbourne, for all the world to rise in unison with the cry: ""Canada is half onboard. Now, we must act."" This is the ""very dream and folly of expectation."" Canada has no plan, and no one is going to follow it.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada57","Premier confident environment minister can improve","December 22, 2018 Saturday","The Gazette (Montreal)","Premier Fran\'e7ois Legault says he still has confidence in his environment minister, MarieChantal Chass\'e9, and says she will improve over time. And Legault said despite polls showing he has high approval ratings, he plans to ""stay humble and close to the people's concerns"" in 2019. Meeting reporters following a pre-Christmas visit to the sick kids at Ste-Justine Hospital, Legault was asked if he is satisfied with the work of Chass\'e9, who has struggled to communicate the government's positions on the hot button environment issue. When Chass\'e9 returned from the COP24 climate change conference in Poland, she did not meet the media to explain what she had accomplished. Earlier this week, she struggled to explain what she will do to the province's Green Fund following a report saying the money was being badly managed. ""In general, I am satisfied with all the ministers,"" Legault said. ""It's normal for some of them to be still working at mastering their files. ""I'm confident she has the potential. Mme. Chass\'e9 is an engineer, was successful in business and understands environmental issues. What she needs to learn is to not be intimidated by big journalists."" Legault said he knew he was taking a risk, however, when he recalled the National Assembly for a brief two-week pre-Christmas sitting because most of the cabinet ministers were untested and could have used more time away from the spotlight to learn the ropes. Chass\'e9's difficulties have not gone unnoticed by the opposition. Interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand said this week that while he recognizes ministers such as Chass\'e9 need time to learn, she has been handed a complex subject to manage and will have to do better. ""I think Mme. Chass\'e9 will have to make a quick recovery in 2019,"" Arcand said. But Legault will have other problems to deal with in the new year, including skepticism over his Coalition Avenir Qu\'e9bec government's plans to replace the nine anglophone school boards with nine anglophone service centres. His education minister, Jean-Fran\'e7ois Roberge, has given mixed signals on how the new structure will work. At the same time, both the francophone and anglophone boards have said they are opposed to the CAQ plan. He was also asked about the challenges he faces in managing voter expectations. On Thursday, the Angus Reid Institute revealed Legault's approval rating among Quebecers is about 60 per cent. ""I'm not taking anything for granted,"" Legault said. ""I know the confidence of the people is a fragile thing. They (voters) want to see some change. We made promises and we'll respect those challenges. He then cracked a joke about the Montreal Gazette. ""My challenge is to manage people at the Gazette because I see that the articles (on the CAQ government) are not very positive,"" Legault said. He had no specific examples to offer. HYPERLINK mailto:pauthier@postmedia.com pauthier@postmedia.com \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada58","Can humanity really win the global warming fight?","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Cornwall Standard Freeholder","""Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made,"" wrote Immanuel Kant in 1784. It is still true. On Sunday, the 24th Conference of the Parties - the 180 countries that signed the 2015 Paris climate change treaty - opened in Katowice, Poland. Warsaw presumably chose the venue, home to Europe's biggest coal company, in a thinly disguised show of defiance. It's not just Donald Trump who loves coal. It's the worst of the fossil fuels in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, but Poland gets 75 per cent of its electricity by burning coal and has no intention of changing. In fact, shortly before COP24 opened, Poland announced plans to invest in a large new coal-mine in Silesia. That same day, 1,500 km west in Paris, municipal workers were cleaning up after the third and most violent weekend of protests - the biggest in decades - against French President Emmanuel Macron. And what were the demonstrators (dubbed ""gilets jaunes"" after the fluorescent yellow vests French drivers must keep in their vehicles) protesting? In Paris and other cities, they built barricades, torched cars, banks and homes because Macron's government has raised the tax on diesel fuel by 6.5 cents a litre. This was on top of a 7.9 cents-a-litre jump earlier this year. Most French vehicles run on diesel, but the reaction does look a bit excessive. That Macron justified it as a ""green"" tax meant to cut fuel use only seemed to make protesters angrier. And, at least until Saturday's extreme violence, most French people supported them. Poles clinging to coal despite the coal smoke that envelops Polish cities in winter and kills thousands a year, and ordinary people in France rioting for the right to go on burning cheap diesel in their cars despite a comparable death toll from atmospheric pollution there, suggest the quest to cut greenhouse gas emissions before global warming goes runaway faces even greater resistance than experts feared. Bear in mind that Poland and France are relatively well-educated countries that belong to the European Union, the world leader in commitment to emission cuts. Neither country has the kind of climate-change denial industry, lavishly funded by fossil-fuel producers, that muddies the waters and spreads doubt about the scientific evidence in the U.S. Neither the Poles nor the French are in denial. And yet ... Now, it's true Poles have a large collective chip on their shoulder for historical reasons - their country was erased from the map for more than a century - so they often respond badly to being lectured by well-meaning foreigners. It's also true that President Macron is arrogant and has a tin ear for public opinion. But neither nationalist resentment nor clumsy political leadership are in short supply worldwide. Bear in mind also that the emission cuts promised in the 2015 accord won't kick in until 2020: we have a mountain to climb and we are not even in the foothills yet. Much bigger sacrifices than a few cents extra on diesel prices or an end to burning coal will be required before this process ends, if it ever does. The question is: can we really expect the relatively large (but still inadequate) greenhouse gas emission cuts promised in Paris in 2015 to ever win the public support necessary to make them happen? If not, our current global civilisation is doomed. If you were designing a species capable of making this hard transition, you'd certainly prefer to start with one that was wiser, more co-operative and less excitable than ourselves. Something a little less crooked, at least. But this is the timber we have to work with. Good luck.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada60","Bangkok meet fails to finalize draft on climate change rules; Bangkok meet fails to finalize draft on climate change rules","September 9, 2018 Sunday 10:22 AM EST","Canadian Press","BANGKOK - An international meeting in Bangkok fell short of its aim of completing fruitful preparations to help an agreement be reached in December on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. The six-day meeting, which ended on Sunday, was scheduled to step up progress in the battle against rising global carbon emissions by adopting a completed text that could be presented at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, three months from now. A primary objective of the 2015 Paris agreement, to which 190 nations subscribe, is to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees, which is vital to the survival of island nations threatened by rising seas. But the absence of guidelines for meeting that goal has led to fears that not enough action is being taken. There have been notable disagreements over fair financing for implementation of the rules by developing countries, and the technical details of their reporting on progress. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Sunday at the closing press briefing for the Bangkok meeting that progress was made on most issues but nothing was finalized. The meeting was attended by representatives of most of the countries party to the Paris agreement, as well as the United States, which has announced that it is pulling out of the pact. Espinosa said there was ""limited progress"" on the issue of contributions from developed nations to developing countries, adding that she is ""hopeful"" that future discussions will be productive because of the importance of the issue. ""On the core issues of forward-looking climate finance and the degree of flexibility developing countries should be given on the information and reporting requirements for national commitments under the Paris Agreement, negotiators were stalemated in Bangkok,"" said a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S.-based activist group. ""It's now up to the incoming Polish presidency and officials leading negotiations to find ways to bridge the deep differences on these issues and to secure agreement in Katowice on a robust, comprehensive package of rules to implement the Paris Agreement,"" he said. Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager for ActionAid International, said Sunday that a vital component of the Paris agreement is for wealthy nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries as they fight natural disasters brought by climate change. But he said wealthy and developed countries ""led by the United States and including countries such as Australia, Japan and even the European Union"" refused to clearly show ""how much money they are going to provide and how that is going to be counted."" Advocacy for the developing countries was led at the meeting by China, said Meyer, but was also supported by others, including India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Activists were critical of Washington's lobbying at the meeting, especially because President Donald Trump has announced plans to have the U.S. withdraw from the Paris pact, which had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""The U.S. has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a Party, weakening international co-operation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries,"" Meena Raman, legal adviser at Third World Network, said in an emailed statement. Climate change is a polarizing issue in the United States, and some states and local communities have announced policies supporting the Paris agreement. Thousands of governors, mayors, company CEOs and civil society leaders are expected to gather this week in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit. \"

La Pologne d\'e9pend encore du charbon pour produire pr\'e8s de 80 pour cent de son \'e9lectricit\'e9, ce qui correspond \'e0 plus du double de la moyenne mondiale, et Katowice constitue le coeur de cette industrie. La cit\'e9 d'environ 300 000 habitants s'est d\'e9velopp\'e9e gr\'e2ce \'e0 des ateliers et \'e0 des usines aliment\'e9es par les abondantes r\'e9serves de charbon cach\'e9es dans le sol.

Les d\'e9l\'e9gu\'e9s, dont la mission est d'\'e9tablir une s\'e9rie de r\'e8gles pour \'e9valuer les progr\'e8s r\'e9alis\'e9s par les pays dans l£tteinte de leurs objectifs de lutte contre les changements climatiques, ont \'e9t\'e9 accueillis par l'orchestre des mineurs de charbon polonais. La d\'e9coration du centre des congr\'e8s comprend des paniers en fil de fer remplis de charbon. Des bijoux et du savon fabriqu\'e9s avec du charbon sont aussi en vente. Les principaux commanditaires de la COP24 sont tous des compagnies de charbon, dont une soci\'e9t\'e9 d'\'c9tat polonaise qui extrait du charbon et une autre qui produit de l'\'e9lectricit\'e9 \'e0 partir du charbon. Le charbon est la source d'\'e9lectricit\'e9 la plus polluante au monde. Il g\'e9n\'e8re habituellement deux fois plus d'\'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre que le gaz naturel et contribue \'e0 faire grimper la pollution atmosph\'e9rique, un probl\'e8me qui tue environ 800 000 personnes par ann\'e9e. Plus t\'f4t cette ann\'e9e, le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'\'e9volution du climat (GIEC) de l'ONU avait pr\'e9venu qu'il y aurait de graves cons\'e9quences si la plan\'e8te ne r\'e9duisait pas de mani\'e8re importante ses \'e9missions au cours de la prochaine d\'e9cennie et, pour y parvenir, avait sugg\'e9r\'e9 de fermer 60 pour cent des centrales \'e9lectriques au charbon existantes d'ici 2030. Le pr\'e9sident de la Pologne, Andrzej Duda, a profit\'e9 de son discours d'ouverture \'e0 la COP24 \£bLe fait d'utiliser ses propres ressources, le charbon dans le cas de la Pologne, et d'\'e9tablir sa s\'e9curit\'e9 \'e9nerg\'e9tique sur elles n'entre pas en conflit avec la protection du climat\'bb, avait-il soutenu. La Pologne n'est pas la seule dans son camp. Les \'c9tats-Unis, o\'f9 le pr\'e9sident Donald Trump a promis de refaire du charbon une source d'\'e9nergie importante, ont organis\'e9 une r\'e9union sp\'e9ciale portant sur la mani\'e8re d'utiliser les \'e9nergies fossiles de fa\'e7on \'e9cologique. La Russie, qui n£ toujours pas ratifi\'e9 l'Accord de Paris, demeure une grande exportatrice de charbon. Le fait que la Chine tente de fermer les centrales au charbon sur son territoire ne l'emp\'eache pas de financer la construction de telles installations ailleurs. Depuis la signature de l'entente sur les changements climatiques dans la capitale fran\'e7aise en 2015, plus de 92 000 m\'e9gawatts g\'e9n\'e9r\'e9s par des centrales au charbon se sont ajout\'e9s aux r\'e9serves mondiales d'\'e9nergie et un nombre au moins six fois plus important de m\'e9gawatts produits avec du charbon devrait s£jouter prochainement gr\'e2ce \'e0 l£grandissement de centrales existantes ou \'e0 la construction de nouvelles installations. Au Canada, la fermeture de centrales au charbon en Ontario entre 2000 et 2014 a permis de retirer quelque 8800 m\'e9gawatts d'\'e9lectricit\'e9 du r\'e9seau. Il s£git vraisemblablement de l'effort le plus important pour r\'e9duire les \'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre au pays, et ce, m\'eame si 10 pour cent de l'\'e9lectricit\'e9 en sol canadien est toujours produite \'e0 partir du charbon. La ministre canadienne de l'Environnement, Catherine McKenna, a balay\'e9 du revers de la main les critiques en r\'e9v\'e9lant son intention de faire la promotion de l£lliance \'c9nergiser au-del\'e0 du charbon \'e0 la COP24 .

The protest group has told police they plan to assemble in Centennial Square and then begin a brief march west down Pandora Avenue to the Johnson Street Bridge, arriving at about 5:30 p.m. The march is timed to coincide with COP 24 , the annual UN Climate Change conference that started today in Poland. Marchers plan to block traffic on the bridge for 12 minutes, ""one minute for each of the 12 years we have left to address the climate crisis,"" according to a statement from the two organizing groups, Rise and Resist! and Extinction Rebellion-Vancouver Island. There will also be a candle-lit vigil and two minutes of silence to acknowledge the depth of the climate emergency, the group said. Last month, similar climate change rallies were held across the U.K. and Australia. Victoria police will not be closing the bridge to facilitate the protesters' actions and they will be required to ensure the safety of participants and the public, police spokesman Bowen Osoko said in a prepared statement. Officers have reminded participants that blocking a highway as part of a protest is unlawful, Osoko said. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada63","Climate talks get boost from G20; Industrial leaders endorse Paris accord as negotiations renew","December 3, 2018 Monday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","Negotiators from around the world began two weeks of talks on curbing climate change Sunday, three years after sealing a landmark deal in Paris that set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees C. Envoys from almost 200 countries gathered in Poland's southern city of Katowice, a day earlier than originally planned because of the large number of issues that need to be resolved by Dec. 14. ""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" said Poland's environmental envoy, Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the U.N. meeting, known as COP24 . ""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" Kurtyka said. ""There is no Plan B."" Ministers and some heads of government plan to join the discussion Monday, when host Poland is expected to push for a declaration ensuring a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The meeting received a boost over the weekend when 19 major economies at the G-20 summit affirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the U.S. which announced under Donald Trump that it is withdrawing from the climate pact. ""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the U.N. climate office. ""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science when it comes to climate change,"" Figures said. She cited a recent expert report warning of the consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees C. ""The rest of the G20 have not only understood the science, they are taking actions to both prevent the major impacts and strengthen their economies,"" said Figueres, who now works with Mission 2020, a group that campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The meeting in Katowice is regarded as a key test of countries' willingness to back their lofty but distant goals with concrete measures, some of which are already drawing fierce protests. At the top of the agenda is the so-called Paris rule book, which will determine how governments record and report their greenhouse emissions and efforts to cut them. Separately, negotiators will discuss ramping up countries' national emissions targets after 2020, and financial support for poor nations that are struggling to adapt to climate change. The shift away from fossil fuels, which scientists say has to happen by 2050, is expected to require a major overhaul of world economies. ""The good news is that we do know a lot of what we need to be able to do to get there,"" said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute. Waskow, who has followed climate talks for years, said despite the Trump administration's refusal to back this global effort the momentum is going in the right direction. ""It's not one or two players anymore in the international arena,"" he said. ""It's what I think you could call a distributed leadership, where you have a number of countries - some of them small or medium-sized - really making headway and doing it in tandem with cities and states and businesses."" Not far from the meetings venue, environmental activists held a small protest Sunday to call for an end to coal mining in Poland, which gets some 80 per cent of its energy from coal. Katowice is in the heart of Poland's coal mining region of Silesia, and there are several active mines in and around the city. Marches aimed at showing support for ending the use of coal-fired power plants drew thousands over the weekend in Brussels, Berlin and Cologne. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada64","Diversifying diets can help counter climate change; Our food supply is vulnerable to rising temperatures, Oumar Barou Togola argues","December 28, 2018 Friday","The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)","More than 63 per cent of Canadians are ""desperately concerned"" about climate change, and it's easy to see why. 2018 in particular, has been the year of climate-change awareness. From COP24 to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report declaring we have 12 years to act to limit a climate-change catastrophe, consumers'conscience has been awakened to climate change, and the need for immediate solutions. As with all global climate issues, there is no panacea. However, there's one place Canadians can make a difference: on their plates. Climate change is a threat not only to animals and our habitat (which is widely discussed), but also to our food supply. We need action by food suppliers, providers, and consumers, if we're to better protect the food supply chains for generations to come. Diets in Canada are surprisingly limited. A report released by Crop Trust, shows that we use only one per cent of available crops to fuel our diets, and more than 50 per cent of our diet comes from just four crops: corn, rice, wheat and maize. While there are 30,000 edible plant species, we eat only 150 of them. This narrow food chain puts our supply at risk, particularly with the effects of climate change putting some grains in jeopardy (such as rice, which three billion people rely on). A recent study concluded that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, yields of vegetables could fall by 35 per cent by 2100 due to water scarcity and the ozone. Rising sea temperatures could affect fish supplies; and cows are sensitive to heat, so milk production could decline. At the same time, our global population continues to grow and is expected to exceed nine billion by 2050, according to the U.N. Yet, we continue to fail to feed our current global population of 7.6 billion people, with one in 10 suffering from chronic undernourishment according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. So, how can we use our diets to propel climate action? First, and most widely known, is cutting out meat. The global livestock industry produces more carbon dioxide than all cars, planes and trains combined. Cutting back meat consumption can directly reduce global warming. Second, improved awareness and education on which crops are climate-change resistant, and how climate change may affect the food on people's dinner plates. Having recently returned from Mali, West Africa, after visiting female farmers that our company, Farafena, partners with, we've seen first-hand how fonio grain production is redefining social and economic development and future-proofing the effects of climate change. Agriculture is a major industry in Africa, and production of crops such as wheat will decline as climate change intensifies. We are working with female farmers to produce fonio, a grain that is an alternative to rice, is drought-resistant and requires no chemical inputs. Fonio has existed in West Africa for more than 5,000 years, and is a staple crop across the sub-sahel. Third and finally, we must diversify our food supply, an action for producers and suppliers, as well as consumers. Producers and suppliers need to market more than the four grains that currently dominate diets. Consumers can use their purchasing power to drive this foodsupply diversification. Every consumer has an opportunity three times a day to improve the biodiversity of food. With 2019 approaching, many Vancouverites will be setting new-year goals. Top of many people's lists will be health-related pledges (setting fitness and food goals) and living a more sustainable socially responsible life. In 2019, rather than committing simply to healthy eating, why not exercise a responsible social licence and explore a sustainable diet instead? Oumar Barou Togola is the Vancouver-based and Mali-born founder of African superfood company Farafena. Farafena partners with more than 850 female farmers in various countries in Africa to bring sustainably farmed products to Canadian tables. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Manon Mass\'e9, the party's co-spokesperson, told the convention that the governing Coalition Avenir Qu\'e9bec (CAQ) must take note of the groundswell of popular support for climate-change action in Quebec, which was in clear evidence at the Planet Goes to Parliament rally, which saw tens of thousands of people marching through downtown Montreal on Nov. 10 as well as a rally on Saturday that saw thousands demonstrate in cities throughout Quebec. In the October election, Qu\'e9bec solidaire tripled its members in the National Assembly - electing 10 MNAs - and doubled its membership to 20,000. Mass\'e9 said the party intends to use its voice in the legislature and that larger membership base to conduct what she called a ""vast awareness campaign"" about the need to transition to an economy that puts environmental concerns first, particularly climate change. ""The struggle against climate change is not some homework we can leave to the last minute,"" Mass\'e9 told the convention. ""It is a structuring project for the future of Quebec, a job-creating project that will give new breath to Quebec's economy. ""The faster we act, the more this transition becomes a historic opportunity. The longer we wait with arms crossed, the more time we let pass, the more this opportunity becomes a nightmare,"" Mass\'e9 said. Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, Qu\'e9bec solidaire's male co-spokesperson and the leader of the 2012 student uprising, demanded that Legault listen to young people who are marching in the streets to demand climate-change action. The choice now is between making a successful transition to a clean-energy economy or ""abandoning future generations to their fate,"" he said. ""Mr. Legault, you are proud to talk tough with Ottawa on the topic of immigration,"" Nadeau-Dubois said. ""But what are you doing about Justin Trudeau buying a pipeline with taxpayers'money? ""I am more convinced than ever that the future of the independence movement will include the transition - the economic, energetic and ecological transition - of Quebec,"" he added. ""And it will pass by way of our exit from the Canadian petroleum state."" He noted that a recent poll showed that almost eight out of 10 Quebecers believe it is important for governments to solve the issue of climate change even if it means the economy suffers. And hundreds of thousands have signed a ""pact for transition"" away from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the party's environment critic, Ruba Ghazal, chided Legault for not attending the COP 24 ""There will be at least 40 heads of state there,"" Ghazal said, who will attend COP 24 . ""Sadly, our head of state will not attend. That is really too bad, and it shows that the CAQ, on the issue of climate change, wants to play the role of an empty chair on the international scene."" Two of Legault's predecessors, Philippe Couillard and Jean Charest, attended COP summits. The QS conference included a discussion on the controversial topic of the wearing of religious symbols by public-sector workers, but members voted to exclude media from the discussion. Nadeau-Dubois said the discussion centred on how the party will revisit the question at its next convention in March. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada66","Global carbon pollution up in 2018","December 6, 2018 Thursday","Sudbury Star","After several years of little growth, global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide experienced their largest jump in seven years, discouraging scientists. World carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have risen 2.7 per cent from 2017 to 2018, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations, announced during negotiations to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into effect, puts some of the landmark agreement's goals nearly out of reach, scientists said. ""This is terrible news,"" said Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures but was not part of the research. ""Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become difficult to meet."" The studies concluded that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons last year. The margin of error is about one percentage point on either side. The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union. The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions - up 2.5 per cent - for the first time since 2013. China, the globe's biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 per cent. Study lead author Corinne Le Quere, a climate change researcher at the University of East Anglia in England, said the increase is a surprising ""reality check"" after a few years of smaller emission increases. But she also doesn't think the world will return to the even larger increases seen from 2003 to 2008. She believes unusual factors are at play this year. For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said. John Reilly, co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, said the results aren't too surprising because fossil fuels still account for 81 per cent of the world's energy use. The burning of coal, oil and gas release carbon dioxide, which warms the Earth. Reilly, who wasn't part of the study, praised it as impressive. Global Carbon Project chairman Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist, said he was discouraged. The Paris accord set two goals. The long-held goal would limit global warming to no more than 1 degree Celsius from now, with a more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 0.5 degrees Celsius from now. The trend is such that the world would have to be lucky to keep warming to 1.8 degrees, let alone the lower goal, Le Quere said. China increased its emissions to 11.4 billion tons, while the U.S. jumped to a shade under 6 billion tons. The European Union spewed 3.9 billion tons and India soared to 2.9 billion tons. Overall, the world is spewing about 1,300 tons of carbon dioxide into the air every second. Use of coal - the biggest carbon emitter - is rising. And while countries are using more renewable fuels and trying to reduce carbon from electricity production, emissions from cars and planes are steadily increasing, Le Quere said. Global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 per cent in the last 20 years, the calculations show. At the same time, Earth has warmed on average about 0.38 degrees Celsius, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Imagine the carbon emissions produced for this amount of money. Meals were $11,051. Lodging these people cost $227,115. They surely did not sleep in tents at that cost. The rental costs for the meeting rooms were $53,165. Why did they not have their meetings outside to enjoy the environment? By the time the tally is complete (hospitality costs have not been finalized) this meeting will have cost taxpayers almost $500,000.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada68","CRSB sustainability projects more common with ranchers, landowners","January 25, 2019 Friday","Prairie Post West","The partnership between the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB) and organizations such as the Alberta Conservation Association (ACA) goes back a few years and these partnerships such as these make sense. They all have the same goal -bringing a top-quality product to the table while doing what it takes to not only minimize any environmental damage, but to enhance the environment for the flora, fauna, and community. The ACA and MultiSAR had already been working with producers on sustainability projects for years, so joining forces with CRSB a few years ago was a nobrainer. ""In 2002, there was a desire from producers and from government to have a partnership in place. Producers were tired of groups coming to their door wanting to do one thing for one species. So, that was why MultiSAR (Multiple Species at Risk) came about,"" explained Brad Downey, senior biologist for the Alberta Conservation Association and project coordinator for MultiSAR. ""It started in the Milk River area and was very grassroots."" In fact, it was one rancher, John Ross, who was the first to become involved with MultiSAR and it has since grown as positive working relationships were developed. ""We conducted surveys, talked about the range and about different enhancements, but the landholders always remain in the driver's seat,"" said Downey. ""Our goal is to have long-term relationships with open, honest communication and that has enabled us to work with close to 600,000 acres. When it started, there was one producer."" Over the years, ACA and MultiSAR have completed enhancement projects that include hawk poles, wildlife fence tags, putting smooth lines on the bottom of fencing, drilling water wells, and portable electric fencing, among many others. Downey recalled in one incident where a ferruginous hawk nest kept falling and the eggs in it lost, but the hawk kept coming back to the same place to nest, always with the same result. A hawk pole was put up at the site as ferruginous hawks return to the same place every year to nest. The strategy has been successful with three to four young being produced each year as a result. A number of years ago, the ACA planted sage brush plugs in the Manyberries area in an effort to improve the habitat for the Greater Sage Grouse, but learned they had more success by planting sage brush seeds rather than plugs. Initially, their work was primarily within the Milk River watershed, but that has since expanded and so has the requests for their services. In another particular project, 1,760 acres planted back to native grass for grazing and wildlife. ""In 2015, CCA (Canadian Cattlemen's Association) and CRSB got funding from the Species at Risk Partnerships on Agricultural Lands (SARPAL),"" said Downey. ""That allowed us to expand into the South Saskatchewan watershed and it runs from Longview to the Saskatchewan border and south to the U.S. border."" With that funding from the Species at Risk Partnerships on Agricultural Lands (SARPAL) program, CRSB has partnered with Alberta Beef Producers, Canadian Cattlemen's Association, MultiSAR, and Cows and Fish to increase, maintain, and improve habitat for species at risk within the Grassland natural region of Alberta. And, the ACA is also a member of the CRSB. ""What they are all about are the same things we are about and everybody wants the same thing,"" said Downey. ""Compared to where we were in 2002, there has been a big change in the openness, the awareness, and in the willingness. We now have a waiting list of people who want to work with us and it has everything to do with our partnership with CRSB."" In 2016-17, initial environmental inventories were completed on 10 ranches, with collaboration to implement 15 habitat enhancements as part of their conservation strategies. In 2017 alone, habitat conservation strategies were developed on seven ranches totaling 62,973 acres. By comparison, for 2017-18, 42 habitat conservation strategies involving 395,296 acres in the Milk River and South Saskatchewan watersheds were completed by MultiSAR. Downey also recognizes that each project and property will be different and the organization is open to ideas from the rancher. ""We are open to initiative ideas. One size doesn't fit all. The producers know the land and knows the species? on their land,"" said Downey. ""Looking forward, we will continue working with producers. That trust and respect is important. We still work with that same producer from all those years ago."" As the ground level work continues and more producers sign onto the CRSB program, the global beef community is watching. Canada is the first country to develop a sustainable beef program with its Canadian Roundtable on Sustainable Beef program and has one of the lowest greenhouse gas footprints of beef production in the world. The CCA attended the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change recently and sustainable beef was part of the discussion there. ""Our industry continually strives to be a global leader in sustainable beef production and a partner in dually achieving Canada's economic and environmental targets,"" CCA said in a written document. ""Canadian beef producers have achieved this through investment and application of research and continue to drive towards further improvement and sharing of best practices through engaging in forums such as the COP 24 ."" CCA Senior Manager, Government and International Relations Fawn Jackson also attended the European Beef Forum 2018 that was held just prior to COP 24 in Warsaw. One highlight of the forum was the indication that Poland will be moving forward with their own sustainable beef initiative. Canada has been a leading force in the sustainable beef conversation through the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef. She also attended a COP 24 side event on sustainable landscapes. The workshop confirmed what Canada's sustainable beef industry already knows ""that high biodiversity is highly correlated to climate resilience. This is yet another reason it's so important to keep native grasslands and the agriculture system that keeps grasslands healthy,"" she said. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada69","Canada called out on climate; Canada pressured to match tough climate talk with leadership","December 13, 2018 Thursday","Brockville Recorder & Times","The Canadian government is under intense pressure to fill a leadership void as countries try to hammer out how they will hold themselves accountable for implementing the Paris climate-change accord. Political leaders from most countries are in the small, coal-mining city of Katowice, in southern Poland, for the 24th meeting of the United Nations ""Conference of the Parties,"" where the rulebook for the Paris agreement is supposed to be finalized. With the United States preparing to leave the Paris agreement altogether, the host country less than enthusiastic about it and the biggest European powers distracted by domestic events like the Brexit crisis and riots against a fuel tax in France, Canada is being pushed to lead where they can't or won't. The rules decided at Katowice are to dictate everything from how carbon markets work to what each country must do to report on their own emissions cuts and how they've helped finance the decarbonization of the developing world. There is also a push for them to agree to make deeper emissions cuts, after the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported earlier this fall that global targets must be substantially higher if the world has any hope of slowing catastrophic global warming. Catherine Abreu, executive director of the Climate Action Network Canada, said at the moment the only developed country really fighting for tougher cuts to emissions is New Zealand. ""They need help,"" she said. Other countries know that Canada is struggling to meet its own targets, that the Liberal government is facing legal and political pressure over its planned carbon tax and that Canada is continuing government support for developing oil and gas reserves. Some officials are snarking that Canada is good for talking points but not action. Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna told The Canadian Press last week Canada will be ready - as the Paris agreement requires - to increase its targets for cutting emissions in 2020. It was a departure from an earlier line that McKenna had no plans to increase Canada's ambitions until policies were in place to realize its existing ones. Abreu was thrilled about the change of tone but said she will be happier if McKenna says it at Katowice as well. Thus far she has not. In a call with reporters Tuesday, McKenna said only: ""We are absolutely committed to meeting our target."" She also said the Canadian government is well aware there are just 12 years in which to act, after which hope will be lost to keep the world from getting more than 1.5 C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times. The existing policies under the Paris agreement have the world on track to exceed 3 C in warming. That report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says Canada would have to double its planned emissions cuts to do its share to keep the world to the 1.5 C goal, but Canada's existing policies don't even get us all the way to our current target, let alone anywhere close to a tougher one. Abreu said bits and pieces of the draft set of rules put together by officials over the last week were released Wednesday but the politicians now have to do the heavy lifting to overcome some of the biggest obstacles. The pressure to set the rules, and the risk that won't happen, is so acute United Nations General Secretary Antonio Guterres flew back to Poland Wednesday to try to light a fire under the political leaders. ""We're running out of time,"" he told the meeting Wednesday. ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Sun Media Corporation. All rights reserved. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada71","Climate talks get G20 boost","December 2, 2018 Sunday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","KATOWICE, Poland - Negotiators from around the world began two weeks of talks on curbing climate change Sunday, three years after sealing a landmark deal in Paris that set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees C. Envoys from almost 200 countries gathered in Poland's southern city of Katowice, a day earlier than originally planned because of the large number of issues that need to be resolved by Dec. 14. ""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" said Poland's environmental envoy, Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the U.N. meeting, known as COP24 . ""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" Kurtyka said. ""There is no Plan B."" Ministers and some heads of government plan to join the discussion Monday, when host Poland is expected to push for a declaration ensuring a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The meeting received a boost over the weekend when 19 major economies at the G-20 summit affirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the United States, which announced under President Donald Trump that it is withdrawing from the climate pact. ""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the U.N. climate office. ""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science when it comes to climate change,"" Figures said. She cited a recent expert report warning of the consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees C. ""The rest of the G20 have not only understood the science, they are taking actions to both prevent the major impacts and strengthen their economies,"" said Figueres, who now works with Mission 2020, a group that campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The meeting in Katowice is regarded as a key test of countries' willingness to back their lofty but distant goals with concrete measures, some of which are already drawing fierce protests. At the top of the agenda is the so-called Paris rule book, which will determine how governments record and report their greenhouse emissions and efforts to cut them. Separately, negotiators will discuss ramping up countries' national emissions targets after 2020, and financial support for poor nations that are struggling to adapt to climate change. The shift away from fossil fuels, which scientists say has to happen by 2050, is expected to require a major overhaul of world economies. ""The good news is that we do know a lot of what we need to be able to do to get there,"" said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute. Waskow, who has followed climate talks for years, said despite the Trump administration's refusal to back this global effort the momentum is going in the right direction. ""It's not one or two players anymore in the international arena,"" he said. ""It's what I think you could call a distributed leadership, where you have a number of countries - some of them small or medium-sized - really making headway and doing it in tandem with cities and states and businesses."" Not far from the meeting venue, environmental activists held a small protest Sunday to call for an end to coal mining in Poland, which gets some 80 per cent of its energy from coal. Katowice is in the heart of Poland's coal mining region of Silesia, and there are several active mines in and around the city. Marches aimed at showing support for ending the use of coal-fired power plants and other efforts to limit climate change drew thousands of people over the weekend in Brussels, Berlin and Cologne. But the governor of Germany's most populous state said Sunday it was premature to set a firm date for phasing out the use of coal-fired power plants. Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said Germany's decision to stop mining and burning lignite coal ""must be considered seriously and decided with broad consensus."" German officials had hoped to present a blueprint for the country's exit from coal at the meeting in Katowice but an expert committee has delayed issuing its recommendations until next year. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada74","UN head pleads for action","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Chatham Daily News","UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a dramatic appeal to world leaders Monday to take the threat of global warming seriously and to act boldly to avert a catastrophic rise in temperatures before the end of the century. Guterres, who spoke at the opening of the UN climate conference in Poland, called climate change ""the most important issue we face."" ""Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,"" Guterres told delegates from almost 200 countries who gathered in the city of Katowice. Famed British naturalist Sir David Attenborough echoed his warnings, telling the gathering that the ""collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizons"" if no urgent action is taking against global warming. The 92-year-old TV presenter blamed humans for the ""disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years."" The UN chief chided countries, particularly those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, for failing to do enough to back the 2015 Paris climate accord, which set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 C - ideally 1.5 C - by the end of the century. Citing a recent scientific report on the dire consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees, Guterres urged countries to cut their emissions 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and aim for net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero emissions mean that any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest or new technologies that can remove carbon from the atmosphere. Such cuts, which experts say is the only way to achieve the 1.5-degree goal, would require a radical overhaul of the global economy and a move away from using fossil fuels. ""In short, we need a complete transformation of our global energy economy, as well as how we manage land and forest resources,"" Guterres said. He said governments should embrace the opportunities rather than cling to fossil fuels such as coal, which are blamed for a significant share of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The remark was directed at host Poland, which relies on coal for 80 per cent of its energy. But Poland's President Andrzej Duda said during a later news conference that the coal-rich country will reduce its reliance on coal but will never entirely give up its ""strategic fossil fuel."" Guterres also urged negotiators not to forget that the challenges they face pale in comparison to the difficulties climate change is already causing millions around the world whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by rising sea levels, drought and more powerful storms. The two-week conference in Poland's southern coal mining region of Silesia is expected to work out how governments can report on their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming within the limits of the Paris climate deal. ""This is the challenge on which this generation's leaders will be judged,"" Guterres said. He later told reporters that realities of global climate changes are ""worse than expected, but the political will is relatively faded after Paris"" and is not matching the current challenges. Guterres called for a ""huge increase in ambitions"" during the negotiations in Poland, adding ""we cannot afford to fail in Katowice."" Arnold Schwarzenegger, the action film star and former governor of California, said the U.S. is ""still in"" the Paris accord to curb global warming despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to walk away from it. He told delegates on Monday that ""America is more than just Washington or one leader."" Calling Trump ""meshugge"" - Yiddish for ""crazy"" - for deciding to withdraw from the Paris accord, Schwarzenegger insisted that the climate deal has widespread support at local and state levels in the U.S. Duda said participants at the conference have backed his country's proposal of a ""just transition"" away from coal mining, which calls for helping people such as coal miners who are slated to lose their jobs as the world changes its energy mix. Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's UN climate summit, said the ""just transition"" proposal shouldn't just consider the fate of fossil fuel workers but all people around the world whose lives are affected by climate change. Residents of the world's smaller islands, many of whom face catastrophic flooding from higher sea levels in a warming world, have been among the world's most vocal backers of measures to combat climate change. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada75","It's all smoke and mirrors; UN's climate circus lumbers on","December 16, 2018 Sunday","Ottawa Sun","The United Nations£nnual climate conferences, like the latest in Katowice, Poland - attended by thousands of politicians, bureaucrats, diplomats, scientists, special interest groups and media - are a circus and a fraud. From the first climate summit in Rio in 1992, followed by 24 annual UN conferences of the parties - COPs - to date, beginning in Berlin in 1995, the script is always the same. Each year in November or December, thousands of the usual suspects, many on the public's dime, fly in to that year's favourite UN tourist destination - previous conference sites include Paris, Copenhagen, Buenos Aires, Bali, Cancun, Marrakech, Geneva, Lima, Milan, New Delhi and Montreal. Once there, they collectively consume enough fossil fuel energy to choke a horse for the better part of two weeks. While doing so, they piously lecture everyone else about wastefully consuming fossil fuel energy - which is what they've just done because apparently no one at the UN has heard of video-conferencing. Then comes the annual parade of climate scientists warning we're facing imminent catastrophe. Followed by the mandatory flailing of the developed world for not shipping enough money to the developing world to fight climate change, while environmentalists of all ages mug for the cameras. In years where a UN climate accord is being negotiated or an important (albeit artificial) deadline has been reached, there are breathless media reports that the countries are far apart in negotiations, followed by a miraculous, eleventhhour agreement - typically after the conference's official close - that can ""save the planet"", although much more needs to be done. Then they all go home and start preparing for next year. Next year's COP 25 (in UN lingo), was supposed to be in Brazil, but since its new president isn't a fan of the Paris accord, it's been shifted to Chile with an assist from Costa Rica. COP 26 will be in the U.K. or Italy. Both are bidding since it will be the most significant meeting since Paris in 2015, because 2020 is the deadline for countries to increase their (non-binding) commitments to cut emissions by 2030. So why is it all a fraud? Because the best way to assess the sincerity of politicians is not by what they say but by what they do. And after a quartercentury of these annual UN circuses, global emissions last year reached a record high of 32.5 gigatonnes (32.5 billion tonnes), with another record expected for 2018. Global emissions went up 1.4% last year after three years of stable emissions, dashing hopes emissions had peaked. In fact, as Barry Saxifrage, who has analyzed the numbers going back to the 1992 Rio Summit, wrote in the National Observer last week, ""despite decades of global promises and negotiations, CO2 (carbon dioxide) levels have not stabilized. Not only are emissions still rising, they are actually accelerating upwards."" Last year, two-thirds of the global increase came from Asia. In China, the world's largest emitter, they jumped 1.7%. Ironically, emissions in the U.S., where President Donald Trump announced he was pulling out of the Paris accord last year, were down 2.7%, primarily by replacing coalfired electricity with loweremitting natural gas, and the growth of renewables. Canada's emissions dropped 1.4% in 2016, the last year for which Canadian figures are available. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted last week that through his national carbon tax/price and other initiatives, Canada is on track to meet the emission cuts he agreed to in the 2015 Paris accord, which used to be Stephen Harper's targets. No one who understands the numbers, including the UN, believes this, with the apparent exception of Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, who was in Katowice and whose public statements are increasingly divorced from reality. Ditto claims by Conservative leader Andrew Scheer that his yet-to-be-unveiled climate plan will hit Canada's Paris targets, without a national carbon tax. If Canada was serious about that, Trudeau's carbon price would already be five to 10 times higher than the $20 per tonne of emissions he's set for 2019, rising to $50 per tonne in 2022. But even if Canada miraculously hit its Paris target, which the UN says is already obsolete and insufficient, it would be insignificant because we account for only 1.6% of global emissions and globally emissions are rising. What Trudeau's national carbon price/tax really is, is a sin tax on energy - like paying for the papal indulgences of old. It won't fix anything, but it's supposed to make us feel better about ourselves. Until the next UN climate circus lands in Chile in November 2019.

But the venue she's most looking forward to is not only pretty close to home, but was one of the first places she tested her filmmaking chops. On Thursday (Jan. 24), the Janetville-area resident will open this year's ReFrame Film Festival at Showplace in Peterborough with her documentary, Youth Unstoppable. ""It's an incredible feeling to screen your work in the place you live,"" stated Jewell-Kemker, who honed her voice at PCVS before opting for home studies that ultimately led to a 10-year journey into the challenging world of climate change. ""For years I've been working on this project, and everyone from neighbours to folks working in local businesses who have watched this process have asked me 'when can I see it?' I've never had an answer for them until now. It's immensely satisfying. I screened a short film at the festival 10 years ago so it's pretty cool to be coming back as the Opening Night Film."" Jewell-Kemker also believes that it's incredibly important and vital for the conversation of climate change and environmental sustainability to be taking place in communities like the Kawarthas. ""You go around the world and see whole countries struggling with the challenges of food security, and clean water, and having their basic needs met, all the while dealing with increasingly erratic weather and lack of stability, and you realize just how truly blessed we are to be living here,"" stated Jewell-Kemker. ""But it also means we have a responsibility to lead the way when it comes to things like restorative agricultural practices and clean energy and lifestyles that don't depend on the destruction of entire ways of life and ecosystems. We have our basic needs met and we know better. It's a scary time to be alive but also an incredibly exciting one, because the opportunities we are being presented in the face of such a major crisis have the ability to change the way we all live for the better."" It's a message that Jewell-Kemker has been sharing around the world, including marking the US Premiere at Michael Moore's film festival in Traverse City, Michigan in August. ""It was a huge honour just to screen there among giants in the field, most of whom are included in the 2019 Oscars Shortlist for Best Documentary Feature, but we also sold out our screening,"" added Jewell-Kemker. The documentary has since been screened at 13 different festivals globally - the film has also scooped up six awards - as well as screening the film during COP24 , the UN Climate Talks in Poland this past December. Selling out theatres is great, but it's been the ""incredibly emotional"" question and answer sessions after the film that have been the most memorable for the young filmmaker. ""In October we were the Gala Opening Night Film at Toronto's Planet in Focus Film Festival, and both David Suzuki and Col. Chris Hadfield attended. Suzuki actually came up to the mic during the Q&A and wept openly in front of the audience, reminding us that climate change is this generation's Pearl Harbour,"" explained Jewell-Kemker. ""People young and old come up to me afterwards all the time crying and saying how they've had their hope for the future restored. It's a bit overwhelming, this feeling of folks looking to you for the answers to deep and meaningful worries in their lives. I want to remind them that it's the next generation of climate activists, lawyers, change-makers and every day citizens around the world who are changing policy and their communities in the face of extreme change and that it's gonna take all of us, together."" After spending close to 10 years shooting - and 30 months editing - the film one might think Jewell-Kemker might want to take a bit of a rest. Not so. She is currently writing a fictional feature film that she will be directing, and hopefully shooting in the Kawarthas. She is also working on the Continuing Impact campaign and Life of the Documentary with both film festival and community screenings, along with holding school filmmaking workshops. ""Our website will be a lot more vibrant and active leading up to May 1st when we have something exciting in the works. I can't say more about that now except that you'll want to be a part of it. So stay tuned."" HYPERLINK http://www.reframefilmfestival.ca www.reframefilmfestival.ca \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada77","China's climate U-turn","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","In 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping were lauded as world saviours for endorsing the UN Paris agreement ""to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future."" As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China's leadership was especially valued, and lauded, even though the Paris agreement was non-binding and committed China to nothing. Then Donald Trump was elected president of the United States and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris agreement. China and its Communist Party leader Xi were happily thrust into a leadership position. It didn't last long. As the nations of the world congregate in Katowice, Poland for the 24th Conference of the Parties climate-change meeting ( COP24 ), China is reeling from Trump's trade sanctions. Xi is focused now on his need to maintain economic growth at home. And the U.S. and EU have largely abandoned a Green Climate Fund that would have redistributed US$100-billion a year from developed countries to developing countries. That was the lucre that made climate change interesting to China and other Third World countries. So China no longer has an economic incentive to participate in what it saw as the Paris climate-change charade. Instead, China's energy policy is focused on the Communist Party's two primary domestic needs: securing the energy to fuel China's economy and reducing the smog that undermines public confidence in the party. Failure to accomplish those two goals would represent an existential threat to the party's control over China. Over the past year, China's demand for energy is up substantially, as high as 15 per cent in the case of natural gas. To meet its need for fuel, Chinese authorities are using their expansionist Belt and Road Initiative and other projects to secure imports from Myanmar and Turkmenistan via pipelines; from Siberia via the nearly completed Russian ""Power of Siberia"" project and a proposed ""Power of Siberia 2"" pipeline; and from the Middle East via pipelines through Gwadar, Pakistan to Kashgar, China. Because that isn't enough, China is securing LNG supplies from as far away as Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Qatar, the United States and Canada, as well as from Russia's Yamal project along a Polar Silk Road. And because even all that is still not enough, China is securing oil from Oman, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Angola, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Congo, South Sudan, Brazil, Venezuela, and Canada. In other words, to meet its energy needs, China is aggressively pursuing every means at its disposal except green energy. As for reducing smog, China has decided that clean-burning natural gas - not renewables - is the answer. Although China promised under its commitment to the Paris agreement to ""peak"" emissions around 2030, to decrease carbon-dioxide emissions per unit of economic output and to use more green energy, China's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 1.7 per cent in 2017 and are projected to grow by 4.7 per cent in 2018. With Paris's low-carbon, green-energy fantasies having ended in abject failure in terms of meeting China's need for either energy or clean air, all that's left is propaganda. To that end, China's super-planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said it is considering floating a national pricing framework on pollutants by the end of 2020 ""to curb environmental damage while keeping the economy afloat."" China's once-lauded carbon market, meanwhile, has been scaled back. Beyond that, China's central government makes little mention of carbon emissions and climate change, except in official propaganda, such as that seen now in the Poland confab, where the main goal will be to produce a ""rule book"" by which participant countries will commit to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and to disclose how well they have done in this regard. But without the US$100 billion per year for the Green Climate Fund, China has lost much of its motivation to keep up the pretence. Since Paris, the Green Climate Fund has raised only a small fraction of the money it promised. The fund now languishes with dwindling resources and beset by internecine conflict. The U.S. and EU's collapsing commitment to meeting Paris's targets gives China an out, which it will take. To the extent that China tries to keep the ruse going, it will continue to insist that, like the Third World nations it purports to represent, it should not be held to the same standard of emissions reductions and disclosure as developed nations are. But the world has changed in another way since the Paris agreement was signed: Other countries don't really believe China's promises and propaganda anymore.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada78","Playing for the planet: How scientists use gaming to talk about climate change","January 24, 2019 Thursday 1:16 PM GMT","CBC News","The idea \'e2\€  to use video games to make the impacts of climate change ""tangible,"" in a virtual way \'e2\€  came to Manjana Milkoreit after her research showed a problem with how the topic was being handled at the political level. ""Participants in global climate negotiations tend to know actually very little about the climate science,"" said Milkoreit, a political science professor at Purdue University in Indiana. ""The facts that effectively are being used in the negotiations are very limited."" Climate science \'e2\€  like the global climate itself \'e2\€  is fiendishly complicated, and no one really expects the politicians who negotiate things like emissions caps and carbon pricing to understand it as well as the scientists do. But politics is all about making choices. So are games. So Milkoreit and her team, together with other researchers at various universities, built one. The online simulation game they came up with \'e2\€  Earth Remembers \'e2\€  gathers dozens of players in a virtual room and assigns each a country and a national budget. To play, each 'country' must negotiate with others to set emissions caps, then watch to see what their choices do to the planet, in five-year cycles \'e2\€  mimicking the deadlines set by global leaders who signed on to the 2016 Paris accord. ""It gives them a sense of what climate change actually might do, rather than just sitting in a political context and negotiating over national interests,"" Milkoreit said. ""So there's a big emotional component."" COP24 climate change conference in Poland last month, and previewed it at past global conferences, to positive reviews. Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences, tried it out in Washington, D.C. at a science conference. He called it impressive. ""I think I understood for the first time viscerally, not intellectually,"" Dessler said. ""You understand how much power the big countries have in these negotiations."" Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who runs the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, said she often feels like she's ""shouting down an empty well with nobody at the bottom"" as she tries to explain to laypeople the ""force-multiplier"" effects of climate change \'e2\€  the fact that it makes other global threats, from famine to disease pandemics, more deadly. She said she sees products like Earth Remembers filling a vital bridging role between science and politics: only governments can curb runaway climate change, but policy-makers seldom have the scientific grounding to know which approaches will work. ""Negotiators are not scientists,"" said Hayhoe. ""These gaming simulations [are] a fantastic way to connect the issue directly to our own decision-making."" Hayhoe took to Twitter last year to lament the fact that a video her 11-year old son had posted showing him playing the hugely popular online game Fortnite had racked up 10 times more views than her own webinar on climate change. Henri Drake heard her plea. The MIT graduate student turned to Twitch \'e2\€  a streaming platform for gaming fans that rivals the audience numbers for NFL football games \'e2\€  to invite climate scientists to play Fortnite with him while engaging in live-in-screen debates of the effects of climate change and the best policies for tackling it. And it was popular \'e2\€  but as a forum for exchanging ideas, maybe not wildly successful. Typically, the science took a back seat to the spectacle. ""Fortnite is a shooter game,"" Drake said, ""and so there's often a lot of gunshots and explosions in the background and sometimes you just can't even hear people because there's all this warfare going on."" He said he's hoping to try again with a game a little closer to the subject matter, such as the soon-to-be-released Civilization VI: The Gathering Storm, an expansion of a popular franchise which has a storyline centred on a crumbling biosphere. Others are pushing ahead with products of their own. EarthGames, based out of Seattle, describes itself as a ""a growing community of researchers, game developers and students who share a passion for games and the environment."" The company has developed multiple games that model climate change \'e2\€  such as a choose-your-adventure story where the player is a water molecule travelling through time to stop environmental disasters. In another EarthGames product, Infrared Escape, the player is a beam of infrared light trying to escape Earth's atmosphere through a gauntlet of greenhouse gases. Drake said the main goal for all such games should be fun \'e2\€  because nobody's going to pick up on the message if the play stinks. ""If you can combine fun with education in the right way, you can have a lot of success because kids don't usually want to do homework but they do want to play games."" It's something government agencies should factor into their own outreach efforts, Hayhoe said. Anything that engages with people through play has an audience. Games could be a very powerful tool for boosting public understanding of climate change, and the policy responses to it. ""If we want people to understand an issue as important as climate change that matters to every single human on this planet, we have to go out and meet people where they are,"" she said. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada80","Oumar Barou Togola: Why diversifying our diets is one step toward climate resilience","December 28, 2018 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","More than 63 per cent( https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/canadians-concerned-about-climate-change https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/canadians-concerned-about-climate-change ) of Canadians are 'desperately concerned' about climate change, and it's easy to see why. 2018 in particular, has been the year of climate change awareness. From COP24 to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report declaring we have 12 years( \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report ) to act to limit a climate change catastrophe, consumers' conscience has been awakened to climate change, and the need for immediate solutions. As with all global climate issues, there is no one panacea. However, there's one place Canadians can make a difference: on their plates. Climate change is a threat not only to animals and our habitat (which is widely discussed), but also to our food supply. We need action by food suppliers, providers, and consumers, if we're to better protect the food supply chains for generations to come. Diets in Canada are surprisingly limited. A report released by Crop Trust, shows that we use only one per cent of available crops to fuel our diets, and more than 50 per cent of our diets comes from just fourcrops( HYPERLINK https://www.croptrust.org/our-mission https://www.croptrust.org/our-mission / ) (corn, rice, wheat and maize). While there are 30,000 edible plant species, we only eat 150 of them. This narrow food chain puts our supply at risk, particularly with the impacts of climate change putting some grains in jeopardy (such as rice, which three billion( HYPERLINK http://theconversation.com/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious-putting-millions-of-the-worlds-poor-at-risk-97914 http://theconversation.com/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious-putting-millions-of-the-worlds-poor-at-risk-97914 HYPERLINK http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/05/1800442115 ) concluded that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, yields of vegetables could fall by 35 per cent by 2100 due to water scarcity and the ozone. Rising sea temperatures could impact fish supplies; and cows are sensitive to heat, so milk production could decline. At the same time, our global population continues to grow and is expected to exceed nine billion by 2050( http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/un-report-world-population-projected-to-reach-9-6-billion-by-2050.html http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/un-report-world-population-projected-to-reach-9-6-billion-by-2050.html ) according to the U.N. Yet, we continue to fail to feed our current global population of 7.6 billion people, with one in 10, suffering from chronic undernourishment according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. So, how can we use our diets to propel climate action? Firstly, and most widely known, is cutting out meat. The global livestock industry produces more carbon dioxide than all cars, planes and trains combined( HYPERLINK https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/eating-less-meat-essential-to-curb-climate-change-says-report https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/eating-less-meat-essential-to-curb-climate-change-says-report ). Cutting back meat consumption can directly reduce global warming. Secondly, improved awareness and education on which crops are climate change resistant, and how climate change may impact the food on people's dinner plates. Having recently returned from Mali, West Africa, to visit women farmers Farafena partners across five villages, we've seen first hand how Fonio grain production is redefining social and economic development and future proofing the effects of climate change Agriculture is a major industry in Africa, and production of crops such as wheat( HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-hitting-african-farmers-the-hardest-of-all-40845 https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-hitting-african-farmers-the-hardest-of-all-40845 )will decline, as climate change intensifies. We are working with women farmers to produce Fonio, a grain which is an alternative to rice, is drought-resistant and requires no chemical inputs. Fonio has existed in West Africa for over 5,000 years, and is a staple crop across the sub-sahel. Third and finally, diversifying our food supply - an action for both producers and suppliers, as well as consumers. Producers and suppliers need to market more than the four grains that currently dominate diets; consumers can use their 'purchase power' to drive this food supply diversification. Every consumer has an opportunity three times a day to improve the biodiversity of food. With a New Year approaching, many Vancouverites will be setting New Year goals. Top of many people's lists will be health related pledges (setting fitness and food goals) and living a more sustainable socially responsible life. In 2019, rather than committing simply to healthy eating, why not exercise a responsible social licence and explore a 'sustainable' diet instead?

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada81","Coal question looms large as climate talks begin in Poland","December 2, 2018 Sunday","Red Deer Advocate","KATOWICE, Poland - Negotiators from around the world opened the United Nations' annual climate change conference Sunday in a Polish city built around mining coal, widely seen as a main culprit behind global warming. Arriving for two weeks of talks on tackling climate change, conference participants cast off hats, scarves and heavy coats as they entered cavernous halls in Katowice heated by coal-fired power plants nearby. While the Polish government claims Katowice is in the process of transforming into a green city , power plant chimneys pumped plumes of smoke into a dull December sky and monitoring sites showed elevated levels of air pollution. Poland, which is presiding over the meeting, plans to use Monday's official opening event to promote a declaration calling for a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental activists have expressed concerns about the non-binding declaration, arguing that it could be cited as justification for propping up dying industries instead of investing in renewable energy sources. Some also have questioned why coal companies are among the meeting's sponsors. Poland's deputy environment minister, Michal Kurtyka, who is chairing the conference, urged envoys from almost 200 nations to use the time between Sunday and Dec. 14 to make progress on fleshing out the 2015 Paris agreement. ""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" he said. With further meetings next year meant to build on what's decided in Katowice, Kurtyka urged all countries to ""show creativity and flexibility."" ""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" he added. ""There is no Plan B."" The meeting, known as COP24 , received a boost over the weekend when 19 major economies at the G-20 summit affirmed their commitment to the Paris accord. The only holdout was the United States, which announced under President Donald Trump that it is withdrawing from the climate pact. ""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the U.N. climate office. ""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science when it comes to climate change,"" Figures said. She cited a recent expert report warning of the consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F). ""The rest of the G-20 have not only understood the science, they are taking actions to both prevent the major impacts and strengthen their economies,"" said Figueres, who now works with Mission 2020, a group that campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the United States is withdrawing from the climate pact, the State Department said it is sending a delegation to the Katowice conference. The meeting in Katowice is regarded as a key test of countries' willingness to back their lofty but distant goals with concrete measures, some of which are already drawing fierce protests . At the top of the agenda is the so-called Paris rulebook , which will determine how governments record and report their greenhouse emissions and efforts to cut them. Separately, negotiators will discuss ramping up countries' national emissions targets after 2020, and financial support for poor nations that are struggling to adapt to climate change. The shift away from fossil fuels, which scientists say has to happen by 2050, is expected to require a major overhaul of world economies. ""The good news is that we do know a lot of what we need to be able to do to get there,"" said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute. Waskow, who has followed climate talks for years, said despite the Trump administration's refusal to back this global effort the momentum is going in the right direction. ""It's not one or two players anymore in the international arena,"" he said. ""It's what I think you could call a distributed leadership, where you have a number of countries - some of them small or medium-sized - really making headway and doing it in tandem with cities and states and businesses."" Not far from the meeting venue, Polish anti-coal activists held a small protest Sunday. It was dwarfed by marches in Brussels, Berlin and Cologne over the weekend calling for greater action to curb climate change. German officials had hoped to present a blueprint for the country's exit from coal at the meeting in Katowice, but an expert committee delayed issuing its recommendations until next year. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada82","Moving in the wrong direction; World faces 'impossible'task at post-Paris climate talks","November 29, 2018 Thursday","Timmins Daily Press","Three years after sealing a landmark global climate deal in Paris, world leaders are gathering again to agree on the fine print. The euphoria of 2015 has given way to sober realization that getting an agreement among almost 200 countries, each with their own political and economic demands, will be challenging - as evidenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, citing his ""America First"" mantra. ""Looking from the outside perspective, it's an impossible task,"" Poland's deputy environment minister, Michal Kurtyka, said of the talks he will preside over in Katowice from Dec. 2-14. Top of the agenda will be finalizing the so-called Paris rulebook, which determines how countries have to count their greenhouse gas emissions, transparently report them to the rest of the world and reveal what they are doing to reduce them. Seasoned negotiators are calling the meeting, which is expected to draw 25,000 participants, ""Paris 2.0"" because of the high stakes at play in Katowice. Forest fires from California to Greece, droughts in Germany and Australia, tropical cyclones Mangkhut in the Pacific and Michael in the Atlantic - scientists say this year's extreme weather offers a glimpse of disasters to come if global warming continues unabated. A recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change warned that time is running out if the world wants to achieve the most ambitious target in the Paris agreement - keeping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree C since pre-industrial times and it's on course for another 2-3 degrees of warming by the end of the century unless drastic action is taken. The conference will have ""quite significant consequences for humanity and for the way in which we take care of our planet,"" Kurtyka told the Associated Press ahead of the talks. Experts agree that the Paris goals can only be met by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. But the Paris agreement let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. Overall, the world is heading the wrong way. Last week, the World Meteorological Organization said globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a new record in 2017, while the level of other heat-trapping gases such methane and nitrous oxide also rose. This year is expected to see another 2 per cent increase in human-made emissions, as construction of coal-fired power plants in Asia and Africa continue while carbon-absorbing forests are felled faster than they can regrow. ""Everyone recognized that the national plans, when you add everything up, will take us way beyond 3, potentially 4 degrees Celsius warming,"" said Johan Rockstrom, the incoming director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""We know that we're moving in the wrong direction,"" said Rockstrom. ""We need to bend the global carbon emissions no later than 2020 - in two years'time - to stand a chance to stay under 2 degrees Celsius."" Convincing countries to set new, tougher targets for emissions reduction by 2020 is a key challenge in Katowice. Doing so will entail a transformation of all sectors of their economies, including a complete end to burning fossil fuel. Poor nations want rich countries to pledge the biggest cuts, on the grounds that they're responsible for most of the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Rich countries say they're willing to lead the way, but only if poor nations play their part as well. ""Obviously not all countries are at the same stage of development,"" said Lidia Wojtal, an associate with Berlin-based consultancy Climatekos and a former Polish climate negotiator. ""So we need to also take that into account and differentiate between the responsibilities. And that's a huge task."" Among those likely to be pressing hardest for ambitious measures will be small island nations, which are already facing serious challenges from climate change. Some observers fear nationalist thinking on climate could scupper all hope of meaningful progress in Katowice. Others are more optimistic. ""We will soon see a large enough minority of significant economies moving decisively in the right direction,"" said Rockstrom. ""That can have spillover effects which can be positive."" Poland could end up playing a crucial role in bringing opposing sides together. The country has already presided over three previous rounds of climate talks, and its heavy reliance on carbonintensive coal for energy is forcing Warsaw to mull some tough measures in the years ahead. The 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24 as it's known, is being held on the site of a Katowice mine that was closed in 1999 after 176 years of coal production. Five out of the city's seven collieries have been closed since the 1990s, as Poland phased out communist-era subsidies and moved to a market economy. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

China accuses rich nations of 'backsliding' on climate change aid pledges","December 14, 2018 Friday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","China accused some of the richest nations in the world of ""backsliding"" on pledges to clean up pollution and provide $100 billion a year in climate-related aid by 2020. The comments at a United Nations conference on global warming in Poland spearheaded a push by a group of the 49 Least Developed Countries for clarity on when those promises will be fulfilled. It indicated deepening tensions as the talks that are due to conclude in the industrial city of Katowice on Friday. ""Some delegations we are seeing backsliding,"" Xie Zhenhua, China's lead envoy to the talks in Katowice, said at a briefing on Thursday afternoon. ""There are still quite a number of developed countries who did not start"" providing financial and technological support that they had pledged in the Paris Agreement three years ago. ""We cannot accept any backsliding."" The remarks emphasized the divide on environmental issues between China and the U.S, which had worked together to seal the landmark deal in Paris in 2015. Since then, President Donald Trump vowed to pull out of the deal and worked to boost use of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel.

Developing nations are resisting measures that would ensure transparency in the way greenhouse gas emissions cuts are measured, reported and verified. They want different rules to apply to rich and poor nations, reflecting their varying capabilities.Debate over a new UN Sustainable Development Mechanism was holding up the promise of expanding the world's network of cap-and-trade markets covering carbon emissions.Nations most vulnerable to climate change want more provisions for compensating them for ""loss and damage"" related to more violent weather expected along with rising temperatures. Issues like that derailed the meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. After that, then-President Barack Obama worked closely with Chinese leaders on a voluntary approach toward cutting emissions, which culminated with the Paris deal. Now that Trump has set a different tone, the old friction points at the talks have become more prominent. ""The big difference is that before you had this diplomatic machinery that had been working on the underpinnings for two years, and you had an understanding between the U.S. and China,"" said Alden Meyer, who has been attending the talks for more than two decades for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington-based advocacy group. ""And now, we don't have the U.S. and China working at that same deep level."" In this photo taken Wednesday, Oct. 3, 2018, a bird flies past as smoke emits from the chimneys of Serbia's main coal-fired power station near Kostolac, Serbia. The LDC group and China were joined by the 40-nation Alliance of Small Island States in calling for a ""strengthening global response"" to climate change including a measure that ""scale up finance."" Business leaders attending the talks expressed concern the Katowice Rulebook, which is supposed to emerge from these talks, will be too vague to serve as a guide for how they should cut their own emissions. ""We do need the rulebook because that will reduce the risk that we have and increase the number of regions where we can invest in,"" said Carlos Salle, an official following the talks for Iberdrola SA, Spain's largest utility. Poland, which as host of the meeting has a heavy hand in crafting the outcome, held the talks in a region known for its coal mines to emphasize the importance of that fuel to the global economy. Miners attending the talks objected to the overall drift of the UN effort, which would quickly limit the fuel they produce. This Dec. 1, 2018 photo flags hang outside of the venue for the COP24 global climate talks in Katowice, Poland. ""What is being forced on us is the idea that unless we get rid of coal yesterday, the planet will cease to exist tomorrow - it's not true,"" Jaroslaw Grzesik, deputy head of the mining arm of Poland's Solidarnosc union, said at the talks on Thursday. For his part, Xie from China said he's ""disappointed in the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement."" He rejected the notion that the dispute will hold up the talks saying developing countries ""have been very flexible and constructive"" at the meeting.

Les groupes Environmental Defence et Stand.earth ont profit\'e9 de la COP24 , une rencontre internationale organis\'e9e par les Nations unies, pour publier un nouveau rapport accusant l'industrie du p\'e9trole et du gaz de miner les efforts du Canada en mati\'e8re de climat. Cette industrie emp\'eache le Canada de devenir r\'e9ellement un chef de file mondial dans la lutte contre les changements climatiques, a plaid\'e9 Dale Marshall, directeur national des programmes chez Environmental Defence. Le document reproche aux entreprises de ce secteur d£voir fait des pressions sur le Canada pour qu'il att\'e9nue ses politiques en mati\'e8re de climat et qu'il les exempte des r\'e9glementations - par exemple, celles-ci b\'e9n\'e9ficient d'une plus longue p\'e9riode pour couper leurs \'e9missions de m\'e9thane et jusqu'\'e0 80 pour cent des \'e9missions issues des sables bitumineux ne sont pas soumises \'e0 la tarification sur le carbone. M. Marshall croit que les politiques canadiennes permettent \'e0 la fili\'e8re des sables bitumineux de prendre de l'expansion, d£utant plus que le gouvernement f\'e9d\'e9ral a achet\'e9 l'ol\'e9oduc Trans Mountain. Patrick McDonald, directeur du climat \'e0 l'Association canadienne des producteurs p\'e9troliers, a qualifi\'e9 le rapport \£bd'effort cibl\'e9 de la part de groupes d'int\'e9r\'eats s'int\'e9ressant uniquement \'e0 notre industrie\'bb. M.

Le rapport indique toutefois que les \'e9missions de chaque baril de p\'e9trole produit au Canada ont augment\'e9 de 20 pour cent entre 1990 et 2016. Une solution non viable \'e0 long terme Catherine Abreu, directrice principale de Climate Action Network Canada, a d\'e9clar\'e9 lors d'une conf\'e9rence de presse lundi en Pologne que m\'eame si l'industrie pouvait utiliser la technologie pour r\'e9duire les \'e9missions par unit\'e9 de p\'e9trole, de gaz ou de charbon produite, ce ne serait qu'une solution temporaire dans un monde o\'f9 l'objectif \'e0 long terme doit \'eatre de cesser compl\'e8tement l'utilisation des combustibles fossiles. \£bIl y a beaucoup de pays qui, comme le Canada, semblent avoir l'impression que leurs combustibles fossiles sont en quelque sorte diff\'e9rents de ceux de tous les autres\'bb, a-t-elle soulign\'e9. \£bComme si leur charbon, leur p\'e9trole ou leur gaz naturel \'e9taient magiquement non \'e9metteurs et r\'e9ellement bons pour le climat, alors que les combustibles fossiles de tous les autres sont le probl\'e8me.\'bb L£ccord de Paris, le pacte op\'e9rationnel visant \'e0 \'e9viter le pire des changements climatiques, engageait les pays du monde entier \'e0 r\'e9duire leurs \'e9missions et la quantit\'e9 de pollution par le carbone suffisamment pour emp\'eacher la temp\'e9rature mondiale moyenne d£ugmenter de plus de 2 degr\'e9s Celsius par rapport aux temps pr\'e9industriels. Ils sont cens\'e9s essayer de maintenir l£ugmentation de la temp\'e9rature le plus pr\'e8s possible de 1,5 degr\'e9 Celsius. La diff\'e9rence entre les deux est importante. Avec une augmentation de 2 degr\'e9s Celsius, des millions de personnes suppl\'e9mentaires seraient forc\'e9es \'e0 se d\'e9placer en raison de l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer, des temp\'e9ratures extr\'eames et des temp\'eates violentes. Il y aurait \'e9galement de graves cons\'e9quences sur l£pprovisionnement alimentaire mondial et une plus grande propagation des maladies, selon le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'\'e9volution du climat. \'c0 l'heure actuelle, on est en voie de d\'e9passer les 3 degr\'e9s Celsius d'ici la fin du si\'e8cle. Des efforts insuffisants Le Canada pr\'e9voit actuellement r\'e9duire ses \'e9missions d'environ 200 millions de tonnes par an - ce qui \'e9quivaut \'e0 ce qui est produit par environ 44 millions de voitures - mais un rapport r\'e9cent de l'ONU, r\'e9dig\'e9 par des dizaines de climatologues respect\'e9s, affirmait que s'il voulait r\'e9ellement atteindre la cible des 1,5 degr\'e9 Celsius, il faudrait diminuer les \'e9missions de 400 millions de tonnes. Le secteur p\'e9trolier et gazier est l'un des rares o\'f9 les \'e9missions continuent d£ugmenter au Canada. Tzeporah Berman, directrice des programmes internationaux \'e0 Stand.earth, a indiqu\'e9 que si les \'e9missions du secteur p\'e9trolier continuaient de cro\'eetre, le Canada devrait \£bcontraindre\'bb toutes les autres provinces et industries pour les amener \'e0 r\'e9duire davantage. \'c9tant donn\'e9 que la majeure partie du plan existant concerne les r\'e9ductions les plus faciles et les moins on\'e9reuses, diminuer davantage les \'e9missions de ces secteurs n\'e9cessiterait des r\'e9glementations et des politiques plus on\'e9reuses et plus difficiles, a-t-elle d\'e9clar\'e9.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada88","Curbing our oil and gas addiction will require more than divestment campaigns and industry bashing","September 19, 2018 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","A decade ago, the world's economy was momentarily gutted. As the calamity called the global financial crisis radiated out of Wall Street, the fiscal damage validated an important relationship between economic activity and energy use. There is a tight bond between wealth and the primary commodities that gives us things like light, heat and mobility; I call it the first principle of energy consumption. It simply says that the more money a person makes, the more energy they use. 100 million barrels a day - This time the oil boom really is different( HYPERLINK https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/peter-tertzakian-this-time-the-global-oil-boom-really-is-different https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/peter-tertzakian-this-time-the-global-oil-boom-really-is-different Ditch the scarcity mindset: We're entering a new era of cheap and limitless energy( HYPERLINK https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ditch-the-scarcity-mindset-were-entering-a-new-era-of-cheap-and-limitless-energy https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ditch-the-scarcity-mindset-were-entering-a-new-era-of-cheap-and-limitless-energy ) The first principle works in reverse, too. The easiest way to arrest and reverse energy consumption is to destroy wealth. And that's what the financial crisis did. I was in Southeast Asia when Lehman Brothers was the domino that tipped sideways into the global banking system. Ironically, at the time I was presenting my views on oil demand. One meeting in Singapore was especially memorable. I was presenting to an investor, one-on-one, in a small board room when a bond trader knocked, opened the door and walked into the room. ""May I join you?"" he asked. Not waiting for an answer, he sat down and explained, ""The global credit markets are frozen."" After pausing, he continued, ""Nothing is trading, I have nothing to do, may I listen in?"" When markets freeze it's not a recession, it's a contraction - the economy shrinks. The fallout doesn't take long, only a matter of weeks. Incomes are slashed, widespread unemployment ensues, wealth erodes. A decade on, that causality still lingers in some countries. During a contraction, the economy doesn't just slow down its growth trajectory-say from three per cent GDP down to two per cent - it goes negative. Wealth creation doesn't just ease up, wallets are emptied. Looking back at the numbers, the financial crisis precipitated the first global economic contraction since World War II. Perusing charts of energy demand in tandem, the relationship between wealth destruction and energy use is clear to see. In 2009, the year after crisis began, the worldwide use of all fossil fuels notched down. There were regional variations, of course. Wealthy OECD countries were most affected, while voracious oil consumers like China were only dented. Importantly, the energy sources with the lowest variable costs of supply - hydro, nuclear and renewables - were mostly unscathed. As in any commercial circumstance, broad-based demand reduction is felt first and hardest in the higher-cost end of the spectrum. Ten years ago, natural gas was the most expensive primary fuel to produce, followed by oil then coal. Since then the cost curves for all primary energy sources has dropped, so taking market share away from anyone of them is even harder now. Why is all this important? The Paris Agreement is trying to push every country to transition away from fossil fuels. Yet the financial crisis, an extreme event, teaches us just how hard it is to make a dent in the status quo. When the world's economy is humming with positive growth, consumers tug hard on all primary energy commodities - the uptrends in Figure 1 stubbornly show this fact. Failing banks offered us one surefire way to arrest the growth of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions: Destroy wealth (see Figure 2). Of course, that's a non-starter solution to curbing consumption under any populist political system. My First Principle of Energy Consumption works both ways in the wealth-equals-energy-use calculus. No wonder governments are hesitant to impose policy mechanisms, like massive carbon levies, that threaten to slow down their economies. In reverse, energy-use-equals-wealth. In the lead up to the December COP24 summit in Poland, voices are getting louder that governments need to do more to accelerate renewable energy development and encumber the market for fossil fuels. I don't think it's a bold prediction to say that most governments will be reluctant to do much. Most countries have anxiety about their economic condition, on top of their inner-conflict between wealth creation and energy use. There is a way out. Can wealth be created at the same time as reducing the use of all primary energy sources? The answer is yes, a necessary yes. Over the next several decades, bending the trajectory of demand growth downward is viewed as necessary for sustainability by every forecasting agency. But to do so, the responsibility lies equally on the consumer's shoulders as it does on the supplier's (the emphasis is biased heavily on the latter right now). On the demand side, reducing energy use and ecological damage is a cultural dynamic, an attitude of wanting to do it. Citizens must be part of the solution. It's more than thinking that sci-fi technology, divesting, industry-bashing and government brow-beating will break the trends. Energy is about how we all live, work and play. So the business of energy is everybody's business, not just the suppliers. In the absence of greater consumer participation, we'll have to wait for the next time a bond trader has nothing to do.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada89","Buckle up Muskoka, a climate change political storm is coming","January 3, 2019 Thursday","Bracebridge Examiner","Editor's note: This is the second part of a series of articles on climate change. The COP24 Too often mainstream media reporting misses the big picture entirely, choosing to focus on popular narratives like blaming the U.S. Trump administration - largely for its plan to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement (which actually helps by focusing attention on its serious flaws). The facts show the U.S. has achieved emission declines over the last decade. China is a far bigger problem though. It is responsible for 25 per cent of all emissions (twice that of the second-ranked U.S.A.), and growing much more quickly (largely from increased coal burning). I strongly recommend you read ""The Road from Paris: China's Climate U-Turn"" by Patricia Adams (executive director of Probe International, a Toronto-based NGO) to better understand China's real goals, and the games it plays. The Globe and Mail columnist Gary Mason nicely summarized it in his recent column ""China's great leap backward on climate change,"" quoting Adams: ""With green energy an abject failure in terms of meeting China's need for either energy or clean air, all that's left is propaganda."" Yet, China is far from alone. Behind them are many fast-growing countries with rapidly developing middle-classes, and like China, none committing to emission reductions. China is helping them industrialize, with massive investments like their trillion dollar Belt and Road initiative, which will build pipelines, ports, railways and power facilities (including many of the 700 coal-powered plants per my previous article) in more than 70 countries. The China economic 'miracle' was, and continues to be, fuelled by carbon-based energy. It took 200 years to place about three billion people into the middle-class; it will take just 20 years to double it (mostly in Asia-Pacific). This, plus two billion people in global population growth, drives the 27 per cent global increase in energy demand forecasted over the next 20 years. Unfortunately, the risks of man made climate change turns the miracle of carbon-based energy into a global zero-sum game. Achieving the new IPCC 2040 targets means replacing all carbon-based energy (81 per cent of all energy globally) and retiring nuclear energy with zero-emission energy. With hydropower tapped out, and biomass not being zero-emission, that leaves the 1 per cent green renewable sector expected to fill the entire energy gap. This requires the sector share to grow at least 25 per cent each year for the next 20 years. To understand how unrealistic this is, China saw just 0.7 per cent share growth in the sector last year. Also note, the power grids' renewables energy cap would be reached long before the energy gap is closed. The reality is that nuclear-based energy remains today's only viable zero-carbon energy source able to scale and replace all carbon-based energy. It's sad that the Canadian government, in listening too much to environmental lobbyists, has significantly diminished our nuclear power industry over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, they are far from alone. The International Energy Agency understands this big picture, and has only lowered the 2040 global energy carbon-based energy share forecast to 74 per cent, far from the zero per cent IPCC target. Broadly speaking, governments have these five big levers to reduce carbon emissions (roughly ordered in decreasing impact and political risk/challenge): 1. Limit overall energy demand (and deforestation) by slowing/restricting population and economic growth. 2. Limit carbon-based energy supplies (i.e. stopping pipelines, shutting down carbon-based fuel extraction, closing carbon-based power plants). 3. Large new investments in nuclear energy and electric power grids (improving efficiencies, capacity, flexibility, interconnections). 4. Reduce carbon-based energy demand by driving their costs way up (i.e. new taxes) or by significantly reducing costs of greener alternatives through large incentives or subsidies. 5. Reduce overall energy demand through efficiency incentives and subsidies. It's understood that these tough actions come with enormous costs and political risk - modest actions on levers 2 and 4 are already hitting political walls, 1 is hard to see any government undertaking, and 3 (nuclear) requires acceptance of largely unpopular risks. Short of non-existent massive carbon removal or high-risk geoengineering schemes, the new IPCC targets and timelines look impossible to reach. However, that doesn't mean we should do nothing. The risks and costs will only rise. While some countries are struggling to find an acceptable balance (avoiding massive public backlash), others are all talk and little action.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada91","Almost 200 countries back universal emissions rules at UN climate talks","December 15, 2018 Saturday","Postmedia Breaking News","KATOWICE, Poland - Nearly 200 countries at the UN climate talks have agreed upon universal, transparent rules on how nations can cut greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming, putting the principles of the 2015 Paris climate accord into action. But to the frustration of environmentalists and a group of countries who were urging more ambitious climate goals, negotiators on Saturday delayed decisions on two other climate issues until next year in an effort to get a deal on them. ""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official chairing the talks. He said while each individual country would likely find some parts of the agreement it didn't like, efforts had been made to balance the interests of all parties. ""We will all have to give in order to gain,"" he said. ""We will all have to be courageous to look into the future and make yet another step for the sake of humanity."" The talks in Poland took place against a backdrop of growing concern among scientists that global warming on Earth is proceeding faster than governments are responding to it. Last month, a study found that global warming will worsen disasters such as the deadly California wildfires and the powerful hurricanes that have hit the United States this year. President Michal Kurtyka poses for a photo after adopting the final agreement during a closing session of the COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018. And a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it's possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels. Alarmed by efforts to include this in the final text of the meeting, the oil-exporting nations of the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait blocked an endorsement of the IPCC report mid-way through this month's talks in the Polish city of Katowice. That prompted uproar from vulnerable countries like small island nations and environmental groups. The final text at the UN talks omits a previous reference to specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the ""timely completion"" of the IPCC report, not its conclusions. Last-minute snags forced negotiators in Katowice to go into extra time, after Friday's scheduled end of the conference had passed without a deal. One major sticking point was how to create a functioning market in carbon credits. Economists believe that an international trading system could be an effective way to drive down greenhouse gas emissions and raise large amounts of money for measures to curb global warming. But Brazil wanted to keep the piles of carbon credits it had amassed under an old system that developed countries say wasn't credible or transparent. Among those that pushed back hardest was the United States, despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and his promotion of coal as a source of energy. ""Overall, the U.S. role here has been somewhat schizophrenic - pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,"" said Elliot Diringer of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Washington think-tank. A worker dismantles the exhibition pavilion of Austria as the UN Climate conference draws to a close, as negotiators from almost 200 countries continue haggling over the fine print of the Paris climate accord in Katowice, Poland, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018. When it came to closing potential loopholes that could allow countries to dodge their commitments to cut emissions, ""the U.S. pushed harder than nearly anyone else for transparency rules that put all countries under the same system, and it's largely succeeded."" ""Transparency is vital to U.S. interests,"" added Nathaniel Keohane, a climate policy expert at the Environmental Defence Fund. He noted that breakthrough in the 2015 Paris talks happened only after the U.S. and China agreed on a common framework for transparency. ""In Katowice, the U.S. negotiators have played a central role in the talks, helping to broker an outcome that is true to the Paris vision of a common transparency framework for all countries that also provides flexibility for those that need it,"" said Keohane, calling the agreement ""a vital step forward in realizing the promise of the Paris accord."" Among the key achievements in Katowice was an agreement on how countries should report their greenhouses gas emissions and the efforts they're taking to reduce them. Poor countries also secured assurances on getting greater predictability about financial support to help them cut emissions, adapt to inevitable changes such as sea level rises and pay for damages that have already happened.

""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up to the urgent call of the IPCC report"" on the dire consequences of global warming. In the end, a decision on the mechanics of an emissions trading system was postponed to next year's meeting. Countries also agreed to consider the issue of raising ambitions at a UN summit in New York next September.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada92","World faces 'impossible' task at post-Paris climate talks","November 28, 2018 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","KATOWICE, Poland - Three years after sealing a landmark global climate deal in Paris, world leaders are gathering again to agree on the fine print. The euphoria of 2015 has given way to sober realization that getting an agreement among almost 200 countries, each with their own political and economic demands, will be challenging - as evidenced by President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, citing his ""America First"" mantra. ""Looking from the outside perspective, it's an impossible task,"" Poland's deputy environment minister, Michal Kurtyka, said of the talks he will preside over in Katowice from Dec. 2-14. Top of the agenda will be finalizing the so-called Paris rulebook, which determines how countries have to count their greenhouse gas emissions, transparently report them to the rest of the world and reveal what they are doing to reduce them. Seasoned negotiators are calling the meeting, which is expected to draw 25,000 participants, ""Paris 2.0"" because of the high stakes at play in Katowice. Forest fires from California to Greece, droughts in Germany and Australia, tropical cyclones Mangkhut in the Pacific and Michael in the Atlantic - scientists say this year's extreme weather offers a glimpse of disasters to come if global warming continues unabated. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that time is running out if the world wants to achieve the most ambitious target in the Paris agreement - keeping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree C since pre-industrial times and it's on course for another 2-3 degrees of warming by the end of the century unless drastic action is taken. The conference will have ""quite significant consequences for humanity and for the way in which we take care of our planet,"" Kurtyka told the Associated Press ahead of the talks. Experts agree that the Paris goals can only be met by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. But the Paris agreement let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. Overall, the world is heading the wrong way. Last week, the World Meteorological Organization said globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a new record in 2017, while the level of other heat-trapping gases such methane and nitrous oxide also rose. This year is expected to see another 2 per cent increase in human-made emissions, as construction of coal-fired power plants in Asia and Africa continue while carbon-absorbing forests are felled faster than they can regrow. ""Everyone recognized that the national plans, when you add everything up, will take us way beyond 3, potentially 4 degrees Celsius warming,"" said Johan Rockstrom, the incoming director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""We know that we're moving in the wrong direction,"" Rockstrom told the AP. ""We need to bend the global carbon emissions no later than 2020 - in two years' time - to stand a chance to stay under 2 degrees Celsius."" Doing so will entail a transformation of all sectors of their economies, including a complete end to burning fossil fuel. Poor nations want rich countries to pledge the biggest cuts, on the grounds that they're responsible for most of the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Rich countries say they're willing to lead the way, but only if poor nations play their part as well. ""Obviously not all countries are at the same stage of development,"" said Lidia Wojtal, an associate with Berlin-based consultancy Climatekos and a former Polish climate negotiator. ""So we need to also take that into account and differentiate between the responsibilities. And that's a huge task."" Among those likely to be pressing hardest for ambitious measures will be small island nations , which are already facing serious challenges from climate change. The U.S., meanwhile, is far from being the driving force it was during the Paris talks under President Barack Obama. Brazil and Australia, previously staunch backers of the accord, appear to be following in Trump's footsteps . Some observers fear nationalist thinking on climate could scupper all hope of meaningful progress in Katowice. Others are more optimistic. ""We will soon see a large enough minority of significant economies moving decisively in the right direction,"" said Rockstrom. ""That can have spillover effects which can be positive."" Poland could end up playing a crucial role in bringing opposing sides together. The country has already presided over three previous rounds of climate talks, and its heavy reliance on carbon-intensive coal for energy is forcing Warsaw to mull some tough measures in the years ahead. The 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24 as it's known, is being held on the site of a Katowice mine that was closed in 1999 after 176 years of coal production. Five out of the city's seven collieries have been closed since the 1990s, as Poland phased out communist-era subsidies and moved to a market economy. Yet elsewhere in the city, 1,500 miners still extract thousands of tons of coal daily. Poland also still depends on coal for some 80 per cent of its energy needs. Poland intends to send a signal that the miners' futures, and those of millions of others whose jobs are at risk from decarbonization, are not being forgotten. During the first week of talks, leaders are expected to sign a Polish-backed declaration calling for a 'just transition' that will ""create quality jobs in regions affected by transition to a low-carbon economy."" Then negotiators will get down to the gritty task of trimming a 300-page draft into a workable and meaningful agreement that governments can sign off on at the end of the second week. ""(I) hope that parties will be able to reach a compromise and that we will be able to say that Katowice contributed positively to this global effort,"" Kurtyka said. -- Jordans reported from Berlin. -- Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at HYPERLINK http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter HYPERLINK http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter -- Read more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climate https://www.apnews.com/Climate HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climate https://www.apnews.com/Climate \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada93","Poles want coal jobs protected amid green energy shift; Poles want coal jobs protected amid green energy shift","August 9, 2018 Thursday 02:28 PM EST","Canadian Press","WARSAW, Poland - Polish trade union leaders and government officials at a climate conference called Thursday for nations to protect industrial jobs and be given the freedom to choose their own approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The two-day meeting that opened in Katowice aimed to work out the positions of Poland's trade unions and industry before an international climate summit in December taking place in the industrial city. Poland chose to host the COP-24 summit in Katowice to show how this former coal-mining city has been turned into an environment-friendly one in the almost-three decades after the collapse of communism and after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. At the Dec. 3-14 summit, more than 190 countries taking part in the 2015 Paris Agreement are to work out a rulebook for implementing the landmark climate accord. Participants at the Poland conference said nations should be allowed to choose their own ways of cutting carbon emissions in accordance with their industrialization and reliance on fossil fuels. They said developing economies should not be forced to cut jobs. ""Those member countries in Europe that have a chance for a modern development and for modern industry, they should get support, on the condition it really is modern industry that will preserve the region's jobs,"" Deputy Energy Minister Grzegorz Tobiszowski said. Since 1990, Poland has cut over 300,000 coal mining jobs, to some 83,000 currently, and has also scaled down coal extraction to some 65 million tons from 147 million tons. However, the industry remains one of the major employers in Poland and consecutive governments have vowed to protect it, while still modernizing it and making it more environment-friendly. Some 80 per cent of Poland's energy comes from coal, some 15 per cent comes from renewable sources and 5 per cent is from gas. By 2030, the government has pledged to cut coal to some 49 per cent of the country's energy mix. Tomasz Rogala, the head of the European Association for Coal and Lignite, said that last year the EU imported 173 million tons of coal, an amount that could have provided some 175,000 jobs in Europe. Among the issues for the two-week summit in December are how to ensure transparent monitoring of what countries do to cut their global emissions and the methods used to take stock of what countries have achieved. It is also expected that the governments will hear that their current national pledges won't be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, and should therefore raise their ambitions. While U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the 2015 Paris accord, the rest of the world remains committed to the deal. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada94","Protesters block Johnson Street Bridge to highlight need for action on climate change","December 3, 2018 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","With the aim of pressuring governments to take action on climate change, about 200 people staged a sit-in on the Johnson Street Bridge Monday evening, shutting it down to traffic during the evening commute. Victoria police diverted traffic away from Pandora Avenue, allowing the group to walk from Centennial Square to the bridge. Cars were held at Wharf Street as the group approached the bridge at 6:07 p.m. Protesters carried banners that said ""we will defend our coastline"" and chanted ""this land is truly sacred."" First Nations elder Rose Henry lightly tapped a drum as protesters sat on the pavement in a circle holding candles. The march was timed to coincide with COP 24 , the annual UN climate change conference which started Monday in Poland. The bridge blockade was meant to last 12 minutes, representing the 12 years organizers say is left to address the climate crisis. However, by 6:40 p.m. the group remained on the bridge, singing songs and listening to speakers. In October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a sobering report, which shows the world is on track to warm up by 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2040. That could cause polar ice caps to melt faster, leading to rising seas which could displace people around the globe. There's also a prediction for more extreme weather, playing a role in wildfires that have ravaged communities across British Columbia and California. Marchers carried candles which shone against the blue lights of the bridge. The crowd was hushed for two minutes to reflect on the depth of the climate emergency. Similar rallies were held across the United Kingdom and Australia last month to highlight government inaction on global climate change. In London, more than 6,000 people blocked five key bridges on Nov. 17, resulting in the arrest of 85 people. Victoria police said earlier they would not close the bridge to facilitate the protesters' actions. Keith Cherry, organizer for Rise and Resist!, said the idea of disrupting the daily commute will send a message to the federal and provincial governments that ""business as usual is not good enough."" Cherry criticized the decision by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to spend $4.5 billion to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan and the fact that British Columbia continues to push liquified natural gas instead of renewable energy sources. ""Both governments are implicated in pushing fossil fuel expansion at a time we can't afford."" Protesters handed out flyers and thanked waiting drivers for their patience. ""When people are asking to weigh the climate change catastrophe that will be facing our children and grandchildren with the fact that drivers might be asked to wait a few minutes on their evening commute, we think it's a small price to pay,"" Cherry said before the march. A poll released Monday suggests a majority of Canadians are complacent about changing their behaviour to fight climate change. In the Forum Research survey, 62 per cent said they were aware or very aware of the federal government's carbon pricing plan, but 53 per cent said it wouldn't change their behaviour. However, almost half of the respondents - 49 per cent - said they would accept a two to five per cent hike in their costs to help mitigate the effects of climate change. - With files from The Canadian Press \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada96","Key terms and issue at this year's global climate summit; Key terms and issue at this year's global climate summit","December 1, 2018 Saturday 03:24 AM EST","Canadian Press","KATOWICE, Poland - Negotiators are gathering in Katowice, Poland, for the annual U.N. climate summit, known informally as COP 24 . It is the most important international meeting for countries to discuss and co-ordinate the fight against global warming. Here is a look at some of the key issues and terms that will come up at the event, which starts Sunday and ends on Dec. 14: COP The acronym stands for Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Held for the first time in 1995, the COP also acts at the meeting of parties to the 1992 Kyoto Protocol that first committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the 2015 Paris Agreement. The term ""Paris"" is often used to refer to the accord's headline goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times, and if possible to limit the increase to 1.5 C (2.7 F). PARIS RULEBOOK When leaders approved the 2015 accord, they put aside a lot of questions about the finer details of how the agreement would work. The meeting in Katowice is meant to finalize those details, including how countries will collect and transparently report their greenhouse gas emissions, and keep track of efforts to reduce them. NDCs Rather than set a global target for emissions cuts, the Paris Agreement allowed countries to submit their own goals, known as Nationally Determined Contributions. It was recognized that all the initial national targets together wouldn't be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees C, so the Paris accord requires countries to keep raising their goals over time. The next set of NDCs for the period after 2020 needs to be submitted within the next two years. An overview of submissions so far can be found here . TALANOA DIALOGUE To encourage countries to keep raising their NDCs, regular discussions are held among all parties to the Paris Agreement. These review what's been achieved so far and what needs to be done next. As part of its presidency of last year's climate meeting, Fiji introduced the notion of ""talanoa,"" a form of open conversation rooted in the Pacific island's culture that's intended to allow participants to share their stories and learn from each other. It's hoped that the so-called Talanoa Dialogue will allow countries to discuss sensitive issues without resorting to blaming others. GLOBAL STOCK-TAKE Once every five years, countries are meant to summarize the world's overall progress toward achieving the Paris goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees C - if not 1.5 C. The first such global stock-take was meant to happen in 2023. But because the Paris accord was ratified so quickly, this year's meeting is regarded as the first, albeit unofficial global stock-take. CLIMATE FINANCE Curbing global warming is expected to require a vast overhaul of the world's economy, as countries shift from using fossil fuels to using clean sources of energy to heat homes, manufacture goods and power all manner of devices from cars to computers. Rich countries have the resources to pay for this transition but many poor countries don't. To ensure that they, too, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions large sums of money will need to flow from rich to poor countries. Aside from using the money to ""green"" their economies, developing nations will also need funds to adapt to the inevitable consequences of climate change, such as sea level rise, which are predicted to hit poor countries hardest. \"

The vote also reflects the fact that America is still over 80 per cent dependent on fossil fuels -and helps explain why a misguided Republican Carlos Curbelo of Florida was able to convince only one colleague (Republican Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania) to co-sponsor his carbon tax bill back in July. In the meantime, Doug Ford became Ontario's new premier in part by vigorously opposing the carbon taxes, and pricey wind and solar electricity that many Canadians have come to despise. He quickly eliminated $2 billion in taxes a year by cancelling 200 heavily subsidized renewable energy projects implemented by his predecessor. Meanwhile, the federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces increased resistance to its plans for a steadily escalating carbon tax. In Australia, Angus Taylor's appointment as Energy minister means wind and solar subsidies will soon be terminated. This will undoubtedly delight residents of South Australia, home of a 50 per cent renewable energy program, the world's highest electricity prices, two weeks of zero wind/zero electricity in two years, and some 200,000 families no longer able to afford electricity. Germany's solar industry is collapsing as its subsidies plummet; its wind turbine subsidies are scheduled to end in 2020; ancient villages and forests have been bulldozed to allow coal mining to fuel its new generating plants; and the country's Green Party has admitted that ""de-carbonizing"" the German and world economies can be accomplished only by limiting or eliminating democracy worldwide. And yet, like Dracula monsters, carbon tax proposals keep rising from the dead. Several big corporations, U.S. Republican officials Jim Baker, Hank Paulson and George Schultz, and their Climate Leadership Council now claim that 56 per cent of American voters support taxing carbon, while only 26% oppose the idea. So says their recent survey. How is that possible? To begin with, they didn't call it a tax. They cleverly labelled their scheme a ""carbon dividend"" (who doesn't like dividends?) and claimed ""the vast majority of American families"" would somehow come out ahead if it's implemented. The survey didn't mention that their program would be administered by the ever-friendly Internal Revenue Service or that the tax would begin at US$43 per tonne of 'carbon' emitted. (Trudeau's hated tax begins at C$10 per tonne and rises to $C50 by 2022.) They didn't mention that the tax would be imposed on foundries, factories, refineries, coaland gas-fired power plants, other industrial facilities, and even (at a lower rate) on products imported from other countries. Equally important, constant assurances that market-based carbon tax schemes like this US$43-per-tonne version would be 'revenue neutral,'receipts would be returned to taxpayers in the form of tax reductions elsewhere, and revenues would be used to reduce federal budget deficits are illusory. Can the council somehow guarantee that the next Congress will not (promptly) reverse these netgain provisions? But let's get to the nuts and bolts of carbon taxes and 'clean, green, renewable' energy. As MIT emeritus professor of atmospheric physics Richard Lindzen points out, those who control carbon control life. And make no mistake, these are taxes on carbon-based fuels: on 83 per cent of the energy we use. They are taxes on everything we make, ship, eat and do -on our lives, livelihoods, living standards, transportation, heating, cooling, refrigeration, healthcare, clothing and everything else we touch. By using the word 'carbon,'tax proponents deceptively suggest they want to tax soot, pollution, toxic emissions. But with modern scrubbers and other pollution controls, what comes out of power plant and factory 'smoke stacks'today is almost entirely water vapour and carbon dioxide. Fossil fuels are what made our health and economic progress over the past 150 years possible -and continue to do so. Carbon (coal, oil and natural gas) is what we burn to generate electricity, power factories and operate vehicles. Carbon dioxide is what's created and emitted by that combustion process. So these climate leadership members want to tax carbon dioxide: the gas of life, the miracle molecule that we exhale and that makes life on Earth possible. In fact, the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the faster and better food crop, forest and grassland plants grow; the better they survive droughts, diseases and viruses. Rising atmospheric CO2 levels are actually greening the Earth, including forests worldwide. The council's goal is to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and force a transition to wind, solar, ethanol and other 'renewable' energy. In the process, the activists, politicians, lobbyists and crony corporatists expect to get incredibly wealthy and gain increasing control over global economies and living standards. How would US$43 per tonne of carbon dioxide affect you? It would raise your electricity and gasoline costs to the exorbitant rates families and businesses already pay in California, Denmark and Germany. Every aspect of your lives would be impacted. Millions of jobs would be lost. To top it off, all this incredible pain and lost liberty would bring no climate benefits. Even assuming for the sake of argument that carbon dioxide has replaced the sun and other powerful natural forces that do control Earth's climate -poor nations are burning more carbon fuels every year, emitting more CO2 and other greenhouse gases, and building or planning to build some 1,600 new coal-fired power plants. It is sheer nonsense to claim that 400 ppm CO2 and another 1 degree C of global warming will bring ""unprecedented cataclysms"" and ""existential threats"" to people and planet. Carbon dioxide has some effect, but saying it controls the climate ignores five Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods, the Roman and Medieval Warm Periods, the Little Ice Age, the Dust Bowl and Anasazi drought, the record 12 years of no major hurricanes making U.S. landfall, and other natural weather and climate changes. Scientists simply don't know enough about Earth's climate or what caused past climate fluctuations even to separate current human influences from natural influences -much less predict future changes. Poor countries signed onto Paris climate treaty because they expected to get $100 billion every year in ""climate adaptation and mitigation"" money from currently wealthy countries that the treaty says must slash their fossil fuel use, carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth and living standards -while now-poor nations dramatically increase theirs. With rich countries unable and refusing to pay up, the treaty is likely to implode like the house of cards it is, before or during the COP24 summit in December in Katowice, Poland. Last but not least, renewable energy is not renewable, clean, green or sustainable. Manufacturing wind turbines, solar panels, backup batteries and ultralong transmission lines requires removing billions of tonnes of rock and earth to extract and process millions of tonnes of exotic ores, limestone, iron, manganese, copper, petroleum-based fibreglass and composites, and other materials -all using fossil fuels. The vital exotics come from Mongolia, China and Congo, under minimal to nonexistent environmental, health and safety standards. But that's somebody else's backyard, so virtue-preening climate activists can just ignore the emissions, habitat destruction, water pollution, health effects and premature deaths. No wonder alarmists are ranting nonstop at their global climate action circus, devoting US$1 billion a year to climate activism and 'education'to advance their radical agenda, draft laws and regulations, and attack and even prosecute climate chaos skeptics. This abuse of government law enforcement powers and taxpayer dollars must end. What needs to be kept in the ground is not the fossil fuels that make modern health and living standards possible, while spurring plant growth. It's carbon tax proposals, preferably with large wooden stakes driven through their hearts. May sanity and reality yet prevail.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada99","Suncors Williams A Climate Accord Architect Feels \u732 Incredibly Optimistic About Industrys Future","June 6, 2018 Wednesday","Daily Oil Bulletin","When leaders of a group of oilsands producers stood with environmental organizations, sharing a stage with Alberta Premier Rachel Notley as she announced an extraordinary provincial climate accord in November 2015, few were aware of the marathon of negotiations and depth of conciliation that had led up to that unprecedented moment. It was no easy process, according to Steve Williams, Suncor Energy Inc. president and CEO, who was involved from the start. The deal hammered out would see an economy-wide carbon levy accompanied by a 100 million tonne CO2 emissions cap applied to the provinces oilsands extraction sector. The unlikely agreement drew praise from organizations as diverse as the sectors main lobby, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, to Pembina Institute, the David Suzuki Foundation and even Al Gore, former United States vice president and climate change campaigner. However, it came only after monumental efforts on all sides to reach a consensus, Williams recalled at the Energy Disruptors Unite conference in Calgary recently. It was a brutally tough process. It took us two years. We had to be hidden from sight, we were doing it on weekends, we were doing it at nights in dark rooms. We had to  eat a lot of unreasonable things that we all brought into the room. We had to get past that, but now, three or four years later, when I go into climate change discussions, Canada is viewed to be the leader in the world now, he said. The oilsands is the first reservoir in the world to have a CO2 cap put on its development, and all of that was developed by co-operation. So its brutally tough [to do], it takes really courageous and bright people to do it, but it can work, he added in a wide-ranging  fireside chat-style interview with Emergent CEO Holly Ransom. In a sense, the deal was the result of a go-around initially circumventing politicians with their polarized positions on the issue, Williams said in a detailed discussion of the arrangement. In this particular example, we found that it turns out politicians are quite extreme. Its very difficult for them to occupy what I call that  common sense space in the middle. If you talk to politicians they will talk about wedge issues and what they really mean is,  How do we drive a wedge between this group and that group? or NGOs (non-governmental organizations) who will take an item and make it so extreme that normal people cant talk about it, or companies which might do the same. I am not attributing it to any particular group, but what we have found is, that doesnt actually make any progress. So I said,  Ill tell you what well do, well work with the NGOs and we will try and get as far as we can on a science-based, reason-based solution. And we did. They started by looking at the big picture, said Williams. The journey started with [asking], how do we supply energy to seven billion people, or how do we provide energy at a cost which enables more people to get food, to get medicine, that requires real fixes and real solutions and real pragmatism, and thats a much more difficult world to work in. So we sat down with the leaders of the worlds NGOs, and it took us a couple of years to have that debate, and what we found was, we were starting from very different positions but our values were very similar. It turns out we all actually care about the community we live in, we all want the better place for our children and our grandchildren. We found some areas where we could start to get closer together, and then we started to really look at the issue. The Canadian energy sector, it turns out, is at the bleeding edge of that world, he said, and the Suncor CEO worked hard among industry partners as well as NGOs to break that paradigm particularly in the oilsands and in the oil and gas world. With a consensus at hand, the changing of the guard in Edmonton and Ottawa helped break the logjam politically, Williams said. We said,  OK, [the agreement] is great but its in a vacuum  we need it to be enacted into public policy, and into law for it to become effective. It became three or four companies, [and] half a dozen NGOs putting together some policy, [then] getting politicians to take it on. And partly because of the fortune of governments changing in Alberta and then in Canada nationally, we were able to get that adopted very quickly. Thats become the basis of the leading best practice on the planet now for climate change and carbon regulation.  Incredibly optimistic Asked what gives him the greatest cause for optimism, and the biggest challenge on the journey there, the leader of Canadas biggest oil and gas company said he remains incredibly optimistic around the industrys future. When I look I see first of all great innovation and creativity in the right places where it really matters. We have the leading edge [of] \£6 the worlds best innovation organizations in Alberta, in Canada. One of them, COSIA (Canadas Oil Sands Innovation Alliance), which is around environmental development, has put $1.4 billion [into R&D] from the [member] companies. We have had 1,000 pieces of intellectual property developed and its pushing the boundaries of science back and its a model for the world about how to do that. We are starting to solve some of these big issues. CO2 is probably the toughest and will take us the longest. In fact, of the four focus areas of COSIA  water consumption, land disturbance, tailings and greenhouse gas emissions  three of those four are on their way to being solved, Williams told the conference. We now use a fraction of the water we used to\£6. We believe we are in the throes of developing the technology to solve [the tailings] issue, not just for Canada, but for the whole of the mining world. We have now completely reclaimed the first of the tailings ponds and its trafficable and its now a nature reserve. But greenhouse gas emissions remain a tough problem to solve, he said. There is climate change happening [and] we have to start to address it, so we have to start to make progress in this energy journey that we are on, said Williams, who was invited to attend the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris as an official member of Canadas delegation. Its a planetary challenge because its not a local issue  the climate doesnt care whether it [emissions] comes from Canada or it comes from China, it has a warming effect around the earth. We are starting to make real progress there, but I can see tons of things we can do right now. Some of them are outside [the conference centre]  some of the vehicles that are here. If you really want to get to it fast, there are steps we can take around fuel quality, around engine efficiency, that we can be implementing right now. We have known how to have much more efficient engines than we have on this continent for the last 30 years, and they havent been used. We know how to do that; we should be taking those steps, said Williams, who sits on the advisory board of Canadas Ecofiscal Commission and supports a countrywide price on carbon. Divisive debate slowing progress Part of the problem, though, is the division within the debate, he reiterated. The biggest barrier is this polarized, confrontational approach which doesnt take us forward, he said. I have been involved in the climate change conversation since the 70s and its made very poor progress by any measure. We can talk about the conferences, we can talk about Paris, but actually look at the CO2 emitted in the world; we havent made much progress. While the debate may have stalled, he said the Canadian oilpatch has been making strides, due largely to technological innovation. Williams noted that Suncor uses 50 per cent less energy per bbl than it did 10 years ago and is on track to use 30 per cent less by 2030. We think we have got the technology already to do it, so those bits of technology require development and then real action to take, and we have got to start moving into that solution space. I came to Canada 16 years ago, and [at that time] the oilsands was viewed to be highly environmentally invasive, and very high cost. Today, its now one of the low cost sectors in the industry ... and every day we get better in terms of our carbon footprint. [Suncors new $17-billion Fort Hills oilsands mine] has a carbon footprint, from how we take it out of the ground to being consumed by a customer, which is lower than the average barrel on this continent, he said. It has also been a journey that has seen costs fall from around $40 a bbl a decade ago to just above $20 today, and I can see it down into the teens, Williams said. We are now one of the lowest cost operators, so for [Fort Hills], for the next 50 years I can produce a bbl of oil for $20 a bbl  thats $20 Canadian. The rest of the world will struggle to compete with that because it has to look at its full investment cycle as well as its operation. Our resources are vast and long-term, so we wont be price setters, [but] we can be the low cost setter and my honest belief is that we will be one of the last barrels of oil produced, by choice, for the world. Its been a journey of scale, of better technology, of getting clever at what you do, having to be far smarter  and thats why the future is so optimistic. The future is digital The applications of digital technology  or artificial intelligence or machine learning  the ability to adopt that in a capital-intensive, data-intensive industry like ours is vast, he said. Its going to have a massive impact on us. We are having to drag ourselves up the learning curve, because although we do all of those things, we have still got a ton to learn about it. So the whole of the top team of Suncor, we are teaching ourselves about artificial intelligence. The whole team has just been down to Seattle with Microsoft and Boeing to look at some of their stuff. I spent a week down in Silicon Valley last year looking at what Facebook and Google can teach us. And I think you never get there  its just a realization that there is so much more you can do. The ability of us to use the data we already have to much more beneficial results is becoming clear  so I think that is where we will see the biggest breakthroughs. Autonomous heavy haulers Williams pointed to the introduction of autonomous heavy haulers in oilsands mining operations, which it anticipates will reduce operating costs by five to 10 per cent, as one successful implementation of digital technology. With more than 150 haulers on the way, Suncor is rolling out the first fully autonomous heavy vehicle fleet in North America. Its just amazing to watch. What it means is, the trucks operate all the time  they only stop to be fuelled, [and] they dont break down so often. We used to have a paradigm where our trucks were best driven by females, because females are better drivers than men are if they are [driving] large vehicles because they drive them more sympathetically than men do. But the bad news is the completely autonomous ones are even better. They drive almost perfectly, they accelerate perfectly, they brake perfectly, they dont bump into things. The biggest problem we have with them  these things are the size of a jumbo jet  is they are so accurate they carve a hole in the road, so we have to move them over a few millimetres every [cycle] so they actually flatten the road rather than digging a hole in the road. So the ability to adapt and take on these technologies is what is going to be the key. Overall, digitalization will have an impact on jobs, but is unlikely to reduce them for decades, he added. The societal question is, what does it mean to us all if we dont need so many people to do the jobs? Is it good or bad? I think both of those are true. I have no doubt that automating a truck means I dont need a driver, but I do need other skills. Some people talk about this as the fourth industrial revolution. If I look at the first three, the net result has been more jobs, so I think the two will be in tension. I suspect there is a crossover coming, in the next 50 to 100 years, where we will be so efficient we wont need everybody to work the way we have been used to working. Democracy under threat Responding to a question about the extent of polarization of the conversation around energy and the environment in an increasingly fragmented social media environment, Williams said he thought the very question nailed it. I think you just put your finger on what the issue is. Communication is so effective, it happens so quickly, that if you have a noisy minority they drown out everybody else. There are bigger questions than just energy disruption  I think democracy itself is at threat, he continued. Does it work in a world where a few people can have such a massive input? It was [U.K. Prime Minister Winston] Churchill who had that expression, that all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good people to stay silent. And so if we go away with something, we have got to stop being silent. Whether its political extreme, industrial extreme, whether its a company doing it or a CEO doing it, or an NGO doing it, we cant let people use these communications mechanisms to huge effect, said Williams. They are not representing us anymore. So I think it is a threat and I am not sure what the answer is. Ending on a more positive note, he urged conference goers to get involved and concentrate in that solution space. Its not enough to be on the outside talking about somebody else doing it, or not doing it; its important for us to get in that space. And I think if we can do that we can make this a much better place. And have an open mind, Williams advised. The toughest thing in the world to do is to compromise. Its the easiest thing in the world to take a position and be intransigent. The most difficult thing is to enter a space and be willing to give something up. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada100","Protesters block Johnson Street Bridge for climate change rally, six arrested","December 3, 2018 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","Six climate-change protesters were arrested Monday night for refusing to leave the Johnson Street Bridge roadway an hour after most had dispersed from a sit-in that disrupted motor traffic during the evening commute. Victoria police officers moved in just before 8 p.m. to arrest the six people, who sat cross-legged and linked arms as an officer read them their rights. Their supporters lined the pedestrian walkway, chanting ""climate action is not a crime"" and cheering as one by one, the protesters were led into a police van. The arrests were peaceful and methodical and took place after an hour of verbal negotiation with police. The march, which aimed to highlight government inaction on climate change, was meant to block the bridge for 12 minutes starting at 6:07 p.m. but carried on until 7 p.m. with songs, speeches and chants. Most people started to disperse but Howard Breen announced that he was going to continue sitting on the bridge even though he knew he was risking arrest. Five others joined him. Organizer Keith Cherry said he accepts that people have a variety of tactics when calling for action on climate change. ""I think it's a great outcome because it shows how serious people are,"" Cherry said of the arrests. ""These aren't hardened criminals being arrested, these are seniors and students, office workers and parents. They're ordinary folk and they feel this strongly."" About 200 people left Centennial Square around 6 p.m., marching down Pandora toward the Johnson Street Bridge. Victoria police diverted traffic from Pandora Avenue and stopped cars at Wharf Street from driving onto the bridge. On social media, many expressed frustration at the bridge closing with some saying there are other ways to draw attention to climate change inaction. Victoria police said earlier they would not close the bridge to facilitate the protesters' actions. Gail Meston, a 67-year-old Fairfield resident whose bike was adorned with a sign that read ""Pipelines are a dead end,"" said she was concerned about the traffic blockade when told about the protest plan. ""We were concerned about disrupting the traffic,"" she said. ""But we're also very concerned about climate change and I think more and more it's being called climate disruption. We need to take note of that and do what we can."" Amid chilly 5C weather, Meston said it ""warms her heart"" that that police closed the streets to allow protesters access. She said she hopes people will understand ""and to the ones that don't, I say 'we're sorry.' "" Protesters handed out flyers and thanked waiting drivers for their patience. ""When people are asking to weigh the climate change catastrophe that will be facing our children and grandchildren with the fact that drivers might be asked to wait a few minutes on their evening commute, we think it's a small price to pay,"" Cherry said before the march. During the sit-in, Charles Campbell spoke about the birth of his son, Remy, on Oct. 5, which made him realize ""if Remy is to live on a livable planet when he is my age, we have to act now."" Campbell said he rejoiced when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared ""Canada is back"" at the 2015 climate change summit in Paris, a promise which Campbell said was dashed when the Liberal government spent $4.5 billion to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan. Marchers carried candles which shone against the blue lights of the bridge. The crowd was hushed for two minutes to reflect on the depth of the climate emergency. The march was timed to coincide with COP 24 , the annual UN climate change conference which started Monday in Poland. Similar rallies were held across the United Kingdom and Australia last month to highlight government inaction on global climate change. In London, more than 6,000 people blocked five key bridges on Nov. 17, resulting in the arrests of 85 people. \"

The reminder comes as U.S. President Donald Trump faces criticism for promoting coal at the COP 24 meetings in Katowice, Poland where world leaders are meeting to establish a set of ground rules for meeting the Paris Agreement targets. The Paris Agreement between 195 countries was reached in December 2015 and established targets that aim to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2 C. According to the UN, average global temperatures increased 0.85 degrees Celsius between 1880 and 2012. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that if the world wants to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, warming must remain below 1.5 C. In Poland, Heyman said he's been busy answering questions about B.C.'s newly released plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meeting with business and political leaders to discuss the province's various initiatives, including its plan to phase out the sale of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. That was the topic of a meeting between Heyman and BMW's vice-president of governmental affairs Andreas Klugescheid ahead of a panel discussion about moving effectively toward low-emissions transportation. ""I found that a very useful and interesting conversation and I think he did as well,"" Heyman said. Read more: Sweeping B.C. climate change plan targets heavy emitters with new rules, carbon tax incentives New vehicles sold in B.C. to emit zero emissions by 2040 Canada seeking new members of anti-coal alliance at climate meeting In November, B.C. announced it would introduce legislation in the spring to ensure all new cars and trucks sold in the province by 2040 are powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel. The policy will apply to cars and trucks weighing up to 8,500 pounds and is expected to shave 1.3 million tonnes from B.C.'s emissions by 2030, when at least 30 per cent of all new cars sold must be electric or hydrogen-fuelled. That's equivalent to taking more than 280,000 fossil-fuel-powered cars off the road. Achieving that target means car manufacturers will need to make significantly more electric cars available for purchase in B.C., where buyers have faced long wait lists, Heyman said. Of his conversation with Klugescheid, Heyman said ""we talked a lot about what has to be done in terms of market factors to incent greater production of electric or other zero-emission vehicles and how we work with the industry to produce those cars and make them available to people."" Offering rebates and incentives will enable more people to buy electric vehicles, and over time that will help bring down the price of manufacturing and the cost to buy electric, Heyman said. Other factors, including an increase in charging infrastructure and improved battery technology, also need to be addressed, he said. Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is also meeting with world leaders in Poland, including leaders from the European Union and China. Speaking to media during a teleconference Wednesday, McKenna said ""these are key countries in the context of the Paris Agreement."" ""There's broader context with China, but in the context of working together on the environment and climate change, they've played an important role. When the U.S. stepped back, China stepped up,"" she said. ""China knows it needs to take action because you can see the levels of pollution that they have, but they also see the economic opportunity,"" she said, adding that the country has been a leader on electric vehicles. ""They can scale like no other country."" Ainslie Cruickshank is a Vancouver-based reporter covering the environment. Follow her on Twitter: @ainscruickshank \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada102","The Climate Clock: Counting down to 1.5?","December  5, 2018 Wednesday 6:10 PM EST","The Conversation - Canada","The HYPERLINK Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5? has opened a window to limit global warming to 1.5? above pre-industrial levels, but carbon dioxide emissions are projected to \~ HYPERLINK increase in 2018 for the second year in a row. If this trend continues, emissions will drive global temperatures to 1.5? in less than 16 years. The HYPERLINK http://www.climateclock.net/ Climate Clock we created shows how quickly we are approaching 1.5? of global warming, given current emissions trends. Here, we present our third annual update of the clock in light of the most recent scientific data, released on Dec. 5, 2018. The IPCC special report showed that 1.5? is an important threshold for many climate impacts. Weather extremes such as heat waves and extreme precipitation events are expected to increase with every increment to global temperature. The risk of irreversible ice sheet loss and consequent sea level rise increases sharply between 1.5? and 2?, and nearly all corals could be wiped out at 2? warming. Read more: What will the world actually look like at 1.5\'b0C of warming? According to the latest data from both the IPCC special report and the HYPERLINK Global Carbon Project Tracking the progression of climate mitigation Each year we have updated the clock to reflect the latest global CO2 emissions trend and rate of climate warming. In 2016, we saw the third year of stable CO2 emissions. This lack of increase in CO2 emissions extended the timeline to 1.5? by a year. But in 2017, emissions increased, and the clock was set back by four months. Emissions for 2018 are now expected to increase again by HYPERLINK 2.7 per cent . This is the largest increase in global emissions since 2011, and it moves 1.5? another eight months closer in time. This year, our update of the climate clock also reflects a new estimate of the remaining carbon budget from the https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sr15/sr15_chapter2.pdf IPCC 1.5? report . This budget, which represents the total amount of allowable CO2 emissions between 2018 and the time we reach 1.5?, has been revised upward to 770 billion tonnes of CO2. By itself, this increase in allowable emissions pushes the 1.5? date further away by more than two years. The result of projected 2018 CO2 emissions and the revised carbon budget is that our estimate of the date of 1.5? now falls near the end of the year 2034. A simple methodology The Climate Clock answers the question: given the current rate of emissions and level of human-induced warming, and assuming the emissions trend over the past five years continues into the future, how long will it be before the remaining allowable emissions for 1.5? are used up? To date, human activities have emitted close to HYPERLINK http://www.globalcarbonproject.org 2,300 billion tonnes of CO2 HYPERLINK 1.06? relative to the 1850-1900 average . Over the past five years, annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have increased by an average of 0.4 billion tonnes each year, and in 2018, are expected to reach a record high of 37.1 billion tonnes. In creating the Climate Clock, we assume that this five-year fossil-fuel CO2 emissions trend will continue into the future, and that CO2 emissions from deforestation and land-use change remain constant at the most recent five-year average of 5.3 billion tonnes per year. By using the IPCC carbon budget estimate, we also assume that pollutants other than CO2, such as methane and nitrous oxide, will be responsible for approximately 25 per cent of the warming between now and 1.5?. How confident are we in our time estimate? Our time estimate is sensitive to the uncertainties associated with the climate response to CO2 emissions. Here, we provide a best estimate, which means that there is a 50 per cent chance of reaching 1.5? before the clock's date, and similarly that there is a 50 per cent chance that the 1.5? date will occur later than shown. To increase the confidence that we have not overestimated the remaining time, we could instead use a smaller estimate of the remaining carbon budget. Setting allowable future emissions to 570 billion tonnes rather than 770 billion tonnes, for example, would move the 1.5? date four years earlier to about the year 2030. This in turn would increase our confidence of not overestimating the time remaining before we reach 1.5? from 50 to 67 per cent. Read more: Trump's £ll-out effort' on climate is derelict and risky Another source of uncertainty is how we choose to define global temperature itself. Here we have used the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) standard definition of global temperature. It is based on available measurements, which are spatially incomplete and also combine air and surface ocean temperature measurements to estimate the global mean surface temperature. If we based the clock on only air temperature estimates with full global coverage - which require either climate models or uncertain spatial interpolation of available temperature data - the remaining carbon budget would be decreased from 770 billion to 580 billion tonnes, and the 1.5? date would again move four years closer in time. How do we add time to the clock? Perhaps the most important uncertain factor is the question of how hard the world will try to decrease future CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, if fossil fuel CO2 emissions continue to increase, we will continue to lose time between now and when we reach 1.5?. Similarly, if the rate of deforestation or emissions of methane accelerate, this will also move 1.5? closer in time. Current national emissions targets are not sufficient to avoid 1.5?: if all countries meet their HYPERLINK https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2018 2030 targets , this would delay 1.5? by only half a year. Similarly, holding CO2 emissions constant at today's level would buy only 14 months of additional time. If we are able to decrease CO2 emissions to zero by the year 2080, we might avoid 2? of global temperature increase, but would pass 1.5? before the year 2040. To actually avoid 1.5? altogether, CO2 emissions from both fossil fuels and deforestation would need to be eliminated by the year 2050. Read more: COP24 Avoiding the impacts of more than 1.5? of warming will require individuals, businesses and governments to cooperate and prioritize climate action at all levels of decision-making. It is only through bold and ambitious action that we will be able to add enough time to the clock to avoid the most dangerous consequences of continued climate warming. This is a daunting challenge, and we may not succeed. But we will clearly fail if we do not try much harder than we have done so far.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada103","The Latest: French PM to skip climate meeting, focus on riot","December 1, 2018 Saturday","National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post) (Canada)","PARIS - The Latest on French protests against rising taxes (all times local): 10:15 p.m. France's prime minister has cancelled a planned trip to a major environmental conference in Poland on Sunday in the wake of his country's worst urban violence in more than a decade. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe's office said he will send the environment minister, Francois de Rugy, in his place to the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland. The cancellation came after violent ""yellow jacket"" protests engulfed Paris, with protesters tagging the Arc de Triomphe with multi-colored graffiti, overturning and torching cars and ransacking stores. Protesters are angry over rising taxes. -- 9:50 p.m. France's interior minister says police were not able to keep protesters from damaging the Arc de Triomphe monument in Paris or spraying it with graffiti. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, speaking on French television TF1, said ""while some (protesters) invaded the Arc de Triomphe, our police forces were protecting other protesters and bystanders."" French television showed images of protesters inside the famous monument, spraying graffiti and taking selfies. Castaner said troublemakers were mixing in with ordinary protesters, called ""yellow jackets"" for their fluorescent vests, so they could run from police more easily. He urged protesters not to take part in violence. France saw its worst urban violence in a decade on Saturday as protesters trashed areas of central Paris. -- 8:10 p.m. French President Emmanuel Macron is denouncing violent protesters who attacked police and vandalized a Paris monument, promising they will be ""held responsible for their acts."" Macron said Saturday that the protests which have left dozens injured and at least 224 arrested ""have nothing to do with the peaceful expression of a legitimate anger."" He says ""no causes justifies"" attacks on police or pillaging stores and burning buildings. Macron said he is holding an emergency government meeting Sunday on the protests. He spoke from the Group of 20 industrial nations summit being held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. -- 7:45 p.m. French police are starting to regain control of central Paris after a protest against a rising taxes and sinking living standards descended into the worst urban violence France has seen in a decade. Around the popular tourist area of Trocadero, the protesters wearing fluorescent emergency vests trashed and looted stores, smashed windows, overturned and torched cars, and tagged buildings with graffiti. Hours later, car after car still smouldered. Central Paris was locked down Saturday afternoon, with all roads leading away from the Arc de Triomphe closed off as more police moved in. Grafitti also marred the Arc de Triomphe, after protesters climbed to the top of the famed archway. -- 6:40 p.m. French police are struggling to regain the upper hand against violent ""yellow jacket"" protesters in central Paris and are spraying protesters with water cannon. The protesters angry over rising taxes and the high cost of living sprayed graffiti on the Arc de Triomphe, torched at least one car, and broke through the metal fence of the Tuileries gardens. French television showed police leading a shaken woman away from the protesters, and loud bangs rang out near the Champs Elysees where the violence was centred. Central Paris was locked down by Saturday afternoon, with all roads leading away from the arc closed off as more police moved in. Police said at least 224 people have been arrested in Saturday's riot in the French capital. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen urged the protesters to go home in a tweet. -- 5:35 p.m. Paris police says at least 80 people have been injured, including 16 police officers, in violent protests in the centre of the French capital. Police also say 183 people have been arrested in violent clashes Saturday between police and protesters angry over rising taxes near the city's famed Champs-Elysees Avenue and several other Paris streets very popular with tourists. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted her ""indignation"" and ""deep sadness,"" saying that violence is ""not acceptable."" Protests against the high cost of living elsewhere in France on Saturday were largely peaceful. -- 3:50 p.m. Paris police say that at least 65 people including 11 police officers have been injured in violent protests in the French capital. Police also say that 140 people have been arrested. Paris police spokeswoman Johanna Primevert gave the updated figures Saturday afternoon. Some protesters in France have set cars and trash cans on fire in central Paris after police pushed them away from the Arc de Triomphe monument following violent clashes. Sporadic scuffles with police were breaking out Saturday afternoon in Paris city centre as some protesters tried to build makeshift barricades using plywood planks and other material. Meanwhile, other protesters, called ""yellow jackets"" because of the fluorescent vests they wear, were marching peacefully elsewhere in Paris. -- 3:35 p.m. Dutch police have closed off the parliamentary complex in The Hague after about 100 yellow jacket protesters gathered outside. As the gas price protest that began in France last month spread to another country, Dutch demonstrators on Saturday gathered outside the historic parliamentary buildings to protest government policies. After the demonstrators initially refused police efforts to move them to a nearby park, officers blocked the archway leading into the parliament. As some of the protesters melted away, police on horseback and in vans later shepherded the remaining yellow jackets away from Parliament. Dutch media reported that two protesters were detained by police in The Hague and that another protest leader was detained in the southern city of Maastricht. Police in The Hague did not immediately return a call seeking confirmation. -- 1:45 p.m. France's prime minister says that some protesters have attacked police officers in rarely seen violence in central Paris, leading to the arrest of at least 107 people. Edouard Philippe has told reporters at Paris police headquarters that authorities counted more than 5,000 protesters on and around the Champs-Elysees avenue. He said ""some determined, equipped individuals"" gathered Saturday morning to ""provoke"" clashes with police. At least 10 officers were slightly injured. He added that he was ""shocked"" by violence near the Arc de Triomphe and graffiti sprayed onto the monument, a symbol of the country with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I. He said that authorities are ""determined to allow peaceful protests"" and will give ""no excuse to those coming to make trouble."" -- 12:50 p.m. A few dozen protesters have symbolically gathered under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to sing France's national anthem as others clashed with police near the famous monument at the top of the Champs-Elysees avenue. The protesters, called ""yellow jackets"" for the fluorescent vests they wear, removed barriers protecting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I to pose near its eternal flame, just under the Arc. The words ""yellow jackets will triumph"" have been written in big black letters at the base of the monument. Other protesters nearby deployed a banner addressing the French president: ""Macron, stop taking us for stupid people."" -- 12:10 p.m. Paris police say at least 63 people have been arrested in violent clashes between protesters and police amid nationwide demonstrations against rising taxes and President Emmanuel Macron's policies. Paris police spokeswoman Johanna Primevert has told French news broadcaster BFM TV that 10 police officers have been slightly injured. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner tweeted that ""1,500 troublemakers"" are around the Champs-Elysees and near the Arc de Triomphe monument. Meanwhile, hundreds of peaceful protesters were present on the famed avenue inside a perimeter secured by police through identity checks and bag inspections. -- 11:30 a.m. French police have fired tear gas to try to disperse a large group of ""yellow jacket"" protesters gathered in front of the Arc de Triomphe. A big cloud of tear gas partially cloaked the famed monument as riot officers closed in to try to push back the demonstrators. But protesters responded by throwing large rocks, and the officers retreated to cheers from the crowd. The demonstrators are angry about rising taxes and French President Emmanuel Macron's leadership. The protests began on Nov. 17. -- 11:05 a.m. Scuffles have broken out between some French protesters angry over rising taxes and police for a third straight weekend, after small pockets of demonstrators built barricades in the middle of streets in central Paris and lit fires. Thousands of police were deployed to try to contain the protests on and around the famed Champs-Elysees avenue. Most of the protesters, called ""yellow jackets"" for the fluorescent vests they wear, were peaceful. But others mixed in with them wore black hoodies and piled up construction materials, including large plywood planks, in the middle of a street near the Arc de Triomphe, and set the rubble on fire. Police responded by firing bursts from a water cannon with backup from riot officers, who used tear gas on the protesters. -- 10:05 a.m. French authorities have deployed thousands of police on Paris' Champs-Elysees avenue to try to contain protests by people angry over rising taxes and President Emmanuel Macron's government. The so-called yellow jackets have called for new demonstrations and road blockades Saturday across France, including the capital, where a demonstration last weekend turned violent. Hundreds of people gathered at the top of the Champs-Elysees on Saturday morning. Access to the avenue was closed to cars and strictly monitored by police with identity checks and bag inspections. Police briefly used tear gas to disperse the crowd as some tried to force their way through. The protests, which began with motorists demonstrating against a fuel tax hike, now involve a broad range of demands related to the country's high cost of living. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada104","Six members of Ontario family killed in Ethiopian Airlines plane crash","March 11, 2019 Monday","Postmedia Breaking News","Six members of an Ontario family, including two teenage sisters, were among the 18 Canadians killed in a plane crash in Ethiopia. The Peel District School Board said the girls, 14-year-old Ashka and 13-year-old Anushka Dixit, were travelling on the doomed Ethiopian Airlines jetliner with their parents and grandparents when it crashed moments after takeoff from Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa on Sunday. All 157 people on board were killed. ""This tragedy has brought great sadness to the students and staff,"" reads a letter sent to attendees of Ashka's high school in Brampton, Ont. ""Even students who did not personally know Ashka may be affected by this loss."" Their 37-year-old mother Kosha Vaidya, 45-year-old father Prerit Dixit, 71-year-old grandfather Pannagesh Vaidya and 63-year-old grandmother Hansini Vaidya also died in the crash, said Kosha's brother, Manant Vaidya. Vaidya said his parents were from Gujarat, India, but they lived in Kenya for three or four years and Kosha was born there. The family later returned to India, and Kosha moved to Ontario in 2004 after marrying her husband, who already lived in Canada, he said. Their family vacation to Kenya was supposed to be her first visit to her birthplace in decades, and the teenage girls were excited to go on a safari there, said Manant. ""They wanted to see what was it is like to see all the animals on the ground, without any cages. It was really going to be a great experience for them,"" he said. The girls were both taking specialized science and technology courses and getting good grades, Manant said. The elder daughter, Ashka, had a beautiful singing voice while Anushka was talented in dance, learning a traditional Indian form called khattak, he said. He said his brother-in-law worked as a medical lab assistant for LifeLabs and also held a job at Ontario's Ministry of Health. His sister used to work for the Canadian Hearing Society, he said. Across the country, tributes also poured in for the other 12 Canadians killed in the crash. They included humanitarians, environmentalists and aid workers who had dedicated their lives to making the world a better place. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres led the tributes by recognizing the impact of the crash on the international aid community, noting 21 UN employees from around the world were among the victims. Former coworkers sketched out a multi-decade career dedicated to the global good. Kyle Matthews, executive director of the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies at Concordia University, first met Hyba as their careers were getting underway at CARE Canada in 2001. Matthews said Hyba, an Ottawa native, arrived after completing her studies abroad looking to get involved in humanitarian or development work. ""She was a very energetic person, a very positive person who tried to make a difference for people affected by war and persecution,"" Matthews said. ""It's a real sad story."" CARE Canada said Hyba, who it described as a ""dedicated humanitarian and loving mother,"" worked both in Canada and Indonesia in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami crisis. ""This tragedy has struck the humanitarian community hard and our thoughts are with all of those who have lost friends and colleagues,"" the group said in a statement. ""We are reminded of the sacrifices humanitarian workers and their families have made through this work in an effort to save lives and help people overcome poverty."" Similar praise was lavished on Danielle Moore, 24, of Winnipeg, who was en route to the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, at the time of the crash. Moore, a marine biology student who had just been accepted into an education program, graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 2017. ""Danielle was exceptional in every sense,"" Moore's thesis adviser Prof. Kim Davies said in an email. ""She excelled at her studies, she was a kind and friendly person, and she was deeply devoted to environmental and human rights causes."" Davies said after graduating from Dalhousie, Moore returned to Manitoba where she worked for several non-governmental organizations, including the Canada Learning Code, a group dedicated to improving the accessibility of educational and technological resources for Canadians. Also among the victims was Peter deMarsh of New Brunswick, who was chairman of the International Family Forestry Alliance, an international group based in Luxembourg that represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide. Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the alliance, said deMarsh had been en route to a conference on financing for small farms. David Coon, leader of New Brunswick's Green party, offered a tribute of his own to deMarsh on Twitter. ""Goodbye old friend,"" Coon wrote while offering condolences to deMarsh's wife and son. ""You gave so much of your self in service to the common good."" Micah Messent was also identified as one of the victims by friends in Facebook posts and his death was reported by media outlets based on information from the B.C. government and members of his family. In an Instagram post, Messent said he was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi and expressed his gratitude at being selected ""to meet with other passionate youth and leaders from around the world and explore how we can tackle the biggest challenges that are facing our generation."" The First Nations Leadership Council said Micah was a member of the Red River Metis Nation in Manitoba and was raised as the youngest of five siblings in the Comox Valley. He was a ""well-liked"" member of a 12-month Aboriginal Youth Internship Program who served his placement with BC Parks, it said in a statement. The placement led to a full-time position in government with the BC Parks Indigenous relations team, which focuses on enhancing reconciliation within the agency and the broader natural resource sector, the statement said. Micah, an avid sailor, was a graduate of the Indigenous studies program at the University of Victoria and had plans to return to school in the future to pursue a law degree, it added. Monica Phung said both she and Messent took part in Ocean Bridge, a conservation program operated through Canadian Service Corps and Ocean Wise. ""Micah is one of the most energetic, enthusiastic, smartest, driven,"" she said in an interview. ""He is so accomplished."" Jasveen Brar said she was a member of the 2018 Ocean Wise group with Messent and described him as ""a true leader."" ""With my time with Micah, I learned a lot, skills such as chopping wood and the unique botany of the B.C. forests but also about life and his visions and ambitions,"" she said. The Canadian Wildlife Federation said Angela Rehhorn was on her way to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi when she was killed in the crash. The federation said Rehhorn, also a recent graduate of Dalhousie University, participated in its Canadian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program for Canadians ages 18 to 30. ""Angela shared the excitement and optimism of volunteering and working to improve our world. Her life is an inspiration to us all,"" federation CEO Rick Bates said in a statement. Stephanie Lacroix's mother, Sylvie Lamarche Lacroix, confirmed from her home in Timmins, Ont. that her daughter died in the crash. Stephanie Lacroix's LinkedIn profile says she was working with the United Nations Association in Canada. Brar said she met Stephanie Lacroix at COP24 in Poland. ""She was a mentor to me and the two other guys that were selected for the conference. Since the COP, we kept in touch over email, where she offered me lots of advice about my career and life, she really was a star,"" Brar said. Other Canadian victims of the crash included a mother and daughter from Edmonton, a renowned Carleton University professor, and an accountant with the City of Calgary. Amina Ibrahim Odowaa of Edmonton, and her five-year-old daughter, Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir, were on the way to Kenya to visit with relatives when the plane crashed. Carleton University confirmed Pius Adesanmi, a professor in the Department of English Language and Literature and the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University, was also among the victims. The school called him a ""global thinker,"" and a ""towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship."" Derick Lwugi, an accountant who worked for the City of Calgary, also died in the crash. He leaves behind his wife and three children, aged 17, 19 and 20. - With files from Laura Kane in Vancouver, Victoria Ahearn in Toronto, Sidhartha Banerjee in Montreal, Michael MacDonald and Aly Thomson in Halifax and The Associated Press. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada106","Why climate change is starting to look too big to solve","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Prince George Citizen (British Columbia)","In the daunting math of climate action, individual choices and government policies aren't adding up. ""There's no silver bullet,"" said Andrew Jones, co-founder of the modeling firm Climate Interactive. ""There's silver buckshot: many actions in many domains."" As the 24th UN conference on climate change kicks off this week, a steady drumbeat of scientific reports have sounded warnings about current climate trajectories. One warned of the need to curb global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels instead of the widely accepted target of two degrees Celsius. Another warned of the growing gap between the commitments made at earlier UN conferences and what is needed to steer the planet off its current path to calamitous global warming. If it sounds downbeat, that's because it is. The world has waited so long that preventing disruptive climate change requires action ""unprecedented in scale,"" the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in an October report. William Nordhaus, the Yale University professor who just won the Nobel Prize for his work on the economics of climate change, recently described his outlook like this: ""I never use the word 'pessimism'; I always use the word 'realism,'but I'd say it's a kind of dark realism today."" Climate scientists and policy experts realize that they walk a fine line between jolting consumers and policymakers into action and immobilizing them with paralyzing pessimism about the world's ability to hit climate targets. ""If you're driving on a highway and the car in front of you stops short, and you slam on brakes and realize that you're going to hit the guy no matter what, that's not the time to take your foot off the brake,"" said John Sterman, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's business school. ""And you certainly don't step on the gas."" Sterman said that the world has missed the chance to contain warming without huge disruptions. ""Now, it's technically possible to do that, but we don't have the policies in place,"" he said. It's not that corporations and governments haven't attacked the problem or made breathtaking advances in energy technology. The cost of solar has plunged 78 per cent for utility-scale projects since 2010. Over the same period, the cost of wind electricity fell nearly a quarter; the biggest turbines offshore now have arms weighing roughly 35 tons each that stretch nearly two football fields across. Even China is making some progress. While its rapidly growing economy keeps emissions rising overall, it is coughing out less carbon dioxide for every unit of economic output. But effective policy is lacking. Nordhaus advocates a whopping carbon tax, which the Climate Interactive model shows would kill off most coal, sharply reduce driving and boost purchases of more fuel efficient vehicles. Getting such a carbon tax adopted in the United States, however, is hard to imagine. Washington state voters in November rejected a $15-per-ton carbon ""fee"" after Big Oil companies poured more than $31 million into the state to block the measure. BP, which had endorsed a $40-per-ton nationwide tax, gave the most to defeat the bill. Congress hasn't shown any appetite for a carbon tax, either. A proposal to impose a $40-per-ton carbon tax and return the revenue to people in dividends has not caught fire yet. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has ignited protests by proposing fuel taxes he says are needed to fight climate change. ""One cannot be on Monday for the environment,"" Macron said, ""and on Tuesday against the increase of fuel prices."" In an email, Nordhaus said that hitting the two-degree target would require global carbon dioxide prices of about $250 a ton in 2020, and rising rapidly after that. ""This assumes that all major countries are onboard and that economies can handle a large fiscal and trade shock in which energy expenditures rise by about $2 trillion in a few years."" Nordhaus has blamed the lack of climate policy progress on the strong incentive for what economists call ""free-riding."" ""People free-ride when they jump the turnstile on the subway,"" he said. ""Nations free-ride in military treaties such as NATO when they enjoy the benefits of the strong U.S. military to protect them while doing little to pay for the common defense."" And when it comes to climate change, he said, free-riding is ""particularly pernicious."" That's partly because international organizations lack the authority to enforce rules on wayward nations. One example is Brazil, whose new President Jair Bolsonaro, the ""tropical Trump,"" has talked about clearing part of the Amazon for roads and development. That would damage the world's lungs - the trees that absorb carbon dioxide and pump out oxygen at high rates. There's lots of carbon to absorb. The world will need to sustain consumers'habits and living standards while replacing the energy industry's massive infrastructure. Every day, the world burns about 100 million barrels, or 15.9 billion litres, of oil - up about two per cent from the year before. Most of that goes into the gasoline tanks of cars and trucks; there are nearly 270 million on the road in the United States alone. The average age of those cars is 11.6 years, according to the Transportation Department, meaning that replacing the fleet with more-efficient or electric vehicles would take a long time. In November, the number of electric vehicles in the United States hit the one million mark. But that was three years later than then-president Barack Obama's target, first issued in 2009. And that makes only a small dent in the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Thanks to the growth in the car market, in 2016 there were nearly 12 million more cars with internal combustion engines emitting greenhouse gases than there were in 2008. The math on coal is just as grim. Global coal consumption is running at more than five billion tons annually. In the United States alone, coal fills 4.4 million rail cars every year. Closing down U.S. and European coal-fired power plants, which are 40 years old on average, could happen, but the average age of coal plants in Asia is just 11 years. ""Most emissions linked to energy infrastructure are already essentially locked-in,"" the International Energy Agency said in its November World Energy Outlook. A project off the coast of Belgium provides a good example of the need to run to stand still. In November, MHI Vestas, the world's largest maker of wind turbines, announced it would provide 23 of its new biggest turbines to a project in the Belgian North Sea. The massive turbines can power 137,471 German homes, the company said. Yet the number of German dwellings grew by 245,000 in 2017. Royal Dutch Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden noted in 2014 that solar and wind provide about one per cent of the world's energy. ""How on earth do we think that one per cent is going to become 90 per cent of a system twice as big as what it is by the middle of the century?"" he asked. ""Whether you like it or not, it won't happen."" Even with large advances in renewable energy, he said, the share of world energy met by oil and gas would decline from 85 per cent to 75 per cent by the middle of the century, a time when the IPCC said net carbon dioxide emissions should drop to zero. ""That might be a gloom-and-doom-type picture,"" van Beurden said. ""But I think the real challenge is not so much how do we accelerate renewables but more about how do we decarbonize the system we have."" Yet taking carbon out of the system means coming up with technology - and a carbon price to cover the costs. Companies already know how to take carbon dioxide from the air and stuff it below the earth's surface. But it's expensive, and unless it's used for enhanced oil recovery, it makes no economic sense without a carbon price. ""Like a married couple that has put off saving for the future for too long, at some point it becomes nearly impossible to retire comfortably,"" Nigel Purvis, co-founder of the advocacy group Climate Advisers, wrote in 2015. ""Given where global emissions are today and the urgency of reducing emissions, we just don't have time for a system that gradually increases climate ambition every five years - the numbers simply don't work."" While Obama had called the Paris deal ""a turning point,"" the report says that seven major countries, including the United States, are falling short of the actions they pledged to take. The UNEP report also says that after three years of relatively stable emissions, global greenhouse emissions were up 1.2 per cent in 2017. Purvis now says his views haven't changed. But, he pleaded, ""Don't cast me as a pessimist."" He said: ""I am an optimist by nature, and I am blown away by progress in certain sectors. If you had told me 10 years ago that wind or solar would be as cheap as they are, I wouldn't have believed you."" His assessment hasn't discouraged people who say that the world needs - and will inevitably develop - a breakthrough technology. They fall into a long tradition of people who place their faith in American inventiveness and know-how. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has invested in Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $1 billion private investment fund, to fund researchers. ""We need the basic research, but we have to pair that with people willing to fund high-risk breakthrough energy companies,"" Gates said in a video on the Breakthrough Energy website. He said ""that's what gives us the chance of having a solution that really lets us not having to give up energy usage and yet not damage the environment. I am optimistic."" One of the earliest climate change models was drawn up in 2004 by a pair of Princeton University professors - Robert Socolow, an engineer, and Stephen Pacala, an ecologist. Their 50-year scenario was optimistic: ""Humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical and industrial know-how to solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century,"" they wrote. They said that no breakthrough was necessary. In their model, a series of ""wedges"" could alter the trajectory of rising temperatures. The wedges included things such as: scaling up wind capacity tenfold; covering an area the size of New Jersey with solar panels; doubling the fuel efficiency of all cars; tripling the world's capacity of nuclear power; halting global deforestation; or planting new forests over an area the size of the Lower 48 United States. ""I like to say that we decomposed a heroic challenge into a limited set of monumental tasks,"" Socolow wrote later. In 2011, Socolow wrote that the number of wedges needed had increased from seven to nine. In an interview, he said it is now approaching 10. Socolow now prefers to call climate action a horse race. At the moment, wind and solar are running ahead faster than expected, while nuclear power and carbon capture are trailing behind. He says he worries that the two-degree target is setting people up for an inevitable letdown. ""My worry is that people will start talking about game over and a line being crossed over irreparably,"" Socolow said. ""Climate change is not like that."" \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada107","The psychology of climate change: Why people deny the evidence","December 2, 2018 Sunday 1:27 PM GMT","CBC News","This week, representatives from more than 150 countries are meeting in Katowice, Poland, for COP 24 , or the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate. Their goal: to find ways to reduce carbon emissions in order to combat the effects of climate change. Last week, the United States released its National Climate Assessment, which was largely buried in the news as a result of its release over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Its conclusions were in line with those of the UN and other climate organizations: global climate is changing, and ""the global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels."" That same day, U.S. President Donald Trump said he doesn't believe the report. On Thursday, the UN World Meteorological Organization said global temperatures are headed for a rise of 3 to 5 C this century, far above the target of 1.5 to 2 C. The message seems to be clear: Earth's climate is rapidly changing as a result of human activity. So how is it that some people are still reluctant to acknowledge it? According to some psychologists, there are a number of reasons, including the prevalence of deceptive or erroneous information about the topic. ""But you're also getting a lot of misinformation, what we call agnotology \'e2\€  misleading information and false information \'e2\€  from vested interests,"" said Michael Ranney, professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley's Department of Psychology. ""And the internet, for decades, has been offering information that is misleading."" And some recent studies suggest that false news spreads faster than true or objective news. One of the reasons people might be sharing that information \'e2\€  which they may not recognize as false \'e2\€  is that it represents their worldview \'e2\€  a phenomenon called confirmation bias. 'Information deficit' Another important thing to consider, Ranney says, is decreasing ""information deficit,"" or lack of knowledge. To this end, he created the website How Global Warming Works, which provides short videos explaining the mechanisms of global warming. And that, he believes, makes a difference with some people. ""Even in places like Berkeley, we almost tripled their understanding of the mechanisms of global warming, and that increased their acceptance of global warming,"" Ranney says of one study conducted at his university. But Canadian Matto Mildenberger, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, doesn't place that much faith in the ""information deficit"" theory. ""Information deficit may matter at the margins,"" says Mildenberger, who also who contributes to Yale University's Program on Climate Change Communication. ""It's not that information doesn't matter, but it strikes me that the way in which we need to solve the problem of climate communication is primarily by having trusted individuals \'e2\€  and by that, I don't mean scientists. I mean people in local communities \'e2\€  be climate advocates and climate messengers to their communities."" What motivates denial? There's something else that may be at play at the subconscious level that allows us to disregard the evidence that's in front of us. ""A big part isn't the experience; it's the motivation,"" said Paul Thagard, professor emeritus at the University of Waterloo's Department of Philosophy, who specializes in cognitive science. ""Psychologists talk a lot about 'motivated inference' \'e2\€ \£6 when people have strong motivations, they're very selective in the sort of evidence they look for."" Even though there is consensus that climate change is occurring and that humans are exacerbating it, there are still people \'e2\€  including politicians \'e2\€  who refuse to acknowledge the evidence. ""The motivations vary depending on who you are,"" says Thagard. ""If you're a conservative politician, you just don't want to believe [in climate change], because if there really is climate change caused by human activity, then there has to be government actions to stop the disastrous results that are probably going to come down the line in 20 or 30 years."" There are other fears: people whose livelihood is dependent on, say, the oil industry, might fear acknowledging climate change will threaten their jobs. Others might resent government taking money out of their pockets in the form of public spending on carbon mitigation efforts. ""But that gets in the way of appreciating the overwhelming scientific evidence that really bad times are coming,"" Thagard said. Changing communication Mildenberger say that, while there is a lot of climate change information out there, communicating it in an effective way is key. And it's not about painting a doom-and-gloom scenario. ""If you overwhelm people, there's some evidence that they can end up in some fatalistic mindset and feel unempowered,"" Mildenberger said. ""The trick is to communicate the seriousness of the climate threat \'e2\€ \£6 with a sense of empowering people to take action."" A sense of empowerment is something that Ranney cites as well when it comes to acceptance of climate change. ""It's going to become more and more obvious to everyone that global warming is occurring and that it's scary and yet something that we can fix, and should,"" he said. ""This is not a time to be passive and allow this calamity to happen to us. We can fix this, and we can fix this now."" \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada108","A look at the Canadian victims of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash; Canadian victims of Ethiopian plane crash","March 11, 2019 Monday 07:45 PM EST","Canadian Press","Details are emerging about the 18 Canadian victims of an Ethiopian Airlines plane crash in Addis Ababa that left 157 people dead. Here is what we know so far: Ashka Dixit, Anushka Dixit, Prerit Dixit, Kosha Vaidya, Pannagesh Vaidya and Hansini Vaidya: The family of six from Brampton, Ont., was planning to visit Kosha's birthplace in Kenya, said her brother, Manant Vaidya. He said his 37-year-old sister hadn't visited Kenya for decades. Her daughters, 14-year-old Ashka and 13-year-old Anushka, were looking forward to going on a safari, he said. The other family members on the trip were 45-year-old father Prerit Dixit, 71-year-old grandfather Pannagesh Vaidya and 63-year-old grandmother Hansini Vaidya. Manant said his parents were from Gujarat, India, but they lived in Kenya for three or four years. The family later returned to India. Kosha moved to Ontario in 2004 after marrying her husband, who already lived in Canada. The girls were strong students and enrolled in specialized science and technology courses, Manant said. Ashka was also known for her singing voice, while Anushka was talented in dance and was learning a traditional Indian form called khattak. Prerit worked as a medical lab assistant for LifeLabs and also held a job at Ontario's Ministry of Health. Kosha used to work for the Canadian Hearing Society, said Manant. Pius Adesanmi: Adesanmi was a Nigerian-born professor in the Department of English Language and Literature and the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa. He was a ""towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship,"" said the school's president, Benoit-Antoine Bacon. Adesanmi was the winner of the inaugural Penguin Prize for African non-fiction writing in 2010. Mitchell Dick, a Carleton student in communications, said Adesanmi was ""extremely nice and approachable,"" and stood out for his passion for African literature. Angela Rehhorn: Angela Rehhorn, 24, was an enthusiastic conservation volunteer from Orillia, Ont., who was developing a citizen science project on bat conservation. The Canadian Wildlife Federation says she had recently participated in its Canadian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program for Canadians ages 18 to 30. She was on her way to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi as part of the UN Association of Canada's Canada Service Corps Program, it said. Rick Bates, CEO of the Canadian Wildlife Federation, said in an interview that Rehhorn was a well-liked ""outdoors girl"" who was also a great leader. ""She was full of excitement and the optimism of youth and wanting to change the world and work on changing the world. And that's what she was doing,"" Bates said. Rehhorn recently completed a bachelor of science at Dalhousie University and was ""thrilled"" to take part in the conservation corps, the federation said. Her experience took her to Alberta where she went backpacking in Kananaskis this fall, then to Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island for her field training. At the time of her death, Rehhorn had just finished volunteering her time to do species surveys and was especially interested in expanding her experience working in the marine environment, the federation said. Stephanie Lacroix: Stephanie Lacroix was passionate about youth education and life skills development in both Canada and southern Africa. Lacroix was working with the United Nations Association in Canada to help engage young Canadians in the UN's work to grow global citizens as a project officer with the association's Canada Service Corps, her LinkedIn profile says. She graduated in 2015 with an honours degree in International Development and Globalization from the University of Ottawa. She was a board member of the African Community Fund for Education Canada and previously volunteered with Free the Children. Her mother Sylvie Lamarche Lacroix of Timmins, Ont., confirmed her death in a Facebook message. In an interview, Jasveen Brar said she met Lacroix at COP24 in Poland. ""She was a mentor to me and the two other guys that were selected for the conference. Since the COP, we kept in touch over email, where she offered me lots of advice about my career and life, she really was a star,"" Brar said. Darcy Belanger: Parvati.org, a not-for-profit conservation group, says the former Edmonton resident was its founding member and director of strategic initiatives. Belanger's LinkedIn profile says he was working as a United States director of professional development with PCL Construction in Denver. Parvati says Belanger had taken time off from PCL and was travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly. The organization said he was a champion of the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary or MAPS because he realized the importance of the Arctic Ocean in balancing global weather patterns. MAPS declares the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle a protected area, the group said in a statement. ""Admired for his courage, outstanding achievements, and noble qualities, Darcy was a hero in every sense of the word,"" Parvati said. ""He was passionately devoted to the protection of all life through the realization of MAPS."" Micah Messent: Messent was an environmentalist from British Columbia who expressed his joy on social media at being able to attend the fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. In an Instagram post, he said he had been selected by the United Nations Association of Canada to attend the assembly and was travelling to Kenya where he would ""have the chance to meet with other passionate youth and leaders from around the world and explore how we can tackle the biggest challenges that are facing our generation."" ""I'm so grateful for this opportunity and want to thank all of the people in my life who have helped me get this far."" Prof. Laurie Meijer Drees taught Messent at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo and said he was committed to being a role model for Indigenous youth and was regarded as a trailblazer among his classmates and the faculty. ""He was a bright light among all of those bright lights,"" she said. ""He was very enthusiastic, a bright young scholar, very committed to the environment and the land."" Drees said Messent was part of a group of about a dozen Indigenous Studies students who wanted to make the world a better place. The First Nations Leadership Council said Messent was a member of the Red River Metis Nation in Manitoba and was raised as the youngest of five siblings in the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island. It said he had plans to return to school in the future to pursue a law degree. Peter deMarsh Described by a longtime family friend in New Brunswick as a dedicated community activist, deMarsh also travelled the world as chairman of the International Family Forestry Alliance. The international group, based in Luxembourg, represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide. Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association in central New Brunswick more than a decade ago. ""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them."" MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community. ""He was warm, funny, passionate - you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community."" Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the International Family Forestry Alliance, said in an email that police shared the news of deMarsh's death with his family late Sunday. DeMarsh was en route to Nairobi, where he and Montecuccoli had planned to attend a workshop on financing for small farms. The CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, Derek Nighbor, issued a statement describing deMarsh as a life-long advocate for the Canadian forest sector. ""The forestry community lost an incredible man this weekend,"" Nighbor said. ""Peter dedicated so much of his life to our sector and was travelling to Africa to do what he loved to do - talking about the environmental benefits of forestry ... He was a true champion of forestry on the global stage."" Amina Ibrahim Odowaa and her daughter Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir: The 33-year-old Edmonton woman and her five-year-old daughter were travelling to Kenya to visit relatives. Her brother, Mohamed Hassan Ali of Toronto, said he had planned to travel with them but had to cancel last week. ""(She was) a very nice person, very outgoing, very friendly - had a lot of friends,"" he said. A family friend said Odowaa had lived in Edmonton since 2006. Derick Lwugi: An accountant with the City of Calgary, Lwugi was on his way to Kenya to visit both his and his wife's parents. ""His mom was not feeling well,"" Lwugi's wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary. The couple have three children, aged 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home. Jessica Hyba Hyba's Facebook page says she was born in Ottawa and pursued a career in international aid work. She worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an public relations officer, based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Prior to that, the UNHCR said Hyba worked for CARE Canada. That agency issued a statement saying she had worked in Indonesia as part of the emergency response to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. ""We remember her fondly as a dedicated humanitarian and loving mother,"" CARE Canada said on their website. Danielle Moore: A 24-year-old marine biology student from Winnipeg, Moore graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 2017. She posted on Facebook on Saturday morning that she would be travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly. ""Over the next week, I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world,"" she wrote. ""I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity."" Prof. Kim Davies, her honours thesis adviser at Dalhousie, said Moore was an exceptional student. ""She excelled at her studies, she was a kind and friendly person, and she was deeply devoted to environmental and human rights causes,"" Davies said in an email. Davies said after graduating from Dalhousie, Moore returned to Manitoba where she worked for several non-governmental organizations, including the Canada Learning Code, a group dedicated to improving the accessibility of educational and technological resources for Canadians. The professor confirmed Moore's work was recognized by the United Nations, which is why she was invited to be a delegate to the environmental assembly. \"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada109","Al Gore says it's good that Trump isn't paying attention to global climate summit","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","Al Gore wore his black cowboy boots. He talked about everything from his cameos on ""South Park"" to his conversations with President Donald Trump. The former vice president and longtime climate crusader had swooped into the coal-mining region of Poland that is home this week to global climate talks, where delegates from nearly 200 countries have convened in an effort to begin implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Gore arrived in town amid worries that the talks - formally known as COP 24 - were flailing. Negotiators had failed to come to consensus on key issues of transparency, finance and the ambition necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The head of the United Nations had warned that ""the window of opportunity is closing."" Gore, who is no stranger to such proceedings, seemed to take Wednesday's atmosphere of angst in stride. He said he remains optimistic that the world will find a way to tackle climate change, and he said it's a good thing that Trump seems to have little interest in the talks unfolding in Katowice. The following are excerpts from Gore's interview with Washington Post national environmental reporter Brady Dennis and Berlin Bureau Chief Griff Witte: The Washington Post: We want to start with the leadership void at this COP. Given where the U.S. is, what do you see as far as the willingness or ability of other countries to step up? Al Gore: I think the European Union's been playing a fairly impressive role, mostly behind the scenes. And China's role is complicated, but in some ways they're moving the ball in the right direction. But it's better when the U.S. is actually providing leadership. And maybe a couple of years from now it will again. TWP: Is it just that the U.S. is not providing leadership, or is it playing a negative role here? AG: Those who are actually down in the trenches and engaged in a lot of the details are doing a workmanlike job. You get the political appointee types who come over here and put on a brief sideshow on promoting coal. And the kerfuffle over welcome-versus-note sent a chill down the spines of some people. But I don't think that it was an indication of a large or malignant engagement by the White House. Of course, we have two days to go, so we'll know then. But I don't think that this COP seems to be on the White House radar screen. I'm hoping it stays that way. TWP: Overall are you optimistic or pessimistic that this COP will yield something substantive? AG: I think that the essential agenda assigned to this COP is probably going to get done. There are 22,000 people here from 190 countries and they're continuing to do highly detailed work regardless of what Donald Trump thinks. TWP: In the absence of a major U.S. role, how do you see the business world? Is the private sector filling the void? AG: Many in the business world and in the investor world are trying to do exactly that. Not only out of a sense of moral duty but also because they see that the world is in the early stages of a sustainability revolution. It's the biggest business opportunity in the history of the world, and people are really seizing it. Look at the announcement just two days ago from Xcel Energy in Minnesota. Big utility right on the Canadian border. They just announced a shift to 100 percent renewable energy and a plan to close their existing fossil fuel plants. They're doing it because the business realities are pushing them in that direction. That's happening around the world. TWP: We've seen suggestions that maybe there's not enough urgency here. Do you think that's the case? AG: Whenever you have 197 nations trying to agree on anything, it's going to be an unwieldy process. But the new approach at these COPs since the Paris meeting has been to reach out beyond the government delegations to civil society, businesses, industry and investors and to welcome the commitments of regional and state governments and municipal governments. And I think that was a wise choice, and I think those actors are feeling or are manifesting a greater sense of urgency than you might get from the official meetings. TWP: How do you see climate factoring into the 2020 presidential campaign? AG: Well, I'm not a great political prognosticator. But I'm impressed that several of the candidates on the great-mentioned list have already said that climate is going to be their number one issue. So that's a good sign. TWP: It's never been, as you well know, an issue that plays very well on the campaign trail. AG: I think the main reason that's changed is Mother Nature. The combination of Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, the Camp Fire, the Woolsey Fire or the Mendocino Complex Fire, Hurricane Harvey the year before, $320 billion in damage from Hurricane Harvey and Maria and Irma. I mean, every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. I think people are connecting these dots on their own. TWP: I know you gave it a try with Ivanka Trump, and I guess Trump himself. Was there any willingness there? AG: I met with Trump and continued my conversations during the first part of his first year in office. I've maintained the confidentiality of those communications. I'll simply say that I went into those discussions with some reason for legitimate hope that he might change. But I was disappointed. TWP: What do you think is at the root of his climate change denial? AG: Well, in Tennessee the farmers have an old saying that if you see a turtle on top of a fence post, you can be pretty sure it didn't get there by itself. And when you see the persistent climate denial in the U.S. among a big chunk of the Republican Party, it didn't happen by itself. And Trump is in that category. The economic interests of the large carbon polluters led them some years back to adopt the playbook of the tobacco industry and to invest $2 billion over the years in promoting climate denial. So that's my take on it. But surely some part of it is human nature, which makes us reluctant to engage with difficult subjects. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada111","Elizabeth May One-on-One","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","TODD VAN DER HEYDEN: Now let's get thoughts from Canada's Green Party leader. Elizabeth May will be heading off to the United Nations major climate change conference in Poland. This is our last chance to speak with her for the year, and it's been a busy one for her. She's got arrested, she got engaged, and now she's here on the show. Congratulations on both counts! ELIZABETH MAY (Green Party Leader): Ha, ha, ha, I am very happy about getting married, and my fiance is fabulous, and we're very happy. VAN DER HEYDEN: So let me ask you about, we've been talking about what's going on in France, and we've seen these violent protests that are happening there amid this fuel tax that was brought in, has since been repealed by the Macron government. Do you worry, when we look at what's happening in the streets of Paris, that people are turning away from climate change when they realize the actual price tag that's involved? When it comes to the hard decisions, they're not interested. MAY: Well I don't think that's true. What's happening in France, there's a lot of other things fueling it in terms of domestic politics and the increasing unpopularity of President Macron, but it has been the case that France has had strong climate action, way stronger than Canada's, has achieved its Kyoto targets and gone way beyond those. And of course under Harper, Canada rejected our legally binding targets under Kyoto, withdrew from the Kyoto accord. We remain the only country on earth that ratified Kyoto that withdrew from that. Obviously the US under Bush didn't ratify. But we have a long way to go to get to where France is now, and I think we have to bear in mind our responsibility as a country that really shows leadership in the world. When we show leadership, we punch above our weight, and it's time we really started to do that, because the world needs leaders on climate. VAN DER HEYDEN: Well we talk about the pushback, we mentioned France, but we're seeing pushback in Canada against the Trudeau government's carbon tax. Some of the provinces, Saskatchewan, Ontario, others saying thanks but no thanks, we're not interested. Do you worry about where that's going? MAY: What I worry about is that we're not talking about what really must be done, what needs to be done, and it's not in a context that says these are the things we're doing, this is how it will engage you as citizens, engage your communities, engage your businesses. It's positive. We want you on board. It's really, it's not an issue, it's not an environmental issue, right, it's an existential threat to the survival of human civilization, and to get through it we can do it with measures that are positive, they're job creating, that really engage people. In the same way I feel that we're in pretty much the same situation but with a different threat than where Winston Churchill found himself in May 1940, where all the evidence looks back, and you don't know if the public is willing to go with you. They used to test for morale reports to the British cabinet, and saying people don't seem ready, they don't really understand the nature of the threat. I think governments showing leadership explain the threat, explain how we get through it, and inspire people to take that challenge on. So we really need a climate Churchill. We need someone who says, okay, if the military can't save our troops in Dunkirk, how many civilian boats are there in Dover. And I think the solution to the climate crisis is engaging communities, municipal governments, and provincial governments. The British Columbia government is in court on the carbon tax to support it. And if Doug Ford hadn't replaced Patrick Brown, the Progressive Conservatives of Ontario would have had their own carbon pricing plan. So I'm very confident that the vast majority of Canadians want climate action, but they want to know that it actually can achieve the goals that are required. VAN DER HEYDEN: Let me ask you about Poland, because you're heading off to Poland to be at the summit, and the United Nations has basically said, look, we've got 12 years give or take until it's too late. MAY: We don't have any give or take, and 12 years is probably the maximum and optimistic projection of achieving 45 percent reduction in greenhouse gases against 2010 levels by 2030. You can't start in five years to achieve something like that within ten years. We had to have started yesterday, so it's why we're still pressing the Trudeau administration to go to COP 24 in Poland with a commitment that Canada wants to lead the world to get on this positive pathway that leads us to a thriving civilization, that gets us through the climate crisis and out the other end. And the procrastination and the political games coming from Andrew Scheer and the Conservative crowds just are reckless and irresponsible. And if you can stand up, and we don't yet have climate leadership from the federal Liberals, but real climate leadership says this is what we're going to do, and we're going to bring other countries along with us because we know that the survival of the future of our kids depends on getting this right. A lot of other issues out there that you want to get right, but you can maybe afford to wait until the next election. This isn't one of those. VAN DER HEYDEN: Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party. Wish you all the best. MAY: Thank you. VAN DER HEYDEN: In the rest of the year and on the journey to Poland. MAY: Thank you very much. VAN DER HEYDEN: Up next, a first look at the new fiscal landscape in the province of Quebec. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \"

It said he had plans to return to school in the future to pursue a law degree. Peter deMarsh Described by a longtime family friend in New Brunswick as a dedicated community activist, deMarsh also travelled the world as chairman of the International Family Forestry Alliance. The international group, based in Luxembourg, represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide. Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association in central New Brunswick more than a decade ago. ""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them."" MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community. ""He was warm, funny, passionate - you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community."" Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the International Family Forestry Alliance, said in an email that police shared the news of deMarsh's death with his family late Sunday. DeMarsh was en route to Nairobi, where he and Montecuccoli had planned to attend a workshop on financing for small farms. The CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, Derek Nighbor, issued a statement describing deMarsh as a life-long advocate for the Canadian forest sector. ""The forestry community lost an incredible man this weekend,"" Nighbor said. ""Peter dedicated so much of his life to our sector and was travelling to Africa to do what he loved to do - talking about the environmental benefits of forestry ... He was a true champion of forestry on the global stage.""

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada114","Huntsville resident offers some final thoughts on climate change and energy","December 17, 2018 Monday","Bracebridge Examiner","MUSKOKA - On Dec. 3, 2018, the 24th UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change, opened in Katowice, Poland, the heart of Polish coal production. The conference, known as COP 24 , comes 24 years after COP 1 in Berlin, Germany. After 24 years of debate and 24 UN conferences, is the world any closer to agreement on what the problem is and how to solve it? Trying to get a 200-horse team moving in unison is not easy. Getting agreement among 200 rich and poor countries on what to do and how best to do it is not easy. Margaret Wente's column in the Dec. 15 Globe and Mail essentially recommends that we put our heads in the sand and give up on climate change. Like all deniers, she ignores the fact that fossil fuels are a finite resource and failing to replace them soon enough will become as big a problem as climate change. Then we will have two problems; global climate change and a global energy shortage. What to do? Recently, I got excited and spoke too soon in praise of yet another news clip about a battery discovery that would save the world from climate change. A reality check with a bit of math quickly showed that while it has some potential, it is hardly the game-changing miracle it was touted to be. After 40 years of engineering work (at times on these subjects) and after almost 10 years of researching and writing about an appropriate balance between our energy system and our environment, I agree with the thinking of James Hansen. Hansen is a renowned professor of environmental science and climatology at Columbia University, and former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Excerpts from Hansen's 2013 interview with the New York Times ""We're not going to turn the lights out. No government, no president or governor is going to turn out the lights. There has to be energy. If renewables aren't providing it, it's been fossil fuels."" ""I think it's unfortunate that so many environmentalists are just assuming that renewable energies will be able to satisfy all of our requirements. The soft renewables are only providing between one and two per cent of global energy. Hydro power provides a significant amount of electricity but that's limited. The hope that the wind, and the sun, and geothermal can provide all of our energy is a nice idea but I find it unlikely that that's possible."" ""The environmental community is basically asking governments to try to reduce their emissions by subsidizing renewables. Well, that simply doesn't work because we don't get enough energy from the renewables to make a difference. And that then forces those governments to approve expanded oil drilling, hydro-fracking to get more gas, and mountaintop removal to get coal. ""Can renewable energies provide all of society's energy needs in the foreseeable future? It is conceivable in a few places, such as New Zealand and Norway. But suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy."" ""I think the only hope we have of phasing down emissions and getting to the middle of the century with a much lower level of fossil fuel emissions - which is what we will have to do if we want our young people to have a future - we're going to have alternatives and at this time nuclear seems to be the best candidate."" Following a discussion of the lessons from the great earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged Japan's Fukushima Daiichi power plant, he focuses on more resilient reactor designs: ""But with the new technologies, they are passively safe in the sense that if there is an anomaly like an earthquake or tsunami or both, it will just shut down and they don't require power to cool them."" How best to get it done? For years, economists have touted a revenue-neutral carbon tax as the most effective way to get everyone working on the problem in unison. But in a recent article, climate/energy economist Mark Jaccard at Simon Fraser University claims that the prospect of a carbon tax on individuals, and on business competitiveness, may be one of the biggest causes of climate change denial and one of the biggest political deterrents to progress. He might be right. Tax increases are always an easy target for opposition parties, even if it is promised to be returned in tax credits elsewhere. Constantly shifting global politics and fuel price speculators make it nearly impossible to track cause and effect. Jaccard says regulations bring less confusion and resistance than taxes and consequently get more results quicker. After all, the biggest carbon-reduction move ever made in Ontario was to eliminate coal-based electricity. It was indeed made without any carbon tax, and with little resistance. Vehicle fuel economy was doubled from 1975 to 2015 by gradually tightening harmonized North American regulations. Vehicle emissions were cut by 90 per cent. With no tax. Existing regulations will drive the conversion to electric vehicles and cut vehicle energy consumption and emissions in half again from 2015 to 2025, with or without a tax. But neither a revenue-neutral carbon tax nor regulations by themselves provide the funding for the research, development and deployment of new technologies. After watching inexperienced new governments of all stripes reverse policies on a whim, the private sector will not take the risk alone. Getting the job done will require many large public-private partnerships. Except for Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada and France are almost unique in that our electricity already comes from clean hydroelectric and nuclear sources, with a little help from wind and solar. We can get to 100 per cent without a tax. Tax or not, individual customers have no control over the source of their electricity. Building code changes can increase energy conservation for buildings without a carbon tax. On a global scale, these changes will take several decades. Meanwhile, the world will need oil from Canada as smaller reserves in all but eight countries are depleted by 2050. There are plenty of different estimates, but the life of official proven oil reserves at current production rates is one year for the EU, 15 years for the USA, China, India, and 21 years for Russia. To position themselves as environmentally responsible producers of large oil and gas reserves, Alberta and B.C. can eliminate emissions from oil and gas production by using made-in-Canada zero-emission small nuclear reactors for power and heat in the production process. That change is best driven by industry regulations and public-private partnerships. Hugh Holland is a retired engineering and manufacturing executive now living in Huntsville.

Greenpeace d\'e9plore ainsi l£bsence annonc\'e9e du premier ministre \'e0 ce sommet international annuel auquel plusieurs de ses pr\'e9d\'e9cesseurs ont particip\'e9. En effet, c'est plut\'f4t la ministre de l'Environnement, MarieChantal Chass\'e9, qui repr\'e9sentera le Qu\'e9bec \'e0 la COP24 \'e0 Katowice, en Pologne. \£bC'est un rendez-vous manqu\'e9\'bb, a regrett\'e9 le porte-parole de Greenpeace, Patrick Bonin, en entrevue avec La Presse canadienne lundi. \£bLe Qu\'e9bec aurait pu lancer un message fort \'e0 l'international en envoyant son premier ministre.

Le porte-parole de Greenpeace a donc souhait\'e9 que le premier ministre caquiste corrige le tir dans son discours inaugural en d\'e9montrant que son gouvernement atteindra ses cibles de r\'e9duction de gaz \'e0 effet de serre (GES) de 2030, des cibles que le Qu\'e9bec est en voie de manquer. \£bIl ne faut pas mettre les bouch\'e9es doubles, on est rendu \'e0 mettre les bouch\'e9es triples, a imag\'e9 M.

Un \£br\'f4le majeur\'bb \'e0 jouer Greenpeace s£ttend \'e0 ce que le Qu\'e9bec r\'e9affirme sa volont\'e9 sans faille de respecter sa cible de r\'e9duction des gaz \'e0 effet de serre pour 2030 et qu'il annonce des mesures dans ce sens \'e0 Katowice. L'organisme r\'e9clame aussi une loi contre le \£bd\'e9ficit climatique\'bb pour mieux contr\'f4ler le bilan GES. M. Bonin soutient aussi que le Qu\'e9bec doit jouer un \£br\'f4le majeur\'bb parmi les \'c9tats f\'e9d\'e9r\'e9s pr\'e9sents, les provinces, villes, etc. Greenpeace ajoute ainsi sa voix \'e0 d£utres organisations et au front commun des partis d'opposition, qui accentuent la pression sur ce qui est consid\'e9r\'e9 comme le maillon faible du programme du gouvernement Legault, soit l'environnement.

Here's the latest on what we know about them","March 12, 2019 Tuesday","The Toronto Star","The Dixit family, Brampton Manant Vaidya - who lost his parents, sister, brother-in-law and two nieces - told the Star in an interview that the family was travelling to Kenya for March break. ""The news came at night,"" he said from his Brampton home. ""Our phone rang like 15, 20 times."" Manant Vaidya said his sister was thrilled to bring her two daughters back to her place of birth. It was also a much-anticipated trip for the grandparents who hadn't been to Kenya in more than 30 years. Ashka was a student at Chinguacousy Secondary School in Brampton and Anushka went to Centennial Sr. Public School. St#233;phanie Lacroix, 25, Timmins, Ont. Lacroix was passionate about youth education and life-skills development in both Canada and southern Africa. Her mother, Sylvie Lamarche Lacroix of Timmins, Ont., confirmed her death in a Facebook message. She was working with the United Nations Association in Canada to help engage young Canadians in the UN's work to grow global citizens as a project officer with the association's Canada Service Corps, her LinkedIn profile says. She graduated in 2015 with an honours degree in international development and globalization from the University of Ottawa. She was a board member of the African Community Fund for Education Canada and previously volunteered with Free the Children. ""My beautiful niece St#233;phanie, a young beautiful servant leader, employed by the United Nations and living her dream of helping people ... perished on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302,"" Gilles Lamarche wrote on Facebook. ""You are loved and will always be. You leave an exceptional legacy of love and service, and will be missed by thousands. You left your mark without a doubt and made a BIG difference."" In an interview, Jasveen Brar said she met Lacroix at the COP24 climate-change summit in Poland. ""She was a mentor to me and the two other guys that were selected for the conference. Since the COP, we kept in touch over email, where she offered me lots of advice about my career and life. She really was a star,"" Brar said. Darcy Belanger, 46, Edmonton Belanger was on his way to the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi. Originally from Edmonton, he was a fierce advocate for the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary (MAPS) - a treaty that aims to declare the Arctic Ocean an international peace park - and posted excitedly while on a layover in Washington, D.C., about plans to discuss the proposal. He was attending the UN assembly as part of his volunteer work with Parvati.org, a non-profit organization dedicated to the environmental and social welfare of the planet. He was a founding member of the organization in 2014 and served as its director of strategic initiatives. Parvati Devi, the primary founder, said Belanger volunteered on top of working full-time at PCL as director of professional development, first in Edmonton and more recently in Denver. Devi said Belanger's work has always been integral to the non-profit. ""We called him our quarterback,"" Devi said. A statement released by Parvati.org hailed Belanger as a hero who personally brought the MAPS treaty to four different UN Climate Change conferences, starting in 2015 in Paris, and who fiercely promoted its role in preserving the planet's resources. ""He was passionately devoted to the protection of all life through the realization of MAPS,"" the statement read. ""On March 10, 2019, he literally gave it his life."" Angela Rehhorn A recent graduate of Dalhousie University and member of the Canadian Conservation Corps, Rehhorn was on her way to Nairobi to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly on Monday. The Canadian Wildlife Federation, which oversees the Canadian Conservation Corps, confirmed she'd been on the flight in a post to its Facebook account Monday afternoon. ""Angela shared the excitement and optimism of volunteering and working to improve our world,"" said Rick Bates, the federation's CEO, in the Facebook post. ""Her life is an inspiration to us all."" Rehhorn had a keen interest in the natural world. She'd gone to Kananaskis, Alta., and B.C.'s Pacific Rim National Park as part of the Canadian Conservation Corps and was working on a citizen science project on bat conservation, according to the federation's post. She had a bachelor of science from Dalhousie, graduating with a double major in marine biology and sustainability. Jasspreet Sahib, a science writer based in Victoria, B.C., went to school with Rehhorn and remembers going to marine-biology class together. ""I remember her as cheerful, kind, encouraging and intelligent,"" she recalled. Sahib remembers their combined love for studying marine animals. ""I fondly remember looking at brittle stars, polychaete worms, sea stars and lobsters together and being ever so fascinated by them all. We also loved drawing them together,"" she said. Micah Messent, Courtenay, B.C. Messent, a M#233;tis environmentalist who grew up in Courtenay, B.C., was working in Indigenous relations at BC Parks when he was selected as a delegate for the United Nations Assembly of the Environment in Kenya. He wrote about the assignment in a ""surprise"" Facebook post - his last before he died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. ""I'll have the chance to meet with other passionate youth and leaders from around the world and explore how we can tackle the biggest challenges that are facing our generation,"" he wrote on March 8. ""I'm so grateful for this opportunity and want to thank all of the people in my life who have helped me get this far."" On Monday, the post was accompanied by hundreds of messages of condolence from friends and acquaintances, referencing his leadership, ""infectious"" smile and generosity. Messent worked in BC Parks' Indigenous relations department for nearly two years - initially as part of the Indigenous Youth Internship Program and then as a full-time analyst in the employ of B.C.'s Public Service. On Monday, the First Nations Leadership Council released a statement calling Messent a ""well liked member"" of his internship cohort. The council said the ""avid sailor"" had ambitions to go to law school. A member of Messent's family told the Star they wouldn't issue a statement at this time, asking for privacy. Peter deMarsh, New Brunswick DeMarsh is being remembered as ""one of the great New Brunswickers,"" a man who ""fought for the little guy"" whether he was in his home province or thousands of miles away. He hailed from Taymouth, just north of the provincial capital of Fredericton. Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association more than a decade ago. ""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them."" MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community. ""He was warm, funny, passionate - you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community."" DeMarsh was en route to a conference on financing for small farms as chairman of the International Family Forestry Alliance, an international group based in Luxembourg that represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide. ""The forestry community lost an incredible man this weekend,"" said Derek Nighbor, CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada. ""He was a true champion of forestry on the global stage."" Jessica Hyba, 43, Ottawa Hyba, who recently moved from Geneva for her latest assignment with the UN Refugee Agency in Somalia in February, is being remembered as a ""dedicated humanitarian and cherished mother."" The 43-year-old Ottawa woman attended Confederation High School in Welland and graduated from SOAS University of London - a leading institution for the study of Asia, Africa and the Middle East - before joining CARE Canada in the capital in 2001. She worked in Indonesia on the tsunami response in Aceh from 2006 to 2008. Hyba, mother of two daughters, 9 and 12, joined the UN Refugee Agency in Iraq in 2013 and also worked at its headquarters in Geneva before taking up the job as Senior External Relations Officer in Mogadishu in February. Calling Hyba a ""dedicated humanitarian and cherished mother,"" Gillian Barth, president and CEO of CARE Canada, said she had known Hyba since 2001 when she was hired as a program officer and later promoted to be a manager. The two stayed in touch even after she left for the UN Refugee Agency. ""We are devastated. It's the worst nightmare for those of us who travel a lot and have young children."" Danielle Moore, 24, Toronto Moore, who lived in Winnipeg, was on her way to the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi as part of a delegation with the United Nations Association in Canada. Moore posted about her upcoming trip on Facebook, saying, ""I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity."" In Winnipeg, Moore worked with Canada Learning Code for almost a year, where she taught coding and promoted digital literacy to youth throughout Manitoba, northwestern Ontario and Nunavut. Melissa Sariffodeen, the organization's CEO, remembered Moore fondly, and said her work has touched the lives of thousands. ""Danielle was a smart, passionate, and a friendly woman who dedicated her life to helping others,"" Sariffodeen said in a written statement. ""So much so that she would often take her vacation days to volunteer for various causes that were dear to her heart."" She was also remembered by Pinnguaq, a non-profit group in Iqaluit that runs a Makerspace where Moore visited and taught in December. ""The kids knew her, affectionately, as 'the girl with the robots,' "" a statement from the group said. ""Ever wonder if an eight-year-old with a robot could improve the world? You just had to watch Danielle teach, and her students would show you how,"" the statement read. Moore attended Francis Libermann Catholic High School in Scarborough, where she was valedictorian of her 2012 graduating class and a member of the school's eco team. Paul Wilson, a music teacher at the school who taught Moore for six years, said her goal was always to change the world in some way, ""and she was actually doing it."" ""She was one of the smartest, brightest students to walk through those doors,"" Wilson said. Derick Lwugi, Calgary Lwugi, an accountant with the City of Calgary, was on his way to Kenya to visit both his and his wife's parents, who live in the west of the country. ""His mom was not feeling well,"" Lwugi's wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary. The couple have three children, ages 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home. The family has lived in Calgary for 12 years. Lwugi was an important figure in the Calgary Kenyan community. He founded the Kenyan Community in Calgary group and served as its president until 2012. He was also on the board of the non-profit Abeingo Association of Canada. Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said he was ""absolutely crushed"" to learn one of his colleagues had died in the crash, calling it a loss for the city's broader African community. Nenshi said he'd spoken with Gladys Kivia on Monday and offered the city's support should her family require it. Pius Adesanmi, Ottawa A Nigerian professor with Carleton University in Ottawa, Adesanmi was on his way to a meeting of the African Union's Economic, Social and Cultural Council in Nairobi, said John O. Oba, Nigeria's representative to the panel. The author of Naija No Dey Carry Last, a collection of satirical essays, Adesanmi had degrees from Ilorin and Ibadan universities in Nigeria, and the University of British Columbia. He was director of Carleton's Institute of African Studies, according to the university's website. He was also a former assistant professor of comparative literature at Pennsylvania State University. ""Pius was a towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship and his sudden loss is a tragedy,"" said Benoit-Antoine Bacon, Carleton's president and vice-chancellor. Adesanmi was the winner of the inaugural Penguin Prize for African non-fiction writing in 2010. Amina Ibrahim Odowa, 33, and Safiya Faisal Abdulkadir Egal, 5, Edmonton Odowa had lived in Edmonton since 2006 but had been raised in Kenya. According to a family friend, she left Canada on Saturday for Nairobi to visit relatives and show her daughter the country where she grew up. Her brother, Mohamed Hassan Ali, described her as a very outgoing woman who contributed greatly to Edmonton's Somali community. She was always at one event or another, he said, and had a very wide circle of friends. Since her death, he's been inundated with callers from across the country and Africa expressing their condolences. ""She was family for everyone, to some extent,"" Ali said Monday. Her two surviving daughters, ages 7 and 3, are still in Edmonton with Odowa's mother. Safiya, who also died on the flight, was also very extroverted and talkative in a manner closer to that of a 10-year-old, according to Ali. ""She's the one who took after her mom in every step,"" he said. Star staff and Star wire services \"

Lorelle Sunduk, who knew both of them, said they were inspirational people who she wanted her own daughter to look up to as she grew older. ""We will never know the gravity of what our country lost yesterday, having lost them, and so many other Canadians and United Nations affiliates who were going to make this world a much better place,"" she wrote in a social media post. Moore and Messent were friends, according to their social media profiles. They were also friends with Angela Rehhorn, a young woman from Ontario who was also killed en route to the environmental assembly, according to the Canadian Wildlife Federation. The young woman had recently been engaged in field work as a resource conservation intern at Pacific Rim National Park Reserve in B.C., according her social media profiles. Silvana Botros, a former roommate of Rehhorn's in Ucluelet, said it would be an understatement to say she was devastated to learn of her friend's death. ""I can't even fathom the universe letting such a young, aspiring person's life be cut so short and in the worst way imaginable,"" she wrote on Facebook. Friends across B.C. and Canada shared memories of Messent on Monday. Laura Cuthbert told Postmedia that Messent cared deeply for the earth and its people, and had a drive for Indigenous futurisms - works of creative arts that incorporate Indigenous perspectives into science fiction - and sovereignty. ""He was a wonderful listener and a big-hearted friend, he connected those he loved to one another and I hope we can continue that echo in this hard time,"" she said in an email.

Here is what we know so far: Ashka Dixit, Anushka Dixit, Prerit Dixit, Kosha Vaidya, Pannagesh Vaidya and Hansini Vaidya: The family of six from Brampton, Ont., was planning to visit Kosha's birthplace in Kenya, said her brother, Manant Vaidya. He said his 37-year-old sister hadn't visited Kenya for decades. Her daughters, 14-year-old Ashka and 13-year-old Anushka, were looking forward to going on a safari, he said. The other family members on the trip were 45-year-old father Prerit Dixit, 71-year-old grandfather Pannagesh Vaidya and 63-year-old grandmother Hansini Vaidya. Manant said his parents were from Gujarat, India, but they lived in Kenya for three or four years. The family later returned to India. Kosha moved to Ontario in 2004 after marrying her husband, who already lived in Canada. The girls were strong students and enrolled in specialized science and technology courses, Manant said. Ashka was also known for her singing voice, while Anushka was talented in dance and was learning a traditional Indian form called khattak. Prerit worked as a medical lab assistant for LifeLabs and also held a job at Ontario's Ministry of Health. Kosha used to work for the Canadian Hearing Society, said Manant. Pius Adesanmi Adesanmi was a Nigerian-born professor in the Department of English Language and Literature and the Institute of African Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa. He was a ""towering figure in African and post-colonial scholarship,"" said the school's president, Benoit-Antoine Bacon. Adesanmi was the winner of the inaugural Penguin Prize for African non-fiction writing in 2010. Mitchell Dick, a Carleton student in communications, said Adesanmi was ""extremely nice and approachable,"" and stood out for his passion for African literature. Darcy Belanger Parvati.org( HYPERLINK http://Parvati.org http://Parvati.org ), a not-for-profit conservation group, says the former Edmonton resident was its founding member and director of strategic initiatives. Belanger's LinkedIn profile says he was working as a United States director of professional development with PCL Construction in Denver. Parvati says Belanger had taken time off from PCL and was travelling to Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly. The organization said he was a champion of the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary or MAPS because he realized the importance of the Arctic Ocean in balancing global weather patterns. MAPS declares the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle a protected area, the group said in a statement. ""Admired for his courage, outstanding achievements, and noble qualities, Darcy was a hero in every sense of the word,"" Parvati said. ""He was passionately devoted to the protection of all life through the realization of MAPS."" Peter deMarsh Described by a longtime family friend in New Brunswick as a dedicated community activist, deMarsh also travelled the world as chairman of the International Family Forestry Alliance. The international group, based in Luxembourg, represents more than 25 million forest owners worldwide. Genevieve MacRae recalled how deMarsh and his wife Jean Burgess helped establish the Taymouth Community Association in central New Brunswick more than a decade ago. ""Peter and his wife Jean made a pretty powerful team,"" said MacRae, a friend of deMarsh's since her childhood. ""They were always looking for how to improve the lives of the people around them."" MacRae said deMarsh was a pillar of the Taymouth community. ""He was warm, funny, passionate - you always felt listened-to with Peter,"" MacRae said. ""He was an intense person, except that doesn't signify the warmth that was behind it all ... It's a monumental loss for our community."" Felix Montecuccoli, a board member with the International Family Forestry Alliance, said in an email that police shared the news of deMarsh's death with his family late Sunday. DeMarsh was en route to Nairobi, where he and Montecuccoli had planned to attend a workshop on financing for small farms. The CEO of the Forest Products Association of Canada, Derek Nighbor, issued a statement describing deMarsh as a life-long advocate for the Canadian forest sector. ""The forestry community lost an incredible man this weekend,"" Nighbor said. ""Peter dedicated so much of his life to our sector and was travelling to Africa to do what he loved to do - talking about the environmental benefits of forestry ... He was a true champion of forestry on the global stage."" Amina Ibrahim Odowaa and her daughter Sofia Faisal Abdulkadir The 33-year-old Edmonton woman and her five-year-old daughter were travelling to Kenya to visit relatives. Her brother, Mohamed Hassan Ali of Toronto, said he had planned to travel with them but had to cancel last week. ""(She was) a very nice person, very outgoing, very friendly - had a lot of friends,"" he said. A family friend said Odowaa had lived in Edmonton since 2006. Angela Rehhorn Angela Rehhorn, 24, was an enthusiastic conservation volunteer from Orillia, Ont., who was developing a citizen science project on bat conservation. The Canadian Wildlife Federation says she had recently participated in its Canadian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program for Canadians ages 18 to 30. She was on her way to participate in the United Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi as part of the UN Association of Canada's Canada Service Corps Program, it said. Rick Bates, CEO of the Canadian Wildlife Federation, said in an interview that Rehhorn was a well-liked ""outdoors girl"" who was also a great leader. ""She was full of excitement and the optimism of youth and wanting to change the world and work on changing the world. And that's what she was doing,"" Bates said. Rehhorn recently completed a bachelor of science at Dalhousie University and was ""thrilled"" to take part in the conservation corps, the federation said. Her experience took her to Alberta where she went backpacking in Kananaskis this fall, then to Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island for her field training. At the time of her death, Rehhorn had just finished volunteering her time to do species surveys and was especially interested in expanding her experience working in the marine environment, the federation said. Derick Lwugi An accountant with the City of Calgary, Lwugi was on his way to Kenya to visit both his and his wife's parents. ""His mom was not feeling well,"" Lwugi's wife, Gladys Kivia, said in a brief interview from Calgary. The couple have three children, aged 17, 19 and 20, all of whom live at home. The family has lived in Calgary for 12 years. Hyba's Facebook page says she was born in Ottawa and pursued a career in international aid work. She worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as an public relations officer, based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Prior to that, the UNHCR said Hyba worked for CARE Canada. That agency issued a statement saying she had worked in Indonesia as part of the emergency response to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. ""We remember her fondly as a dedicated humanitarian and loving mother,"" CARE Canada said on their website. Stephanie Lacroix Stephanie Lacroix was passionate about youth education and life skills development in both Canada and southern Africa. Lacroix was working with the United Nations Association in Canada to help engage young Canadians in the UN's work to grow global citizens as a project officer with the association's Canada Service Corps, her LinkedIn profile says. She graduated in 2015 with an honours degree in International Development and Globalization from the University of Ottawa. She was a board member of the African Community Fund for Education Canada and previously volunteered with Free the Children. Her mother Sylvie Lamarche Lacroix of Timmins, Ont., confirmed her death in a Facebook message. In an interview, Jasveen Brar said she met Lacroix at COP24 in Poland. ""She was a mentor to me and the two other guys that were selected for the conference. Since the COP, we kept in touch over email, where she offered me lots of advice about my career and life, she really was a star,"" Brar said. Danielle Moore A 24-year-old marine biology student from Winnipeg, Moore graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 2017. She posted on Facebook on Saturday morning that she would be travelling to Nairobi, Kenya, for the United Nations Environment Assembly. ""Over the next week, I'll have the opportunity to discuss global environmental issues, share stories, and connect with other youth and leaders from all over the world,"" she wrote. ""I feel beyond privileged to be receiving this opportunity."" Prof. Kim Davies, her honours thesis adviser at Dalhousie, said Moore was an exceptional student. ""She excelled at her studies, she was a kind and friendly person, and she was deeply devoted to environmental and human rights causes,"" Davies said in an email. Davies said after graduating from Dalhousie, Moore returned to Manitoba where she worked for several non-governmental organizations, including the Canada Learning Code, a group dedicated to improving the accessibility of educational and technological resources for Canadians. The professor confirmed Moore's work was recognized by the United Nations, which is why she was invited to be a delegate to the environmental assembly.

Le gouvernement Legault pourrait devoir faire une croix sur le milliard de dollars qu'il veut r\'e9cup\'e9rer dans l'enveloppe des m\'e9decins sp\'e9cialistes. Le nouveau ministre des Finances, \'c9ric Girard, l£ reconnu jeudi en m\'eal\'e9e de presse au terme de la c\'e9r\'e9monie de prestation de serment. La Coalition avenir Qu\'e9bec (CAQ) s'est engag\'e9e \'e0 recouvrer un milliard de dollars dans l'enveloppe globale de r\'e9mun\'e9ration des sp\'e9cialistes, m\'eame si le montant n£ppara\'eet pas dans le cadre financier du parti. M. Girard a rappel\'e9 que le nouveau gouvernement attendait d£bord les r\'e9sultats d'une \'e9tude comparative qui permettrait de situer l'\'e9cart entre les m\'e9decins du Qu\'e9bec et ceux de l'Ontario. Mais du m\'eame souffle, il a reconnu que si l'\'e9tude confirmait que les sp\'e9cialistes d'ici gagnent moins que ceux de l'Ontario, dans une fourchette \'e9quivalente \'e0 l'\'e9cart de niveau de vie entre les deux provinces, Qu\'e9bec serait bien mal plac\'e9 pour leur en enlever davantage. \£bL'hypoth\'e8se du milliard (de dollars), c'est qu'ils gagnaient plus, alors d\'e9finitivement, si l'\'e9tude donnait un r\'e9sultat contraire... l'\'e9tude, ce sont les faits, les donn\'e9es, pour prendre les d\'e9cisions, amorcer les n\'e9gociations.\'bb Mode de scrutin: un mod\'e8le \'e0 discuter C'est la nouvelle ministre de la Justice, Sonia LeBel, qui sera en charge de r\'e9former le mode de scrutin. Le premier ministre Fran\'e7ois Legault a rappel\'e9 cet engagement dans son discours \'e0 la c\'e9r\'e9monie de prestation de serment, mais sans dire \'e0 qui reviendrait ce mandat. Rappelons que la Coalition avenir Qu\'e9bec (CAQ) a sign\'e9, avec le Parti qu\'e9b\'e9cois (PQ) et Qu\'e9bec solidaire (QS), une d\'e9claration commune dans laquelle les trois partis s'engageaient \'e0 changer le mode de scrutin actuel uninominal \'e0 un tour, pour le remplacer par un mode de scrutin mixte avec proportionnelle. En point de presse apr\'e8s la c\'e9r\'e9monie, Mme LeBel a dit que son objectif \'e9tait de r\'e9former le mode de scrutin, mais quant au mod\'e8le, il reste \'e0 discuter. \£bLe diable est dans les d\'e9tails, alors on va consulter, on va voir de quelle fa\'e7on il est mieux de le faire, pour s£ssurer qu'il n'y ait pas de pertes, mais seulement des gains.\'bb Ira?

Le gouvernement Legault n£ pas l'intention de reculer sur cet engagement de longue date que la CAQ a repris de l'Action d\'e9mocratique du Qu\'e9bec (ADQ), son anc\'eatre. En m\'eal\'e9e de presse apr\'e8s la c\'e9r\'e9monie de pr\'e9sentation du cabinet, le nouveau ministre de l'\'c9ducation, Jean-Fran\'e7ois Roberge, a soulign\'e9 la fermet\'e9 du gouvernement sur cet enjeu, m\'eame si les commissions scolaires sont reconnues dans la Constitution et les anglophones avaient d\'e9j\'e0 menac\'e9 le pr\'e9c\'e9dent gouvernement Couillard d'un recours judiciaire en cas d£tteinte \'e0 leurs institutions. M.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada129","Environnement: la CAQ est surveill\'e9e par l'opposition sur un enjeu impos\'e9; Environnement: la CAQ sous surveillance","vendredi 4 janvier 2019 12:32 AM EST","La Presse Canadienne","QU\'c9BEC - La sc\'e8ne se d\'e9roule dans un centre commercial de Longueuil durant la derni\'e8re fin de semaine de la campagne \'e9lectorale au Qu\'e9bec, \'e0 moins de 24 heures du scrutin. Le chef caquiste Fran\'e7ois Legault croise les deux instigateurs de \£bParlons environnement\'bb, un mouvement pr\'e9sent sur les r\'e9seaux sociaux qui incitait les partis \'e0 aborder en priorit\'e9 les enjeux environnementaux et la lutte contre les changements climatiques. Est-ce un hasard? Ils reprochent \'e0 la Coalition avenir Qu\'e9bec (CAQ) la faiblesse de son programme en environnement et son intention de prolonger des autoroutes. M. Legault fait quant \'e0 lui valoir qu'il veut \'e9galement prolonger le R\'e9seau \'e9lectrique m\'e9tropolitain (REM) et investir 100 millions $ pour d\'e9contaminer des terrains dans l'est de Montr\'e9al. Les deux militants repartent \£bpas rassur\'e9s, pas satisfaits\'bb. \'c0 l'image de cette escarmouche, l'enjeu de l'urgence climatique a \'e9t\'e9 impos\'e9 \'e0 l'\'e9tat-major caquiste, qui n£ pas pu choisir de sa propre initiative d'en faire un de ses grands th\'e8mes. \'c0 peine quelques jours apr\'e8s l'\'e9lection du nouveau gouvernement caquiste majoritaire, un volumineux rapport scientifique du Groupe d'experts sur l'\'e9volution du climat (GIEC) destin\'e9 aux d\'e9cideurs du monde entier pr\'e9disait des cons\'e9quences d\'e9sastreuses si le r\'e9chauffement des temp\'e9ratures n'\'e9tait pas limit\'e9 \'e0 1,5 degr\'e9 par rapport au niveau pr\'e9industriel. Le Parti lib\'e9ral, le Parti qu\'e9b\'e9cois et Qu\'e9bec solidaire ont rapidement d\'e9tect\'e9 la faille dans l£rmure de la CAQ, son \£btalon d'Achille\'bb, son \£bangle mort\'bb, des expressions qui ont \'e9t\'e9 reprises depuis. Dans une rare unanimit\'e9, ils ont r\'e9clam\'e9 des \'c9tats g\'e9n\'e9raux sur l'urgence climatique, en vain, mais ont poursuivi leurs tirs group\'e9s. La nomination de MarieChantal Chass\'e9, une novice en politique, \'e0 titre de ministre de l'Environnement n£ pas contribu\'e9 non plus \'e0 donner le signal que la CAQ donnait un coup de barre dans le nouveau cabinet caquiste. La nouvelle ministre a \'e9t\'e9 per\'e7ue par l'opposition comme le \£bmaillon faible\'bb \'e0 attaquer en Chambre lors de la courte session parlementaire qui a suivi le discours inaugural. Des d\'e9buts difficiles Une suite de positions et de d\'e9cisions ont pu par ailleurs noircir le bilan des premiers pas de l'\'e9quipe caquiste en mati\'e8re de protection de l'environnement. Pensons au troisi\'e8me lien, ce projet de nouveau lien autoroutier entre la rive nord et la rive sud promu par la CAQ \'e0 Qu\'e9bec. S'est ajout\'e9 le projet d'usine d'ur\'e9e \'e0 B\'e9cancour, ainsi qu'un projet de pipeline qui partirait de l'Ontario pour se rendre au Saguenay, et enfin l£utorisation du passage d'une piste de motoneige dans le Parc national du Mont-Tremblant. Le premier ministre n£ tout de m\'eame pas manqu\'e9 de ligne de d\'e9fense ou de bou\'e9e de sauvetage. Par exemple, il s'est empar\'e9 rapidement d'un rapport qui constatait une hausse constante des \'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre du Qu\'e9bec au cours des derni\'e8res ann\'e9es, alors que la cible officielle est de r\'e9duire de 20 pour cent les \'e9missions d'ici \'e0 2020, par rapport au niveau de 1990. Il a ainsi eu beau jeu de critiquer le gouvernement lib\'e9ral pr\'e9c\'e9dent, mais a toutefois refus\'e9 de confirmer qu'il maintenait la cible de 2020. Pareillement, la pagaille constat\'e9e dans un rapport sur la gestion, durant le r\'e8gne lib\'e9ral, du Fonds vert - l'enveloppe sp\'e9ciale du gouvernement destin\'e9e \'e0 financer des mesures de lutte contre les changements climatiques - lui a permis de se d\'e9douaner. Les trois partis de l'opposition ont toutefois tent\'e9 de garder l'initiative. Ils ont exig\'e9 que le premier ministre participe \'e0 la COP24 , le grand sommet annuel des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques, au d\'e9but de d\'e9cembre. Ses pr\'e9d\'e9cesseurs comme Jean Charest et Philippe Couillard y ont d\'e9j\'e0 pris part et le Qu\'e9bec y a un r\'f4le reconnu de meneur parmi les \'c9tats f\'e9d\'e9r\'e9s. Fran\'e7ois Legault a cependant refus\'e9 d'y aller, \£bun rendez-vous manqu\'e9\'bb selon l'opposition. Le Parti lib\'e9ral est revenu \'e0 la charge en demandant une grande \£bmobilisation\'bb du milieu des affaires et du gouvernement Legault afin de poser la candidature du Qu\'e9bec en vue d£ccueillir le sommet de l'ONU sur le climat de 2020, la COP26. Fran\'e7ois Legault a refus\'e9, pr\'e9textant qu'il est plut\'f4t un homme d£ction. Alors 2019 sera un test: son gouvernement sera plac\'e9 sous surveillance concert\'e9e des partis de l'opposition pour obtenir des r\'e9sultats dans la lutte contre les changements climatiques et la transition \'e9nerg\'e9tique. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada131","Des objectifs de r\'e9duction des \'e9missions ambitieux pour le Canada en 2020; Climat: des objectifs canadiens ambitieux en 2020","mardi 4 d\'e9cembre 2018 07:02 PM EST","La Presse Canadienne","OTTAWA - Le Canada sera pr\'eat \'e0 \'e9tablir des objectifs plus stricts de r\'e9duction de ses \'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre lorsque l£ccord de Paris sur les changements climatiques entrera en vigueur \'e0 la fin de 2020, affirme la ministre de l'Environnement, Catherine McKenna. Celle-ci se rendra en Pologne la semaine prochaine pour la 24e r\'e9union annuelle des Nations unies sur le changement climatique. Les dirigeants du monde sont cens\'e9s d\'e9cider de la mani\'e8re dont chaque pays sera tenu responsable de sa r\'e9duction promise d'\'e9missions de carbone. Une discussion secondaire concerne les demandes des pays de se fixer des objectifs plus ambitieux. La r\'e9union de d\'e9cembre, connue sous le nom de Conf\'e9rence des Parties (ou COP24 ), intervient deux mois apr\'e8s que les scientifiques du changement climatique ont averti le monde que sans r\'e9duction significative des \'e9missions, la plan\'e8te serait en proie \'e0 des changements climatiques irr\'e9versibles et d\'e9vastateurs. Selon le rapport d'octobre, le Canada doit r\'e9duire ses \'e9missions de moiti\'e9 pour pouvoir jouer son r\'f4le. L'objectif actuel du Canada est de les r\'e9duire d'environ 27 pour cent. La ministre McKenna a h\'e9sit\'e9 \'e0 fixer des objectifs plus ambitieux, alors que le Canada est toujours incapable d£tteindre ses cibles les plus basses. En entrevue, elle a toutefois reconnu qu'\£ben 2020, tout le monde devra revenir et \'eatre plus ambitieux\'bb, et elle a assur\'e9 que le Canada le ferait. Catherine McKenna a ajout\'e9 que d'ici cette date, des normes devront \'eatre d\'e9finies en Pologne pour aider le monde \'e0 faire le point sur ses progr\'e8s et pour garantir l'utilisation de r\'e8gles universellement comprises. Cela permettra de s£ssurer que lorsqu'un pays dira que ses objectifs sont atteints, ils le seront r\'e9ellement. La r\'e9daction d'un r\'e8glement lors de la r\'e9union de ce mois-ci sera d£utant plus difficile apr\'e8s l'\'e9lection de plusieurs gouvernements moins enthousiastes vis-\'e0-vis de l£ccord de Paris.

Les objectifs de l£ccord de Paris L£ccord de Paris, sign\'e9 par tous les pays du monde, vise \'e0 r\'e9duire suffisamment la quantit\'e9 de gaz \'e0 effet de serre rejet\'e9e dans l£tmosph\'e8re pour que l£ugmentation de la temp\'e9rature mondiale moyenne ne d\'e9passe pas 2 degr\'e9s Celsius par rapport \'e0 la p\'e9riode pr\'e9industrielle, et aussi proche que possible de 1,5 degr\'e9. La temp\'e9rature moyenne dans le monde s'est d\'e9j\'e0 r\'e9chauff\'e9e d£u moins 1 degr\'e9 par rapport au 19e si\'e8cle et continue de se r\'e9chauffer d'environ 0,2 degr\'e9 chaque d\'e9cennie. Au rythme actuel des \'e9missions, les scientifiques pr\'e9voient que la plan\'e8te conna\'eetra un r\'e9chauffement de 1,5 degr\'e9 d'ici 2052. Apr\'e8s cela, l'impact sur la sant\'e9 humaine et les \'e9cosyst\'e8mes deviendra beaucoup plus probl\'e9matique. Catherine Abreu, directrice du R\'e9seau action climat Canada, s'est dite \£bravie\'bb que le Canada parle enfin d£ugmenter ses objectifs. \£bC'est une chose pour laquelle le Canada s'est vraiment pr\'e9par\'e9\'bb, a-t-elle d\'e9clar\'e9. En pr\'e9vision de la formulation de nouveaux objectifs, le Canada lance un nouvel institut sur les changements climatiques. L'organisme de recherche et de politiques est cens\'e9 ouvrir ses portes au cours de la prochaine ann\'e9e. Il conseillera le gouvernement sur la mani\'e8re dont ses politiques existantes fonctionnent et sur les autres mesures \'e0 prendre. Le gouvernement pr\'e9voit lui accorder 20 millions $ sur cinq ans. Mme Abreu esp\'e8re que l'institut sera plus qu'un autre groupe de r\'e9flexion. Elle voudrait que ce soit l'organisation qui \'e9value les progr\'e8s r\'e9alis\'e9s par le Canada pour atteindre ses objectifs en mati\'e8re d'\'e9missions. Trente-trois membres du R\'e9seau action climat ont \'e9crit cette semaine \'e0 la ministre McKenna et au premier ministre Justin Trudeau pour leur demander de fixer dans une loi les objectifs en mati\'e8re d'\'e9missions. Cela obligerait non seulement le gouvernement \'e0 atteindre ses objectifs, mais rendrait un recul plus difficile pour les futurs gouvernements. \"

Le Parti lib\'e9ral (PLQ) fait cette demande au moment o\'f9 le sommet de cette ann\'e9e, la COP24 , se termine \'e0 Katowice, en Pologne. Le d\'e9put\'e9 lib\'e9ral de Nelligan, Monsef Derraji, qui a \'e9t\'e9 envoy\'e9 par son parti \'e0 Katowice, a discut\'e9 de cette \'e9ventuelle candidature avec la d\'e9l\'e9gation qu\'e9b\'e9coise qui \'e9tait notamment compos\'e9e d'entrepreneurs et de chercheurs. Dans une entrevue diffus\'e9e dimanche, M.

Fran\'e7ois Legault a fait fi de la pression de l'opposition et de Greenpeace en d\'e9cidant de ne pas aller au sommet de Katowice. C'est sa ministre de l'Environnement, MarieChantal Chass\'e9, qui le repr\'e9sentait. En outre, son gouvernement a \'e9t\'e9 tr\'e8s critiqu\'e9 pour son absence de programme en environnement.

Elle a rappel\'e9 les conclusions du dernier rapport d'experts intergouvernementaux sur le climat, selon lequel la hausse moyenne de la temp\'e9rature ne pourra pas \'eatre limit\'e9e \'e0 1,5 degr\'e9 avec les cibles de r\'e9duction des GES actuelles, et que des hausses de temp\'e9rature beaucoup plus importantes sont \'e0 pr\'e9voir \'e0 moins d'une action plus forte.

L'opposition conservatrice s'insurge Les politiciens conservateurs \'e0 Ottawa et en Alberta ont critiqu\'e9 la d\'e9cision du gouvernement lib\'e9ral de Justin Trudeau, qu'ils jugent \'e9lectoraliste et inefficace. \£bL'offre d£ujourd'hui n'est qu'une tentative d\'e9sesp\'e9r\'e9e, en ann\'e9e \'e9lectorale, pour faire croire aux Canadiens de l'Ouest que (le premier ministre Trudeau) se soucie d'eux\'bb, a d\'e9nonc\'e9 le chef conservateur Andrew Scheer. \£bIl essaie seulement de sauver quelques si\'e8ges lib\'e9raux, rien de plus.\'bb Le chef du Parti conservateur uni de l'Alberta, Jason Kenney, a abond\'e9 dans son sens. \£bCette annonce est trop peu, trop tard pour ces familles qui souffrent en raison des priorit\'e9s antip\'e9trole et antigaz du gouvernement Trudeau\'bb, a-t-il d\'e9clar\'e9. La d\'e9put\'e9e bloquiste Monique Pauz\'e9, qui a particip\'e9 \'e0 la r\'e9cente conf\'e9rence internationale sur le climat en Pologne, s'est dite frustr\'e9e de la nouvelle. \£bOn est au lendemain de la COP24 et je trouve que c'est compl\'e8tement irresponsable d£ller faire les annonces comme celle-l\'e0 et m\'eame de penser encore \'e0 investir dans le secteur p\'e9trolier\'bb, a-t-elle d\'e9plor\'e9 en entrevue t\'e9l\'e9phonique. M\'eame son de cloche du c\'f4t\'e9 d'Andr\'e9 Belisle, de l'Association qu\'e9b\'e9coise de lutte contre la pollution atmosph\'e9rique (AQLPA), qui accuse le gouvernement Trudeau \£bd£jouter l'insulte \'e0 l'injure\'bb au lendemain de cette grande rencontre climatique. \£bIls jouent la com\'e9die. On ne peut pas, d'une part, dire qu'on va r\'e9duire les gaz \'e0 effets de serre comme M. Trudeau avait fait \'e0 Paris, la main sur le coeur (...) et revenir au Canada et dire qu'on va augmenter de 40 pour cent le p\'e9trole bitumineux, qui est la plus grande source de gaz \'e0 effets de serre au monde\'bb, a-t-il d\'e9plor\'e9. Annie B\'e9rub\'e9, directrice des relations gouvernementales de l'organisme \'c9quiterre, critique \'e9galement l£pproche d'Ottawa, qui ne choisit pas la bonne voie pour aider les Albertains, selon elle. \£b\'c7a fait des ann\'e9es qu'on tente d\'e9sesp\'e9r\'e9ment de trouver des nouveaux march\'e9s d'exportation, en particulier pour le p\'e9trole des sables bitumineux. Et en fait, ces march\'e9s d'exportation ne se sont jamais concr\'e9tis\'e9s, il n'y a pas de demande globalement pour cette \'e9nergie qui est tr\'e8s intensive en carbone et qui est tr\'e8s co\'fbteuse \'e0 raffiner\'bb, a-t-elle soulign\'e9. Greenpeace a aussi encourag\'e9 le gouvernement \'e0 se tourner vers les \'e9nergies propres pour aider les Albertains. \£bLe gouvernement f\'e9d\'e9ral devrait investir pour prot\'e9ger les travailleurs et les communaut\'e9s et acc\'e9l\'e9rer la transition vers les \'e9nergies renouvelables plut\'f4t que de faciliter l£ugmentation de la production et de la consommation de p\'e9trole\'bb, a indiqu\'e9 l'organisme dans une d\'e9claration transmise par courriel. \"

L'euphorie de 2015 a c\'e9d\'e9 la place \'e0 la p\'e9nible r\'e9alisation qu'il sera difficile d'obtenir un accord entre pr\'e8s de 200 pays, chacun ayant ses propres revendications politiques et \'e9conomiques - comme en t\'e9moigne la d\'e9cision du pr\'e9sident Donald Trump de retirer les \'c9tats-Unis de l£ccord de Paris, citant sa politique \£bAmerica First\'bb. \£bVu de l'ext\'e9rieur, c'est une t\'e2che impossible\'bb, a admis le ministre polonais adjoint de l'Environnement, Michal Kurtyka, \'e0 propos des n\'e9gociations qu'il pr\'e9sidera \'e0 Katowice du 2 au 14 d\'e9cembre. En t\'eate de l'ordre du jour sera la finalisation du soi-disant r\'e8glement de Paris, qui d\'e9termine comment les pays doivent comptabiliser leurs \'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre (GES), les communiquer de mani\'e8re transparente au reste du monde et r\'e9v\'e9ler ce qu'ils font pour les r\'e9duire. Des n\'e9gociateurs chevronn\'e9s qualifient la r\'e9union, qui devrait attirer 25 000 participants, de \£bParis 2.0\'bb en raison des enjeux \'e9lev\'e9s \'e0 Katowice. Incendies de for\'eat de la Californie \'e0 la Gr\'e8ce, s\'e9cheresses en Allemagne et en Australie, les temp\'eates Mangkhut dans le Pacifique et Michael dans l'Atlantique... Selon les scientifiques, les conditions m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames de cette ann\'e9e offrent un aper\'e7u des catastrophes \'e0 venir si le r\'e9chauffement de la plan\'e8te se poursuit. Un r\'e9cent rapport du Groupe international d'experts sur les changements climatiques (GIEC) avertit que le temps commence \'e0 manquer si le monde veut atteindre l'objectif le plus ambitieux de l£ccord de Paris, \'e0 savoir limiter le r\'e9chauffement climatique \'e0 1,5 degr\'e9 Celsius. La plan\'e8te s'est d\'e9j\'e0 r\'e9chauff\'e9e d'environ 1C depuis l'\'e8re pr\'e9industrielle et devrait encore r\'e9chauffer de deux \'e0 trois degr\'e9s d'ici la fin du si\'e8cle, \'e0 moins que des mesures radicales ne soient prises. La conf\'e9rence aura \£bdes cons\'e9quences assez importantes pour l'humanit\'e9 et pour la mani\'e8re dont nous prendrons soin de notre plan\'e8te\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 M. Kurtyka \'e0 l'Associated Press avant les n\'e9gociations. Les experts conviennent que les objectifs de Paris ne pourront \'eatre atteints qu'en neutralisant compl\'e8tement les \'e9missions de dioxyde de carbone et d£utres gaz \'e0 effet de serre (ce qu'on appelle le \£bnet zero\'bb, en anglais) d'ici 2050. La Commission europ\'e9enne a d£illeurs propos\'e9 mercredi de s£ttaquer \'e0 cet objectif. L'UE devient donc la premi\'e8re grande \'e9conomie \'e0 vouloir atteindre la neutralit\'e9 climatique, mais le but est nettement plus ambitieux que les cibles nationales \'e9nonc\'e9es jusqu'\'e0 pr\'e9sent par les 28 \'c9tats membres. La neutralit\'e9 climatique signifie que toutes les \'e9missions polluantes seraient contr\'e9es par de nouvelles for\'eats ou de nouvelles technologies pour retirer le carbone de l£tmosph\'e8re. Le responsable du climat au sein de l'UE, Miguel Arias Canette, assure qu'on dispose d\'e9j\'e0 des outils pour y parvenir. \£bOn n'invente pas la roue\'bb, a-t-il dit. Il a ensuite reconnu que des investissements consid\'e9rables seront n\'e9cessaires pour sevrer l'\'e9conomie europ\'e9enne des carburants fossiles, et que cela devra se faire d'une mani\'e8re acceptable socialement. L£ccord de Paris laisse les pays fixer leurs propres objectifs en mati\'e8re d'\'e9missions. Certains sont sur la bonne voie, d£utres pas. Globalement, le monde se dirige dans la mauvaise direction. La semaine derni\'e8re, l'Organisation m\'e9t\'e9orologique mondiale (OMM) a d\'e9clar\'e9 que les concentrations moyennes de dioxyde de carbone avaient atteint un nouveau record en 2017, tandis que le niveau d£utres gaz \'e0 effet de serre, tels que le m\'e9thane et l'oxyde nitreux, augmentait. Les \'e9missions anthropiques devraient encore grimper de 2 pour cent cette ann\'e9e, alors que la construction de centrales \'e9lectriques au charbon en Asie et en Afrique se poursuit, tandis que les for\'eats absorbant le carbone sont ras\'e9es plus rapidement qu'elles ne peuvent se r\'e9g\'e9n\'e9rer. \£bTout le monde sait que les plans nationaux, quand on additionne tout \'e7a ensemble, nous m\'e8neront bien au-del\'e0 de trois, potentiellement de quatre degr\'e9s Celsius\'bb, a rappel\'e9 Johan Rockstrom, le nouveau directeur de l'Institut de recherche sur l'impact du climat de Potsdam. \£bNous savons que nous allons dans la mauvaise direction, a-t-il ajout\'e9. Nous devons r\'e9duire les \'e9missions mondiales de carbone au plus tard en 2020, dans deux ans, pour avoir une chance de rester en dessous de 2 degr\'e9s Celsius.\'bb Convaincre les pays de fixer de nouveaux objectifs plus stricts en mati\'e8re de r\'e9duction des \'e9missions d'ici 2020 est un d\'e9fi majeur \'e0 Katowice. Cela entra\'eenera une transformation de tous les secteurs de leurs \'e9conomies, y compris la fin compl\'e8te de la combustion de carburants fossiles. Les pays pauvres veulent que les pays riches promettent les r\'e9ductions les plus importantes au motif qu'ils sont responsables de la plupart des \'e9missions de carbone dans l£tmosph\'e8re. Les pays riches se disent pr\'eats \'e0 montrer le chemin, mais seulement si les pays pauvres jouent \'e9galement leur r\'f4le. \£bIl est \'e9vident que tous les pays ne sont pas au m\'eame stade de d\'e9veloppement, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Lidia Wojtal, du cabinet de conseil berlinois Climatekos et une ancienne n\'e9gociatrice polonaise du climat. Nous devons donc \'e9galement prendre cela en compte et diff\'e9rencier les responsabilit\'e9s. Et c'est une t\'e2che \'e9norme.\'bb Parmi les plus susceptibles de faire pression pour l£doption de mesures ambitieuses figurent les petits \'c9tats insulaires, qui sont d\'e9j\'e0 confront\'e9s \'e0 de graves probl\'e8mes li\'e9s aux changements climatiques. Les \'c9tats-Unis, quant \'e0 eux, sont loin d'\'eatre la force motrice qu'ils ont \'e9t\'e9 lors des n\'e9gociations \'e0 Paris sous le pr\'e9sident Barack Obama. Le Br\'e9sil et l'Australie, qui \'e9taient auparavant des partisans fervents de l£ccord, semblent suivre les traces de M. Trump. Certains observateurs craignent que la pens\'e9e nationaliste sur le climat ne d\'e9truise tout espoir de progr\'e8s significatif \'e0 Katowice. D£utres sont plus optimistes. \£bNous verrons bient\'f4t une minorit\'e9 suffisamment grande d'\'e9conomies importantes avancer r\'e9solument dans la bonne direction, a pr\'e9dit M. Rockstrom. Cela peut avoir des effets d'entra\'eenement qui peuvent \'eatre positifs.\'bb La Pologne pourrait finir par jouer un r\'f4le crucial en rassemblant les parties adverses. Le pays a d\'e9j\'e0 pr\'e9sid\'e9 trois pr\'e9c\'e9dents rounds de n\'e9gociations sur le climat et sa forte d\'e9pendance vis-\'e0-vis du charbon oblige Varsovie \'e0 envisager des mesures rigoureuses dans les ann\'e9es \'e0 venir. La 24e Conf\'e9rence des Parties, ou COP24 , se tient sur le site d'une mine de Katowice ferm\'e9e en 1999 apr\'e8s 176 ans de production de charbon. Cinq des sept mines de la ville ont \'e9t\'e9 ferm\'e9es depuis les ann\'e9es 1990, alors que la Pologne \'e9liminait progressivement les subventions de l'\'e8re communiste et passait \'e0 une \'e9conomie de march\'e9. \"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada139","Les experts sous-estimaient largement la rapidit\'e9 du r\'e9chauffement il y a 25 ans; Changements climatiques: pire que pr\'e9vu","jeudi 29 novembre 2018 05:24 PM EST","La Presse Canadienne","WASHINGTON - Les climatologues ont rat\'e9 des tas de choses il y a environ un quart de si\'e8cle, quand ils ont essay\'e9 de pr\'e9dire l£mpleur de l'impact du r\'e9chauffement climatique. Ils n'ont pas su anticiper l£mpleur des cons\'e9quences des incendies de for\'eat, des s\'e9cheresses, des averses et des ouragans. Ils ont \'e9chou\'e9 \'e0 pr\'e9dire \'e0 quel point les calottes glaciaires de l'Antarctique occidental et du Groenland fondraient et contribueraient \'e0 l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer. Ils ont rat\'e9 une grande partie de la myriade de probl\'e8mes de sant\'e9 publique et de s\'e9curit\'e9 mondiale. Les scientifiques disent maintenant que le r\'e9chauffement climatique est plus rapide, plus \'e9tendu et tout simplement... pire que ce qui \'e9tait anticip\'e9. Les n\'e9gociateurs internationaux se r\'e9uniront la semaine prochaine en Pologne pour discuter d'un renforcement de la lutte aux changements climatiques dans le cadre de la conf\'e9rence COP24 . La compr\'e9hension que nous avons du r\'e9chauffement de la plan\'e8te a consid\'e9rablement \'e9volu\'e9 depuis la premi\'e8re conf\'e9rence en mars 1995. Depuis ce moment, le monde s'est r\'e9chauff\'e9 en moyenne d'environ 0,41 degr\'e9 Celsius, mais l'histoire est bien plus complexe que \'e7a. L£ugmentation annuelle de la temp\'e9rature mondiale est l\'e9g\'e8rement inf\'e9rieure \'e0 certaines pr\'e9visions du d\'e9but des ann\'e9es 1990. Pourtant, plus d'une douzaine de climatologues ont d\'e9clar\'e9 \'e0 l'Associated Press que, priv\'e9s des donn\'e9es actuellement disponibles et d'une compr\'e9hension am\'e9lior\'e9e du climat, les chercheurs d'il y a plusieurs d\'e9cennies \'e9taient trop conservateurs et ne pouvaient pas se rendre compte de l'impact du r\'e9chauffement climatique sur la vie quotidienne. Une \'e9tude scientifique r\'e9alis\'e9e ce mois-ci a montr\'e9 combien de fois - directement et indirectement - le r\'e9chauffement avait d\'e9j\'e0 transform\'e9 la Terre et la soci\'e9t\'e9. Le total \'e9tait de 467. Dans les ann\'e9es 1990, lorsque les scientifiques parlaient de r\'e9chauffement, ils se concentraient sur la temp\'e9rature moyenne annuelle mondiale et l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer. Le probl\'e8me est que les gens n'habitent pas toute la surface du globe et ne ressentent pas de temp\'e9ratures moyennes. Ils ressentent les ph\'e9nom\'e8nes extr\'eames - chaleur, pluie, s\'e9cheresse - qui les frappent chez eux un jour ou une semaine, a expliqu\'e9 Richard Alley, un climatologue de l'universit\'e9 Penn State. \£bLes jeunes g\'e9n\'e9rations grandissent l\'e0 o\'f9 il n'y a pas de normalit\'e9\'bb, a dit Kristie Ebi, une scientifique en climatologie et sant\'e9 publique \'e0 l'Universit\'e9 de Washington, soulignant que durant 406 mois cons\'e9cutifs, le monde \'e9tait plus chaud que la moyenne du 20e si\'e8cle. Plus r\'e9cemment, des \'e9conomistes se sont joints \'e0 des scientifiques pour pr\'e9voir un avenir co\'fbteux. William Nordhaus, \'e9conomiste \'e0 Yale et r\'e9cipiendaire du prix Nobel d'\'e9conomie 2018 pour ses travaux sur les changements climatiques et d£utres probl\'e8mes environnementaux, a d\'e9clar\'e9 \'e0 l'Associated Press que, selon ses calculs, les changements climatiques co\'fbteront 4000 milliards $ US par an \'e0 la fin du si\'e8cle aux \'c9tats-Unis, en tenant compte d'une projection raisonnable du r\'e9chauffement. Des cons\'e9quences observables par tout un chacun \'c0 l'\'e9poque, Michael Mann \'e9tait un \'e9tudiant dipl\'f4m\'e9 qui explorait le r\'e9chauffement climatique. \£bHonn\'eatement, je ne pensais pas que, \'e0 la mi-carri\'e8re, nous verrions les cons\'e9quences des changements climatiques \'e0 la t\'e9l\'e9vision\'bb, ni qu'elles seraient aussi fortes, a d\'e9clar\'e9 M. Mann, actuellement un sp\'e9cialiste du climat \'e0 l'universit\'e9 Penn State. Cela se traduit par des incendies de for\'eat, des ouragans accompagn\'e9s de pluies diluviennes, des inondations, des s\'e9cheresses, des vagues de chaleur et d£utres ph\'e9nom\'e8nes m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames, a-t-il ajout\'e9. Les scientifiques comprennent maintenant mieux comment les fluctuations des courants atmosph\'e9riques - tels que le courant-jet - et le cycle de la pluie peuvent provoquer des conditions m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames. Et des recherches r\'e9centes montrent comment les changements climatiques modifient ces facteurs naturels. Un lien direct avec l£ctivit\'e9 humaine Le plus grand changement dans la science au cours du dernier quart de si\'e8cle est que \£bnous pouvons maintenant attribuer les changements des temp\'e9ratures mondiales et m\'eame certains \'e9v\'e9nements extr\'eames \'e0 l£ctivit\'e9 humaine\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Sir Robert Watson, un ancien climatologue de la NASA et le Britannique qui a pr\'e9sid\'e9 le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'\'e9volution du climat de l'ONU de 1997 \'e0 2002. Avec des connaissances et des outils am\'e9lior\'e9s, les scientifiques peuvent mieux comprendre les ph\'e9nom\'e8nes m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames tels que les ouragans et les s\'e9cheresses, et effectuer des simulations informatiques complexes attribuant les ph\'e9nom\'e8nes extr\'eames au r\'e9chauffement provoqu\'e9 par la combustion du charbon, du p\'e9trole et du gaz naturel, a pr\'e9cis\'e9 M. Watson. Les scientifiques attribuent les \'e9v\'e9nements extr\'eames au r\'e9chauffement provoqu\'e9 par l'homme en comparant ce qui s'est pass\'e9 dans la vie r\'e9elle \'e0 des simulations sans gaz \'e0 effet de serre provenant de combustibles fossiles. Ils ont conclu que les changements climatiques avaient notamment caus\'e9 plus de pluie lors des ouragans Harvey, Maria et Katrina. Des \'e9tudes ont montr\'e9 que les changements climatiques avaient aggrav\'e9 les s\'e9cheresses, les pluies diluviennes et les vagues de chaleur, comme celle de Russie en 2010, qui ont tu\'e9 des milliers de personnes. Et elles ont li\'e9 les changements climatiques \'e0 la quantit\'e9 croissante de terres incendi\'e9es dans l'ouest des \'c9tats-Unis, ce qui n'\'e9tait pas consid\'e9r\'e9 comme un probl\'e8me climatique majeur il y a quelques d\'e9cennies, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Phil Dennison, un sp\'e9cialiste des incendies \'e0 l'universit\'e9 de l'Utah. De la pollution atmosph\'e9rique provoqu\'e9e par les incendies de for\'eat qui a pouss\'e9 les habitants du nord de la Californie \'e0 enfiler des masques respiratoires aux attaques d£sthme de plus en plus fr\'e9quentes qui envoient des enfants \'e0 l'h\'f4pital, les experts m\'e9dicaux pr\'e9viennent que les changements climatiques nuisent \'e0 la sant\'e9. \£bNous avons des surprises, a d\'e9clar\'e9 la professeure de sant\'e9 publique Kristie Ebi. Nous projetons des changements et nous les voyons plus t\'f4t que pr\'e9vu.\'bb Cela inclut des moustiques porteurs de maladies autrefois tropicales au Canada et l£rriv\'e9e en Alaska des bact\'e9ries des mollusques et des coquillages des eaux chaudes, a-t-elle illustr\'e9. La docteure Renee Salas, une urgentologue de l'H\'f4pital g\'e9n\'e9ral du Massachusetts qui a \'e9crit un chapitre dans les rapports annuels sur les effets sur la sant\'e9 li\'e9s au climat du journal m\'e9dical Lancet, a rappel\'e9 que ces statistiques n'\'e9taient pas abstraites, mais bien r\'e9elles. \£bQuand j£i d\'fb dire \'e0 une m\'e8re en pleurs que je devais admettre sa fille de quatre ans pour une crise d£sthme, lors de sa quatri\'e8me visite en une semaine, le changement climatique \'e9tait vraiment une de mes pr\'e9occupations parce que je savais que sa maladie \'e9tait due \'e0 la hausse des niveaux de pollen\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 la docteure Salas. Les calottes glaciaires massives de l'Antarctique occidental et du Groenland fondent beaucoup plus rapidement que ne l£vaient imagin\'e9 les scientifiques il y a un quart de si\'e8cle. L'Antarctique a perdu pr\'e8s de 3000 milliards de tonnes de glace depuis 1992, suffisamment pour recouvrir le Texas sur pr\'e8s de quatre m\'e8tres de profondeur, ont annonc\'e9 des scientifiques en juin. Le Groenland a perdu plus de 5000 milliards de tonnes au cours de la m\'eame p\'e9riode. La fonte en Antarctique et au Groenland au cours des derni\'e8res ann\'e9es \£ba litt\'e9ralement doubl\'e9 nos pr\'e9visions concernant l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer \'e0 la fin du si\'e8cle\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 M. Mann, de Penn State. Des chercheurs se disent encore conservateurs dans leurs sc\'e9narios Les non-experts qui rejettent la science traditionnelle qualifient souvent les scientifiques d'\£balarmistes\'bb, mais la plupart des chercheurs assurent qu'ils ont tendance \'e0 \'e9viter les pires sc\'e9narios. Les scientifiques disent qu'il est dans leur nature d'\'eatre trop conservateurs. Dans presque tous les cas, lorsque les scientifiques ont rat\'e9 la cible, c'\'e9tait davantage parce qu'ils avaient sous-estim\'e9 un probl\'e8me que parce qu'ils l£vaient surestim\'e9, a dit le climatologue britannique Robert Watson. Mais il y a les pires cas possible. Ce sont les points de bascule, apr\'e8s lesquels les changements s£cc\'e9l\'e8rent et on ne peut plus revenir en arri\'e8re. La calotte glaciaire s'effondre. On voit des changements massifs dans la circulation oc\'e9anique. Les extinctions se multiplient \'e0 travers le monde. \£bAu d\'e9but des ann\'e9es 1990, nous n£vions que des indices sur le fait que nous pourrions pousser le syst\'e8me climatique vers des points critiques, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Jonathan Overpeck, le doyen de la Facult\'e9 de l'environnement \'e0 l'Universit\'e9 du Michigan. Nous savons maintenant que nous sommes peut-\'eatre en train d£ssister au d\'e9but d'une extinction massive qui pourrait faire dispara\'eetre jusqu'\'e0 la moiti\'e9 des esp\'e8ces sur Terre.\'bb \"

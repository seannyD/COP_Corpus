In an interview, the Liberal party's interim leader called on the premier to show his commitment to addressing climate issues by heading up a Quebec delegation comprised of representatives from all political parties as well as civil society and business.""Francois Legault needs to show the world that Quebec is serious and that he wants to continue the leadership that we've shown over the past years,"" Pierre Arcand told The Canadian Press.Arcand said Legault's participation is doubly necessary given what he called the United States' indifference to climate issues.At least two of Legault's predecessors, Philippe Couillard and Jean Charest, attended previous climate summits.Greenpeace spokesman Patrick Bonin, for his part, said Quebec has ""a major role"" to play in a conference that is addressing ""urgent"" issues.""It's practically an obligatory passage for a new government that has to work doubly hard because it has come empty-handed to the election campaign on the issue of climate change,"" Bonin said in an interview.Bonin said it's in the new Coalition Avenir Quebec government's interest to attend, in order to take better advantage of emerging green economies and give the new environment minister a crash course in climate issues.Contacted Friday, Chasse's office said the final decision on attendance had not yet been made.On the federal side, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has said she will attend. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not yet confirmed his presence.The UNConference on Climate ChangeThe legislature gets underway on Nov. 27 and in principle should be in session until Dec. 7, during which time the new government is expected to present its first bills since winning October's election.\l"

Women play an important role in fighting climate change and advancing clean growth. That is why the Government of Canada is following through with this commitment by holding, with France, a training workshop on climate negotiations for 15 francophone negotiators from the sub-Saharan African region in Dakar, Senegal from October 22 to 25, 2018. The workshop, which will be offered in French for the first time, aims to help participants develop the personal skills, competencies, and knowledge they need for international negotiations, decision making, and the development of climate change policies. These skills will be especially useful ahead of the 24th United Nations (COP24), which will be hosted in Poland, in December 2018. The project follows the launch of the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, in April 2018. This partnership includes several Franco-Canadian cooperation actions for 2018\- 2019, such as including climate in development assistance actions. In addition to supporting the Franco-Canadian participation in climate issues, this workshop encourages a diversity of voices at the negotiation table, by supporting the participation of francophone women. Developed and funded by Canada and France, the workshop is also a partnership with the Institut de la Francophonie pour le d\'e9veloppement durable and the Women\' s Environment & Development Organization.

Trudeau&rsquo;s Liberal government cannot go to COP24 to simply defend how they will miss their reduction targets; they must instead take the opportunity to significantly increase their action to address the most pressing crisis facing Canadians.  The report tabled a few weeks ago by the IPCC is unequivocal: if no changes are made, humanity will lose its fight against climate change. Prime Minister Trudeau has made moving speeches for three years, but because of his government&rsquo;s inaction, we already know the country will not be able to achieve the goals it has set by signing the Paris agreement on climate change, said NDP Environment and Climate Change Critic Alexandre Boulerice.  With its highly inadequate approach, the Liberal government is contributing to humanity's climate disaster. COP24 is the perfect time for Trudeau&rsquo;s government to urgently increase its action to tackle climate change. In order for the Trudeau government to increase their action on climate change, the NDP will be presenting the following motion for unanimous consent to the House of Commons: That the House asks the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change to bring forward the following priorities and commitments at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: i) a climate action strategy that prioritizes reconciliation with indigenous peoples; ii) investments in a transition that leaves no workers behind; iii) robust rules for implementing the Paris Agreement that will allow Canada to increase the ambition of its GHG reduction targets in response to the IPCC report; iv) transparency and accountability mechanisms to address climate change; and v) integrating human health into Canada's climate commitments.  We are already seeing the impacts of climate change in Canada: longer heat waves, climate refugees, species extinctions, crop losses, floods, forest fires, heat islands, disruption of our ecosystems and other extreme weather events. It's simple, this is our most important fight, added NDP Deputy Environment and Climate Change Critic Linda Duncan.  Just last week we saw a media report categorizing Canada with China and Russia on the list of biggest polluters. This is wrong and shows Trudeau&rsquo;s lack of urgent action on this file. New Democrats will continue to push this government for urgent action because we know we need to defend our environment and fight climate change now.

But Poland's President Andrzej Duda told a later news conference that the coal-rich country will never entirely give up its ""strategic fossil fuel.""In order to steer businesses and consumers away from heavily polluting forms of energy, the U.N. chief urged countries to embrace carbon pricing, something few countries have yet to do.Guterres also urged negotiators not to forget that the challenges they face pale in comparison to the difficulties climate change is already causing millions around the world whose homes and livelihoods are at risk from rising sea levels, drought and more powerful storms.The two-week conference, in Poland's southern coal mining region of Silesia, is expected to work out how governments can report on their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming within the Paris accord limit.""This is the challenge on which this generation's leaders will be judged,"" Guterres said.Andrzej Duda, President of Poland, prepares to speak at the opening ceremony of the COP 24 United Nations on December 03, 2018 in Katowice, Poland.He later told reporters that realities about global climate are ""worse than expected, but the political will is relatively faded after Paris"" and is not matching the challenges.Guterres called for a ""huge increase in ambitions"" during the two weeks of negotiations in Poland, adding ""we cannot afford to fail in Katowice.""Duda, the Polish leader, said participants at the conference have backed its proposal of a ""just transition"" away from coal mining, which calls for helping those people, like coal miners, who are slated to lose their jobs as the world changes its energy mix.Fiji's prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's UN climate summit, said the ""just transition"" proposal shouldn't just consider the fate of fossil fuel workers but all people around the world whose lives are affected by climate change.Residents of the world's smaller islands, many of whom face catastrophic flooding from higher sea levels in a warming world, have been among the world's most vocal backers of measures to combat climate change. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada12","Political approach to climate change is alarmist","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)","In New Brunswick and across Canada, the more time passes, the less support among the public there appears to be for the\~carbon tax the federal government is imposing, especially on reluctant provinces with alternative proposals.Canada's not the only place witnessing considerable discontent and citizen anger about heavy-handed governments telling citizen's what's best for them, paying little heed to what the voters think. See street protests in France, the vote for Brexit in the United Kingdom and the province of Ontario electing populist Doug Ford.On the whole, Canadians have long been ahead of\~politicians in\~concerns about climate change and other environmental issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in agreement with the consensus among full-time environmental activists who, however well-meaning, are ideologues, not scientists.To the extent politicians in Canada have paid attention to climate change, they've largely relied on activists for proposed solutions. That usually means summarily dismissing legitimate public objections and proposed alternatives.It's how we got shortages of corn and food riots in poor nations. It was a ""solution"" ill-thought-through. The carbon tax is another case of trying to reach a positive goal (reduction of fossil fuel use) the least effective way possible,\~indirectly by changing ingrained behaviour.Political image and ethical certitudes that evolve into platitudes mean increasingly less the longer they're unsupported by concrete, effective action. Canada long ago once seemed in the lead on climate change. We made much of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol as years passed.But it was mostly talk, with minimal action. We didn't meet our Kyoto obligations, just signed on for newer ones. And we aren't meeting the new ones, either.Kyoto, a.k.a. the COP3 meetings, was billed as the international agreement to save the world. The failed COP24 meetings that just finished on Saturday in Poland heard the same rhetoric.These annual COP events have failed (the acronym is for ""Conference of the Parties,"" and the number denotes the consecutive years since the first of the United Nations held).I've argued even before the 2015 COP21/Paris meetings - which also promised to finally save the world - that we'd be farther ahead if we scrapped the costly, futile exercise and put all our focus and money on practical measures in each nation.Three years, and three conferences later, we're again simultaneously being told the climate crisis is worsening and coming ever faster, while shaky international agreements seriously crumble.And like every one of these events up to this year's, COP24 concluded with unsubstantiated hopeful news releases and assertions of progress and success, all contradicted by the inescapable fact the delegates didn't agree on their self-defined crucial items and are kicking the ball down the road.They'll do it again next year too. It's been 24 years straight now.\~It's easy to see why. They're trying to get virtually every nation in the world to agree on complex, expensive\~and difficult solutions, muddled by so many variables that they'll never get there.It took three years since Paris for the annual event\~to even try to create a ""rule book"" for how to implement the agreement. It's not crying wolf,\~it's wheel spinning for 24 years straight.Had Canadian governments been listening carefully to the public all along, instead of wasting millions on these conferences, the nation and planet would be in better shape today.\~Instead, we're being told again that government knows better than those who elect them. They'll decide, and we're told to go away and pay their tax grab until the next time they expect our votes. How could the public not be happy?The Trudeau government, heading into an election year, remains remains tone deaf and arrogant, mistaking a weak opposition for voter approval instead of voters holding their noses.There are alternatives to a tax, big things Ottawa could use to pull Canada's weight. Begin by declaring Canada a zero-emissions-vehicle zone by 2028. The auto industry has dragged its feet too long. Do it or lose our market.Where is investment in tidal power and\~high-speed, electric inter-urban transit across the nation? A carbon tax achieves nothing when consumers have no alternatives to use.Where are community wind or solar farms? Where is reverse metering? We have instead fibs about the tax being revenue neutral. And supposedly it ain't a tax, it's ""a price on carbon.""We'd do better without the UN and panicked activists, replacing them with community efforts at every level that genuinely get things done.

Smaller brands around the world are using repurposed and recycled materials. In announcing Earth Polo, Ralph Lauren committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. The shirts are manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each uses an average 12 bottles.The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibers will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibers, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture.The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. It comes in styles for men and women in green, white, navy and light blue. The shirts are not more expensive than other Polos.Ralph Lauren has taken on environmental initiatives over the years, but it's putting into place a more significant strategy aimed at changing both its corporate culture and how it thinks about the clothes it produces. The effort includes a new supply chain and sustainability officer, Halide Alagoz, who said more details will be released in June.""At the moment we're refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability,"" she said.Among the company's other goals: the use of 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100% recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year.Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment.Late last year, Burberry and H&M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations , COP24, in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory but is exploring the call to action.As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibers that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is ""much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean.""The broader question of biodegradability of such fibers remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said.""There's so much out in the world that is not good for the environment. Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities,"" he said. ""Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem?

Each uses an average 12 bottles.The shirts are produced in partnership with First Mile, an organization that collects the bottles turned into yarn and, ultimately, fabric. The new fibres will also be used for existing performance wear already made of polyfibres, which are popular for their ability to wick away moisture.The Earth Polo went on sale Thursday, ahead of Monday's Earth Day, at RalphLauren.com and retail stores around the world. It comes in styles for men and women in green, white, navy and light blue. The shirts are not more expensive than other Polos.Ralph Lauren has taken on environmental initiatives over the years, but it's putting into place a more significant strategy aimed at changing both its corporate culture and how it thinks about the clothes it produces. The effort includes a new supply chain and a sustainability officer, Halide Alagoz, who said more details will be released in June.""At the moment, we're refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability,"" she said.Among the company's other goals: the use of 100 per cent sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100 per cent recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year.Other fashion powerhouses are also getting more aggressive on the environment.Late last year, Burberry and H&;M were among fashion stakeholders to sign on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations , COP24, in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Ralph Lauren is not a signatory, but is looking at it.As for Earth Polo, a huge threat facing oceans today involves trillions of tiny plastic and chemical-covered non-plastic microfibres that flow from washing machines through drain water, placing smaller fish and other sea life, such as anemones, at risk.Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfibre is ""much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean.""The broader question of biodegradability of such fibres remains unresolved. For Polo Earth, the story is about recycling and reusing, Lauren said.""Whatever materials we can turn into threads, we'll start looking at other opportunities,"" he said. ""Right now, we're trying to make sure that what we produce is as good for the environment as possible, or at least helps clean up another problem. Are we creating a new problem? I think we're creating solutions, or at least trying to find solutions.""\l"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada15","'We are still not doing enough'; Leaders stress need to win support for climate measures","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Prince George Citizen (British Columbia)","As leaders attending the UN's annual climate summit heard fresh warnings about the dire consequences of leaving global warming unchecked, a new issue emerged Monday as a pressing concern: how to persuade millions of workers their industry can't have a future if humanity is to have one.Hosting the talks in the heart of its coal region of Silesia, Poland tried to set the tone for the two-week meeting by promoting the idea of a ""just transition"" for miners and other workers facing layoffs as countries adopt alternative energy sources.""We are trying to save the world from annihilation, but we must do this in a way that those who live with us today in the world have the best possible living conditions,"" Polish President Andrzej Duda said. ""Otherwise they will say, 'We don't want such policy.""'The issue of a ""just transition"" isn't restricted to workers in energy industries who might lose their jobs. Many economists argue that ambitious curbs on greenhouse emissions require raising the cost of carbon fuels - one of the measures that triggered large-scale protests in France by motorists feeling the squeeze at the pump.Scientists say the only way to keep average global temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century is to phase out the use of fossil fuels by 2050. That is the most ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris agreement, which negotiators from nearly 200 countries have come to Katowice to finalize.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a dramatic appeal to leaders Monday to take the threat of global warming seriously, calling it ""the most important issue we face.""""Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,"" Guterres told delegates from almost 200 countries on the second day of talks.Famed British naturalist Sir David Attenborough echoed his warnings, telling the gathering that the ""collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizons"" if no urgent action is taken against global warming.The 92-year-old TV presenter blamed humans for the ""disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years.""Without naming specific countries, Guterres chided the nations most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions for failing to do enough to meet the goals set in Paris.Citing a recent scientific report, the UN chief urged governments to aim for net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero emissions mean that any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest or new technologies that can remove carbon from the atmosphere.Such cuts would require a radical overhaul of the global economy. But Guterres said governments should embrace the opportunities of shifting to a ""green economy"" rather than cling to fossil fuels such as coal, which are blamed for a significant share of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. officials have kept a low profile at the talks so far. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced Washington's withdrawal from the Paris accord, saying it's a bad deal for Americans, and repeatedly questioned the science behind climate change.By contrast, action film star and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger drew crowds and applause at the UN conference Monday for insisting that many in the United States remain committed to the agreement.The Netherlands, a country with a long history of pumping oil and gas from the ground, is also among the places most at risk from rising sea levels caused by global warming.With millions of people in the Netherlands living in low-lying areas, ""you have your evidence and your case in point to make, sure, that you prevent sea levels from rising even further"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told The Associated Press.Asked about the recent protests in France, one of which turned into a riot in Paris on Saturday, Rutte said politicians must work to get all of society to back the measures needed to tackle climate change.""That means talking, talking, talking,"" he said. ""With all societal organizations, politicians, all citizens being involved if they want to.""More talk is doubtlessly necessary, including at the international level. Poland's President Duda told reporters that his country, which relies on coal for 80 per cent of its energy, would work to reduce its reliance on coal but never entirely give up its ""strategic fossil fuel.""Among those addressing conference participants this week is a 15-year-old Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, who has inspired students around the world to campaign against global warming.Thunberg criticized leaders, such as Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who failed to come to the climate talks.""I think that in the future we will look back and we will either laugh at them or we will hate them,"" she told The Associated Press. ""It's very sad, but if they don't do anything right now that is the truth.""\l"

Our message for the international audience at COP24 is that sub-national governments like B.C. can be difference-makers in the fight against climate change, Heyman said.  We&rsquo;re there to listen to ideas and to share how our plan puts our province on the path to a cleaner, better future - with a low-carbon economy that creates opportunities for all. From Dec. 10-13, 2018, Heyman will participate in a number of panels with international government and private-sector leaders, as well as provide keynote addresses on carbon pricing and sustainable transport policy. Heyman will also receive the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Momentum for Change award, on behalf of British Columbia, for its Carbon Neutral Government Program, now in its 10th year of operation. The conference is an opportunity to connect with world leaders and share what is being done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home, as well as to learn what other nations and sub-national governments are doing to combat one of the greatest challenges facing the planet. Quick Facts: Highlights of the CleanBC plan include: By 2040, every new car sold in B.C. will be a zero-emission vehicle. Government is helping people afford cleaner cars and save money on fuel with incentive programs, and making it easier to charge or fuel them. The Province is speeding up the switch to cleaner fuels at the gas pump \- with further reductions to the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. Every new building constructed in B.C. will be  net-zero energy ready&rdquo; by 2032, meaning they will be so energy efficient they will be able to produce their own power. Along the way, government will require new buildings to become progressively more efficient through changes to the building code, and by ramping up funding for renovations and energy retrofits to existing homes and offices, including $400 million to support retrofits and upgrades for B.C.\' s stock of publicly funded housing. Government is helping B.C. to reduce residential and industrial organic waste, turning it into a clean resource. The Province is helping industry lower its emissions and reduce its pollution by reinvesting some of the carbon tax paid by industry in technologies that reduce their emissions.

His predecessors, Philippe Couillard and Jean Charest, both made a point of showing up at past editions of COP, as the summit of world leaders is commonly known. They ensured Quebec was part of the dialogue, particularly when Canada couldn't even be bothered to go under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper.For a political leader who admits the environment isn't his strong suit, but who has indicated he wants to make the fight against climate change a priority, attending COP24 would be a perfect time to turn good intentions into action. It would also be an opportunity to ascend the steep learning curve of scientific data and bureaucratic language that often shroud efforts to reduce global emissions as well as exchange with experts on the best practices and strike partnerships with allies. It's not that Chass\'e9 can't do any of this, but there would be more gravitas if the premier were galvanized in the effort.Declining to participate is a missed opportunity for Legault. But more than that, it's a sign that he's not recognizing the urgency of facing climate change despite the litany of alarms blaring dire warnings.

These mobilized companies are paving the way to continue this vast regional campaign entitled ""Here, we're taking action for the climate!"" The $60,000 funding obtained by the CREE under the Action-Climat Qu\'e9bec program, funded by the Green Fund and implemented by the FAQDD, was able to raise awareness for almost 400 representatives of organizations in the region of the impacts of climate change and the importance of taking action. Through conferences and workshops on the theme ""Understanding and responding to climate change in the Estrie region"", these change agents were invited to act on sustainable rainwater management, the electrification of transportation and active transportation, eco-responsible practices in companies, and the energy efficiency of buildings.At the heart of this original approach, experienced experts have accompanied industries, businesses and institutions (ICI) in the region ready to act in the fight against climate change. The CREE, ADDERE Consulting Service, the Quebec Association for Energy Management (AQME), COGESAF, COBARIC and the MRC du Granit have offered their expertise to ICI by identifying their needs and providing them with the tools they need to move to action. Several measures have already been implemented as a result, such as the purchase of an electric vehicle by JL Expertise, the conversion of lighting and windows by the Sherbrooke Community Development Corporation, the organization of a bike-to-work campaign by the firm EXP, and obtaining the ICI recycle level 3 certificate by Horizon Notaires.The number of municipal councils that support the Universal Declaration of Citizens with a Climate Emergency is multiplying in Quebec (more than 150 municipalities) and the number of signatories to the Transition Pact exceeds 250,000 people. It is clear that citizen mobilization for the climate is being organized.At the same time, at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (), leaders and representatives of 196 countries and states are expected to establish guidel"

Loggers in the Amazon are not waiting for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's right-wing president-elect, to take office Jan. 1 to expand their footprint in the Amazon jungle.The rate of deforestation in the Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, leaped 50 per cent from August through October as Bolsonaro emerged as a favourite in the country's presidential election, according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, which keeps tabs on the destruction of the rain forest through satellite images.Bolsonaro rode a populist wave of disgust with Brazil's traditional political parties to a presidential victory in October, waving off concerns about the environment with speeches about economic development in the rain forest. The former army captain has promised to reap the Amazon's riches for Brazil and suggested that he would cut back on indigenous rights. He criticized the government's environmental protection agency as an ""industry of fines.""That talk has quickly translated to action. Brazil withdrew its offer to host a 2019 United Nationsclimate-change conference, and Bolsonaro has threatened to pull Brazil out of the Paris accord on climate change. He has also pondered placing the environmental ministry under the ministry of agriculture, a department critics say is swayed by Brazil's powerful farm lobby, historically opposed to indigenous rights.As his foreign minister, Bolsonaro has tapped Ernesto Araujo, a Trump-loving diplomat who wrote in an October blog post that climate change is a ""dogma"" that serves to stymie democratic capitalist countries.""Environmental politics can't muddle with Brazil's development,"" Bolsonaro said last week. ""Today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.""Activists are learning that when it comes to the Amazon, the president's talk is not cheap. Even before he can implement these policies, Bolsonaro's statements are having an effect. During the last few months of the campaign, the Amazon lost 600 square miles of forest - an area two times the size of New York City. Some areas of the jungle saw deforestation rates nearly triple during the last few months of the campaign, compared with this time last year.Logging is an expensive and risky business. Because the forest is so dense, it can cost tens of millions of dollars to bring the labour and equipment necessary to cut down a few hectares of lucrative lumber in the Amazon. Brazil's illegal loggers pay close attention to developments in Brasilia before investing in deforestation projects that can be thwarted by authorities. They have interpreted Bolsonaro's statements as a green light to start chopping, according to Greenpeace.""We measure deforestation through satellite images from the Amazon, but if we had a satellite measuring the cause of that deforestation, it would be pointed at Brasilia,"" said Marcio Astrini, a public policy coordinator at Greenpeace.Deforestation rates hit a 10-year high last year and are expected to drastically expand under a Bolsonaro administration, according to analysts.Deforestation is considered the second-largest contributor to climate change, after fossil fuel use, accounting for about 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Forests act as sponges for carbon dioxide, soaking it up and converting it into plant material. When trees are cut down or burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.""When we are talking about illegal logging, the message is often more important than the law,"" Astrini said. ""And the message that is being sent is that deforestation is permitted."" !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Times &; Transcript (Moncton)\l"

The U.S. president has moved to take apart the Obama-era regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity generation plants. He has vowed to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate change accord.At a United Nations climate change conference in Poland this week, U.S. negotiators joined forces with Russia, Australia and Saudi Arabia to promote the use of carbon-rich fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.""The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,"" Trump adviser Wells Griffith told the conference, as environmental activists jeered.""No country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability.""To the New York Times, it was evidence of Trump's move from mere outlier on the climate change front to downright opponent of anything designed to constrain global warming.And in some ways it was - particularly since it came only two days after the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia deep-sixed an attempt to have the conference endorse the latest report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This report warns that the world is running out of time in the battle against global warming.But the essence of the Trump critique - that nations cannot afford to leave their oil and gas reserves undeveloped, regardless of the effect on climate change - is not unique to him. It is shared by, among others, Canada's own Justin Trudeau.""No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there,"" the prime minister said in Houston last year, in reference to Alberta's controversial oilsands.""The resource will be developed. Our job is to ensure that this is done responsibly, safely and sustainably.""How does this mesh with Canada's stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels and doing so by the year 2030? The answer is that it doesn't. The Canadian government admits that its carbon-reduction strategy - already modest to begin with - is not on target.Indeed, the federal, Alberta and British Columbia governments continue to subsidize the oil and natural gas industries.The federal Liberal government has purchased a pipel"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada33","Comment on 'White Pines Cancellation'letters","December 13, 2018 Thursday","Picton County Weekly News","The subject article evoked a couple of letters from the £nti-wind'side of the debate. John Hirsch started with, ""Health"", stating 'Wind turbines also cause serious health effects in humans, even with the legal setbacks required'. Wind Concerns Ontario has helped bring to light thousands of noise complaints to the Ministry of the Environment and never acted upon;"" Indeed: Wind Concerns Ontario have certainly provided many complaints. These were dealt with locally at a Tribunal in 2010. No credible evidence was produced. After years of study, the ""Climate and Health Alliance"" state that: ""To date, there is no credible peer reviewed scientific evidence that demonstrates a direct causal link between wind turbines and adverse health impacts in people living in proximity to them."" HYPERLINK https://tinyurl.com/y85qdma7https://tinyurl.com/y85qdma7Mr. Hirsch then spoke of harm to birds, turtles, etc. Indeed. All human-activity takes a toll on wildlife. But he failed to mention the same applies to; farming, cars and of new home development that demands more and more energy from the Ontario grid. We all love locally produced food and wine, so why not locally produced pollution free energy? Mr. Hirsch's second point suggests that wind energy may be sold at a loss at night when energy demand is low. A point not mentioned is that the Ontario Energy grid (the grid) consists of the inflexible nuclear energy generators with their relatively consistent output at 10+MW of power, along with the hydro and gas generators. And on a very windy night, wind may produce 10 per cent of the roughly 11 to 15 MW total energy output. The nuclear stations produce 10+MW of power 24/7 -needed or not. HYPERLINK http://www.sygration.com/gendata/today.htmlhttp://www.sygration.com/gendata/today.html.His third point has some merit. He speaks about the energy costs of integrating the changing wind energy into the grid by using gas-driven generators to act as a buffer so that total generation capacity matches the instantaneously load on the grid. To prove his point he kindly refers to a great report by the 'Ontario Society of Professional Engineers'(OSPE) HYPERLINK https://tinyurl.com/ybjg5ysbhttps://tinyurl.com/ybjg5ysbThe executive summary recommends that the 'Ministry of Energy'needs to improve the way wind energy is integrated into the grid; possibly by developing new storage, such as hydrogen generation, and also to, ""AuthorizeOPG to adjust the FIT rates and annual maximum capacity additions in each category to an affordable level that will sustain the new green energy sectors.'So it is not 'wind energy'that is the problem, but the Ontario Power Generating organization simply have not kept up with the best ways of dealing with it. Mr. Hirsch says, ""So wind energy in Ontario's system just doesn't make sense.'Well Mr. Hirsch, it makes sense to the engineers of OSPE and to anyone else that is familiar with the importance of energy in society: And it makes sense to a 12-year-old girl from Sudbury who is spearheading the Canadian branch of the growing youth-movement intent of forcing governments into action!

One of the quotes described our current national unity problem well: ""Canada will be a strong country when Canadians of all provinces feel at home in all parts of the country, and when they feel that all Canada belongs to them.""Increasingly, Albertans do not feel at home in Canada or that Canada belongs to us. If I were to pinpoint the one issue that has driven the biggest wedge, it is the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.I've been watching the climate change debate become increasingly extreme since Canada first signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The practice of our political leaders has been to sign an agreement with overly aggressive targets, fail to achieve them, then sign onto even more aggressive targets.The Paris Accord marked peak absurdity, where the government agreed to reduce our emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Since signing the Paris Accord, the rhetoric has become even more alarming with environmentalists claiming we actually need to reduce emissions to 80 per cent below 2005 levels by 2050, and others saying we need to be off fossil fuels completely within 10 years if we are to survive.The extremists may believe it, but no one else does.

The city of about 300,000 people grew up around workshops and mills fuelled by the coal deposits abundant in the ground.At the International Congress Centre in Katowice, where thousands of environment leaders and representatives from almost every country in the world are meeting for at least two weeks, you can see the smoke stacks and plumes of coal exhaust from nearby power plants.Attendees, whose mission at these talks is to set rules for monitoring countries' progress in meeting their climate-change promises, were greeted by the Polish Coal Miners Band. Displays inside the conference hall include wire baskets filled with coal. Coal jewelry and soap are for sale. The ""COP24"" conference's main sponsors are all coal companies, including the Polish state-owned coal-mining concern and the state-owned power company.Coal is the world's dirtiest source of electricity, producing generally twice the greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas and contributing to air pollution that kills an estimated 800,000 people a year. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this year warned of the grave impacts on the planet if the world doesn't curb emissions significantly over the next decade, and to do that, suggested 60 per cent of existing coal plants must be closed by 2030.Polish President Andrzej Duda used his opening speech at the COP24 conference on Dec. 3 to declare that coal is not the enemy of climate change action.""The use of one's own resources - in Poland's case coal - and basing energy security on them, is not in conflict with climate protection,"" he said in Polish.Poland is not on its own. The United States, with President Donald Trump's promises to make coal king again in his country, is hosting a side meeting on how fossil fuels can be used cleanly. Russia, which has yet to ratify the Paris accord on climate change, remains a huge exporter and supporter of coal. China, which is trying to close coal plants at home, nevertheless is funding them elsewhere.Since the Paris climate-change agreement was signed in 2015, more than 92,000 megawatts of new coal power has been added to the world's energy supply and more than six times that amount is planned in new or expanded coal plants. Perhaps the single biggest move to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in Canada, the closure of coal plants in Ontario between 2000 and 2014, took about 8,800 megawatts of coal power off the grid.Canada still gets about 10 per cent of its electricity from coal.Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna shrugged off naysayers as she spoke of plans to push the Powering Past Coal Alliance at this year's climate talks. The alliance says all developed nations should phase out coal-fired power plants by 2030, and the rest of the world should do it by 2050. The group includes 28 nations thus far but faces stronger opposition from coal-dominant economies each passing day.""Some of the countries have taken different tacks, but we know that there's a huge opportunity to reduce emissions and if we're going to meet our Paris targets we all have to phase out coal,"" said McKenna in a recent interview with The Canadian Press.She said ""we are going to be working very hard at COP"" to promote the alliance. Canada plans to phase coal out by 2030, although there will likely be allowances for plants that have mechanisms to capture and store their carbon-dioxide emissions. The United Kingdom, where coal has plunged as a source of electricity thanks to government policies including a carbon tax, is to close its last coal plant in 2025.\l"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada36","China accelerates electric vehicle strategy with investments in B.C. clean energy firms","August 30, 2018 Thursday","National Post's Financial Post & FP Investing (Canada)","Randy MacEwen has made 39 separate trips to China in less than four years - an indication of how much opportunity the British Columbia-based executive sees in that country.On Wednesday, MacEwen, who is chief executive of Burnaby-based hydrogen fuel cell maker Ballard Power Systems Inc. announced a $208 million deal that links the company's future to China's fastgrowing clean vehicle market.Under the deal, Weichai Power Co., one of China's largest diesel engine manufacturers, agreed to purchase $163 million worth of Ballard's stock at a 15 per cent premium; and to invest an additional $45 million to form a joint venture that will manufacture Ballard's fuel cells at a plant in China, where they could end up in buses, commercial trucks and forklifts.Separately, on Wednesday, Vancouver-based Westport Fuel Systems also announced a deal with Weichai, which agreed to purchase its components and license its technology to build 18,000 natural gas engines by 2023. Taken together, the deals show how China is investing in a future that envisions a shift from internal combustion energy vehicles to loweremission, clean energy vehicles. The vast scale of those investments is enticing Canadian companies to strike partnerships and form joint ventures that send their technology across the Pacific Ocean.""We're in the very early moments of a major global transformation of the transportation industry,"" MacEwen told shareholders on a conference call on Wednesday. ""This transformation involves the move towards zero-emission vehicles.""Many Canadian mining companies, particularly those developing lithium and cobalt deposits, have been working with investors in China, Japan and South Korea, looking to source the metals for use in batteries for electric vehicles.By contrast, Ballard is designing and building fuel cells that can convert hydrogen to electricity, also for use in transportation. Such technology is better-suited for hauling heavy loads over a long range, an area where lithium-ion powered electric vehicles struggle, according to MacEwen.In an interview with the Financial Post, he said China's vast scale makes its market very appealing. MacEwen estimated China puts 400,000 new buses on its road every year, compared to around 5,000 in North America.That Weichai, which is primarily a diesel engine company, is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology, signals China's commitment to improving air quality and fighting climate change, according to MacEwen.""Two years ago, we wouldn't have been able to engage a company like this,"" he said.Weichai has framed its deal with Westport as a way to improve air quality in China. Its chairman Tan Xuguang said Westport's technology can cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 20 per cent, according to Westport's press release.MacEwen said the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, in which countries from around the world agreed to limit carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, has also opened up new business opportunities. Now, major cities around the globe have signalled their intention to phase out internal combustion engines in their public transportation fleets.That's compelling diesel companies like Weichai to begin investing in alternatives, he said, such as his company's hydrogen fuel cell technology.Weichai's investment in Ballard at $3.54, a 15 per cent premium to the company 30-day volume weighted trading price, gives it a 19.9 per cent position and the largest stake in the company.In addition, one of Ballard's previous shareholders, Zhongsan Broad-Ocean Motor Co. Ltd, agreed to invest an additional $20 million, also at $3.54 per share, to maintain its 9.9 per cent stake. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2018.Weichai, which is 19 per cent owned by Shandong province, and also listed on the Hong Kong and Shenzen stock exchanges, also separately announced on Wednesday it has agreed to supply 2,000 fuel cells for commercial vehicles in China by 2021. Ballard said it is hoping to supply some part or all of that order.""China will be the largest hydrogen fuel cell market starting this year going forward,"" said MacEwen.Ballard Power was up 19.6 per cent to $4.52 per share and Westport rose 18.8 per cent to $4.44 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The group includes 28 nations thus far but faces stronger opposition from coal-dominant economies each passing day.""Some of the countries have taken different tacks, but we know that there's a huge opportunity to reduce emissions and if we're going to meet our Paris targets we all have to phase out coal,"" said McKenna in a recent interview with The Canadian Press.She said ""we are going to be working very hard at COP"" to promote the alliance. Canada plans to phase coal out by 2030, although there will likely be allowances for plants that have mechanisms to capture and store their carbon-dioxide emissions. The United Kingdom, where coal has plunged as a source of electricity thanks to government policies including a carbon tax, is to close its last coal plant in 2025.\l"

But the ambassador's dinner had an additional purpose, which was to raise funds for the sustainable seafood program of the not-for-profit organization Ocean Wise.

As far back as 1988, world powers knew about the impending destruction of the Earth's environment by the massive amounts of carbon dioxide we were pumping into the atmosphere; 30 years ago, the unchecked burning of fossil fuels for heat, electricity and transportation was known to be a treacherous and looming global problem.In 1988, vowing to fight global warming with all the resources at his disposal, the late President George H.W. Bush said: ""We will fight the greenhouse gas effect with the White House effect."" He didn't, of course - that was just hot air. But Bush and other world leaders knew that the planet was heating up, and even then a carbon-based tax was talked about.As far back as 1977, McKibben's grandfather worked for Exxon and made an ironclad case to that oil giant's top executives about the impending catastrophe of extreme climate change. They believed him and the science it was based on - they acted immediately by hiring their own scientists to provide false reports and erroneous studies in order to undermine the whole of idea of climate change. The longer they could mislead world opinion, the longer they could profit from the sale of fossil fuels. And they hired the best befuddlers oil money could buy ... tobacco industry health deniers!They did such a good job of muddying the rising waters of global warming that even today 12 per cent of North Americans believe that the Earth's intense and unpredictable weather patterns are cyclical. An additional 12 per cent say that they just don't know the cause.OK, so let's say you're in that 24 per cent group, unconvinced that the world needs to take drastic measures to reduce the temperature of our planet, which every legitimate scientist in the world claims has a fever that will likely prove fatal. Instead, look at some first-hand, eyewitness testimonials.Look at Paradise, California, so that ... wait! You can't! That place is gone, burned to the ground by a wildfire so fast and so powerful, it was referred to as a ""fire tornado."" Once a rustic, treed city of 27,000 people, Paradise is now a heap of ashes described as ""apocalyptic."" That raging wall of wild flames destroyed 18,793 homes and buildings, killed 85 civilians, and left hundreds of residents still missing or homeless. Alberta's Fort McMurray fire forced 88,000 people from their homes. These are irrefutable statistics supported by gruesome video evidence.Not counting the devastation and flooding caused by Irma, Maria and Nate, Hurricane Harvey alone dumped 50 inches of rain on Texas and Louisiana in six days; that's more than four feet of water falling from the sky, totalling 27 trillion gallons. That's one million gallons of rainwater for every person who lives in the state of Texas! Make that 28.3 million people who wished they'd gone to bed on Aug. 17, 2017 wearing life jackets. Not a myth, but a flood of biblical proportions.Almost every recent summer is hotter than the one before it. Weather stations near the Arctic are recording 90 F temperatures. Europe is creeping up to an unheard of 49 C record. In Quebec, 70 people died in last summer's heat wave - 65 in Japan.Within a matter of months, France was hit by torrential rains, violent thunderstorms, heat waves and drought. In Holland, there's not enough rainwater to counter balance the sea water on the other side of the dikes. In Sweden - almost overnight - its highest peak, Mount Kebnekaise, became its second-highest peak after a glacier meltdown. In Greenland, an iceberg so huge is about to break up that it could create a tsunami.Snowstorms are routinely closing airports, and wildfires are more frequent. Hurricanes are more powerful and destructive, and oceans are drowning low-lying islands. All of this is happening far faster than the scientists predicted even a few years ago.I'm guessing that 24 per cent of the non-believers also cannot see the humanity and benefits of welcoming immigrants. The best U.N. scientific estimate has between 25 million and 1 billion migrants fleeing their uninhabitable homelands by 2050. They will seek higher and colder climates; how old will your kids be when the boats start running our shores?At this point, saving planet Earth would take a massive war effort of national cutbacks and personal sacrifice, but the will to fight off our inevitable demise is simply not there.

Already 85 per cent of the city's auto jobs are gone, but the loss of the last 15 per cent feels especially difficult.How did we get here, and where do we go from here?

We will argue about the best method, but we can no longer argue about the need. This is not a 'downtown elites' vs. 'the working folk' argument. It's complicated, but it's not rocket science.In November, a group of 415 global investors representing $32 trillion in assets (some of it Canadian, including rural and elderly pensioners) called on governments around the world to do more to address climate change, including implementing actions called for in the Paris Climate Agreement.Second, social change needs leadership and pricing signals that work.

Those findings have profound implications for the debate in Canada.Social psychologists Leaf Van Boven and David Sherman conducted two surveys of more than 2,000 respondents across the United States on the issue of climate change. Their research, published in early July in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science and promoted in a New York Times op-ed last weekend, found that Republicans believed climate change is happening, threatens humans and is caused by human activity - and that reducing carbon emissions would help alleviate the problem. The findings suggested Republicans were in basic agreement with Democrats on the issue - but not on the policy solutions, which were viewed as being specific to the Democratic Party. ""This tribalism leads to political fights over differences between the parties that either do not exist or are vastly exaggerated,"" Van Boven and Sherman concluded. ""This implies that if the tables were turned - if Republican politicians proposed a climate policy - Republican voters might support it. In our research, this is exactly what we have found.""The authors say they were not totally surprised. A fundamental lesson of social psychology is that people are profoundly affected by what other people think.But it does suggest political polarization on climate change is less than might have been supposed - and that political parties in the U.S. and Canada are exaggerating the problem for their own gain, a classic case of the narcissism of small differences at work.According to a study last year by Abacus Data, only 2 per cent of Canadians dispute the climate is changing, and 68 per cent of people attribute that change to human and industrial causes. More than 85 per cent agree that the consequences of taking no action will be severe, very severe or catastrophic.Half of Canadians won't contemplate voting for a party that doesn't have a climate change plan and only 6 per cent prefer a party or candidate that ignores the issue. A sizeable number - 44 per cent - are concerned but would consider a party that didn't ""emphasize"" the issue. Even they are looking for a plan to make inroads on CO2 emissions.Climate-change activists dressed like polar bears demonstrate near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Dec.12, 2015, during a .The Abacus poll arrives at a similar conclusion as did Van Boven and Sherman - 85 per cent of Conservatives feel there is a moral responsibility to act; 67 per cent see a looming financial disaster if more is not done.All of this suggests the Conservative Party is in urgent need of a climate plan.Andrew Scheer and his front-bench team have made it clear they would love to fight an election on the question of Justin Trudeau's carbon tax. The Liberal plan is on the ropes, as provincial governments in Saskatchewan, Ontario and even New Brunswick howl about the cost. Judging by the polls, they'll be joined by a Jason Kenney-led Alberta before the next federal election.Will the federal government really impose the threatened backstop against the wishes of half the provincial governments in the country? (The federal government has said it will introduce a $10-per-tonne levy this year, rising to $50 per tonne by 2022 - roughly $0.11 per litre of gas - for those provinces that don't have their own system.)Trudeau's trump card is that he could levy the tax and then return the proceeds directly to households in the province where they were raised.But the perils facing the carbon tax do not absolve the Conservatives from coming up with a solution of their own.They may want to hammer the carbon tax, in the belief that when the debate is over taxes they win nine times out of 10.Scheer has committed to meeting Canada's Paris climate targets, however - emissions 30-per-cent below 2005 levels by 2030 - without a carbon tax. The Abacus poll and Van Boven and Sherman's findings suggest his own supporters are going to demand a policy response. Since a carbon tax and cap-and-trade are off the table, the plan is likely to centre on regulations that are likely to prove less noticeable to voters but more expensive for the economy than a revenue-neutral, market-based carbon price.Perhaps the smart thing for the Liberals to do is wait until the Conservatives show their hand, then steal the policy, as they have done with innumerable NDP ideas.John Ivison: Auditor's F35 lightning to strike twice - and this time the Liberals may get burned( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-auditors-f35-lightning-to-strike-twice-and-this-time-the-liberals-may-get-burnedhttps://nationalpost.com/news/politics/john-ivison-auditors-f35-lightning-to-strike-twice-and-this-time-the-liberals-may-get-burned )John Ivison: Canada, Mexico must hang together or Trump will ensure they hang separately( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-canada-mexico-must-hang-together-or-trump-will-ensure-they-hang-separately?video_autoplay=truehttps://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-canada-mexico-must-hang-together-or-trump-will-ensure-they-hang-separately?video_autoplay=true )They could claim, with some justification, that provincial opposition has made the carbon tax untenable and then adopt regulations equivalent to Scheer's suggestions.The rationale, based on Van Boven and Sherman's research, is that political disagreement was substantially reduced when it came to Republican-backed climate policies.In Canada as in the U.S., a climate change plan proposed by the right-of-centre party holds more promise for bipartisan agreement..

The crisis has gone from ""sometime in the future"" to action required immediately to avoid catastrophe, with several major reports saying that the world has only about 10 years to make dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to avoid a catastrophe.An August article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) examined global tipping points that, once started, could fall like a row of dominoes affecting ""the Earth System for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially lead to conditions that resemble planetary states that were last seen several millions of years ago, conditions that would be inhospitable to current human societies and to many other contemporary species."" It showed that the world had only ""one to two decades"" to act aggressively before we lose total control over climate change.This was followed by the October report of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that showed that the world has only about 12 years to reduce its GHGs by 45 per cent and to zero by 2050 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Above 1.5 degrees the effects of climate change will be disastrous for the world. Bringing the problem closer to home, the prestigious Lancet health journal states in its November 2018 report that Canada experienced 7,142 deaths from exposure to human-produced air pollution from fossil fuels in 2015, resulting in a loss in economic welfare for Canadians valued at approximately $53.5 billion. This is almost three times Canada's predicted federal deficit of $19.4 billion in 2019.An August study shows that Canadians and Saudi Arabians are the worst per-capita polluters in the G20, and among the worst in the world. It also shows that Canada is not on track to meet its international agreement on GHG reductions. Finally, and this is the good news, a September report commissioned by seven countries, including Norway, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom, shows that acting aggressively to reduce greenhouse gases within the next three years will generate a $26 trillion economic global windfall, create 65 million new jobs and avoid 700,000 early deaths linked to air pollution.All these reports show that aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gases must start immediately, but the benefits from quick action enormously outweigh any temporary economic costs.

""What she needs to learn is to not be intimidated by big journalists,"" Legault said on Dec. 21.But on Jan. 8, Legault said he had started having doubts over the previous few weeks and he believed it would be difficult for her when the legislature resumes sitting in February and that it would be better to make the change now.""I met her yesterday and during that discussion we mutually agreed that it was better, for her and for the government, that she give up her responsibilities to someone else,"" Legault said.Legault said there were no internal problems that led to the shuffle and the switch was entirely because of issues concerning Chass\'e9's ability to communicate with people outside government.The shuffle leaves Legault's cabinet with 14 men and 12 women. Legault said gender parity remains ""an important goal, however, you can't be rigid, there could be an occasion where there are 14 women and 12 men,"" he said. He added that chose the MNA he thought was best-suited for the job.""I think, honestly, when we look at the ministers I named, it's been a success,"" Legault said.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada50","Conrad Black: Thirty years of climate hysterics being proven wrong over and over again","June 29, 2018 Friday","Postmedia Breaking News","It is 30 years this past week that Dr. James Hansen, then well into the first of more than three decades as head of the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)-Goddard Institute for Space Studies, testified to a U.S. Senate committee that the then-current heat wave in Washington was caused by the relationship between ""the greenhouse effect and observed warming."" This was the starting gun of a mighty debate about the existence, cause and consequences of global warming. Hansen was embraced by the environmental movement, from authentic scientists like David Suzuki to well-meaning faddists like the Prince of Wales, to cynical interlopers from the defeated international left grasping at anything to debunk and confound capitalism, like Naomi Klein, to complete charlatans like former U.S. vice-president Al Gore.Dr. James Hansen sits for a portrait in his home in New York on April 12, 2018.In his testimony, Hansen described three possible courses for the world's climate, depending on public policy. Business as usual was the first case, which would accelerate carbon dioxide emissions, at the same rate of annual increase it had reached in the late 1980s, which, he said, would produce a one Celsius degree increase in the world's temperature within 30 years. The second case, which Hansen believed the most likely, was that emissions would increase at the same rate they had achieved in 1988, but not greater, which would produce a world temperature increase of seven-tenths of one Celsius degree by now. And the last case, which he preferred but for which he was not hopeful, was that carbon emissions would be reduced somewhat after 2000, which would cause a slight increase in temperature until 2000, and a stable temperature afterwards. It is the third result that has occurred: unchanged world temperatures since 2000, apart from 2015-2016; then the temperature rose slightly after a heavy El Nino, and then receded again although world carbon emissions have increased moderately.Parallel predictions were made by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which forecast temperature increases twice as great as occurred in the period up to 2000, with accelerating increases in the years since, when the temperature has been flat (with the exception of the one year mentioned). Hansen also predicted exceptional warming in the Southeast and Midwest of the United States, which has not occurred either. As his predictions were battered and defied by the facts, Hansen reinforced his expressions of ecological gloom and in 2007 predicted that all Greenland's ice would melt and that ocean levels would rise by seven metres within 100 years. We have only had 11 years, but no ice has been lost by Greenland, other than what melts every summer and then forms again, and water levels have not moved appreciably. Undaunted, Professor Hansen pressed on like the Ancient Mariner, or Captain Bligh. Hurricanes and tornadoes, at least in the United States, would become stronger, a prediction repeated by the American left's favourite weatherman, Sen. Bernie Sanders. None of it has occurred, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, despite the strength of last year's hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico.Climate-change activists dressed like polar bears demonstrate near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Dec.12, 2015, during a .In any event, Hansen's predictions have all bombed and he has not recanted. His polyglot and multi-motivated echo chamber, including Dr. Michael Mann and his infamous ""hockey stick"" of sharply rising temperatures, have had their noses rubbed in the fiction of increasing world temperatures throughout this new millennium. Every sane person is opposed to the pollution of the environment and there is a practically universal consensus to reduce automobile exhaust emissions, ensure industrial smoke goes through scrubbers, and that all contaminated water is thoroughly treated before being returned to nature. Every serious person agrees that we must, as a species, show extreme vigilance in exercising man's unique ability to tamper with and alter the environment. We are the stewards of the world and its environment and there are few who would dispute that until comparatively recently, we have not taken that responsibility very seriously. The Industrial Revolution had been thundering in Europe and North America for nearly a century, and in Japan for half a century, before even basic conservation, such as national parks, got its green foot in the public policy door.The Eiffel Tower is illuminated in green on Nov. 4, 2016, the date the Paris climate accord went into effect.But there is no justification whatever for the self-punitive nonsense of the Paris climate accord, where the administration of president Barack Obama committed to garrote American industry with costs of tens of billions of dollars to reduce carbon emissions, even as the world's principal offenders, China and India, and most other countries, solemnly decl"

This month's meeting, known as the Conference of the Parties (or ""COP24""), comes two months after climate-change scientists warned the world that without significantly deeper emissions cuts, the planet is on course for irreversible and devastating climate changes.Canada, that report said in October, needs to cut emissions almost in half to do its part. Canada's current target is to cut them by about 27 per cent.McKenna has been reluctant to look at setting tougher goals when the country's climate change plan is still not strong enough to meet the weaker ones.But, she acknowledged in an interview, ""in 2020 everyone has to come back and be more ambitious,"" and she said Canada will.McKenna said before then, the standards to be set in Poland are needed to help the world take stock of its progress and and ensure that everyone is measuring and reporting by universally understood rules. That will give confidence that when a country says its targets are being met, they actually are.Writing the rule book at the meeting this month is made all the more difficult after the election of several governments that are less enthusiastic about the Paris agreement.The U.S. under President Trump is preparing to withdraw at the earliest opportunity - which is in 2020 - and the newly elected government in Brazil campaigned on a promise to do the same thing. The Brazilian government also just cancelled its plans to host the annual COP meeting in 2019.McKenna said in the current global political environment, the Paris accord might never have been reached.""I think it would be much harder,"" she said.The Paris agreement, which every country in the world has signed, aims to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being spewed into the atmosphere enough to keep the increase in average global temperature to no more than 2 C, compared to pre-industrial times, and as close to 1.5 C as possible.The world's average temperature has already warmed up at least 1 C compared to the 19th century, and it is continuing to warm by about 0.2 C each decade. At the current rate of emissions, the planet will be 1.5 C warmer by 2052, scientists predict. After that, the impact on human health and ecosystems becomes far more problematic.\l"

In December, experts and officials from around the world will gather in Katowice, Poland, for a new round of international climate negotiations.- What about the Paris Agreement?Every country agreed, nearly three years ago, to set its own targets to bring down its greenhouse gas emissions. That's the good news.The deal specifically aspired to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels. And, it was worded in such a way that countries would, over time, have to get more ambitious in their emissions reductions.That's not going well. And it's not just because the Trump administration announced its intention to pull out of that deal. The United States, history's largest polluter, is nowhere close to meeting its emissions reductions targets.Russia, one of the world's largest emitters, has not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions have grown recently, mainly because large swathes of forest were converted to farmland, and the leading contender in Brazil's presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, has suggested pulling his country out of Paris deal, too. Australia also appears unlikely to meet its targets under its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, a champion of the country's coal mining industry.Water escapes from pipework as a giant excavator operates at the open pit lignite mine, operated by RWE AG, in Hambach, Germany, on Friday, Oct. 5, 2018.With rich countries falling short, some developing countries are starting to balk.

Your vehicle is an 18-year-old beater, and gets, on a good day, 15 miles to the gallon (unleaded). Your plan calls for taxing - er borrowing a few bucks from your credulous neighbours and buying the gas for the trip from that subscription. You get 12 bucks, enough for two gallons, and that might, with a wind at your back, get you to Whitbourne, 50 miles from St. John's, a fine place - great pea soup, with dumplings at Monty's restaurant and worth the drive. But it's roughly 500 miles short of Port aux Basques.And that's it. That's your plan. You offer it as a blueprint for other trans-island travellers.Well, it is, technically, a plan. But you're never going to see Port aux Basque under this plan. Your plan is gallons short of a full tank. You've promised a marathon and delivered a sprint.The Trudeau-McKenna church of latter-day environmentalists have a plan for reducing Canada's ""carbon emissions,"" as they call them, to meet their promises from the Paris Agreement. It's an energy tax. (They call it a ""price on pollution,"" which is an absolute and devious deception.) They are not putting a price on pollution; they are putting a tax on all energy fuels. CO2 is not a pollutant - ask a plant. Ask a tree. Ask a human being during exhale. Sewage is a pollutant. It causes diseases. CO2 is a nature-produced life-giving and life-enhancing part of our planet's atmosphere.However, the Trudeau-McKenna ""plan"" is never going to get to Port aux Basques. It starts at 10 bucks a tonne, and rises to 50. (If they even get to that; half the provinces are in revolt.) According to the very latest report from the IPCC (the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) of the leading environmental shamans), for Canada to reach its promised commitments it will require a starting tax of 135 bucks a tonne and as time passes and apocalypse beckons may claim as much as 5,500 dollars a tonne. And that's in real money - U.S. dollars. We will never, ever see those rates. Even the greenest planet-saving Gaia-drunk cabinet in Canadian history will not approach the numbers really necessary to live up to their rhetoric. That way lies electoral oblivion, a fate worse than a burning planet.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signs the Paris Agreement on climate change during a ceremony at the United Nations headquarters in New York on April 22, 2016.In the terms of my delightful Trans-Canada Newfoundland analogy, the Trudeau-McKenna recipe will only get us to Whitbourne, and maybe a bowl of pea soup.The T-M plan does not even approach the IPCC commitment necessary to achieve their promised goal of meeting the Paris Agreement targets. It is a plan, yes. But it is a sham of a plan - inadequate, incomplete, shortsighted, and yet pretentious all the while.As to its measurable impact on the growth of all global emissions, this meagre, footling, sham of a plan promises less impact than a burp in a hurricane. Canada's minute calibrations toward reducing CO2 through an energy tax will be wiped out in a week by China's roaring industries. In the fantastical ambition to change the Earth's climate, Canada is not even a player. It is at best a ball boy on the court, delivering towels to the real players and scampering after fouls.As Mr. Trudeau said obligingly in Montreal recently, ""Even if Canada stopped everything tomorrow, and the other countries didn't have any solutions, it wouldn't make a big difference.""( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-truth-about-pms-carbon-taxhttps://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-the-truth-about-pms-carbon-tax ) Change ""big"" to ""any"" and he's hit the truth. Canada could shut down all industry, all traffic, and we could all hold our breath for long periods at a time - and, according to the settled science of global warming, all would still be lost, and all we'd get for it is poverty and blue in the face.So what is the point of a plan that cannot meet its own, inadequate stated targets, and that on a global scale in the matter of absolute reduction of carbon-dioxide emission is nugatory, otiose and trivial? It's just a do-gooder's flare - it's Canada sending up its eco-Bat Signal, that we're on the case. In that phrase that more than any other overheats the cockles of every virtue-signalling politician's heart, ""we're doing something."" Something is a wonderful word, vague even to nullity; as the predicate of a plan of action it has all the obscurantist utility of a fog bank. It tells you nothing while deviously seeming to offer all.Climate-change activisits dressed as polar bears demonstrate near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Dec.12, 2015, during a .So the T-M plan is inadequate, useless on the global plain, and by the IPCC's trenchant standards insufficient even for Canada, let alone the world.

Earlier this week, she struggled to explain what she will do to the province's Green Fund following a report saying the money was being badly managed.""In general, I am satisfied with all the ministers,"" Legault said. ""It's normal for some of them to be still working at mastering their files.""I'm confident she has the potential. Mme. Chass\'e9 is an engineer, was successful in business and understands environmental issues. What she needs to learn is to not be intimidated by big journalists.""Legault said he knew he was taking a risk, however, when he recalled the National Assembly for a brief two-week pre-Christmas sitting because most of the cabinet ministers were untested and could have used more time away from the spotlight to learn the ropes.Chass\'e9's difficulties have not gone unnoticed by the opposition.Interim Liberal leader Pierre Arcand said this week that while he recognizes ministers such as Chass\'e9 need time to learn, she has been handed a complex subject to manage and will have to do better.""I think Mme. Chass\'e9 will have to make a quick recovery in 2019,"" Arcand said.But Legault will have other problems to deal with in the new year, including skepticism over his Coalition Avenir Qu\'e9bec government's plans to replace the nine anglophone school boards with nine anglophone service centres.His education minister, Jean-Fran\'e7ois Roberge, has given mixed signals on how the new structure will work. At the same time, both the francophone and anglophone boards have said they are opposed to the CAQ plan.He was also asked about the challenges he faces in managing voter expectations. On Thursday, the Angus Reid Institute revealed Legault's approval rating among Quebecers is about 60 per cent.""I'm not taking anything for granted,"" Legault said. ""I know the confidence of the people is a fragile thing. They (voters) want to see some change. We made promises and we'll respect those challenges.He then cracked a joke about the Montreal Gazette.""My challenge is to manage people at the Gazette because I see that the articles (on the CAQ government) are not very positive,"" Legault said.He had no specific examples to offer.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada58","Can humanity really win the global warming fight?","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Cornwall Standard Freeholder","""Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made,"" wrote Immanuel Kant in 1784. It is still true.On Sunday, the 24th Conference of the Parties - the 180 countries that signed the 2015 Paris climate change treaty - opened in Katowice, Poland. Warsaw presumably chose the venue, home to Europe's biggest coal company, in a thinly disguised show of defiance.It's not just Donald Trump who loves coal. It's the worst of the fossil fuels in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, but Poland gets 75 per cent of its electricity by burning coal and has no intention of changing. In fact, shortly before COP24 opened, Poland announced plans to invest in a large new coal-mine in Silesia.That same day, 1,500 km west in Paris, municipal workers were cleaning up after the third and most violent weekend of protests - the biggest in decades - against French President Emmanuel Macron. And what were the demonstrators (dubbed ""gilets jaunes"" after the fluorescent yellow vests French drivers must keep in their vehicles) protesting? In Paris and other cities, they built barricades, torched cars, banks and homes because Macron's government has raised the tax on diesel fuel by 6.5 cents a litre.This was on top of a 7.9 cents-a-litre jump earlier this year. Most French vehicles run on diesel, but the reaction does look a bit excessive. That Macron justified it as a ""green"" tax meant to cut fuel use only seemed to make protesters angrier. And, at least until Saturday's extreme violence, most French people supported them.Poles clinging to coal despite the coal smoke that envelops Polish cities in winter and kills thousands a year, and ordinary people in France rioting for the right to go on burning cheap diesel in their cars despite a comparable death toll from atmospheric pollution there, suggest the quest to cut greenhouse gas emissions before global warming goes runaway faces even greater resistance than experts feared.Bear in mind that Poland and France are relatively well-educated countries that belong to the European Union, the world leader in commitment to emission cuts. Neither country has the kind of climate-change denial industry, lavishly funded by fossil-fuel producers, that muddies the waters and spreads doubt about the scientific evidence in the U.S. Neither the Poles nor the French are in denial. And yet ... Now, it's true Poles have a large collective chip on their shoulder for historical reasons - their country was erased from the map for more than a century - so they often respond badly to being lectured by well-meaning foreigners. It's also true that President Macron is arrogant and has a tin ear for public opinion. But neither nationalist resentment nor clumsy political leadership are in short supply worldwide.Bear in mind also that the emission cuts promised in the 2015 accord won't kick in until 2020: we have a mountain to climb and we are not even in the foothills yet. Much bigger sacrifices than a few cents extra on diesel prices or an end to burning coal will be required before this process ends, if it ever does.The question is: can we really expect the relatively large (but still inadequate) greenhouse gas emission cuts promised in Paris in 2015 to ever win the public support necessary to make them happen? If not, our current global civilisation is doomed.If you were designing a species capable of making this hard transition, you'd certainly prefer to start with one that was wiser, more co-operative and less excitable than ourselves. Something a little less crooked, at least. But this is the timber we have to work with. Good luck.

La cit\'e9 d'environ 300 000 habitants s'est d\'e9velopp\'e9e gr\'e2ce \'e0 des ateliers et \'e0 des usines aliment\'e9es par les abondantes r\'e9serves de charbon cach\'e9es dans le sol.Au centre international des congr\'e8s de Katowice, o\'f9 des milliers de leaders et de repr\'e9sentants provenant de presque tous les pays au monde sont r\'e9unis pour au moins deux semaines, on peut voir des panaches de fum\'e9e s'\'e9chapper des hautes chemin\'e9es des centrales \'e9lectriques voisines.Les d\'e9l\'e9gu\'e9s, dont la mission est d'\'e9tablir une s\'e9rie de r\'e8gles pour \'e9valuer les progr\'e8s r\'e9alis\'e9s par les pays dans l£tteinte de leurs objectifs de lutte contre les changements climatiques, ont \'e9t\'e9 accueillis par l'orchestre des mineurs de charbon polonais. La d\'e9coration du centre des congr\'e8s comprend des paniers en fil de fer remplis de charbon. Des bijoux et du savon fabriqu\'e9s avec du charbon sont aussi en vente. Les principaux commanditaires de la COP24 sont tous des compagnies de charbon, dont une soci\'e9t\'e9 d'\'c9tat polonaise qui extrait du charbon et une autre qui produit de l'\'e9lectricit\'e9 \'e0 partir du charbon.Le charbon est la source d'\'e9lectricit\'e9 la plus polluante au monde. Il g\'e9n\'e8re habituellement deux fois plus d'\'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre que le gaz naturel et contribue \'e0 faire grimper la pollution atmosph\'e9rique, un probl\'e8me qui tue environ 800 000 personnes par ann\'e9e. Plus t\'f4t cette ann\'e9e, le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'\'e9volution du climat (GIEC) de l'ONU avait pr\'e9venu qu'il y aurait de graves cons\'e9quences si la plan\'e8te ne r\'e9duisait pas de mani\'e8re importante ses \'e9missions au cours de la prochaine d\'e9cennie et, pour y parvenir, avait sugg\'e9r\'e9 de fermer 60 pour cent des centrales \'e9lectriques au charbon existantes d'ici 2030.Le pr\'e9sident de la Pologne, Andrzej Duda, a profit\'e9 de son discours d'ouverture \'e0 la COP24\£bLe fait d'utiliser ses propres ressources, le charbon dans le cas de la Pologne, et d'\'e9tablir sa s\'e9curit\'e9 \'e9nerg\'e9tique sur elles n'entre pas en conflit avec la protection du climat\'bb, avait-il soutenu.La Pologne n'est pas la seule dans son camp.

La Russie, qui n£ toujours pas ratifi\'e9 l'Accord de Paris, demeure une grande exportatrice de charbon. Le fait que la Chine tente de fermer les centrales au charbon sur son territoire ne l'emp\'eache pas de financer la construction de telles installations ailleurs.Depuis la signature de l'entente sur les changements climatiques dans la capitale fran\'e7aise en 2015, plus de 92 000 m\'e9gawatts g\'e9n\'e9r\'e9s par des centrales au charbon se sont ajout\'e9s aux r\'e9serves mondiales d'\'e9nergie et un nombre au moins six fois plus important de m\'e9gawatts produits avec du charbon devrait s£jouter prochainement gr\'e2ce \'e0 l£grandissement de centrales existantes ou \'e0 la construction de nouvelles installations.Au Canada, la fermeture de centrales au charbon en Ontario entre 2000 et 2014 a permis de retirer quelque 8800 m\'e9gawatts d'\'e9lectricit\'e9 du r\'e9seau. Il s£git vraisemblablement de l'effort le plus important pour r\'e9duire les \'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre au pays, et ce, m\'eame si 10 pour cent de l'\'e9lectricit\'e9 en sol canadien est toujours produite \'e0 partir du charbon.La ministre canadienne de l'Environnement, Catherine McKenna, a balay\'e9 du revers de la main les critiques en r\'e9v\'e9lant son intention de faire la promotion de l£lliance \'c9nergiser au-del\'e0 du charbon \'e0 la . Selon l£lliance, tous les pays d\'e9velopp\'e9s devraient se d\'e9barrasser progressivement de ses centrales au charbon d'ici 2030 et le reste du monde devrait leur embo\'eeter le pas d'ici 2050. Le groupe compte pour le moment 28 membres, mais est confront\'e9 \'e0 une grande r\'e9sistante de la part des \'e9conomies domin\'e9es par le charbon.\£bCertains pays ont emprunt\'e9 diff\'e9rents chemins, mais nous savons que nous avons une belle occasion de r\'e9duire les \'e9missions et, si nous voulons atteindre les objectifs que nous nous sommes fix\'e9s \'e0 Paris, nous devons tous abandonner progressivement le charbon\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Mme McKenna en entrevue avec La Presse canadienne.

""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" said Poland's environmental envoy, Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the U.N. meeting, known as COP24.""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" Kurtyka said. ""There is no Plan B.""Ministers and some heads of government plan to join the discussion Monday, when host Poland is expected to push for a declaration ensuring a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The meeting received a boost over the weekend when 19 major economies at the G-20 summit affirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the U.S. which announced under Donald Trump that it is withdrawing from the climate pact.""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the U.N. climate office.""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science when it comes to climate change,"" Figures said.She cited a recent expert report warning of the consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees C.""The rest of the G20 have not only understood the science, they are taking actions to both prevent the major impacts and strengthen their economies,"" said Figueres, who now works with Mission 2020, a group that campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The meeting in Katowice is regarded as a key test of countries' willingness to back their lofty but distant goals with concrete measures, some of which are already drawing fierce protests. At the top of the agenda is the so-called Paris rule book, which will determine how governments record and report their greenhouse emissions and efforts to cut them.Separately, negotiators will discuss ramping up countries' national emissions targets after 2020, and financial support for poor nations that are struggling to adapt to climate change.The shift away from fossil fuels, which scientists say has to happen by 2050, is expected to require a major overhaul of world economies.""The good news is that we do know a lot of what we need to be able to do to get there,"" said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute.Waskow, who has followed climate talks for years, said despite the Trump administration's refusal to back this global effort the momentum is going in the right direction.""It's not one or two players anymore in the international arena,"" he said. ""It's what I think you could call a distributed leadership, where you have a number of countries - some of them small or medium-sized - really making headway and doing it in tandem with cities and states and businesses.""Not far from the meetings venue, environmental activists held a small protest Sunday to call for an end to coal mining in Poland, which gets some 80 per cent of its energy from coal. Katowice is in the heart of Poland's coal mining region of Silesia, and there are several active mines in and around the city.Marches aimed at showing support for ending the use of coal-fired power plants drew thousands over the weekend in Brussels, Berlin and Cologne.\l"

From COP24 to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report declaring we have 12 years to act to limit a climate-change catastrophe, consumers'conscience has been awakened to climate change, and the need for immediate solutions.As with all global climate issues, there is no panacea. However, there's one place Canadians can make a difference: on their plates. Climate change is a threat not only to animals and our habitat (which is widely discussed), but also to our food supply. We need action by food suppliers, providers, and consumers, if we're to better protect the food supply chains for generations to come.Diets in Canada are surprisingly limited. A report released by Crop Trust, shows that we use only one per cent of available crops to fuel our diets, and more than 50 per cent of our diet comes from just four crops: corn, rice, wheat and maize. While there are 30,000 edible plant species, we eat only 150 of them.This narrow food chain puts our supply at risk, particularly with the effects of climate change putting some grains in jeopardy (such as rice, which three billion people rely on). A recent study concluded that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, yields of vegetables could fall by 35 per cent by 2100 due to water scarcity and the ozone.

Mass\'e9 said the party intends to use its voice in the legislature and that larger membership base to conduct what she called a ""vast awareness campaign"" about the need to transition to an economy that puts environmental concerns first, particularly climate change.""The struggle against climate change is not some homework we can leave to the last minute,"" Mass\'e9 told the convention.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada66","Global carbon pollution up in 2018","December 6, 2018 Thursday","Sudbury Star","After several years of little growth, global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide experienced their largest jump in seven years, discouraging scientists.World carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have risen 2.7 per cent from 2017 to 2018, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations, announced during negotiations to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into effect, puts some of the landmark agreement's goals nearly out of reach, scientists said.""This is terrible news,"" said Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures but was not part of the research. ""Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become difficult to meet.""The studies concluded that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons last year. The margin of error is about one percentage point on either side. The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union.The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions - up 2.5 per cent - for the first time since 2013. China, the globe's biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 per cent.Study lead author Corinne Le Quere, a climate change researcher at the University of East Anglia in England, said the increase is a surprising ""reality check"" after a few years of smaller emission increases. But she also doesn't think the world will return to the even larger increases seen from 2003 to 2008. She believes unusual factors are at play this year.For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said.John Reilly, co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, said the results aren't too surprising because fossil fuels still account for 81 per cent of the world's energy use. The burning of coal, oil and gas release carbon dioxide, which warms the Earth. Reilly, who wasn't part of the study, praised it as impressive.Global Carbon Project chairman Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist, said he was discouraged.The Paris accord set two goals.The long-held goal would limit global warming to no more than 1 degree Celsius from now, with a more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 0.5 degrees Celsius from now.The trend is such that the world would have to be lucky to keep warming to 1.8 degrees, let alone the lower goal, Le Quere said.China increased its emissions to 11.4 billion tons, while the U.S. jumped to a shade under 6 billion tons. The European Union spewed 3.9 billion tons and India soared to 2.9 billion tons. Overall, the world is spewing about 1,300 tons of carbon dioxide into the air every second.Use of coal - the biggest carbon emitter - is rising. And while countries are using more renewable fuels and trying to reduce carbon from electricity production, emissions from cars and planes are steadily increasing, Le Quere said.Global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 per cent in the last 20 years, the calculations show. At the same time, Earth has warmed on average about 0.38 degrees Celsius, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

In fact, it was one rancher, John Ross, who was the first to become involved with MultiSAR and it has since grown as positive working relationships were developed.""We conducted surveys, talked about the range and about different enhancements, but the landholders always remain in the driver's seat,"" said Downey. ""Our goal is to have long-term relationships with open, honest communication and that has enabled us to work with close to 600,000 acres. When it started, there was one producer.""

Other countries know that Canada is struggling to meet its own targets, that the Liberal government is facing legal and political pressure over its planned carbon tax and that Canada is continuing government support for developing oil and gas reserves.Some officials are snarking that Canada is good for talking points but not action.Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna told The Canadian Press last week Canada will be ready - as the Paris agreement requires - to increase its targets for cutting emissions in 2020.

""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" said Poland's environmental envoy, Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the U.N. meeting, known as COP24.""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" Kurtyka said. ""There is no Plan B.""Ministers and some heads of government plan to join the discussion Monday, when host Poland is expected to push for a declaration ensuring a ""just transition"" for fossil fuel industries that face cuts and closures amid efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The meeting received a boost over the weekend when 19 major economies at the G-20 summit affirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the United States, which announced under President Donald Trump that it is withdrawing from the climate pact.""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the U.N. climate office.""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science when it comes to climate change,"" Figures said.She cited a recent expert report warning of the consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees C.""The rest of the G20 have not only understood the science, they are taking actions to both prevent the major impacts and strengthen their economies,"" said Figueres, who now works with Mission 2020, a group that campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The meeting in Katowice is regarded as a key test of countries' willingness to back their lofty but distant goals with concrete measures, some of which are already drawing fierce protests. At the top of the agenda is the so-called Paris rule book, which will determine how governments record and report their greenhouse emissions and efforts to cut them.Separately, negotiators will discuss ramping up countries' national emissions targets after 2020, and financial support for poor nations that are struggling to adapt to climate change.The shift away from fossil fuels, which scientists say has to happen by 2050, is expected to require a major overhaul of world economies.""The good news is that we do know a lot of what we need to be able to do to get there,"" said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute.Waskow, who has followed climate talks for years, said despite the Trump administration's refusal to back this global effort the momentum is going in the right direction.""It's not one or two players anymore in the international arena,"" he said. ""It's what I think you could call a distributed leadership, where you have a number of countries - some of them small or medium-sized - really making headway and doing it in tandem with cities and states and businesses.""Not far from the meeting venue, environmental activists held a small protest Sunday to call for an end to coal mining in Poland, which gets some 80 per cent of its energy from coal. Katowice is in the heart of Poland's coal mining region of Silesia, and there are several active mines in and around the city.Marches aimed at showing support for ending the use of coal-fired power plants and other efforts to limit climate change drew thousands of people over the weekend in Brussels, Berlin and Cologne. But the governor of Germany's most populous state said Sunday it was premature to set a firm date for phasing out the use of coal-fired power plants. Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said Germany's decision to stop mining and burning lignite coal ""must be considered seriously and decided with broad consensus.""German officials had hoped to present a blueprint for the country's exit from coal at the meeting in Katowice but an expert committee has delayed issuing its recommendations until next year.\l"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada74","UN head pleads for action","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Chatham Daily News","UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a dramatic appeal to world leaders Monday to take the threat of global warming seriously and to act boldly to avert a catastrophic rise in temperatures before the end of the century.Guterres, who spoke at the opening of the UN climate conference in Poland, called climate change ""the most important issue we face.""""Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,"" Guterres told delegates from almost 200 countries who gathered in the city of Katowice.Famed British naturalist Sir David Attenborough echoed his warnings, telling the gathering that the ""collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizons"" if no urgent action is taking against global warming.The 92-year-old TV presenter blamed humans for the ""disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years.""The UN chief chided countries, particularly those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, for failing to do enough to back the 2015 Paris climate accord, which set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 C - ideally 1.5 C - by the end of the century.Citing a recent scientific report on the dire consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees, Guterres urged countries to cut their emissions 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and aim for net zero emissions by 2050.Net zero emissions mean that any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest or new technologies that can remove carbon from the atmosphere.Such cuts, which experts say is the only way to achieve the 1.5-degree goal, would require a radical overhaul of the global economy and a move away from using fossil fuels.""In short, we need a complete transformation of our global energy economy, as well as how we manage land and forest resources,"" Guterres said.He said governments should embrace the opportunities rather than cling to fossil fuels such as coal, which are blamed for a significant share of man-made greenhouse gas emissions.The remark was directed at host Poland, which relies on coal for 80 per cent of its energy. But Poland's President Andrzej Duda said during a later news conference that the coal-rich country will reduce its reliance on coal but will never entirely give up its ""strategic fossil fuel.""Guterres also urged negotiators not to forget that the challenges they face pale in comparison to the difficulties climate change is already causing millions around the world whose homes and livelihoods are threatened by rising sea levels, drought and more powerful storms.The two-week conference in Poland's southern coal mining region of Silesia is expected to work out how governments can report on their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming within the limits of the Paris climate deal.""This is the challenge on which this generation's leaders will be judged,"" Guterres said.He later told reporters that realities of global climate changes are ""worse than expected, but the political will is relatively faded after Paris"" and is not matching the current challenges.Guterres called for a ""huge increase in ambitions"" during the negotiations in Poland, adding ""we cannot afford to fail in Katowice.""Arnold Schwarzenegger, the action film star and former governor of California, said the U.S. is ""still in"" the Paris accord to curb global warming despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to walk away from it. He told delegates on Monday that ""America is more than just Washington or one leader.""Calling Trump ""meshugge"" - Yiddish for ""crazy"" - for deciding to withdraw from the Paris accord, Schwarzenegger insisted that the climate deal has widespread support at local and state levels in the U.S.Duda said participants at the conference have backed his country's proposal of a ""just transition"" away from coal mining, which calls for helping people such as coal miners who are slated to lose their jobs as the world changes its energy mix.Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's UN climate summit, said the ""just transition"" proposal shouldn't just consider the fate of fossil fuel workers but all people around the world whose lives are affected by climate change.Residents of the world's smaller islands, many of whom face catastrophic flooding from higher sea levels in a warming world, have been among the world's most vocal backers of measures to combat climate change. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

It's a scary time to be alive but also an incredibly exciting one, because the opportunities we are being presented in the face of such a major crisis have the ability to change the way we all live for the better.""It's a message that Jewell-Kemker has been sharing around the world, including marking the US Premiere at Michael Moore's film festival in Traverse City, Michigan in August.""It was a huge honour just to screen there among giants in the field, most of whom are included in the 2019 Oscars Shortlist for Best Documentary Feature, but we also sold out our screening,"" added Jewell-Kemker.The documentary has since been screened at 13 different festivals globally - the film has also scooped up six awards - as well as screening the film during COP24, the UN Climate Talks in Poland this past December.Selling out theatres is great, but it's been the ""incredibly emotional"" question and answer sessions after the film that have been the most memorable for the young filmmaker.""In October we were the Gala Opening Night Film at Toronto's Planet in Focus Film Festival, and both David Suzuki and Col. Chris Hadfield attended. Suzuki actually came up to the mic during the Q&A and wept openly in front of the audience, reminding us that climate change is this generation's Pearl Harbour,"" explained Jewell-Kemker. ""People young and old come up to me afterwards all the time crying and saying how they've had their hope for the future restored. It's a bit overwhelming, this feeling of folks looking to you for the answers to deep and meaningful worries in their lives. I want to remind them that it's the next generation of climate activists, lawyers, change-makers and every day citizens around the world who are changing policy and their communities in the face of extreme change and that it's gonna take all of us, together.""After spending close to 10 years shooting - and 30 months editing - the film one might think Jewell-Kemker might want to take a bit of a rest.Not so.She is currently writing a fictional feature film that she will be directing, and hopefully shooting in the Kawarthas. She is also working on the Continuing Impact campaign and Life of the Documentary with both film festival and community screenings, along with holding school filmmaking workshops.""Our website will be a lot more vibrant and active leading up to May 1st when we have something exciting in the works.

As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China's leadership was especially valued, and lauded, even though the Paris agreement was non-binding and committed China to nothing.Then Donald Trump was elected president of the United States and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris agreement. China and its Communist Party leader Xi were happily thrust into a leadership position. It didn't last long. As the nations of the world congregate in Katowice, Poland for the 24th Conference of the Parties climate-change meeting (COP24), China is reeling from Trump's trade sanctions. Xi is focused now on his need to maintain economic growth at home. And the U.S. and EU have largely abandoned a Green Climate Fund that would have redistributed US$100-billion a year from developed countries to developing countries. That was the lucre that made climate change interesting to China and other Third World countries. So China no longer has an economic incentive to participate in what it saw as the Paris climate-change charade.Instead, China's energy policy is focused on the Communist Party's two primary domestic needs: securing the energy to fuel China's economy and reducing the smog that undermines public confidence in the party. Failure to accomplish those two goals would represent an existential threat to the party's control over China.Over the past year, China's demand for energy is up substantially, as high as 15 per cent in the case of natural gas. To meet its need for fuel, Chinese authorities are using their expansionist Belt and Road Initiative and other projects to secure imports from Myanmar and Turkmenistan via pipel"

From COP24 to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report declaring we have 12 years( \~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report ) to act to limit a climate change catastrophe, consumers' conscience has been awakened to climate change, and the need for immediate solutions.As with all global climate issues, there is no one panacea. However, there's one place Canadians can make a difference: on their plates. Climate change is a threat not only to animals and our habitat (which is widely discussed), but also to our food supply. We need action by food suppliers, providers, and consumers, if we're to better protect the food supply chains for generations to come.Diets in Canada are surprisingly limited. A report released by Crop Trust, shows that we use only one per cent of available crops to fuel our diets, and more than 50 per cent of our diets comes from just fourcrops( HYPERLINK https://www.croptrust.org/our-missionhttps://www.croptrust.org/our-mission/ ) (corn, rice, wheat and maize). While there are 30,000 edible plant species, we only eat 150 of them.This narrow food chain puts our supply at risk, particularly with the impacts of climate change putting some grains in jeopardy (such as rice, which three billion( HYPERLINK http://theconversation.com/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious-putting-millions-of-the-worlds-poor-at-risk-97914http://theconversation.com/climate-change-will-make-rice-less-nutritious-putting-millions-of-the-worlds-poor-at-risk-97914 HYPERLINK http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/06/05/1800442115 ) concluded that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, yields of vegetables could fall by 35 per cent by 2100 due to water scarcity and the ozone.

Some also have questioned why coal companies are among the meeting's sponsors.Poland's deputy environment minister, Michal Kurtyka, who is chairing the conference, urged envoys from almost 200 nations to use the time between Sunday and Dec. 14 to make progress on fleshing out the 2015 Paris agreement.""We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change,"" he said. With further meetings next year meant to build on what's decided in Katowice, Kurtyka urged all countries to ""show creativity and flexibility.""""The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver,"" he added. ""There is no Plan B.""The meeting, known as COP24, received a boost over the weekend when 19 major economies at the G-20 summit affirmed their commitment to the Paris accord. The only holdout was the United States, which announced under President Donald Trump that it is withdrawing from the climate pact.""Despite geopolitical instability, the climate consensus is proving highly resilient,"" said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the U.N. climate office.""It is sad that the federal administration of the United States, a country that is increasingly feeling the full force of climate impacts, continues to refuse to listen to the objective voice of science when it comes to climate change,"" Figures said.She cited a recent expert report warning of the consequences of letting average global temperatures rise beyond 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F).""The rest of the G-20 have not only understood the science, they are taking actions to both prevent the major impacts and strengthen their economies,"" said Figueres, who now works with Mission 2020, a group that campaigns to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.While the United States is withdrawing from the climate pact, the State Department said it is sending a delegation to the Katowice conference.The meeting in Katowice is regarded as a key test of countries' willingness to back their lofty but distant goals with concrete measures, some of which are already drawing fierce protests . At the top of the agenda is the so-called Paris rulebook , which will determine how governments record and report their greenhouse emissions and efforts to cut them.Separately, negotiators will discuss ramping up countries' national emissions targets after 2020, and financial support for poor nations that are struggling to adapt to climate change.The shift away from fossil fuels, which scientists say has to happen by 2050, is expected to require a major overhaul of world economies.""The good news is that we do know a lot of what we need to be able to do to get there,"" said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute.Waskow, who has followed climate talks for years, said despite the Trump administration's refusal to back this global effort the momentum is going in the right direction.""It's not one or two players anymore in the international arena,"" he said. ""It's what I think you could call a distributed leadership, where you have a number of countries - some of them small or medium-sized - really making headway and doing it in tandem with cities and states and businesses.""Not far from the meeting venue, Polish anti-coal activists held a small protest Sunday. It was dwarfed by marches in Brussels, Berlin and Cologne over the weekend calling for greater action to curb climate change.German officials had hoped to present a blueprint for the country's exit from coal at the meeting in Katowice, but an expert committee delayed issuing its recommendations until next year.\l"

The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree C since pre-industrial times and it's on course for another 2-3 degrees of warming by the end of the century unless drastic action is taken.The conference will have ""quite significant consequences for humanity and for the way in which we take care of our planet,"" Kurtyka told the Associated Press ahead of the talks.Experts agree that the Paris goals can only be met by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.But the Paris agreement let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. Overall, the world is heading the wrong way.Last week, the World Meteorological Organization said globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a new record in 2017, while the level of other heat-trapping gases such methane and nitrous oxide also rose.This year is expected to see another 2 per cent increase in human-made emissions, as construction of coal-fired power plants in Asia and Africa continue while carbon-absorbing forests are felled faster than they can regrow.""Everyone recognized that the national plans, when you add everything up, will take us way beyond 3, potentially 4 degrees Celsius warming,"" said Johan Rockstrom, the incoming director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.""We know that we're moving in the wrong direction,"" said Rockstrom. ""We need to bend the global carbon emissions no later than 2020 - in two years'time - to stand a chance to stay under 2 degrees Celsius.""Convincing countries to set new, tougher targets for emissions reduction by 2020 is a key challenge in Katowice.Doing so will entail a transformation of all sectors of their economies, including a complete end to burning fossil fuel.Poor nations want rich countries to pledge the biggest cuts, on the grounds that they're responsible for most of the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Rich countries say they're willing to lead the way, but only if poor nations play their part as well.""Obviously not all countries are at the same stage of development,"" said Lidia Wojtal, an associate with Berlin-based consultancy Climatekos and a former Polish climate negotiator. ""So we need to also take that into account and differentiate between the responsibilities.And that's a huge task.""Among those likely to be pressing hardest for ambitious measures will be small island nations, which are already facing serious challenges from climate change.Some observers fear nationalist thinking on climate could scupper all hope of meaningful progress in Katowice. Others are more optimistic.""We will soon see a large enough minority of significant economies moving decisively in the right direction,"" said Rockstrom. ""That can have spillover effects which can be positive.""Poland could end up playing a crucial role in bringing opposing sides together. The country has already presided over three previous rounds of climate talks, and its heavy reliance on carbonintensive coal for energy is forcing Warsaw to mull some tough measures in the years ahead.The 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24 as it's known, is being held on the site of a Katowice mine that was closed in 1999 after 176 years of coal production. Five out of the city's seven collieries have been closed since the 1990s, as Poland phased out communist-era subsidies and moved to a market economy. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Developing nations are resisting measures that would ensure transparency in the way greenhouse gas emissions cuts are measured, reported and verified. They want different rules to apply to rich and poor nations, reflecting their varying capabilities.Debate over a new UN Sustainable Development Mechanism was holding up the promise of expanding the world's network of cap-and-trade markets covering carbon emissions.Nations most vulnerable to climate change want more provisions for compensating them for ""loss and damage"" related to more violent weather expected along with rising temperatures.Issues like that derailed the meeting in Copenhagen in 2009. After that, then-President Barack Obama worked closely with Chinese leaders on a voluntary approach toward cutting emissions, which culminated with the Paris deal. Now that Trump has set a different tone, the old friction points at the talks have become more prominent.""The big difference is that before you had this diplomatic machinery that had been working on the underpinnings for two years, and you had an understanding between the U.S. and China,"" said Alden Meyer, who has been attending the talks for more than two decades for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington-based advocacy group. ""And now, we don't have the U.S. and China working at that same deep level.""In this photo taken Wednesday, Oct. 3, 2018, a bird flies past as smoke emits from the chimneys of Serbia's main coal-fired power station near Kostolac, Serbia.The LDC group and China were joined by the 40-nation Alliance of Small Island States in calling for a ""strengthening global response"" to climate change including a measure that ""scale up finance.""Business leaders attending the talks expressed concern the Katowice Rulebook, which is supposed to emerge from these talks, will be too vague to serve as a guide for how they should cut their own emissions.""We do need the rulebook because that will reduce the risk that we have and increase the number of regions where we can invest in,"" said Carlos Salle, an official following the talks for Iberdrola SA, Spain's largest utility.Poland, which as host of the meeting has a heavy hand in crafting the outcome, held the talks in a region known for its coal mines to emphasize the importance of that fuel to the global economy. Miners attending the talks objected to the overall drift of the UN effort, which would quickly limit the fuel they produce.This Dec. 1, 2018 photo flags hang outside of the venue for the COP24 global climate talks in Katowice, Poland.""What is being forced on us is the idea that unless we get rid of coal yesterday, the planet will cease to exist tomorrow - it's not true,"" Jaroslaw Grzesik, deputy head of the mining arm of Poland's Solidarnosc union, said at the talks on Thursday.For his part, Xie from China said he's ""disappointed in the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris Agreement."" He rejected the notion that the dispute will hold up the talks saying developing countries ""have been very flexible and constructive"" at the meeting.""We will get a rulebook because there are countries who are not ready to leave without it,"" said David Levai, head of climate governance at IDDRI, a French research group advising on sustainability.

Avec une augmentation de 2 degr\'e9s Celsius, des millions de personnes suppl\'e9mentaires seraient forc\'e9es \'e0 se d\'e9placer en raison de l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer, des temp\'e9ratures extr\'eames et des temp\'eates violentes.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada88","Curbing our oil and gas addiction will require more than divestment campaigns and industry bashing","September 19, 2018 Wednesday","Postmedia Breaking News","A decade ago, the world's economy was momentarily gutted.As the calamity called the global financial crisis radiated out of Wall Street, the fiscal damage validated an important relationship between economic activity and energy use.There is a tight bond between wealth and the primary commodities that gives us things like light, heat and mobility; I call it the first principle of energy consumption. It simply says that the more money a person makes, the more energy they use.100 million barrels a day - This time the oil boom really is different( HYPERLINK https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/peter-tertzakian-this-time-the-global-oil-boom-really-is-differenthttps://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/peter-tertzakian-this-time-the-global-oil-boom-really-is-differentDitch the scarcity mindset: We're entering a new era of cheap and limitless energy( HYPERLINK https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ditch-the-scarcity-mindset-were-entering-a-new-era-of-cheap-and-limitless-energyhttps://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/ditch-the-scarcity-mindset-were-entering-a-new-era-of-cheap-and-limitless-energy )The first principle works in reverse, too. The easiest way to arrest and reverse energy consumption is to destroy wealth. And that's what the financial crisis did.I was in Southeast Asia when Lehman Brothers was the domino that tipped sideways into the global banking system. Ironically, at the time I was presenting my views on oil demand. One meeting in Singapore was especially memorable. I was presenting to an investor, one-on-one, in a small board room when a bond trader knocked, opened the door and walked into the room.""May I join you?"" he asked. Not waiting for an answer, he sat down and explained, ""The global credit markets are frozen."" After pausing, he continued,""Nothing is trading, I have nothing to do, may I listen in?""When markets freeze it's not a recession, it's a contraction - the economy shrinks. The fallout doesn't take long, only a matter of weeks. Incomes are slashed, widespread unemployment ensues, wealth erodes. A decade on, that causality still lingers in some countries.During a contraction, the economy doesn't just slow down its growth trajectory-say from three per cent GDP down to two per cent - it goes negative. Wealth creation doesn't just ease up, wallets are emptied.Looking back at the numbers, the financial crisis precipitated the first global economic contraction since World War II. Perusing charts of energy demand in tandem, the relationship between wealth destruction and energy use is clear to see.In 2009, the year after crisis began, the worldwide use of all fossil fuels notched down. There were regional variations, of course. Wealthy OECD countries were most affected, while voracious oil consumers like China were only dented.Importantly, the energy sources with the lowest variable costs of supply - hydro, nuclear and renewables - were mostly unscathed. As in any commercial circumstance, broad-based demand reduction is felt first and hardest in the higher-cost end of the spectrum.Ten years ago, natural gas was the most expensive primary fuel to produce, followed by oil then coal. Since then the cost curves for all primary energy sources has dropped, so taking market share away from anyone of them is even harder now.Why is all this important?The Paris Agreement is trying to push every country to transition away from fossil fuels. Yet the financial crisis, an extreme event, teaches us just how hard it is to make a dent in the status quo.When the world's economy is humming with positive growth, consumers tug hard on all primary energy commodities - the uptrends in Figure 1 stubbornly show this fact.Failing banks offered us one surefire way to arrest the growth of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions: Destroy wealth (see Figure 2). Of course, that's a non-starter solution to curbing consumption under any populist political system.My First Principle of Energy Consumption works both ways in the wealth-equals-energy-use calculus. No wonder governments are hesitant to impose policy mechanisms, like massive carbon levies, that threaten to slow down their economies. In reverse, energy-use-equals-wealth.In the lead up to the December COP24 summit in Poland, voices are getting louder that governments need to do more to accelerate renewable energy development and encumber the market for fossil fuels. I don't think it's a bold prediction to say that most governments will be reluctant to do much. Most countries have anxiety about their economic condition, on top of their inner-conflict between wealth creation and energy use.There is a way out. Can wealth be created at the same time as reducing the use of all primary energy sources?The answer is yes, a necessary yes. Over the next several decades, bending the trajectory of demand growth downward is viewed as necessary for sustainability by every forecasting agency. But to do so, the responsibility lies equally on the consumer's shoulders as it does on the supplier's (the emphasis is biased heavily on the latter right now).On the demand side, reducing energy use and ecological damage is a cultural dynamic, an attitude of wanting to do it. Citizens must be part of the solution. It's more than thinking that sci-fi technology, divesting, industry-bashing and government brow-beating will break the trends.Energy is about how we all live, work and play. So the business of energy is everybody's business, not just the suppliers.In the absence of greater consumer participation, we'll have to wait for the next time a bond trader has nothing to do.Peter Tertzakian is the Executive Director of the ARC Energy Research Institute.

""We will all have to be courageous to look into the future and make yet another step for the sake of humanity.""The talks in Poland took place against a backdrop of growing concern among scientists that global warming on Earth is proceeding faster than governments are responding to it. Last month, a study found that global warming will worsen disasters such as the deadly California wildfires and the powerful hurricanes that have hit the United States this year.President Michal Kurtyka poses for a photo after adopting the final agreement during a closing session of the COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018.And a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it's possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels.Alarmed by efforts to include this in the final text of the meeting, the oil-exporting nations of the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait blocked an endorsement of the IPCC report mid-way through this month's talks in the Polish city of Katowice. That prompted uproar from vulnerable countries like small island nations and environmental groups.The final text at the UN talks omits a previous reference to specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the ""timely completion"" of the IPCC report, not its conclusions.Last-minute snags forced negotiators in Katowice to go into extra time, after Friday's scheduled end of the conference had passed without a deal.One major sticking point was how to create a functioning market in carbon credits. Economists believe that an international trading system could be an effective way to drive down greenhouse gas emissions and raise large amounts of money for measures to curb global warming.But Brazil wanted to keep the piles of carbon credits it had amassed under an old system that developed countries say wasn't credible or transparent.Among those that pushed back hardest was the United States, despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and his promotion of coal as a source of energy.""Overall, the U.S. role here has been somewhat schizophrenic - pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,"" said Elliot Diringer of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Washington think-tank.A worker dismantles the exhibition pavilion of Austria as the UN Climate conference draws to a close, as negotiators from almost 200 countries continue haggling over the fine print of the Paris climate accord in Katowice, Poland, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2018.When it came to closing potential loopholes that could allow countries to dodge their commitments to cut emissions, ""the U.S. pushed harder than nearly anyone else for transparency rules that put all countries under the same system, and it's largely succeeded.""""Transparency is vital to U.S. interests,"" added Nathaniel Keohane, a climate policy expert at the Environmental Defence Fund. He noted that breakthrough in the 2015 Paris talks happened only after the U.S. and China agreed on a common framework for transparency.""In Katowice, the U.S. negotiators have played a central role in the talks, helping to broker an outcome that is true to the Paris vision of a common transparency framework for all countries that also provides flexibility for those that need it,"" said Keohane, calling the agreement ""a vital step forward in realizing the promise of the Paris accord.""Among the key achievements in Katowice was an agreement on how countries should report their greenhouses gas emissions and the efforts they're taking to reduce them. Poor countries also secured assurances on getting greater predictability about financial support to help them cut emissions, adapt to inevitable changes such as sea level rises and pay for damages that have already happened.Where's the money?

The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree C since pre-industrial times and it's on course for another 2-3 degrees of warming by the end of the century unless drastic action is taken.The conference will have ""quite significant consequences for humanity and for the way in which we take care of our planet,"" Kurtyka told the Associated Press ahead of the talks.Experts agree that the Paris goals can only be met by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.But the Paris agreement let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. Overall, the world is heading the wrong way.Last week, the World Meteorological Organization said globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a new record in 2017, while the level of other heat-trapping gases such methane and nitrous oxide also rose.This year is expected to see another 2 per cent increase in human-made emissions, as construction of coal-fired power plants in Asia and Africa continue while carbon-absorbing forests are felled faster than they can regrow.""Everyone recognized that the national plans, when you add everything up, will take us way beyond 3, potentially 4 degrees Celsius warming,"" said Johan Rockstrom, the incoming director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.""We know that we're moving in the wrong direction,"" Rockstrom told the AP. ""We need to bend the global carbon emissions no later than 2020 - in two years' time - to stand a chance to stay under 2 degrees Celsius.""Doing so will entail a transformation of all sectors of their economies, including a complete end to burning fossil fuel.Poor nations want rich countries to pledge the biggest cuts, on the grounds that they're responsible for most of the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Rich countries say they're willing to lead the way, but only if poor nations play their part as well.""Obviously not all countries are at the same stage of development,"" said Lidia Wojtal, an associate with Berlin-based consultancy Climatekos and a former Polish climate negotiator. ""So we need to also take that into account and differentiate between the responsibilities. And that's a huge task.""Among those likely to be pressing hardest for ambitious measures will be small island nations , which are already facing serious challenges from climate change.The U.S., meanwhile, is far from being the driving force it was during the Paris talks under President Barack Obama. Brazil and Australia, previously staunch backers of the accord, appear to be following in Trump's footsteps .Some observers fear nationalist thinking on climate could scupper all hope of meaningful progress in Katowice. Others are more optimistic.""We will soon see a large enough minority of significant economies moving decisively in the right direction,"" said Rockstrom. ""That can have spillover effects which can be positive.""Poland could end up playing a crucial role in bringing opposing sides together. The country has already presided over three previous rounds of climate talks, and its heavy reliance on carbon-intensive coal for energy is forcing Warsaw to mull some tough measures in the years ahead.The 24th Conference of the Parties, or COP24 as it's known, is being held on the site of a Katowice mine that was closed in 1999 after 176 years of coal production. Five out of the city's seven collieries have been closed since the 1990s, as Poland phased out communist-era subsidies and moved to a market economy.Yet elsewhere in the city, 1,500 miners still extract thousands of tons of coal daily. Poland also still depends on coal for some 80 per cent of its energy needs.Poland intends to send a signal that the miners' futures, and those of millions of others whose jobs are at risk from decarbonization, are not being forgotten. During the first week of talks, leaders are expected to sign a Polish-backed declaration calling for a 'just transition' that will ""create quality jobs in regions affected by transition to a low-carbon economy.""Then negotiators will get down to the gritty task of trimming a 300-page draft into a workable and meaningful agreement that governments can sign off on at the end of the second week.""(I) hope that parties will be able to reach a compromise and that we will be able to say that Katowice contributed positively to this global effort,"" Kurtyka said.--Jordans reported from Berlin.--Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at HYPERLINK http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter HYPERLINK http://www.twitter.com/wirereporterhttp://www.twitter.com/wirereporter--Read more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climatehttps://www.apnews.com/Climate HYPERLINK https://www.apnews.com/Climatehttps://www.apnews.com/Climate\l"

They said developing economies should not be forced to cut jobs.""Those member countries in Europe that have a chance for a modern development and for modern industry, they should get support, on the condition it really is modern industry that will preserve the region's jobs,"" Deputy Energy Minister Grzegorz Tobiszowski said.Since 1990, Poland has cut over 300,000 coal mining jobs, to some 83,000 currently, and has also scaled down coal extraction to some 65 million tons from 147 million tons. However, the industry remains one of the major employers in Poland and consecutive governments have vowed to protect it, while still modernizing it and making it more environment-friendly.Some 80 per cent of Poland's energy comes from coal, some 15 per cent comes from renewable sources and 5 per cent is from gas. By 2030, the government has pledged to cut coal to some 49 per cent of the country's energy mix.Tomasz Rogala, the head of the European Association for Coal and Lignite, said that last year the EU imported 173 million tons of coal, an amount that could have provided some 175,000 jobs in Europe.Among the issues for the two-week summit in December are how to ensure transparent monitoring of what countries do to cut their global emissions and the methods used to take stock of what countries have achieved.It is also expected that the governments will hear that their current national pledges won't be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, and should therefore raise their ambitions.While U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the 2015 Paris accord, the rest of the world remains committed to the deal.\l"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada98","Carbon taxes defy science, cripple economies; Fossil fuels are what made our health and economic progress over the past 150 years possible - and continue to do ....","November 29, 2018 Thursday","Winkler Times","The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a nonbinding resolution that a carbon tax would kill jobs, damage the revitalized American economy, and disproportionately impact poor, minority and working class families.The vote also reflects the fact that America is still over 80 per cent dependent on fossil fuels -and helps explain why a misguided Republican Carlos Curbelo of Florida was able to convince only one colleague (Republican Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania) to co-sponsor his carbon tax bill back in July.In the meantime, Doug Ford became Ontario's new premier in part by vigorously opposing the carbon taxes, and pricey wind and solar electricity that many Canadians have come to despise. He quickly eliminated $2 billion in taxes a year by cancelling 200 heavily subsidized renewable energy projects implemented by his predecessor.Meanwhile, the federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces increased resistance to its plans for a steadily escalating carbon tax.In Australia, Angus Taylor's appointment as Energy minister means wind and solar subsidies will soon be terminated. This will undoubtedly delight residents of South Australia, home of a 50 per cent renewable energy program, the world's highest electricity prices, two weeks of zero wind/zero electricity in two years, and some 200,000 families no longer able to afford electricity.Germany's solar industry is collapsing as its subsidies plummet; its wind turbine subsidies are scheduled to end in 2020; ancient villages and forests have been bulldozed to allow coal mining to fuel its new generating plants; and the country's Green Party has admitted that ""de-carbonizing"" the German and world economies can be accomplished only by limiting or eliminating democracy worldwide.And yet, like Dracula monsters, carbon tax proposals keep rising from the dead.Several big corporations, U.S.Republican officials Jim Baker, Hank Paulson and George Schultz, and their Climate Leadership Council now claim that 56 per cent of American voters support taxing carbon, while only 26% oppose the idea. So says their recent survey. How is that possible? To begin with, they didn't call it a tax. They cleverly labelled their scheme a ""carbon dividend"" (who doesn't like dividends?) and claimed ""the vast majority of American families"" would somehow come out ahead if it's implemented.The survey didn't mention that their program would be administered by the ever-friendly Internal Revenue Service or that the tax would begin at US$43 per tonne of 'carbon' emitted. (Trudeau's hated tax begins at C$10 per tonne and rises to $C50 by 2022.)They didn't mention that the tax would be imposed on foundries, factories, refineries, coaland gas-fired power plants, other industrial facilities, and even (at a lower rate) on products imported from other countries.Equally important, constant assurances that market-based carbon tax schemes like this US$43-per-tonne version would be 'revenue neutral,'receipts would be returned to taxpayers in the form of tax reductions elsewhere, and revenues would be used to reduce federal budget deficits are illusory. Can the council somehow guarantee that the next Congress will not (promptly) reverse these netgain provisions? But let's get to the nuts and bolts of carbon taxes and 'clean, green, renewable' energy.As MIT emeritus professor of atmospheric physics Richard Lindzen points out, those who control carbon control life. And make no mistake, these are taxes on carbon-based fuels: on 83 per cent of the energy we use. They are taxes on everything we make, ship, eat and do -on our lives, livelihoods, living standards, transportation, heating, cooling, refrigeration, healthcare, clothing and everything else we touch.By using the word 'carbon,'tax proponents deceptively suggest they want to tax soot, pollution, toxic emissions. But with modern scrubbers and other pollution controls, what comes out of power plant and factory 'smoke stacks'today is almost entirely water vapour and carbon dioxide.Fossil fuels are what made our health and economic progress over the past 150 years possible -and continue to do so. Carbon (coal, oil and natural gas) is what we burn to generate electricity, power factories and operate vehicles.Carbon dioxide is what's created and emitted by that combustion process.So these climate leadership members want to tax carbon dioxide: the gas of life, the miracle molecule that we exhale and that makes life on Earth possible. In fact, the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the faster and better food crop, forest and grassland plants grow; the better they survive droughts, diseases and viruses. Rising atmospheric CO2 levels are actually greening the Earth, including forests worldwide.The council's goal is to keep fossil fuels in the ground, and force a transition to wind, solar, ethanol and other 'renewable' energy. In the process, the activists, politicians, lobbyists and crony corporatists expect to get incredibly wealthy and gain increasing control over global economies and living standards.How would US$43 per tonne of carbon dioxide affect you? It would raise your electricity and gasol"
"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada99","Suncors Williams A Climate Accord Architect Feels \u732 Incredibly Optimistic About Industrys Future","June 6, 2018 Wednesday","Daily Oil Bulletin","When leaders of a group of oilsands producers stood with environmental organizations, sharing a stage with Alberta Premier Rachel Notley as she announced an extraordinary provincial climate accord in November 2015, few were aware of the marathon of negotiations and depth of conciliation that had led up to that unprecedented moment. It was no easy process, according to Steve Williams, Suncor Energy Inc. president and CEO, who was involved from the start. The deal hammered out would see an economy-wide carbon levy accompanied by a 100 million tonne CO2 emissions cap applied to the provinces oilsands extraction sector. The unlikely agreement drew praise from organizations as diverse as the sectors main lobby, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, to Pembina Institute, the David Suzuki Foundation and even Al Gore, former United States vice president and climate change campaigner. However, it came only after monumental efforts on all sides to reach a consensus, Williams recalled at the Energy Disruptors Unite conference in Calgary recently. It was a brutally tough process. It took us two years. We had to be hidden from sight, we were doing it on weekends, we were doing it at nights in dark rooms. We had to  eat a lot of unreasonable things that we all brought into the room. We had to get past that, but now, three or four years later, when I go into climate change discussions, Canada is viewed to be the leader in the world now, he said. The oilsands is the first reservoir in the world to have a CO2 cap put on its development, and all of that was developed by co-operation. So its brutally tough [to do], it takes really courageous and bright people to do it, but it can work, he added in a wide-ranging  fireside chat-style interview with Emergent CEO Holly Ransom. In a sense, the deal was the result of a go-around initially circumventing politicians with their polarized positions on the issue, Williams said in a detailed discussion of the arrangement. In this particular example, we found that it turns out politicians are quite extreme. Its very difficult for them to occupy what I call that  common sense space in the middle. If you talk to politicians they will talk about wedge issues and what they really mean is,  How do we drive a wedge between this group and that group? or NGOs (non-governmental organizations) who will take an item and make it so extreme that normal people cant talk about it, or companies which might do the same. I am not attributing it to any particular group, but what we have found is, that doesnt actually make any progress. So I said,  Ill tell you what well do, well work with the NGOs and we will try and get as far as we can on a science-based, reason-based solution. And we did. They started by looking at the big picture, said Williams. The journey started with [asking], how do we supply energy to seven billion people, or how do we provide energy at a cost which enables more people to get food, to get medicine, that requires real fixes and real solutions and real pragmatism, and thats a much more difficult world to work in. So we sat down with the leaders of the worlds NGOs, and it took us a couple of years to have that debate, and what we found was, we were starting from very different positions but our values were very similar. It turns out we all actually care about the community we live in, we all want the better place for our children and our grandchildren. We found some areas where we could start to get closer together, and then we started to really look at the issue. The Canadian energy sector, it turns out, is at the bleeding edge of that world, he said, and the Suncor CEO worked hard among industry partners as well as NGOs to break that paradigm particularly in the oilsands and in the oil and gas world. With a consensus at hand, the changing of the guard in Edmonton and Ottawa helped break the logjam politically, Williams said. We said,  OK, [the agreement] is great but its in a vacuum  we need it to be enacted into public policy, and into law for it to become effective. It became three or four companies, [and] half a dozen NGOs putting together some policy, [then] getting politicians to take it on. And partly because of the fortune of governments changing in Alberta and then in Canada nationally, we were able to get that adopted very quickly. Thats become the basis of the leading best practice on the planet now for climate change and carbon regulation.  Incredibly optimistic Asked what gives him the greatest cause for optimism, and the biggest challenge on the journey there, the leader of Canadas biggest oil and gas company said he remains incredibly optimistic around the industrys future. When I look I see first of all great innovation and creativity in the right places where it really matters. We have the leading edge [of] \£6 the worlds best innovation organizations in Alberta, in Canada. One of them, COSIA (Canadas Oil Sands Innovation Alliance), which is around environmental development, has put $1.4 billion [into R&D] from the [member] companies. We have had 1,000 pieces of intellectual property developed and its pushing the boundaries of science back and its a model for the world about how to do that. We are starting to solve some of these big issues. CO2 is probably the toughest and will take us the longest. In fact, of the four focus areas of COSIA  water consumption, land disturbance, tailings and greenhouse gas emissions  three of those four are on their way to being solved, Williams told the conference. We now use a fraction of the water we used to\£6. We believe we are in the throes of developing the technology to solve [the tailings] issue, not just for Canada, but for the whole of the mining world. We have now completely reclaimed the first of the tailings ponds and its trafficable and its now a nature reserve. But greenhouse gas emissions remain a tough problem to solve, he said. There is climate change happening [and] we have to start to address it, so we have to start to make progress in this energy journey that we are on, said Williams, who was invited to attend the 2015 United Nations in Paris as an official member of Canadas delegation. Its a planetary challenge because its not a local issue  the climate doesnt care whether it [emissions] comes from Canada or it comes from China, it has a warming effect around the earth. We are starting to make real progress there, but I can see tons of things we can do right now. Some of them are outside [the conference centre]  some of the vehicles that are here. If you really want to get to it fast, there are steps we can take around fuel quality, around engine efficiency, that we can be implementing right now. We have known how to have much more efficient engines than we have on this continent for the last 30 years, and they havent been used. We know how to do that; we should be taking those steps, said Williams, who sits on the advisory board of Canadas Ecofiscal Commission and supports a countrywide price on carbon. Divisive debate slowing progress Part of the problem, though, is the division within the debate, he reiterated. The biggest barrier is this polarized, confrontational approach which doesnt take us forward, he said. I have been involved in the climate change conversation since the 70s and its made very poor progress by any measure. We can talk about the conferences, we can talk about Paris, but actually look at the CO2 emitted in the world; we havent made much progress. While the debate may have stalled, he said the Canadian oilpatch has been making strides, due largely to technological innovation. Williams noted that Suncor uses 50 per cent less energy per bbl than it did 10 years ago and is on track to use 30 per cent less by 2030. We think we have got the technology already to do it, so those bits of technology require development and then real action to take, and we have got to start moving into that solution space. I came to Canada 16 years ago, and [at that time] the oilsands was viewed to be highly environmentally invasive, and very high cost. Today, its now one of the low cost sectors in the industry ... and every day we get better in terms of our carbon footprint. [Suncors new $17-billion Fort Hills oilsands mine] has a carbon footprint, from how we take it out of the ground to being consumed by a customer, which is lower than the average barrel on this continent, he said. It has also been a journey that has seen costs fall from around $40 a bbl a decade ago to just above $20 today, and I can see it down into the teens, Williams said. We are now one of the lowest cost operators, so for [Fort Hills], for the next 50 years I can produce a bbl of oil for $20 a bbl  thats $20 Canadian. The rest of the world will struggle to compete with that because it has to look at its full investment cycle as well as its operation. Our resources are vast and long-term, so we wont be price setters, [but] we can be the low cost setter and my honest belief is that we will be one of the last barrels of oil produced, by choice, for the world. Its been a journey of scale, of better technology, of getting clever at what you do, having to be far smarter  and thats why the future is so optimistic. The future is digital The applications of digital technology  or artificial intelligence or machine learning  the ability to adopt that in a capital-intensive, data-intensive industry like ours is vast, he said. Its going to have a massive impact on us. We are having to drag ourselves up the learning curve, because although we do all of those things, we have still got a ton to learn about it. So the whole of the top team of Suncor, we are teaching ourselves about artificial intelligence. The whole team has just been down to Seattle with Microsoft and Boeing to look at some of their stuff. I spent a week down in Silicon Valley last year looking at what Facebook and Google can teach us. And I think you never get there  its just a realization that there is so much more you can do. The ability of us to use the data we already have to much more beneficial results is becoming clear  so I think that is where we will see the biggest breakthroughs. Autonomous heavy haulers Williams pointed to the introduction of autonomous heavy haulers in oilsands mining operations, which it anticipates will reduce operating costs by five to 10 per cent, as one successful implementation of digital technology. With more than 150 haulers on the way, Suncor is rolling out the first fully autonomous heavy vehicle fleet in North America. Its just amazing to watch. What it means is, the trucks operate all the time  they only stop to be fuelled, [and] they dont break down so often. We used to have a paradigm where our trucks were best driven by females, because females are better drivers than men are if they are [driving] large vehicles because they drive them more sympathetically than men do. But the bad news is the completely autonomous ones are even better. They drive almost perfectly, they accelerate perfectly, they brake perfectly, they dont bump into things. The biggest problem we have with them  these things are the size of a jumbo jet  is they are so accurate they carve a hole in the road, so we have to move them over a few millimetres every [cycle] so they actually flatten the road rather than digging a hole in the road. So the ability to adapt and take on these technologies is what is going to be the key. Overall, digitalization will have an impact on jobs, but is unlikely to reduce them for decades, he added. The societal question is, what does it mean to us all if we dont need so many people to do the jobs? Is it good or bad? I think both of those are true. I have no doubt that automating a truck means I dont need a driver, but I do need other skills. Some people talk about this as the fourth industrial revolution. If I look at the first three, the net result has been more jobs, so I think the two will be in tension. I suspect there is a crossover coming, in the next 50 to 100 years, where we will be so efficient we wont need everybody to work the way we have been used to working. Democracy under threat Responding to a question about the extent of polarization of the conversation around energy and the environment in an increasingly fragmented social media environment, Williams said he thought the very question nailed it. I think you just put your finger on what the issue is. Communication is so effective, it happens so quickly, that if you have a noisy minority they drown out everybody else. There are bigger questions than just energy disruption  I think democracy itself is at threat, he continued. Does it work in a world where a few people can have such a massive input? It was [U.K. Prime Minister Winston] Churchill who had that expression, that all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good people to stay silent. And so if we go away with something, we have got to stop being silent. Whether its political extreme, industrial extreme, whether its a company doing it or a CEO doing it, or an NGO doing it, we cant let people use these communications mechanisms to huge effect, said Williams. They are not representing us anymore. So I think it is a threat and I am not sure what the answer is. Ending on a more positive note, he urged conference goers to get involved and concentrate in that solution space. Its not enough to be on the outside talking about somebody else doing it, or not doing it; its important for us to get in that space. And I think if we can do that we can make this a much better place. And have an open mind, Williams advised. The toughest thing in the world to do is to compromise. Its the easiest thing in the world to take a position and be intransigent. The most difficult thing is to enter a space and be willing to give something up. \l"

A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that if the world wants to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, warming must remain below 1.5 C.In Poland, Heyman said he's been busy answering questions about B.C.'s newly released plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meeting with business and political leaders to discuss the province's various initiatives, including its plan to phase out the sale of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles.That was the topic of a meeting between Heyman and BMW's vice-president of governmental affairs Andreas Klugescheid ahead of a panel discussion about moving effectively toward low-emissions transportation.""I found that a very useful and interesting conversation and I think he did as well,"" Heyman said.Read more:Sweeping B.C. climate change plan targets heavy emitters with new rules, carbon tax incentivesNew vehicles sold in B.C. to emit zero emissions by 2040Canada seeking new members of anti-coal alliance at climate meetingIn November, B.C. announced it would introduce legislation in the spring to ensure all new cars and trucks sold in the province by 2040 are powered by electricity or hydrogen fuel.The policy will apply to cars and trucks weighing up to 8,500 pounds and is expected to shave 1.3 million tonnes from B.C.'s emissions by 2030, when at least 30 per cent of all new cars sold must be electric or hydrogen-fuelled. That's equivalent to taking more than 280,000 fossil-fuel-powered cars off the road.Achieving that target means car manufacturers will need to make significantly more electric cars available for purchase in B.C., where buyers have faced long wait lists, Heyman said.Of his conversation with Klugescheid, Heyman said ""we talked a lot about what has to be done in terms of market factors to incent greater production of electric or other zero-emission vehicles and how we work with the industry to produce those cars and make them available to people.""Offering rebates and incentives will enable more people to buy electric vehicles, and over time that will help bring down the price of manufacturing and the cost to buy electric, Heyman said.Other factors, including an increase in charging infrastructure and improved battery technology, also need to be addressed, he said.Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna is also meeting with world leaders in Poland, including leaders from the European Union and China.Speaking to media during a teleconference Wednesday, McKenna said ""these are key countries in the context of the Paris Agreement.""""There's broader context with China, but in the context of working together on the environment and climate change, they've played an important role. When the U.S. stepped back, China stepped up,"" she said.""China knows it needs to take action because you can see the levels of pollution that they have, but they also see the economic opportunity,"" she said, adding that the country has been a leader on electric vehicles.""They can scale like no other country.""Ainslie Cruickshank is a Vancouver-based reporter covering the environment.

But others mixed in with them wore black hoodies and piled up construction materials, including large plywood planks, in the middle of a street near the Arc de Triomphe, and set the rubble on fire.Police responded by firing bursts from a water cannon with backup from riot officers, who used tear gas on the protesters.--10:05 a.m. French authorities have deployed thousands of police on Paris' Champs-Elysees avenue to try to contain protests by people angry over rising taxes and President Emmanuel Macron's government.The so-called yellow jackets have called for new demonstrations and road blockades Saturday across France, including the capital, where a demonstration last weekend turned violent.Hundreds of people gathered at the top of the Champs-Elysees on Saturday morning. Access to the avenue was closed to cars and strictly monitored by police with identity checks and bag inspections.Police briefly used tear gas to disperse the crowd as some tried to force their way through.The protests, which began with motorists demonstrating against a fuel tax hike, now involve a broad range of demands related to the country's high cost of living. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada109","Al Gore says it's good that Trump isn't paying attention to global climate summit","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","The Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada)","Al Gore wore his black cowboy boots. He talked about everything from his cameos on ""South Park"" to his conversations with President Donald Trump.The former vice president and longtime climate crusader had swooped into the coal-mining region of Poland that is home this week to global climate talks, where delegates from nearly 200 countries have convened in an effort to begin implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement.Gore arrived in town amid worries that the talks - formally known as COP24 - were flailing. Negotiators had failed to come to consensus on key issues of transparency, finance and the ambition necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The head of the United Nations had warned that ""the window of opportunity is closing.""Gore, who is no stranger to such proceedings, seemed to take Wednesday's atmosphere of angst in stride. He said he remains optimistic that the world will find a way to tackle climate change, and he said it's a good thing that Trump seems to have little interest in the talks unfolding in Katowice.The following are excerpts from Gore's interview with Washington Post national environmental reporter Brady Dennis and Berlin Bureau Chief Griff Witte:The Washington Post: We want to start with the leadership void at this COP. Given where the U.S. is, what do you see as far as the willingness or ability of other countries to step up?Al Gore: I think the European Union's been playing a fairly impressive role, mostly behind the scenes. And China's role is complicated, but in some ways they're moving the ball in the right direction. But it's better when the U.S. is actually providing leadership. And maybe a couple of years from now it will again.TWP: Is it just that the U.S. is not providing leadership, or is it playing a negative role here?AG: Those who are actually down in the trenches and engaged in a lot of the details are doing a workmanlike job. You get the political appointee types who come over here and put on a brief sideshow on promoting coal. And the kerfuffle over welcome-versus-note sent a chill down the spines of some people. But I don't think that it was an indication of a large or malignant engagement by the White House. Of course, we have two days to go, so we'll know then. But I don't think that this COP seems to be on the White House radar screen. I'm hoping it stays that way.TWP: Overall are you optimistic or pessimistic that this COP will yield something substantive?AG: I think that the essential agenda assigned to this COP is probably going to get done. There are 22,000 people here from 190 countries and they're continuing to do highly detailed work regardless of what Donald Trump thinks.TWP: In the absence of a major U.S. role, how do you see the business world? Is the private sector filling the void?AG: Many in the business world and in the investor world are trying to do exactly that. Not only out of a sense of moral duty but also because they see that the world is in the early stages of a sustainability revolution. It's the biggest business opportunity in the history of the world, and people are really seizing it. Look at the announcement just two days ago from Xcel Energy in Minnesota. Big utility right on the Canadian border. They just announced a shift to 100 percent renewable energy and a plan to close their existing fossil fuel plants. They're doing it because the business realities are pushing them in that direction. That's happening around the world.TWP: We've seen suggestions that maybe there's not enough urgency here. Do you think that's the case?AG: Whenever you have 197 nations trying to agree on anything, it's going to be an unwieldy process. But the new approach at these COPs since the Paris meeting has been to reach out beyond the government delegations to civil society, businesses, industry and investors and to welcome the commitments of regional and state governments and municipal governments. And I think that was a wise choice, and I think those actors are feeling or are manifesting a greater sense of urgency than you might get from the official meetings.TWP: How do you see climate factoring into the 2020 presidential campaign?AG: Well, I'm not a great political prognosticator. But I'm impressed that several of the candidates on the great-mentioned list have already said that climate is going to be their number one issue. So that's a good sign.TWP: It's never been, as you well know, an issue that plays very well on the campaign trail.AG: I think the main reason that's changed is Mother Nature. The combination of Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, the Camp Fire, the Woolsey Fire or the Mendocino Complex Fire, Hurricane Harvey the year before, $320 billion in damage from Hurricane Harvey and Maria and Irma. I mean, every night on the TV news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. I think people are connecting these dots on their own.TWP: I know you gave it a try with Ivanka Trump, and I guess Trump himself. Was there any willingness there?AG: I met with Trump and continued my conversations during the first part of his first year in office. I've maintained the confidentiality of those communications. I'll simply say that I went into those discussions with some reason for legitimate hope that he might change. But I was disappointed.TWP: What do you think is at the root of his climate change denial?AG: Well, in Tennessee the farmers have an old saying that if you see a turtle on top of a fence post, you can be pretty sure it didn't get there by itself. And when you see the persistent climate denial in the U.S. among a big chunk of the Republican Party, it didn't happen by itself. And Trump is in that category. The economic interests of the large carbon polluters led them some years back to adopt the playbook of the tobacco industry and to invest $2 billion over the years in promoting climate denial. So that's my take on it. But surely some part of it is human nature, which makes us reluctant to engage with difficult subjects.\l"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada111","Elizabeth May One-on-One","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","CTV NEWS CHANNEL Television, Inc. POWER PLAY WITH DON MARTIN 17:00:00 ET","TODD VAN DER HEYDEN: Now let's get thoughts from Canada's Green Party leader. Elizabeth May will be heading off to the United Nations major climate change conference in Poland. This is our last chance to speak with her for the year, and it's been a busy one for her. She's got arrested, she got engaged, and now she's here on the show. Congratulations on both counts!ELIZABETH MAY (Green Party Leader): Ha, ha, ha, I am very happy about getting married, and my fiance is fabulous, and we're very happy.VAN DER HEYDEN: So let me ask you about, we've been talking about what's going on in France, and we've seen these violent protests that are happening there amid this fuel tax that was brought in, has since been repealed by the Macron government. Do you worry, when we look at what's happening in the streets of Paris, that people are turning away from climate change when they realize the actual price tag that's involved? When it comes to the hard decisions, they're not interested.MAY: Well I don't think that's true. What's happening in France, there's a lot of other things fueling it in terms of domestic politics and the increasing unpopularity of President Macron, but it has been the case that France has had strong climate action, way stronger than Canada's, has achieved its Kyoto targets and gone way beyond those. And of course under Harper, Canada rejected our legally binding targets under Kyoto, withdrew from the Kyoto accord. We remain the only country on earth that ratified Kyoto that withdrew from that. Obviously the US under Bush didn't ratify. But we have a long way to go to get to where France is now, and I think we have to bear in mind our responsibility as a country that really shows leadership in the world. When we show leadership, we punch above our weight, and it's time we really started to do that, because the world needs leaders on climate.VAN DER HEYDEN: Well we talk about the pushback, we mentioned France, but we're seeing pushback in Canada against the Trudeau government's carbon tax. Some of the provinces, Saskatchewan, Ontario, others saying thanks but no thanks, we're not interested. Do you worry about where that's going?MAY: What I worry about is that we're not talking about what really must be done, what needs to be done, and it's not in a context that says these are the things we're doing, this is how it will engage you as citizens, engage your communities, engage your businesses. It's positive. We want you on board. It's really, it's not an issue, it's not an environmental issue, right, it's an existential threat to the survival of human civilization, and to get through it we can do it with measures that are positive, they're job creating, that really engage people. In the same way I feel that we're in pretty much the same situation but with a different threat than where Winston Churchill found himself in May 1940, where all the evidence looks back, and you don't know if the public is willing to go with you. They used to test for morale reports to the British cabinet, and saying people don't seem ready, they don't really understand the nature of the threat. I think governments showing leadership explain the threat, explain how we get through it, and inspire people to take that challenge on. So we really need a climate Churchill. We need someone who says, okay, if the military can't save our troops in Dunkirk, how many civilian boats are there in Dover. And I think the solution to the climate crisis is engaging communities, municipal governments, and provincial governments. The British Columbia government is in court on the carbon tax to support it. And if Doug Ford hadn't replaced Patrick Brown, the Progressive Conservatives of Ontario would have had their own carbon pricing plan. So I'm very confident that the vast majority of Canadians want climate action, but they want to know that it actually can achieve the goals that are required.VAN DER HEYDEN: Let me ask you about Poland, because you're heading off to Poland to be at the summit, and the United Nations has basically said, look, we've got 12 years give or take until it's too late.MAY: We don't have any give or take, and 12 years is probably the maximum and optimistic projection of achieving 45 percent reduction in greenhouse gases against 2010 levels by 2030. You can't start in five years to achieve something like that within ten years. We had to have started yesterday, so it's why we're still pressing the Trudeau administration to go to COP 24 in Poland with a commitment that Canada wants to lead the world to get on this positive pathway that leads us to a thriving civilization, that gets us through the climate crisis and out the other end. And the procrastination and the political games coming from Andrew Scheer and the Conservative crowds just are reckless and irresponsible. And if you can stand up, and we don't yet have climate leadership from the federal Liberals, but real climate leadership says this is what we're going to do, and we're going to bring other countries along with us because we know that the survival of the future of our kids depends on getting this right. A lot of other issues out there that you want to get right, but you can maybe afford to wait until the next election. This isn't one of those.VAN DER HEYDEN: Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party. Wish you all the best.MAY: Thank you.VAN DER HEYDEN: In the rest of the year and on the journey to Poland.MAY: Thank you very much.VAN DER HEYDEN: Up next, a first look at the new fiscal landscape in the province of Quebec. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\l"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada114","Huntsville resident offers some final thoughts on climate change and energy","December 17, 2018 Monday","Bracebridge Examiner","MUSKOKA - On Dec. 3, 2018, the 24th UN Conference of the Parties on Climate Change, opened in Katowice, Poland, the heart of Polish coal production.The conference, known as COP 24, comes 24 years after COP 1 in Berlin, Germany. After 24 years of debate and 24 UN conferences, is the world any closer to agreement on what the problem is and how to solve it? Trying to get a 200-horse team moving in unison is not easy. Getting agreement among 200 rich and poor countries on what to do and how best to do it is not easy.Margaret Wente's column in the Dec. 15 Globe and Mail essentially recommends that we put our heads in the sand and give up on climate change. Like all deniers, she ignores the fact that fossil fuels are a finite resource and failing to replace them soon enough will become as big a problem as climate change. Then we will have two problems; global climate change and a global energy shortage.What to do?Recently, I got excited and spoke too soon in praise of yet another news clip about a battery discovery that would save the world from climate change. A reality check with a bit of math quickly showed that while it has some potential, it is hardly the game-changing miracle it was touted to be.After 40 years of engineering work (at times on these subjects) and after almost 10 years of researching and writing about an appropriate balance between our energy system and our environment, I agree with the thinking of James Hansen. Hansen is a renowned professor of environmental science and climatology at Columbia University, and former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.Excerpts from Hansen's 2013 interview with the New York Times""We're not going to turn the lights out. No government, no president or governor is going to turn out the lights. There has to be energy. If renewables aren't providing it, it's been fossil fuels.""""I think it's unfortunate that so many environmentalists are just assuming that renewable energies will be able to satisfy all of our requirements. The soft renewables are only providing between one and two per cent of global energy. Hydro power provides a significant amount of electricity but that's limited. The hope that the wind, and the sun, and geothermal can provide all of our energy is a nice idea but I find it unlikely that that's possible.""""The environmental community is basically asking governments to try to reduce their emissions by subsidizing renewables. Well, that simply doesn't work because we don't get enough energy from the renewables to make a difference. And that then forces those governments to approve expanded oil drilling, hydro-fracking to get more gas, and mountaintop removal to get coal.""Can renewable energies provide all of society's energy needs in the foreseeable future? It is conceivable in a few places, such as New Zealand and Norway. But suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the United States, China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.""""I think the only hope we have of phasing down emissions and getting to the middle of the century with a much lower level of fossil fuel emissions - which is what we will have to do if we want our young people to have a future - we're going to have alternatives and at this time nuclear seems to be the best candidate.""Following a discussion of the lessons from the great earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged Japan's Fukushima Daiichi power plant, he focuses on more resilient reactor designs: ""But with the new technologies, they are passively safe in the sense that if there is an anomaly like an earthquake or tsunami or both, it will just shut down and they don't require power to cool them.""How best to get it done?For years, economists have touted a revenue-neutral carbon tax as the most effective way to get everyone working on the problem in unison. But in a recent article, climate/energy economist Mark Jaccard at Simon Fraser University claims that the prospect of a carbon tax on individuals, and on business competitiveness, may be one of the biggest causes of climate change denial and one of the biggest political deterrents to progress. He might be right.Tax increases are always an easy target for opposition parties, even if it is promised to be returned in tax credits elsewhere. Constantly shifting global politics and fuel price speculators make it nearly impossible to track cause and effect. Jaccard says regulations bring less confusion and resistance than taxes and consequently get more results quicker.After all, the biggest carbon-reduction move ever made in Ontario was to eliminate coal-based electricity. It was indeed made without any carbon tax, and with little resistance. Vehicle fuel economy was doubled from 1975 to 2015 by gradually tightening harmonized North American regulations. Vehicle emissions were cut by 90 per cent. With no tax. Existing regulations will drive the conversion to electric vehicles and cut vehicle energy consumption and emissions in half again from 2015 to 2025, with or without a tax.But neither a revenue-neutral carbon tax nor regulations by themselves provide the funding for the research, development and deployment of new technologies. After watching inexperienced new governments of all stripes reverse policies on a whim, the private sector will not take the risk alone. Getting the job done will require many large public-private partnerships.Except for Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada and France are almost unique in that our electricity already comes from clean hydroelectric and nuclear sources, with a little help from wind and solar. We can get to 100 per cent without a tax. Tax or not, individual customers have no control over the source of their electricity. Building code changes can increase energy conservation for buildings without a carbon tax.On a global scale, these changes will take several decades. Meanwhile, the world will need oil from Canada as smaller reserves in all but eight countries are depleted by 2050. There are plenty of different estimates, but the life of official proven oil reserves at current production rates is one year for the EU, 15 years for the USA, China, India, and 21 years for Russia. To position themselves as environmentally responsible producers of large oil and gas reserves, Alberta and B.C. can eliminate emissions from oil and gas production by using made-in-Canada zero-emission small nuclear reactors for power and heat in the production process. That change is best driven by industry regulations and public-private partnerships.Hugh Holland is a retired engineering and manufacturing executive now living in Huntsville.

Les dirigeants du monde sont cens\'e9s d\'e9cider de la mani\'e8re dont chaque pays sera tenu responsable de sa r\'e9duction promise d'\'e9missions de carbone.Une discussion secondaire concerne les demandes des pays de se fixer des objectifs plus ambitieux. La r\'e9union de d\'e9cembre, connue sous le nom de Conf\'e9rence des Parties (ou COP24), intervient deux mois apr\'e8s que les scientifiques du changement climatique ont averti le monde que sans r\'e9duction significative des \'e9missions, la plan\'e8te serait en proie \'e0 des changements climatiques irr\'e9versibles et d\'e9vastateurs.Selon le rapport d'octobre, le Canada doit r\'e9duire ses \'e9missions de moiti\'e9 pour pouvoir jouer son r\'f4le. L'objectif actuel du Canada est de les r\'e9duire d'environ 27 pour cent.La ministre McKenna a h\'e9sit\'e9 \'e0 fixer des objectifs plus ambitieux, alors que le Canada est toujours incapable d£tteindre ses cibles les plus basses.En entrevue, elle a toutefois reconnu qu'\£ben 2020, tout le monde devra revenir et \'eatre plus ambitieux\'bb, et elle a assur\'e9 que le Canada le ferait.Catherine McKenna a ajout\'e9 que d'ici cette date, des normes devront \'eatre d\'e9finies en Pologne pour aider le monde \'e0 faire le point sur ses progr\'e8s et pour garantir l'utilisation de r\'e8gles universellement comprises. Cela permettra de s£ssurer que lorsqu'un pays dira que ses objectifs sont atteints, ils le seront r\'e9ellement.La r\'e9daction d'un r\'e8glement lors de la r\'e9union de ce mois-ci sera d£utant plus difficile apr\'e8s l'\'e9lection de plusieurs gouvernements moins enthousiastes vis-\'e0-vis de l£ccord de Paris.Sous l'impulsion du pr\'e9sident Donald Trump, les \'c9tats-Unis se pr\'e9parent \'e0 se retirer de l£ccord de Paris \'e0 la premi\'e8re occasion, c'est-\'e0-dire en 2020. Le gouvernement nouvellement \'e9lu au Br\'e9sil a promis de faire la m\'eame chose. Le gouvernement br\'e9silien vient \'e9galement d£nnuler le projet d£ccueillir la r\'e9union annuelle de la COP en 2019.Les objectifs de l£ccord de ParisL£ccord de Paris, sign\'e9 par tous les pays du monde, vise \'e0 r\'e9duire suffisamment la quantit\'e9 de gaz \'e0 effet de serre rejet\'e9e dans l£tmosph\'e8re pour que l£ugmentation de la temp\'e9rature mondiale moyenne ne d\'e9passe pas 2 degr\'e9s Celsius par rapport \'e0 la p\'e9riode pr\'e9industrielle, et aussi proche que possible de 1,5 degr\'e9.La temp\'e9rature moyenne dans le monde s'est d\'e9j\'e0 r\'e9chauff\'e9e d£u moins 1 degr\'e9 par rapport au 19e si\'e8cle et continue de se r\'e9chauffer d'environ 0,2 degr\'e9 chaque d\'e9cennie. Au rythme actuel des \'e9missions, les scientifiques pr\'e9voient que la plan\'e8te conna\'eetra un r\'e9chauffement de 1,5 degr\'e9 d'ici 2052. Apr\'e8s cela, l'impact sur la sant\'e9 humaine et les \'e9cosyst\'e8mes deviendra beaucoup plus probl\'e9matique.Catherine Abreu, directrice du R\'e9seau action climat Canada, s'est dite \£bravie\'bb que le Canada parle enfin d£ugmenter ses objectifs.\£bC'est une chose pour laquelle le Canada s'est vraiment pr\'e9par\'e9\'bb, a-t-elle d\'e9clar\'e9.En pr\'e9vision de la formulation de nouveaux objectifs, le Canada lance un nouvel institut sur les changements climatiques. L'organisme de recherche et de politiques est cens\'e9 ouvrir ses portes au cours de la prochaine ann\'e9e. Il conseillera le gouvernement sur la mani\'e8re dont ses politiques existantes fonctionnent et sur les autres mesures \'e0 prendre. Le gouvernement pr\'e9voit lui accorder 20 millions $ sur cinq ans.Mme Abreu esp\'e8re que l'institut sera plus qu'un autre groupe de r\'e9flexion. Elle voudrait que ce soit l'organisation qui \'e9value les progr\'e8s r\'e9alis\'e9s par le Canada pour atteindre ses objectifs en mati\'e8re d'\'e9missions.Trente-trois membres du R\'e9seau action climat ont \'e9crit cette semaine \'e0 la ministre McKenna et au premier ministre Justin Trudeau pour leur demander de fixer dans une loi les objectifs en mati\'e8re d'\'e9missions. Cela obligerait non seulement le gouvernement \'e0 atteindre ses objectifs, mais rendrait un recul plus difficile pour les futurs gouvernements.\l"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada136","Les d\'e9tails de l'accord de Paris seront au coeur des discussions en Pologne; Accord de Paris: les d\'e9tails discut\'e9s en Pologne","mercredi 28 novembre 2018 10:08 AM EST","La Presse Canadienne","KATOWICE, Pologne - Trois ans apr\'e8s avoir sign\'e9 \'e0 Paris un accord historique sur le climat, les dirigeants mondiaux se r\'e9uniront de nouveau pour en peaufiner les d\'e9tails.L'euphorie de 2015 a c\'e9d\'e9 la place \'e0 la p\'e9nible r\'e9alisation qu'il sera difficile d'obtenir un accord entre pr\'e8s de 200 pays, chacun ayant ses propres revendications politiques et \'e9conomiques - comme en t\'e9moigne la d\'e9cision du pr\'e9sident Donald Trump de retirer les \'c9tats-Unis de l£ccord de Paris, citant sa politique \£bAmerica First\'bb.\£bVu de l'ext\'e9rieur, c'est une t\'e2che impossible\'bb, a admis le ministre polonais adjoint de l'Environnement, Michal Kurtyka, \'e0 propos des n\'e9gociations qu'il pr\'e9sidera \'e0 Katowice du 2 au 14 d\'e9cembre.En t\'eate de l'ordre du jour sera la finalisation du soi-disant r\'e8glement de Paris, qui d\'e9termine comment les pays doivent comptabiliser leurs \'e9missions de gaz \'e0 effet de serre (GES), les communiquer de mani\'e8re transparente au reste du monde et r\'e9v\'e9ler ce qu'ils font pour les r\'e9duire.Des n\'e9gociateurs chevronn\'e9s qualifient la r\'e9union, qui devrait attirer 25 000 participants, de \£bParis 2.0\'bb en raison des enjeux \'e9lev\'e9s \'e0 Katowice.Incendies de for\'eat de la Californie \'e0 la Gr\'e8ce, s\'e9cheresses en Allemagne et en Australie, les temp\'eates Mangkhut dans le Pacifique et Michael dans l'Atlantique... Selon les scientifiques, les conditions m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames de cette ann\'e9e offrent un aper\'e7u des catastrophes \'e0 venir si le r\'e9chauffement de la plan\'e8te se poursuit.Un r\'e9cent rapport du Groupe international d'experts sur les changements climatiques (GIEC) avertit que le temps commence \'e0 manquer si le monde veut atteindre l'objectif le plus ambitieux de l£ccord de Paris, \'e0 savoir limiter le r\'e9chauffement climatique \'e0 1,5 degr\'e9 Celsius. La plan\'e8te s'est d\'e9j\'e0 r\'e9chauff\'e9e d'environ 1C depuis l'\'e8re pr\'e9industrielle et devrait encore r\'e9chauffer de deux \'e0 trois degr\'e9s d'ici la fin du si\'e8cle, \'e0 moins que des mesures radicales ne soient prises.La conf\'e9rence aura \£bdes cons\'e9quences assez importantes pour l'humanit\'e9 et pour la mani\'e8re dont nous prendrons soin de notre plan\'e8te\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 M. Kurtyka \'e0 l'Associated Press avant les n\'e9gociations.Les experts conviennent que les objectifs de Paris ne pourront \'eatre atteints qu'en neutralisant compl\'e8tement les \'e9missions de dioxyde de carbone et d£utres gaz \'e0 effet de serre (ce qu'on appelle le \£bnet zero\'bb, en anglais) d'ici 2050.La Commission europ\'e9enne a d£illeurs propos\'e9 mercredi de s£ttaquer \'e0 cet objectif. L'UE devient donc la premi\'e8re grande \'e9conomie \'e0 vouloir atteindre la neutralit\'e9 climatique, mais le but est nettement plus ambitieux que les cibles nationales \'e9nonc\'e9es jusqu'\'e0 pr\'e9sent par les 28 \'c9tats membres.La neutralit\'e9 climatique signifie que toutes les \'e9missions polluantes seraient contr\'e9es par de nouvelles for\'eats ou de nouvelles technologies pour retirer le carbone de l£tmosph\'e8re. Le responsable du climat au sein de l'UE, Miguel Arias Canette, assure qu'on dispose d\'e9j\'e0 des outils pour y parvenir. \£bOn n'invente pas la roue\'bb, a-t-il dit.Il a ensuite reconnu que des investissements consid\'e9rables seront n\'e9cessaires pour sevrer l'\'e9conomie europ\'e9enne des carburants fossiles, et que cela devra se faire d'une mani\'e8re acceptable socialement.L£ccord de Paris laisse les pays fixer leurs propres objectifs en mati\'e8re d'\'e9missions. Certains sont sur la bonne voie, d£utres pas. Globalement, le monde se dirige dans la mauvaise direction.La semaine derni\'e8re, l'Organisation m\'e9t\'e9orologique mondiale (OMM) a d\'e9clar\'e9 que les concentrations moyennes de dioxyde de carbone avaient atteint un nouveau record en 2017, tandis que le niveau d£utres gaz \'e0 effet de serre, tels que le m\'e9thane et l'oxyde nitreux, augmentait.Les \'e9missions anthropiques devraient encore grimper de 2 pour cent cette ann\'e9e, alors que la construction de centrales \'e9lectriques au charbon en Asie et en Afrique se poursuit, tandis que les for\'eats absorbant le carbone sont ras\'e9es plus rapidement qu'elles ne peuvent se r\'e9g\'e9n\'e9rer.\£bTout le monde sait que les plans nationaux, quand on additionne tout \'e7a ensemble, nous m\'e8neront bien au-del\'e0 de trois, potentiellement de quatre degr\'e9s Celsius\'bb, a rappel\'e9 Johan Rockstrom, le nouveau directeur de l'Institut de recherche sur l'impact du climat de Potsdam.\£bNous savons que nous allons dans la mauvaise direction, a-t-il ajout\'e9. Nous devons r\'e9duire les \'e9missions mondiales de carbone au plus tard en 2020, dans deux ans, pour avoir une chance de rester en dessous de 2 degr\'e9s Celsius.\'bbConvaincre les pays de fixer de nouveaux objectifs plus stricts en mati\'e8re de r\'e9duction des \'e9missions d'ici 2020 est un d\'e9fi majeur \'e0 Katowice.Cela entra\'eenera une transformation de tous les secteurs de leurs \'e9conomies, y compris la fin compl\'e8te de la combustion de carburants fossiles.Les pays pauvres veulent que les pays riches promettent les r\'e9ductions les plus importantes au motif qu'ils sont responsables de la plupart des \'e9missions de carbone dans l£tmosph\'e8re. Les pays riches se disent pr\'eats \'e0 montrer le chemin, mais seulement si les pays pauvres jouent \'e9galement leur r\'f4le.\£bIl est \'e9vident que tous les pays ne sont pas au m\'eame stade de d\'e9veloppement, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Lidia Wojtal, du cabinet de conseil berlinois Climatekos et une ancienne n\'e9gociatrice polonaise du climat. Nous devons donc \'e9galement prendre cela en compte et diff\'e9rencier les responsabilit\'e9s. Et c'est une t\'e2che \'e9norme.\'bbParmi les plus susceptibles de faire pression pour l£doption de mesures ambitieuses figurent les petits \'c9tats insulaires, qui sont d\'e9j\'e0 confront\'e9s \'e0 de graves probl\'e8mes li\'e9s aux changements climatiques.Les \'c9tats-Unis, quant \'e0 eux, sont loin d'\'eatre la force motrice qu'ils ont \'e9t\'e9 lors des n\'e9gociations \'e0 Paris sous le pr\'e9sident Barack Obama. Le Br\'e9sil et l'Australie, qui \'e9taient auparavant des partisans fervents de l£ccord, semblent suivre les traces de M. Trump.Certains observateurs craignent que la pens\'e9e nationaliste sur le climat ne d\'e9truise tout espoir de progr\'e8s significatif \'e0 Katowice. D£utres sont plus optimistes.\£bNous verrons bient\'f4t une minorit\'e9 suffisamment grande d'\'e9conomies importantes avancer r\'e9solument dans la bonne direction, a pr\'e9dit M. Rockstrom. Cela peut avoir des effets d'entra\'eenement qui peuvent \'eatre positifs.\'bbLa Pologne pourrait finir par jouer un r\'f4le crucial en rassemblant les parties adverses. Le pays a d\'e9j\'e0 pr\'e9sid\'e9 trois pr\'e9c\'e9dents rounds de n\'e9gociations sur le climat et sa forte d\'e9pendance vis-\'e0-vis du charbon oblige Varsovie \'e0 envisager des mesures rigoureuses dans les ann\'e9es \'e0 venir.La 24e Conf\'e9rence des Parties, ou COP24, se tient sur le site d'une mine de Katowice ferm\'e9e en 1999 apr\'e8s 176 ans de production de charbon. Cinq des sept mines de la ville ont \'e9t\'e9 ferm\'e9es depuis les ann\'e9es 1990, alors que la Pologne \'e9liminait progressivement les subventions de l'\'e8re communiste et passait \'e0 une \'e9conomie de march\'e9.\l"

"COP24","Canada","COP24_Canada139","Les experts sous-estimaient largement la rapidit\'e9 du r\'e9chauffement il y a 25 ans; Changements climatiques: pire que pr\'e9vu","jeudi 29 novembre 2018 05:24 PM EST","La Presse Canadienne","WASHINGTON - Les climatologues ont rat\'e9 des tas de choses il y a environ un quart de si\'e8cle, quand ils ont essay\'e9 de pr\'e9dire l£mpleur de l'impact du r\'e9chauffement climatique.Ils n'ont pas su anticiper l£mpleur des cons\'e9quences des incendies de for\'eat, des s\'e9cheresses, des averses et des ouragans. Ils ont \'e9chou\'e9 \'e0 pr\'e9dire \'e0 quel point les calottes glaciaires de l'Antarctique occidental et du Groenland fondraient et contribueraient \'e0 l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer. Ils ont rat\'e9 une grande partie de la myriade de probl\'e8mes de sant\'e9 publique et de s\'e9curit\'e9 mondiale.Les scientifiques disent maintenant que le r\'e9chauffement climatique est plus rapide, plus \'e9tendu et tout simplement... pire que ce qui \'e9tait anticip\'e9.Les n\'e9gociateurs internationaux se r\'e9uniront la semaine prochaine en Pologne pour discuter d'un renforcement de la lutte aux changements climatiques dans le cadre de la conf\'e9rence COP24. La compr\'e9hension que nous avons du r\'e9chauffement de la plan\'e8te a consid\'e9rablement \'e9volu\'e9 depuis la premi\'e8re conf\'e9rence en mars 1995. Depuis ce moment, le monde s'est r\'e9chauff\'e9 en moyenne d'environ 0,41 degr\'e9 Celsius, mais l'histoire est bien plus complexe que \'e7a.L£ugmentation annuelle de la temp\'e9rature mondiale est l\'e9g\'e8rement inf\'e9rieure \'e0 certaines pr\'e9visions du d\'e9but des ann\'e9es 1990. Pourtant, plus d'une douzaine de climatologues ont d\'e9clar\'e9 \'e0 l'Associated Press que, priv\'e9s des donn\'e9es actuellement disponibles et d'une compr\'e9hension am\'e9lior\'e9e du climat, les chercheurs d'il y a plusieurs d\'e9cennies \'e9taient trop conservateurs et ne pouvaient pas se rendre compte de l'impact du r\'e9chauffement climatique sur la vie quotidienne.Une \'e9tude scientifique r\'e9alis\'e9e ce mois-ci a montr\'e9 combien de fois - directement et indirectement - le r\'e9chauffement avait d\'e9j\'e0 transform\'e9 la Terre et la soci\'e9t\'e9. Le total \'e9tait de 467.Dans les ann\'e9es 1990, lorsque les scientifiques parlaient de r\'e9chauffement, ils se concentraient sur la temp\'e9rature moyenne annuelle mondiale et l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer. Le probl\'e8me est que les gens n'habitent pas toute la surface du globe et ne ressentent pas de temp\'e9ratures moyennes. Ils ressentent les ph\'e9nom\'e8nes extr\'eames - chaleur, pluie, s\'e9cheresse - qui les frappent chez eux un jour ou une semaine, a expliqu\'e9 Richard Alley, un climatologue de l'universit\'e9 Penn State.\£bLes jeunes g\'e9n\'e9rations grandissent l\'e0 o\'f9 il n'y a pas de normalit\'e9\'bb, a dit Kristie Ebi, une scientifique en climatologie et sant\'e9 publique \'e0 l'Universit\'e9 de Washington, soulignant que durant 406 mois cons\'e9cutifs, le monde \'e9tait plus chaud que la moyenne du 20e si\'e8cle.Plus r\'e9cemment, des \'e9conomistes se sont joints \'e0 des scientifiques pour pr\'e9voir un avenir co\'fbteux. William Nordhaus, \'e9conomiste \'e0 Yale et r\'e9cipiendaire du prix Nobel d'\'e9conomie 2018 pour ses travaux sur les changements climatiques et d£utres probl\'e8mes environnementaux, a d\'e9clar\'e9 \'e0 l'Associated Press que, selon ses calculs, les changements climatiques co\'fbteront 4000 milliards $ US par an \'e0 la fin du si\'e8cle aux \'c9tats-Unis, en tenant compte d'une projection raisonnable du r\'e9chauffement.Des cons\'e9quences observables par tout un chacun\'c0 l'\'e9poque, Michael Mann \'e9tait un \'e9tudiant dipl\'f4m\'e9 qui explorait le r\'e9chauffement climatique.\£bHonn\'eatement, je ne pensais pas que, \'e0 la mi-carri\'e8re, nous verrions les cons\'e9quences des changements climatiques \'e0 la t\'e9l\'e9vision\'bb, ni qu'elles seraient aussi fortes, a d\'e9clar\'e9 M. Mann, actuellement un sp\'e9cialiste du climat \'e0 l'universit\'e9 Penn State. Cela se traduit par des incendies de for\'eat, des ouragans accompagn\'e9s de pluies diluviennes, des inondations, des s\'e9cheresses, des vagues de chaleur et d£utres ph\'e9nom\'e8nes m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames, a-t-il ajout\'e9.Les scientifiques comprennent maintenant mieux comment les fluctuations des courants atmosph\'e9riques - tels que le courant-jet - et le cycle de la pluie peuvent provoquer des conditions m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames. Et des recherches r\'e9centes montrent comment les changements climatiques modifient ces facteurs naturels.Un lien direct avec l£ctivit\'e9 humaineLe plus grand changement dans la science au cours du dernier quart de si\'e8cle est que \£bnous pouvons maintenant attribuer les changements des temp\'e9ratures mondiales et m\'eame certains \'e9v\'e9nements extr\'eames \'e0 l£ctivit\'e9 humaine\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Sir Robert Watson, un ancien climatologue de la NASA et le Britannique qui a pr\'e9sid\'e9 le Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'\'e9volution du climat de l'ONU de 1997 \'e0 2002.Avec des connaissances et des outils am\'e9lior\'e9s, les scientifiques peuvent mieux comprendre les ph\'e9nom\'e8nes m\'e9t\'e9orologiques extr\'eames tels que les ouragans et les s\'e9cheresses, et effectuer des simulations informatiques complexes attribuant les ph\'e9nom\'e8nes extr\'eames au r\'e9chauffement provoqu\'e9 par la combustion du charbon, du p\'e9trole et du gaz naturel, a pr\'e9cis\'e9 M. Watson.Les scientifiques attribuent les \'e9v\'e9nements extr\'eames au r\'e9chauffement provoqu\'e9 par l'homme en comparant ce qui s'est pass\'e9 dans la vie r\'e9elle \'e0 des simulations sans gaz \'e0 effet de serre provenant de combustibles fossiles. Ils ont conclu que les changements climatiques avaient notamment caus\'e9 plus de pluie lors des ouragans Harvey, Maria et Katrina.Des \'e9tudes ont montr\'e9 que les changements climatiques avaient aggrav\'e9 les s\'e9cheresses, les pluies diluviennes et les vagues de chaleur, comme celle de Russie en 2010, qui ont tu\'e9 des milliers de personnes. Et elles ont li\'e9 les changements climatiques \'e0 la quantit\'e9 croissante de terres incendi\'e9es dans l'ouest des \'c9tats-Unis, ce qui n'\'e9tait pas consid\'e9r\'e9 comme un probl\'e8me climatique majeur il y a quelques d\'e9cennies, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Phil Dennison, un sp\'e9cialiste des incendies \'e0 l'universit\'e9 de l'Utah.De la pollution atmosph\'e9rique provoqu\'e9e par les incendies de for\'eat qui a pouss\'e9 les habitants du nord de la Californie \'e0 enfiler des masques respiratoires aux attaques d£sthme de plus en plus fr\'e9quentes qui envoient des enfants \'e0 l'h\'f4pital, les experts m\'e9dicaux pr\'e9viennent que les changements climatiques nuisent \'e0 la sant\'e9.\£bNous avons des surprises, a d\'e9clar\'e9 la professeure de sant\'e9 publique Kristie Ebi. Nous projetons des changements et nous les voyons plus t\'f4t que pr\'e9vu.\'bbCela inclut des moustiques porteurs de maladies autrefois tropicales au Canada et l£rriv\'e9e en Alaska des bact\'e9ries des mollusques et des coquillages des eaux chaudes, a-t-elle illustr\'e9.La docteure Renee Salas, une urgentologue de l'H\'f4pital g\'e9n\'e9ral du Massachusetts qui a \'e9crit un chapitre dans les rapports annuels sur les effets sur la sant\'e9 li\'e9s au climat du journal m\'e9dical Lancet, a rappel\'e9 que ces statistiques n'\'e9taient pas abstraites, mais bien r\'e9elles.\£bQuand j£i d\'fb dire \'e0 une m\'e8re en pleurs que je devais admettre sa fille de quatre ans pour une crise d£sthme, lors de sa quatri\'e8me visite en une semaine, le changement climatique \'e9tait vraiment une de mes pr\'e9occupations parce que je savais que sa maladie \'e9tait due \'e0 la hausse des niveaux de pollen\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 la docteure Salas.Les calottes glaciaires massives de l'Antarctique occidental et du Groenland fondent beaucoup plus rapidement que ne l£vaient imagin\'e9 les scientifiques il y a un quart de si\'e8cle.L'Antarctique a perdu pr\'e8s de 3000 milliards de tonnes de glace depuis 1992, suffisamment pour recouvrir le Texas sur pr\'e8s de quatre m\'e8tres de profondeur, ont annonc\'e9 des scientifiques en juin. Le Groenland a perdu plus de 5000 milliards de tonnes au cours de la m\'eame p\'e9riode.La fonte en Antarctique et au Groenland au cours des derni\'e8res ann\'e9es \£ba litt\'e9ralement doubl\'e9 nos pr\'e9visions concernant l'\'e9l\'e9vation du niveau de la mer \'e0 la fin du si\'e8cle\'bb, a d\'e9clar\'e9 M. Mann, de Penn State.Des chercheurs se disent encore conservateurs dans leurs sc\'e9nariosLes non-experts qui rejettent la science traditionnelle qualifient souvent les scientifiques d'\£balarmistes\'bb, mais la plupart des chercheurs assurent qu'ils ont tendance \'e0 \'e9viter les pires sc\'e9narios. Les scientifiques disent qu'il est dans leur nature d'\'eatre trop conservateurs.Dans presque tous les cas, lorsque les scientifiques ont rat\'e9 la cible, c'\'e9tait davantage parce qu'ils avaient sous-estim\'e9 un probl\'e8me que parce qu'ils l£vaient surestim\'e9, a dit le climatologue britannique Robert Watson.Mais il y a les pires cas possible. Ce sont les points de bascule, apr\'e8s lesquels les changements s£cc\'e9l\'e8rent et on ne peut plus revenir en arri\'e8re. La calotte glaciaire s'effondre. On voit des changements massifs dans la circulation oc\'e9anique. Les extinctions se multiplient \'e0 travers le monde.\£bAu d\'e9but des ann\'e9es 1990, nous n£vions que des indices sur le fait que nous pourrions pousser le syst\'e8me climatique vers des points critiques, a d\'e9clar\'e9 Jonathan Overpeck, le doyen de la Facult\'e9 de l'environnement \'e0 l'Universit\'e9 du Michigan. Nous savons maintenant que nous sommes peut-\'eatre en train d£ssister au d\'e9but d'une extinction massive qui pourrait faire dispara\'eetre jusqu'\'e0 la moiti\'e9 des esp\'e8ces sur Terre.\'bb\l"

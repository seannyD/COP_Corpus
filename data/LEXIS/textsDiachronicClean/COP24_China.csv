In 2014, former US president Barack Obama pledged the US would contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help the poorest countries in the world on combating climate change. In response to some voices calling on China to make up the funding shortfall after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, Li Gao, director-general of the department of climate change at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, noted that the responsibility should rest more with other developed countries. Historically speaking, climate change was caused by the unlimited emissions of developed countries since the Industrial Revolution, he said, ""Therefore those countries should take on more responsibilities,"" Li said. He reaffirmed that China would implement the Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but different responsibilities and respective capabilities.China's carbon dioxide emissions per person are much lower than that of the US, Li noted.China has also been helping developing countries tackle climate change by supplying low-carbon devices and supporting projects that reduce emissions, he said.For many developing countries, the most significant issue was to ensure basic needs including electricity, Li said.""COP24 in Katowice is a remarkable point in the multilateral climate change process,"" Li said. Patricia Espinosa, UN climate change executive secretary, said at a press conference on Saturday in Katowice, ""We're very thankful for the leadership [of China] for clarity and vision in putting sustainability and addressing the climate changing at the center of the agenda.""Against a background of rising unilateralism, the Katowice conference process is more significant, Li noted.""If it fails in Katowice, doubts will emerge about the multilateral climate change process as well as globalization and global governance,"" he said.China has been working hard on promoting the process in negotiations, Li said. The implementation of the Paris Agreement is complicated due to detailed problems and political issues, he said, but many parties are still working positively and constructively.""We have confidence in reaching the goal in Katowice,"" Li said.As of 2017, China had cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 46 percent from the 2005 level, fulfilling its commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 40 to 45 percent from the 2005 level by 2020.

"COP24","China","COP24_China17","If we don't act on climate change, we'll soon be up to our necks in hot water","December 8, 2018 Saturday","Hong Kong Free Press","The boiling frog fable is a well-known metaphor to describe the unwillingness of people to act in the face of gradually approaching threats.Although there appears to be little truth in the legend that a frog will remain in water as the temperature gradually rises to the boiling point, the analogy has taken hold and has been applied to many cases of human resistance to change.The frog metaphor seems particularly apt this week as delegates meet in Poland at the United NationsClimate Change Conference COP 24.Air pollution in Beijing. Photo: Kentaro Iemoto via Flickr.Given the magnitude of the threat to our very existence, one might have expected that these delegates would have devised policies, or at the very least, significant incentives, during the past 23 years of conferences to make a real dent in the rise of atmospheric pollutants, such as carbon dioxide and methane.Alas, it is very unlikely that anyone here in Hong Kong has been forced to alter their lifestyle to the extent that their actions would have made a noticeable reduction in their contribution to factors that lead to global warming.In other words, although efforts such as the climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 are laudable, we observe virtually no change in people\' s behaviour to suggest we have an impending catastrophe the likes of which has never experienced before, and life on the planet itself has experienced only five times in the last few billion years.I speak of the  sixth extinction, a term that has recently entered the vernacular.COP21 participants in the 2015 United Nations in Paris. Photo: Wikicommons.For example, as I enter my workplace, I see students taking the lift to go up or down one or two floors, using a tiny sip of electricity that, here in Hong Kong, is mostly generated by burning fossil fuels.Although I have never asked students about this behaviour and other similar types, such as casually opening a window in summer when the air-conditioning is too cool, or not bringing their own mug to the coffee shop, I feel certain the last thought on their minds is their incremental contribution to climate change and our approaching crisis. At these times, the frog analogy looms large.It also looms large when I observe the local diet, which is largely carnivorous. It is said that the single most effective thing any individual can do to combat global warming is to stop, or at least reduce, their consumption of meat.This is because raising cows, pigs and chickens is such an inefficient way of producing calories, and also because livestock belch prodigious amounts of methane, a damaging greenhouse gas.Instead, on almost every restaurant menu, or on every celebratory occasion, there are meals centred around meat or seafood, with low-carbon-footprint vegetables only as decorations.And let\' s not forget about those air-freighted tomatoes and blueberries in our supermarkets, wrapped in double plastic from distant destinations, that come at a carbon footprint price fifty times greater than produce arriving by sea.Photo: Luca Ricci/Facebook.At the level of society as a whole, our government has shown little interest in the big picture.Sure, there are public service announcements telling us to turn off the lights and avoid overusing the air-conditioner, but such efforts are laughably minuscule in their potential impact compared with the damage done by mega-projects like the just-completed longest sea bridge in the world.I have yet to see any serious mention of the environmental effects from the construction of this bridge.Never mind those few woeful dolphins that are destined for extinction anyway. But rather, pay heed to the unimaginable amounts of concrete and steel that were used in the bridge\' s construction.Converting limestone into cement and forging coke and iron into steel are known to be two of the primary producers of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change.And speaking of big projects, the third runway at the airport presently under construction will end up allowing three times the number of takeoffs and landings that existed when the airport opened a mere 20 years ago.Just for the record, a  fuel-efficient A380 aircraft holds over 300,000 litres of fuel. Even on short-haul flights, each passenger is responsible for the burning of hundreds of litres of fuel.A380 aircraft. Photo: Pixabay.So how can we avoid the worst effects of the sixth extinction that is currently being played out? Action is required at all levels beginning with a dedicated subject on sustainability in schools where students learn how to behave and eat in sustainable ways.But most importantly we need to instil in our youth a mindset of environmental responsibility.However, this is obviously not enough because we know that if Hong Kong is the only place willing to sacrifice economic growth for the sake of the planet \- say by not building runways and bridges \- real change on a planetary scale cannot happen.Somehow, at meetings like COP 24, the authorities need to devise a new strategy that imbues a radical way of thinking among the population of all countries about economic and population growth and the seriousness of our planetary predicament \- a mindset that considers extreme measures such as limits on the number of children a couple can have or taxes on the purchase of meat. Only then can we hope to make real progress.We are now up to our necks in uncomfortably warm 45 degree Celcius water, and the temperature is rising.Paul\~Stapleton\~is an associate professor at the Education University of Hong Kong.\l"

The people of PNG raised banners in both Chinese and English to welcome visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping, extending their thanks to the president for building schools and roads for them. PNG Prime Minister Peter O\' Neill noted that his country couldn\' t have made such rapid development as it is doing today or organized the APEC meeting in such a smooth manner without China\' s help. China\' s contribution to the Asia-Pacific in promoting regional cooperation and common prosperity is obvious to all.  China is the world\' s second largest economy and one of the largest consumer markets. Its economic development has an impact on the future trend of global economy, said PNG\' s Minister for Finance, James Marape. He believes China plays a vital role among APEC members. China has raised a series of proposals and ideas within the APEC framework in recent years that have exerted huge influence on not only APEC, but also other global organizations, Marape underscored. PNG citizens pose for pictures by an advertising board of APEC. Photo from Xinhua News Agency Alan Bollard, APEC Secretariat executive director holds that as a major economy that has a huge influence in the Asia-Pacific region, China has been extensively engaged in APEC activities, playing a significant role in multiple schemes to enhance regional economic integration. As this year marks the 5th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Chinese proposal has become a hot topic among politicians, businessmen and scholars attending the APEC. On Nov. 12, the first day of the APEC week, China and Fiji officially inked a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation within the framework of the BRI. The BRI proposed by China bears an important referential significance, Bollard said, adding that China\' s rich experience in infrastructure and poverty reduction over the last few years has gradually been adopted into regional agenda, contributing to the development of the Asia-Pacific.  China and Japan are respectively the second and third largest economies of the world, and they should jointly take the responsibility to cope with global challenges, said Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono at a recent press conference. To enhance infrastructure and improve regional interconnectivity could become a focus of China-Japan cooperation in the future, he noted, adding that Japan welcomes the cooperation with China that complies to international codes. Climate change is also one of the major topics at the APEC summit.  Pacific island countries attach high importance on climate change, and we will never forget the last year\' s United Nations which concluded with success under the support from China, said chief economic adviser Joseph Veramu to the Prime Minister of Fiji, host of the 23rd United Nations last year. David Morris, Pacific Islands Trade and Investment Commissioner in China highly praised China\' s fulfillment of its obligation in the Paris Agreement, as well as the country\' s efforts to coordinate each country to find the ""biggest common denominator"" for cooperation, saying China has played a leading role in emission reduction.\l"

His first time was in Bonn, Germany in May.""I felt pressure at that time, because I was not familiar with the process. But now I enjoy it,"" Sun said.Born in 1989 in Beijing, Sun finished his PhD studies at the Beijing Normal University two years ago. He then joined the National Climate Center under the China Meteorological Administration.""When I was a student, I always felt climate negotiation was a holy task, as you stand for your country on the international stage,"" he said.He was very relaxed chatting with this reporter at the office of the Chinese delegation, located in a deep corner of the COP24 venue, the Katowice Spodek.He talked fast when mentioning the complex professional jargon used in the negotiations, as well as the articles under negotiation. ""You have to master what you are to negotiate,"" he said.According to Eco Business, 22,771 registered participants are attending COP24, with 13,898 people representing specific parties, 7,331 observers and 1,541 journalists. Guinea has the biggest delegation with 406 members.More than 32,000 people have participated in COP24, said Alexsander Saler, a UN climate change official, during a media conference.There are 91 delegates for China at COP24, according to the provisional list on the UNFCCC's website. The delegation is led by Li Ganjie, minister of ecology and environment, along with Xie Zhanhua, China's special representative on climate change.The delegates are officials and researchers from governmental departments, including the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Science and Technology, together with experts from universities and institutes.The delegates vary in age. The Global Times learned from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment that the delegates were born from the 1950s to the 1990s. Many delegates in the negotiations were born after 1985. More than half of the delegates are women. The youngest was born in 1995, Sun said.To stand for China in international negotiations, the delegates need to make great efforts, even outside the conference. They also have to give up a lot in daily life and work.By December 21, the negotiations are supposed to be finished. However, according to the example from previous conferences, the ending of the negotiations may be delayed because the parties cannot come to an agreement. The delay could be several hours, or even days.During COP24, the Global Times talked to several delegates to find out about their lives as negotiators.Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change Photo: Shan Jie/GTSleep deprivedSeveral new sleeping bags and a row of bottled water were stored in the corner of Chinese delegation office.They are for the negotiators, who work late into the night during the conference.Sometimes the delegates cannot finish work until 2 or 3 am. Sometimes they have no time to sleep.The daily work of Chinese delegates starts early. At 7 am, the negotiators have their first meeting of the day. They must take a shuttle bus to the venue. This year, the journey from the hotel of Chinese delegation to Katowice Spodek takes about 40-50 minutes.The delegates, while on the bus, one by one explain briefly what they had negotiated in the conferences of previous day.Then after arriving at the venue, they check the time and location of negotiations they are responsible for, and prepare for them. By 4 pm, Sun has finished his negotiation work for that day.""The daily negotiation takes four or five hours.

What do you have to say to people who have these concerns?Secretary for the Environment: After the COP 21, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, we saw the Paris Agreement. After that, the Hong Kong Government has set up a high level steering committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, to look after mitigation, that means decarbonisation, and also adaptation and resilience. So you are talking about the adaptation. Under the high level steering committee, we have a working group to look after the infrastructures on how to follow the latest global standards and by making reference to the local situation. It will set the latest up-to-date standards for all infrastructures, including reclamation. Under this mechanism, for whatever kind of major infrastructures and development, no matter it is near the sea or on land, they will have to follow the latest climate adaptation standards.Reporter: What about the impact of this project on marine life? How confident are you that the impact would be minimal?Secretary for the Environment: I don't think it is fair for me to comment on that. We have an established procedure, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). It is a process based on scientific and objective data. It is up to the proponents to collect the data, to put forward the proposal and to decide on how they can minimise the environmental impact. Then they have to go through the (EIA) process, which the proposals can be approved or disapproved. Through the process, there are public involvement opportunities. The public can view the assessment and express their opinions. The duty of the Environment Bureau and also the EPD (Environmental Protection Department) is to diligently administer the EIA process.(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the transcript.)

That report is now in, and the four countries didn't like the implications.The US State Department said the US noted the IPCC report but did not ""welcome"" it, as to do so would be to endorse it. Which is basically saying we can all go to hell in a fossil-fueled handcart, because not even Mother Nature gets to tell this administration what to do.The statement sends a stark message of how difficult it is to get everyone to appreciate that climate change is happening and lifestyle changes are unavoidable, not optional, if runaway global warming is to be prevented.The current US administration's infamous distrust of the scientific findings about climate change means its casual dismissal of the report comes as no real surprise.But while negotiations in the rest of the week are expected to get a lot tougher than previously anticipated, that would be nothing compared with the critical summit ending up without a meaningful consensus on what to do next.Nonparticipation by a few countries may not stop concerned members of the international community from pressing ahead with their own climate response agenda under the framework of the Paris Agreement. Key supporters including China and the European Union have repeatedly stated their respective commitment to what has been agreed upon, and there is a shared sense of urgency about reworking and upgrading growth models and promoting clean energy usage, an urgency that will only become more acute as the reality of the global temperature rise begins to bite.But climate change is a problem way beyond any individual country's capacities. Collective, indeed universal, actions are indispensable if a difference is to be made globally.If this year's UN climate summit fails to achieve a consensus on actions to be taken, much of what countries agreed in Paris risks becoming empty talk.

It approved the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius that will be a key scientific input into the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Poland in December.The report highlighted a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in comparison to 2 degrees Celsius or higher.It examined pathways available to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, what it would take to achieve them and what the consequences could be.The report found that limiting the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require ""rapid and far-reaching"" transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities.The special report was requested by 195 nations when they adopted the Paris Agreement in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the UNFCCC.The report would become a key scientific basis for the COP24 to the UNFCCC, scheduled for December in Poland, according to the IPCC.The IPCC was established by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments about climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Photo: Shan JieChina, the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, has been promoting the building of a market system for the carbon emissions trade, China's special representative said.China pays great attention to using the market mechanism to confront climate change, Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Representative on Climate Change, said on Monday at a side event of the Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland.Since 2011, China has been conducting trials on local carbon trading in seven provinces and cities. By October, the traded emissions quota exceeded 264 million tons in the trial regions, with transactions worth over 6 billion yuan ($860 million), Xie said.The sections and companies in the trial areas have realized a dual reduction in the amount and intensity of carbon emissions, which shows the great effects of using the carbon market to control the emissions of greenhouse gas and gain experience for the future construction of a national carbon emissions trade, he noted.China is also learning from the practices and experience of the overseas carbon market, Xie said.As a market mechanism, the carbon emissions trade could effectively lower the cost on emissions reduction to achieve the goal of controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon market is playing a more significant role in promoting the global governance of climate.The carbon emissions trading system in China includes power generation, the iron and steel production and cement manufacturing sectors in seven provinces and municipalities. Under the scheme, enterprises are assigned emissions quotas, and those producing more than their share of emissions are allowed to buy unused quotas in the market from those that cause less pollution.

Feng Yongbin/China Daily Interconnectivity with Latin American countries high on bilateral talks agenda China and Chile should connect their development strategies and promote interconnectivity between Chile and other Latin American countries, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. Xi made the remark while meeting with Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Pinera is on a five-day state visit and planned to attend the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Premier Li Keqiang also met with him on Wednesday. Xi said Chile is the first South American country to have established diplomatic relations with China, and the first Latin American nation to fully acknowledge China's status as a market-oriented economy. Xi said that Chile, the first Latin American country to have signed a bilateral free trade agreement with China and to have upgraded the agreement, is an important cooperation partner in jointly building the Belt and Road. The two countries should take the opportunity to jointly build the Belt and Road, deepen mutual political trust and pragmatic cooperation and promote the development of the China-Chile comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level, Xi said. The two countries should promote the upgrading of bilateral trade and investment and enhance cooperation in such areas as minerals, clean energy, information technology, e-commerce, innovation and scientific research on the Antarctic, he said. Xi called on the two countries to make joint efforts to celebrate the 50th anniversary of China-Chile diplomatic ties next year and promote people-to-people exchanges. China supports Chile's hosting of the United Nations and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economic leaders' meeting this year, Xi said. Xi added that the two countries should jointly promote the building of the Asia-Pacific free trade zone and maintain the multilateral trading system. He said China and Latin American countries should support each other, make full use of their complementary advantages and achieve win-win cooperation. The two sides should pursue common development and jointly build a community with a shared future for China and Latin America, Xi added. The Chilean president said the Belt and Road Initiative, put forward by Xi, has shown the glorious history of the ancient Silk Road and promoted exchanges between different cultures in the new era. Chile supports the building of the Belt and Road, and it hopes to learn from China's experience in innovative and green development, he said. Pinera said Chile, which is dedicated to maintaining multilateralism and the multilateral trading system, would like to enhance coordination with China on regional and multilateral affairs. With the two presidents as witnesses, China and Chile signed a number of cooperation documents after the talks. According to Chilean Ambassador Luis Schmidt, the two countries on Wednesday secured a deal to open the Chinese market to Chilean pears.

This year, Chinese businessman Wang Shi has been chosen as one of the honorees  for championing the environment  from the cities of China to the farthest reaches of the planet. Wang Shi built China Vanke Group, the organization he founded in 1984, into China\' s largest residential real estate company, now worth $34 billion. But Wang\' s great and lasting accomplishment will likely be his commitment to environmental causes. During his expeditions to Everest, he led cleanup efforts to clear refuse left behind by other climbers. He even participated in an expedition to Antarctica to highlight the effect of climate change on polar ice caps. And he has led China\' s Private Sector Delegation to the United Nations three times and has served as UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador. Wang spearheaded China Vanke\' s sustainable building initiatives by requiring all of its structures to achieve China\' s Green Building Evaluation certification, which requires residential buildings to conserve water, energy, materials, and other resources. This spring, he joined other prominent business leaders at the East-West Philanthropists Summit, where he gave a speech emphasizing the government\' s role in fostering environmental integrity.

Veteran French politician Laurent Fabius, who chaired the 2015 United Nations in Paris, assessed the current situation in the fight against climate change, and mentioned future agricultural methods and carbon pricing in Europe as crucial factors, among others.Fabius said the world ""suffered a major setback"" after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which ""sent a very bad signal"" to other countries.The solution involving carbon pricing was also mentioned by other speakers including Jorma Ollila, former CEO of Nokia and current CEO of steel giant Outokumpu, who said there has not been ""a strong enough price signal"" that high carbon emissions from production would be bad for business.NORDIC PERFORMANCEThe discussions reflected the view that while governments create the framework, citizens and businesses put ideas into practice.Kristin Skogen Lund, director general of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, Finland's major employers' organization and the leading business lobby, assured that businesses will join the efforts ""once they realize there is profit available.""Ollila said that currently only 7 percent of Finnish industrial companies have a strategy that involves climate change matters, but on account of a joint Nordic electricity system, energy efficiency in Finland is at a good level. He also mentioned the steel industry has developed low carbon solutions that are ""miles ahead"" of those of many other countries.Outi Honkatukia, the chief Finnish negotiator for climate change, said Finland was the first country in the world to have a carbon tax, and ""everyone must do more for the cause, and do it faster.""

This would mean that the past four years  2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018  are also the four warmest years in the series, the UN agency said in its provisional report on the state of the climate this year. The  warming trend is obvious and continuing, WMO chief Petteri Taalas told reporters in Geneva.The report shows that the global average temperature for the first 10 months of the year was nearly 1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900). It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it, Taalas warned.With levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, at a record high,  we may see temperature increase of 3-5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, Taalas said.  If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher. Delegations from nearly 200 countries are due in Poland next week for the latest COP24 climate summit, aimed at renewing and building on the Paris deal and limiting global warming.World leaders have been trying to breathe new life into the 195-nation agreement amid backsliding from several nations, most notably the United States, over commitments made when it was signed in December 2015.It is to take effect in 2020 and calls for limiting global warming to less than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. But experts warn that global warming is on track to surpass 3 degrees by 2100 and urge governments to do more than first planned to rein it in. Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life, WMO deputy chief Elena Manaenkova stressed. It makes a difference to economic productivity, food security, and to the resilience of our infrastructure and cities, she said.  It makes a difference to the speed of glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities. \l"

[Photo/Agencies] </figcaption></figure>So the crux of the climate challenge, according to those closely following developments, is straightforward: The diversity of the global community in terms of needs and wants makes it difficult to agree on how to allocate carbon emissions credits fairly.Some countries have asked for more flexibility on cutting emissions, with Brazil pushing for a weaker set of rules on carbon trading. However, opposition from other countries led the discussion to an impasse and just like other technical challenges, negotiators postponed addressing it until next year.The US withdrawal also cast a shadow over the fulfillment of cutting emissions as well as implementing the Paris deal in 2020. But the declining influence of the world's largest economy on climate change also means more countries should strengthen their efforts on the high-profile issue, which, as Li noted, provides China with an opportunity to set a good example.As the world's biggest investor and innovator in renewable industries, China was among the first countries to sign the Paris Agreement, taking leadership in the fight against global warming.""Playing a leading role on climate change, China has ramped up its commitment to cut emissions. And China, in the future, would direct negotiations under its philosophy of fairness and cooperation,"" said Li.Some observers suggest a more optimistic view on the challenge posed by the US federal government's reluctance.Liu Shuang, director of the Low Carbon Economic Growth Program at Energy Foundation China, said that the US withdrawal would not hamper the country's state governments and business organizations to ""go green"". For example, during the Global Climate Action Summit held in San Francisco in September, a group of 29 organizations announced a commitment of $4 billion to combat climate change over the next five years. Similar efforts are being launched locally across America.Despite the politics of coordinating disparate groups to achieve a necessary collective action, large companies should - and many are - taking action against global warming. This includes oil companies and other fossil fuel producers.""Companies should be more responsible and creative, developing and deploying advanced green technologies,"" Ma of the Beijing NGO said.Taken all together, climate watchers said, these combined efforts could have a profound impact when it comes to reversing the planet's warming. If not, they warn, more disasters await.Who knows, perhaps Japan will be able to pick a more positive symbol in the future.\l"

Michal Kustyka, the Polish official presiding over the meeting, sought to provide comfort: ""Every single step forward is a big achievement. You have made 1,000 little steps forward together.""

Organisers explained that the aim was to ""showcase a city and region in need of transition away from its lifeblood"". As attendees discussed the urgent need to eliminate fossil fuels - coal the first among them - by 2050, Poland's President Andrzej Duda was defensive: ""We have coal deposits that will last for 200 years. It would be hard to expect us to give up on it totally."" Poland today generates 80 per cent of its energy from coal, while China generates 60 per cent, and the United States 30 per cent. Against the backdrop of such a daunting transition, wilfully contrarian US representatives ran a highly contentious workshop on a ""realistic and pragmatic"" agenda justifying the continued development of coal. Note that the US is estimated to have the world's largest coal reserves. Commentary: Trump's treatment of Saudi Arabia, and China, shows trade is built on trustThe US was joined by the most unlikely of bedfellows - Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - in refusing to endorse the by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the teeth of alarming consensus warnings from the world's environmental scientists, this blockage meant that the final text of the agreement merely ""recognises"" the role of the IPCC, ""expresses appreciation and gratitude"" to the scientists who produced it, ""welcomes"" its timely completion and ""invites"" nations to ""make use of the information"" it contained. ""A year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world's top scientists should have led to so much more,"" said Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace, speaking the minds for many. ""Instead, governments let people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable."" Before becoming too disconsolate, it is important to recognise some progress at the Katowice meeting. Rules for measuring carbon emissions were agreed and targets confirmed. Progress was also made on how to fund the transition costs of poor, developing countries. China strengthened its commitments. Carbon trading schemes were discussed, though agreement was blocked by Brazil. It is also helpful that so many met in such a blaze of global publicity to talk bluntly about the climate crisis we face. Those ""thousand little steps"" surely count for something. But it is no wonder that Anjana Ahuja, the Financial Times science commentator, complained that ""the international silence was deafening"" following the latest IPCC report. ""Climate change denial, no longer a credible political position, has given way to climate change indifference,"" she wrote. Others in Katowice called this ""apocalypse fatigue"". Commentary: To see how climate change is up close and very personal, look no further than Mangkhut's havocIt is a perplexing puzzle that in the face of such a striking scientific consensus over the extreme and urgent climate threat that we face, so many leaders with fossil fuels at the heart of their economies - from Donald Trump in the US and Australia's Scott Morrison, to Poland's Duda - continue to shrug their shoulders. My sense is that the main crisis here is in the poverty of messaging. Politicians will always ignore the global, when a local issue is biting their heels. They will also ignore future problems when they are awash with present ones. Scientists' abstracted warnings also leave them cold: climate change feels distant and unreal when it is about whether global mean temperatures will be 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees higher, or about sea levels rising 10 centimetres more than previous models, or the melting of the ice cap over Greenland or even the bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The warnings of the awesome, awful consequences of climate change and global warming need to be local and palpable. In Osaka, what politician can be unmoved by the fact that Kansai airport was shut for 17 days after Typhoon Jebi? In North Carolina in the US, seeing 1.7 million people evacuated as Hurricane Florence swept in, and over 500,000 people losing electricity, is a massive political embarrassment. So too, as 375,000 people were evacuated in Florida ahead of Hurricane Michael, with pecan and cotton farmers losing their entire crops, 2 million chickens killed, vegetables worth US$480 million lost, and 3 million acres of commercial timber destroyed. So too, the devastating forest fires across California. Politicians need to see hurricanes, typhoons, floods, droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves killing people and destroying property. Predicting such tragedies in some distant dystopia carries no political heft whatsoever. As closed, it is easy to feel gloomy that so little is being done to tackle the grave and urgent climate challenges that face our communities. That is undoubtedly why for Japan, ""sai"" is the word of the year. But the warnings are now clear and gripping. We need the messaging to drop down from the stratosphere to become relevant to us today and in our local communities. For Hong Kong, Typhoon Mangkhut was just such a message, and as we close on what is expected to be Hong Kong's hottest year on record, how long will it be before our next massive local warning?

They have raised their voices since COP24. They want to see decision makers taking serious measures to reduce CO2 emissions worldwide. They want to have a future,"" Daniel said.Two Swiss teenagers, Sarangan and Selma, both 17 and helping to stamp the postcards at Jungfraujoch, also voiced their calls for people to drive electric cars, which would be better for global warming, and for governments to make new rules and regulations to reduce CO2 emissions.The event's location, the Aletsch glacier, situated at an altitude of more than 3,400 meters, has been a perfect example of climate change impact, Gass said. Stretching over 23 km, the Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais is the longest in Europe, measuring 1.5 km wide on average and 900 meters at its thickest point.Scientific studies in Switzerland have shown that the Aletsch glacier, together with the vast majority of glaciers in central Switzerland, are melting at an ever-quickening pace and could almost disappear by the end of this century. According to the SDC, many of the world's glaciers are shrinking rapidly and will disappear completely in the near future. Enditem\l"
"COP24","China","COP24_China60","Climate Crisis: A Chilling Fate","January 1, 2019 Tuesday","China Pictorial","December 1, 2018: Climate change protesters demonstrate in London before the United Nations is held in Poland. VCGOn December 12, 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus of nearly 200 state parties showing great willingness to work together to protect the common home of humankind. Just three years later, however, the ninth Emission Gap Report released by the UN Environment delivered a jarring wake-up call: Current national emission reduction commitments are far from enough to meet the climate target of 2030. The report also stressed that to achieve the Paris Agreement\' s target of limiting the increase in average global temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, commitments to emission reduction need to be quadrupled from current levels. To limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, efforts would need to increase five-fold.Global carbon emissions continue to increase year by year, and in 2018 the annual growth rate reached an all-time high of 2.7 percent. Global warming is no longer a theoretical prediction by scientists, but a harsh reality. Unusually high temperatures in the Arctic Circle above 30 degrees Celsius have led to the thawing of the permafrost. Near Greenland, the Arctic\' s thickest sheet of sea ice broke up for the first time in thousands of years. And the California wildfires in the United States consumed vast swaths of forests and pastures, resulting in heavy casualties and economic losses.A polar bear prowls a barren landscape on the shores of Hudson Bay, Canada. As the Arctic and sub-Arctic sea ice melts due to global warming, polar bears face long summers without fat reserves from seals. VCGRegardless of how long U.S. President Donald Trump continues to deny the consequences of rising carbon emissions, the irreversible damage to the planet will continue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that the impacts of global warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will lead to devastating climate consequences after 2030. Only 12 years remain for decisive preventative action before the planet becomes a greenhouse by 2030.Another noteworthy development is that although countries that had looked to Washington to promote strong climate agreements remain hesitant, China has shown strong determination to step up to the challenge, emphasizing the cost of carbon emissions and using carbon pricing as an important method of reducing emissions. China has successfully reduced coal consumption for three consecutive years. Through supportive policies, sales of electric vehicles in the country are also growing steadily.In recent years, China has constantly stressed  green development by reducing demand for coal-fired power, expanding the clean energy market and improving the national carbon trading system. Examining root causes and seeking effective solutions, China\' s commitment to promoting global green and low-carbon development and building a community with a shared future for humanity has been recognized by many countries. China will continue to play an important role in South-South cooperation in the field of climate change. In the future, the international community will closely monitor China\' s actions, in the hope that it will contribute Chinese experience, wisdom and fresh approaches to tackling global climate change.But we must keep in mind that the road to green development remains arduous and long. Under the Paris Agreement, no mechanism forces any country to set a specific target by a specific date. As severe consequences of climate change continue to emerge, how to allocate emission reduction tasks and achieve a balance between climate governance and national development is still an important issue that urgently needs to be discussed by all countries. In any case, reduction of carbon emissions has become urgent and imminent. This new report makes it clearer than ever that we\' re in the race of our lives, declared Nathaniel Keohane, senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund.  Our fate and the fate of our children is in our hands. We can make decisions that protect our communities, our children and future generations, or we can pass on a world far different and more damaged than the one we inherited.

This marks the city's lowest density on record since 2013. In addition, there was no severe air pollution caused by human factors, according to the watchdog.Rui Wengang, director of the environmental protection bureau, said: ""We have highlighted the comprehensive application of scientific and technological means to prevent and control the air pollution this winter.""Lanzhou has also resorted to remote monitoring technologies to better implement the prohibition of straw burning, one of the major emission sources of air pollution in towns and villages. It set up a related integrated monitoring platform, through which the supervision departments at the municipal, district, county and village levels can discover on their computers or cell phones those areas where straw burning is taking place almost as soon as it happens, significantly enhancing workplace efficiency.In the city, registered construction sites are now all equipped with onl"

The event, whose theme is  Take Ambition to the Next Level, aims to serve as a launchpad for accelerated action that will enable the world to meet the goals set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It is a golden opportunity to make progress in the effort to combat global warming, but it can be seized only with the involvement of all stakeholders.With the Paris climate agreement, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius  and ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius  above pre-industrial levels. To that end, national governments were tasked with developing their own climate-action plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).But national governments cannot do it alone. Everyone  including those at all levels of government, as well as business leaders, investors, and civil society  must contribute.There is unprecedented global momentum to build a low-carbon, climate-secure future, characterized by a dynamic green economy, a thriving society, and a healthy environment.Globally, renewable power accounted for 70 percent of net additions to power-generating capacity in 2017, according to the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report.Moreover, as part of the Under2 Coalition, over 200 states, regions, and local authorities have committed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80 below 1990 levels by 2050.Urban centers are also proving their capacity for climate innovation and leadership. New York City has mandated the retrofitting of 14,500 of the city\' s most polluting buildings. Shenzhen has become the first city in the world with a fully electric bus fleet. Curitiba, Brazil, has introduced a new model of urban food production. And Oslo has created a climate budget to guide financial decision-making.At the business level, more than 700 companies with a total market capitalization of over US$16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments, according to the We Mean Business Coalition. And 289 investors, holding nearly US$30 trillion in assets, have signed on to Climate 100+, a five-year initiative to engage with the world\' s largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change, curb emissions, and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures.Yet we are far from being in the clear. Scientists agree that global carbon dioxide emissions must reach a turning point in 2020 if we are to achieve carbon neutrality (with emissions low enough to be safely absorbed by forests, soils, and other natural systems) by mid-century.So far, nearly 50 countries have or may have reached their emissions peaks, and more may soon join their ranks. This is progress, but it is not enough.In fact, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are still accumulating at a rate that will soon take us well above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, beyond which some of the worst effects of climate change cannot be staved off. On current trends, average global temperatures could well rise by 3 degrees Celsius, imperiling vital natural systems like coral reefs, rainforests, and the polar regions. All relevant stakeholders need to strengthen their climate commitments.To kick-start that process, the Global Climate Action Summit and its partners have issued a wide array of new challenges, including zero-waste goals in cities, a target of 500 companies adopting science-based targets, and initiatives to accelerate uptake of zero-emission vehicles.Such efforts would not just protect our environment; they would also boost our economies. A recent report by the New Climate Economy suggests that, in transportation alone, a low-carbon transition would create 23 million jobs worldwide annually.Perhaps more important, a show of climate-action ambition from leaders across sectors would likely inspire national governments to increase their own NDCs ahead of this December\' s United Nations in Poland, where governments will finalize the implementation guidel"

A despicable trade war by the US sent shockwaves around globe, but failed to dim the dazzling achievements of China's reform and opening-up. Much of the world still falls under terrorist threat, in contrast with effective measures in China's Xinjiang that eradicate extremism and improve people's livelihood.The Global Times In-Depth correspondents witnessed and covered many of the major issues on the scene, with both close-up vividness and macroscopic analysis.In-Depth reporters excel in portraying a bigger picture and establishing the relevance of either an everyday occurrence or State policies to the broader socio-political situation.They travel across and beyond China, to countries and regions thousands of kilometers away yet still closely connected to China, economically or politically.They reach out to the people and feel what the locals desire. Their research becomes true and powerful words to better communicate China to the outside world.Liu Xin on Xinjiang issuesI went to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in late September to report on vocational and educational training centers. During my visit to some training centers in Hotan and Kashi, I was impressed by some female trainees' stories about their previous lives. When extremism went viral in these places, some women were forced to wear a burka, some were beaten by their husbands, and some were abandoned with the man saying talaq three times (a type of instant divorce in Islam), leaving them raising the children alone.I told stories of these women, about their previous life and the current one. They now earn a monthly salary with vocational skills they learned in the centers. They also won the right to lead their own lives.I think that China's Xinjiang is seeking a way to crack down on extremism. This process needs time to verify the results and also needs space to be improved. And I am and will keep paying attention to stories that happen in Xinjiang.Hu Yuwei on China-India military tiesIt was a marvelous and impressive experience for me to report on the ""Hand-in-Hand"" 2018 China-India counter-terrorism exercise in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province.It enabled me to come closer to seeing how two armies understand each other despite a language barrier with gestures, eye contact and shared feelings. I was impressed by the resumed friendship and trust between the two after the border stand-off in 2017. The carefully prepared evening party after the training was full of joy and camaraderie. Many Indian soldiers greeted this reporter in Chinese and expressed their gratitude. As a Chinese reporter, this is probably the best end-of-the-year gift - to see Chinese and Indian military forces repair their relationship. I look forward to hearing more good news about China-India cooperation next year.Shan Jie on climate changeI was in Katowice, Poland, for two weeks on my own covering the UN COP24 climate change conference this December.I spent a lot of time with the Chinese delegation during the conference, observing the members working. Many of the delegates were very young, born after 1985, but they are veterans in climate change negotiations with years of experience. They told me that it is a holy task to represent China on an international stage. In the intensive negotiations, they were under great pressure and had little time to rest. So I felt empathy when I saw their relieved smile after the COP24 president announced the adoption of the implementation plan for of the Paris agreement. It is a step toward humans saving our future, and these Chinese young people have played a key role in the process. The COP24 is the longest reporting task I have ever undertaken. It was tiring, challenging yet meaningful.Zhang Dan on trade friction As a novice journalist, one of the most impressive stories I did this year was about the soybeans grown by a Chinese company in Russia's Far East amid the China-US trade friction.China's Heilongjiang Province is dubbed the country's granary. Hence it will definitely support China's soybean supply under the current circumstance. Smart Chinese businessmen came up with the idea of growing soybeans in Russia's Far East so that the border areas of both countries could enjoy a revival. Local Russian farmers and Chinese farmers were both glad to see the agricultural cooperation between the two countries. From another perspective, the trade friction brought both sides of the border opportunities. Sometimes, the people who I interviewed and the places I have been take me to a new world. That's where I found the fun part of journalism. Zhang Yu on China-Vatican relationsOver the past year, I witnessed new breakthroughs in China-Vatican relations. As a reporter who has covered the beat for years, it was really exciting to see China and the Holy See finally signing a provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops in September. Although the agreement is just a start, changes have already taken place. In some dioceses, the former ""underground"" church has already merged with the State-sanctioned church as churchgoers pray together in Sunday masses. I expect to see more of these changes in the year to come.Li Lei on reform, opening-upWith a mission of reporting changes to the Three Gorges over the past two decades, my priority was to interview people who had been to the place 20 years ago.In a caf\'e9 of the cruise ship we took, David Swanson, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, who had travelled to China seven times, told me stories of his first trip there while sipping a beer. In his stories, there are shabby houses along the two banks and poor children begging for money from tourists with a long stick with a basket on an end.Twenty years later, outside the porthole of the gorgeous cruise are many modern cities and confident people benefiting from China's reform and opening-up.On the last day of the voyage, we arrived at the Three Gorges Dam which has been controversial since its establishment.

"COP24","China","COP24_China80","Rediscovering the promise of nuclear power","June 27, 2018 Wednesday","Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)","At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, world leaders at last seemed to recognize the reality of climate change. But the response they are pursuing is fundamentally flawed, given its dependence on  renewable energy sources  such as solar, hydro, and wind power, as well as biofuels  that actually damage nature. Ironically, the world\' s best bet to achieve the Paris agreement\' s goals is to rely on an energy source that is often demonized: nuclear power.Water, wind, and solar power cannot reliably provide energy on the scale required for a modern economy. One kilogram of water behind a dam that is 100 meters high can provide just 1/3,600 kilowatt hours of energy. One kilogram of coal, by contrast, provides about 7 kWh of energy.A hydroelectric scheme would thus have to be enormous to generate the same amount of energy as a coal-fired equivalent, implying high environmental and human costs.Wind has a similar energy density. Even with their large and noisy turbines, offshore wind farms produce, at their peak, as little as nine megawatts per square kilometer. To match a one-gigawatt coal-fired plant requires several hundred turbines. The same goes for solar farms: To be competitive, they must be huge, covering vast areas of hillside and meadow.Yet, even if these massive and environmentally damaging structures were installed, they would be unable to produce enough energy reliably. Articles touting the peak power generation of wind and solar often fail to mention that, for periods that sometimes last many days, they offer little to none. If excess energy could be stored efficiently, the lean periods might be covered; but improvements in battery technology are limited by the laws of chemistry.A recent claim that renewable sources alone could supply all of the United States\' electricity needs has been discredited. To avoid blackouts, fully reliable back-up energy sources must be built and kept on stand-by at a cost attributable to the fluctuating renewables.Some argue that the answer is biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, which benefit from subsidies in some places. But, among renewable-energy options, biofuels have the greatest environmental impact of all, because they require large areas of agricultural land and forest, yet fail to retain the carbon dioxide that nature captures so effectively.Nuclear energy is the one carbon-free energy source without these environmental downsides. In fact, nuclear fuel has 100,000 times the energy density of coal, so that a one-gigawatt nuclear plant would require only 15 hectares of land. Smaller modular plants could blend unobtrusively into the landscape. Moreover, nuclear ores are widespread geographically, and the fuel is easily transported and stockpiled. And a nuclear plant is more resilient to extreme weather than wind or solar plants.Despite these advantages, countries around the world are refusing to invest in new nuclear plants and are even shutting down those that already exist. The reason lies in a lack of understanding of how we are exposed to radiation from nuclear processes every day.Fears of radiationFor three billion years, life has evolved not to be adversely affected by natural radiation from rocks and space. A century ago, Marie Curie received two Nobel Prizes for explaining the physics and chemistry of nuclear physics and radiation, before pioneering the use of high doses of radiation for cancer treatment.Yet, while virtually everyone has a relative or friend who has benefited from radiotherapy, public attitudes toward nuclear energy and radiation never recovered from the shock of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. But the long-term effects of the radiation released by those bombs have been greatly exaggerated.True, up to 200,000 people may have died in the bombings and their immediate aftermath, but that was mainly from the blast and resulting firestorm. Few died of cancer. Indeed, the medical records of survivors indicate an extra 550-850 cancer deaths over 50 years.It did not help that, during the Cold War, politicians and media exploited fear of radiation. Draconian safety regulations were enacted in the 1950s, not because evidence demanded it, but to appease an anxious public whose concerns were exacerbated by the nuclear-arms race between the US and former Soviet Union.In 1986, the nuclear accident at Chernobyl seemed to confirm these fears, though the radiation death toll of that event was just 43. Likewise, although no one died from radiation released by the 2011 accident at Japan\' s Fukushima Daiichi plant, that episode was widely regarded as proof that countries should abandon nuclear power.The world must move beyond radiation phobia and accept more relaxed, evidence-based nuclear regulations.What is required, above all, is the political will to challenge the status quo, in the name of smart and forward-thinking policy choices, and better education of the public. Nuclear power may not be popular today, but it should be tomorrow. It is the best choice for our collective future. We should embrace it.Wade Allison is Emeritus Professor of Physics and Fellow of Keble College at the University of Oxford. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018.

However, he said, many developed countries think more of the money should come from the private sector.Considering the current political situation, it will not be easy to redirect taxes collected in developed countries to developing countries.""So I think that it's going to be important to unlock private sector finance and unlock it to the extent that we're talking about trillions of dollars in investment rather than $100 billion,"" he said.A lot of money is still being invested in the ""old economy"", such as coal and the internal combustion engine, rather than the ""green economy"", including geothermal and solar energies and electric vehicles, Hagelberg said, adding that if the green economy becomes the normal economy, ""then suddenly there will be a lot of money available"".""In many countries, the investment in climate in general is not easy,"" he said. ""It needs to be made easier.""Governments need to draft policies that can give long-term certainty and direction for the private investor - for example, making it compulsory for companies to buy renewable energy at a fixed price.Hagelberg said governments should draft policies under the principles of transparency, longevity and credibility.""They need to be transparent so that everybody has a fair understanding of them, and that the rules are the same for everybody,"" he said.Hagelberg said China is at the center of the negotiations in Katowice, as the country accounts for more than 20 percent of global emissions.""The progress that China can advance will help the whole of the negotiations move forward,"" he said.Despite high emissions in China, there has been progress: About 2.2 percent of cars currently sold in the country are electric ones.

"COP24","China","COP24_China88","Negotiators reach deal to keep Paris pact alive","December 17, 2018 Monday","Shenzhen Daily","DIPLOMATS from nearly 200 countries reached a deal Saturday to keep the Paris climate agreement alive by adopting a detailed set of rules to implement the pact. The deal, struck after an all-night bargaining session, will ultimately require every country in the world to follow a uniform set of standards for measuring their planet-warming emissions and tracking their climate policies. And it calls on countries to step up their plans to cut emissions ahead of another round of talks in 2020. It also calls on richer countries to be clearer about the aid they intend to offer to help poorer nations install more clean energy or build resilience against natural disasters. And it builds a process in which countries that are struggling to meet their emissions goals can get help in getting back on track. The United States agreed to the deal despite President Trump\' s vow to abandon the Paris Agreement. Diplomats and climate change activists said they hoped that fact would make it easier for the administration to change its mind and stay in the Paris Agreement, or for a future president to embrace the accord once again. The United States cannot formally withdraw from the agreement until late 2020. Many of the attendees at this year\' s United Nations climate talks  known as COP24, shorthand for their formal name  expressed disappointment at what they saw as half measures to deal with a mounting climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising around the world, and millions of people are facing increased risks from severe droughts, floods and wildfires. But supporters of the deal reached Saturday said that they hoped the new rules would help build a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation among countries, at a time when global politics seems increasingly fractured.  Particularly given the broader geopolitical context, this is a pretty solid outcome, said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.  It delivers what we need to get the Paris Agreement off the ground.  The fundamentals are in place, Mr. Diringer added. Not every country got what it wanted at the meeting, which had been scheduled to end Friday. Developing nations were hoping for more robust promises on climate aid, but that issue has been postponed for future talks. The negotiations over the Paris rule book, often dense and technical, were frequently bogged down by sharp political disputes inside the saucer-shaped convention center in Katowice, at the heart of Poland\' s coal country.(SD-Agencies)\l"

Leaders from at-risk nations such as Fiji, Nigeria and Nepal are due to plead their case at the COP24 climate talks, which aim to flesh out the promises agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord.But host Poland, heavily reliant on energy from coal, will push its own agenda  a  just transition from fossil fuels that critics say could allow it to continue polluting for decades.Nor are any of the world\' s largest emitters represented at the highest level in Poland.The Paris deal saw nations agree to limit global temperature rises to below 2 degrees Celsius and under 1.5 degrees if possible.Officials from nearly 200 countries now have two weeks to finalize how those goals work in practice.One of the key disputes is finance. Under Paris, richer nations  responsible for the majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions  are expected to contribute funding that developing nations can access to make their economies greener.But US President Donald Trump\' s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord has dented trust among vulnerable nations, who fear there is not enough cash to help them adapt to our heating planet.The World Bank yesterday announced US$200 billion in climate action investment for 2021-25  a major shot in the arm for green initiatives but one which needs bolstering by state funding. The background to yesterday\' s summit could hardly be bleaker: with just 1 degree Celsius of warming so far, Earth is bombarded with raging wildfires, widespread crop failures and super-storms exacerbated by rising sea levels.The United Nations own expert climate panel in October issued its starkest warning to date. To have any hope of reaching the 1.5 degrees goal by the end of the century, it said emissions from fossil fuel use must be halved by 2030.As Poland pushed the continued use of coal, it fell to the president of Nauru, a Pacific island nation that is critically threatened by rising sea-levels, to point out the most obvious barrier to climate action: fossil fuel use.Baron Divavesi Waqa said the Paris agreement  doesn\' t radically disrupt the fossil fuel industry ... these powerful interests emerged from Paris unscathed and we ignore that reality at our peril. \l"

Developed countries are responsible for the vast majority of historic emissions, and many became remarkably wealthy burning fossil fuels, said Amjad Abdulla, the head of a negotiating bloc of small island states. Yet, we face devastating climate impacts and some of us could be lost forever to rising seas without progress on the Paris deal by the end of the year, he added.The Paris deal, struck in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius and to below 1.5 degrees if possible by the end of the century.To do this, countries agreed to a set of promises, including to establish an annual US$100 billion fund to help developing nations react to our heating planet.But the details of the final rule book are subject to intense debate.The US and other developed economies want less oversight on how their funding is gathered and more flexibility over how future finance is structured.But developing nations insist they need predictable and open funding in order to effectively plan their fight against the fallout from climate change.A senior climate negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US and rich nations were asking poorer ones to trust them to self-regulate climate financing. We want to do our bit, but how can we trust them? Show us the money, the negotiator said.Delegates ended talks yesterday with an agreement to hand over technical discussions to a panel of experts, who will continue to meet before the COP24 kicks off in Katowice, Poland, at the start of December.Patricia Espinosa, the UN\' s climate change secretary, told reporters that progress had been made in Bangkok  on most issues but that  no issues have been fully resolved yet. The issue of climate finance was  very difficult and politically sensitive, she added.  For Katowice to be successful, work needs to speed up and political will needs to be intensified.

The 30-member IEA, founded in 1974 in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil crisis, includes 22 European countries, Japan, the United States and Canada. China joined the Paris-based group in 2015, as one of its eight association countries. The IEA's mission is to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its member countries and beyond. Birol says the IEA is closely watching this year's UN climate change conference, which is taking place in the Polish city of Katowice from Dec 2 to 14. He says he hopes the international community will take rapid action to avoid climate catastrophe. ""When governments make decisions on energy, they have to think about it in terms of affordability - the energy price will have an impact on economic growth and consumers' pockets, employment and the environment footprint. We have to look at all of these issues together,"" he says. Birol points out that the energy sector has a crucial role to play in combating climate change, and all nations must recognize that their policies on energy transition will have significant impacts on the shared future. Before taking over as executive director in 2015, Birol had served IEA for two decades as chief economist and director of global energy economics, responsible for the organization's World Energy Outlook publication. The 60-year-old energy expert founded and chaired the IEA Energy Business Council, which provides a forum for cooperation between the energy industry and policymakers. Apart from his role at the institution, he is also the chairman of the World Economic Forum's energy advisory board and a member of the UN secretary-general's High-Level Group on Sustainable Energy for All.

""I'm a father and it's kind of crucial that she will have a decent life.""Marchers gathered in one of Katowice's main squares before setting off for the conference center where delegates from almost 200 countries are haggling over the fine print of the 2015 Paris accord to fight climate change.Some protesters were dressed as endangered orangutans while others wore breathing masks to highlight the air pollution in Katowice, which lies at the heart of Poland's coal mining region of Silesia. A group wearing polar bear costumes was expelled from the march after suggesting that fossil fuels should be replaced by nuclear power, a technology that many environmentalists object to.The ""March for the Climate"" passed largely peacefully, though three people were detained after a small scuffle with police, a Katowice police spokeswoman said.Earlier on Saturday, environmental groups had complained that some of their activists were being turned back at the Polish border or deported. One Belgian activist was allowed to enter the country after her country's ambassador intervened with Polish authorities.Poland has introduced identity checks ahead of the conference, arguing they were needed for security.Inside the UN meeting, negotiators were concluding the first week of talks, which are focused on finalizing the Paris rulebook that determines how signatories to the 2015 deal record and report their greenhouse gas emissions.In a recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said drastic action would be needed to achieve the Paris accord's most ambitious target of keeping global warming below 1.5 C.Illustrating the sensitivity of this message for some governments, major oil exporting countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia objected to ""welcoming"" the IPCC's report. The issue is now one of several that will be left to government ministers.Strong signalEnvironmental groups want countries to send a strong signal that they're ready for more ambitious action in the years ahead, but some protesters felt that governments alone would not do enough to fight climate change.US President Donald Trump, who has announced he's pulling the US out of the agreement, claimed on Saturday that ""people do not want to pay large sums of money... in order to maybe protect the environment"".Economists say the price of curbing climate change is actually far lower than the eventual cost of coping with the catastrophic famines, storms and sea level rises that will happen with a warming climate.Associated Press\l"

Speaking in Hong Kong the 63-year-old novelist explained that he had gradually stepped away from the Nobel spotlight and learned to largely ignore the public's high expectations, comparing himself to an athlete who needs to unwind to perform well in a major competition. ""Some athletes perform well in regular races, but they can't compete at their best during international sport events, such as the Olympics,"" he said. ""To some degree, it also applies to writers. When you are under lots of pressure and demand more from yourself, it's not good for writing."" After a five-year hiatus, Mo started publishing some short stories and poems in Chinese literature magazines late last year, although most of these works had been written before he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 and he only recently polished them up for publication. Mo is the only Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize for literature. Gao Xingjian, who was born in Ganzhou, Jiangxi province, in 1940, won the prize in 2000, three years after becoming a French citizen. ""During the first two years after [the award], there were so many invitations that even if I picked one out of 10 I was still fully occupied,"" Mo said. ""Over the past two years, I feel I have paid back most of the favours that I owed my friends ... so now I have more time for myself and my writing."" These days he usually spends the morning reading, before sparing some time in the afternoon for catching up with friends and the news, and then devotes two hours in the evening - usually between 8pm and 10pm - to writing. HYPERLINK http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2089799/why-writer-mo-yan-thinks-his-nobel-prize-was-blessing-and-curseWhy writer Mo Yan thinks his Nobel Prize was a blessing and a curseBut until recently he had many more demands on his time. In March, he became one of the most high-profile figures to stand down as one of the delegates to the annual Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. He had been nominated for the position in 2013 by the Chinese National Academy of Arts, something he later described as a responsibility rather than an honour. During his five-year tenure, Mo delivered proposals for improving preschool education in rural areas, shortening the school year and increasing subsidies for families that lost their only child. But the post brought with it long hours spent in meetings, as well as researching and drafting proposals, along with a bombardment of media interviews. ""My body simply cannot handle that amount of work. So I suggested not being elected for another tenure,"" Mo said. ""Besides, I want to focus more on my writing.""

But now Mo says: ""My teaser is as untrustworthy as county-level weather report. The novel is not done. New material keeps coming."" Critics have often portrayed Mo as a writer ""inside the establishment""- he has been the deputy chairman of the Communist Party-affiliated China Writers Association since 2011, an organisation often lambasted for being too close to the government. In a 2013 interview with the South China Morning Post, Mo argued that censorship gave writers the motivation to challenge topics seen as taboos and described the 1980s as a golden period for literature when writers dared to confront forbidden topics creatively. HYPERLINK http://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2144693/nobel-literature-prize-suspended-due-fallout-sexual-assaultNobel Literature Prize suspended due to fallout from sexual assault scandalBut recently he has become more discreet about issues such as censorship and ideological control, both of which have tightened since President Xi Jinping came to power. Mo defended his position in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel and said he was writing on behalf of the people, not the party. HYPERLINK http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1310577/censorship-has-spurred-writers-says-nobel-prize-winner-mo-yanCensorship has spurred writers, says Nobel Prize winner Mo YanHowever, he drew heavy criticism in 2013 when he compared China's censorship regime to an airport security check and again in 2016 when he praised Xi, who likes revealing his latest reading lists through state media, as ""a prolific reader, someone with sophisticated taste for art, an expert"" and ""a leader of our thoughts"". When asked if he had witnessed any changes in the environment on the mainland, Mo answered: ""I can only speak for myself ... I feel I am still following my old writing style. And the topics as well as the people in my works also keep pace with times. There are historical figures, my memory of history, and people's lives that are happening and changing."" While he does not follow Hong Kong news closely, he said the Hongkongers who felt only a loose attachment to the mainland only represent a small group and he did not worry about relations between the two, adding: ""History won't backtrack"".

The award, named after the gambling and entertainment mogul Lui Che-woo, grants prizes of HK$20 million (US$2.5 million) in three categories: sustainable development, improving people's welfare and promoting ""positive energy"". This year the prize in the third category will focus on people or groups who have worked to tackle illiteracy, a topic Mo feels particularly strongly about. He said it reminded him of people from his parents' generation who did not know how to read and wrote and also brought back memories of his childhood, when as a primary school student he was mobilised to teach illiterate farmers. Past winners of the prize include Xie Zhenhua, head of the Chinese delegation to the United NationsClimate Change Conference, China's ""father of hybrid rice"" Yuan Longping, former US president Jimmy Carter, the International Paralympic Committee, Seattle-based NGO Landesa Rural Development Institute and medical humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres. Mo said the award, now in its third year, was a big prize ""not only because of its unprecedented cash awards, but also because it sets a high bar and covers a wide array of fields, with a focus on issues influencing mankind"". He said the success of the Nobel Prize is partly down to its 100-year history and widespread public engagement, but believed the newcomer can achieve a similar level of influence. ""We have studied the selection process and style of almost every prestigious award around the world ... I believe it will become an international prize that attracts global attention,"" he said.

"COP24","China","COP24_China112","Four reasons Hong Kong businesses should be taking more interest in local bogs and birds","February 14, 2019 Thursday","South China Morning Post.com","World Wetlands Day was celebrated earlier this month. However, not many people in Hong Kong realise that wetlands, freshwater or inter-tidal, cover about 5 per cent of our land area. Our Mai Po marshes and Inner Deep Bay area are listed as a Ramsar Site, a wetland of international importance, and are located on the fringe of the Indo-Burma Hotspot, one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. But urbanisation and unsustainable consumption are affecting the delicate relationship between human beings and the environment. Our compact city is characterised by densely built-up areas. Fortunately, though, 40 per cent of our terrain is reserved for country park use and the government has spelled out the direction of the city's conservation efforts in a HYPERLINK https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/Con_hkbsap/files/HKBSAP_ENG_2.pdfBiodiversity and Sustainability Action Plan. Businesses can play a role in protecting Hong Kong's biodiversity. Studies worldwide have highlighted the economic value of preserving natural resources, from local livelihood support to tourism income. But the intrinsic benefit lies in ""shared value"", a business concept coined by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School. They propose that a company's competitiveness and the health of the communities and natural environment around it are mutually dependent. At first glance, there may not seem to be any connection between wetlands and businesses. However, there are four reasons businesses should be taking an interest in Hong Kong's marshes. First, wetlands are an important factor in mitigating climate change. Trees and vegetation capture carbon dioxide and the root networks in wetlands stabilise the soil structure while absorbing water and acting as a means of flood control. Coastal wetlands are an important protection against extreme weather events such as HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2164262/how-climate-change-could-cause-more-mega-storms-super-typhoontyphoons. There are not many ways for mankind to limit the rise in global temperature to HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2167399/landmark-un-climate-report-flags-life-or-death-warning-doubts1.5 degrees Celsius HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2176097/cop24-climate-talks-poland-start-grim-warning-humankindCOP24 summit in Poland. Carbon intensity levels may stabilise by 2030 for large emitters like China but we have a long way to go to reduce total emissions by 29 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by then to meet the goal of restricting global warming. Reforestation is an option but will take decades to be effective. It is therefore in the interest of businesses to retain natural resources like wetlands, which can act as vast carbon sinks. Imagine Mai Po multiplied several thousand times over in the reaches of mighty river basins and coastal deltas across the world. HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/2182727/hong-kongs-mai-po-wetlands-kept-strong-buffer-areasHigh-density development near Mai Po must be resistedFor governments to act on this initiative requires corporate support. Businesses that believe climate change will not affect them need to think twice as severe weather can bring not just direct damage to property and assets but also commercial losses due to disrupted supply chains. Second, companies could learn a lot from nature. Biomimicry involves focusing on techniques that have evolved over centuries in nature and deploying them in modern applications. There is too much emphasis placed on technology and finding man-made solutions to our problems when often the answer is staring us in the face. Take solar cells, for instance. The best advancements in photovoltaics can only muster a conversion efficiency of sunlight to electricity of around 25 per cent. Plants have been converting sunlight into useful biomass since the beginning of time through photosynthesis. Similarly, water-resistant materials and\~camouflage coatings have been developed taking a cue from duck feathers and chameleons respectively. The sources of inspiration for innovation abound in biodiverse settings like wetlands.

White willow, a riverine plant, is a source of salicylic acid, is used in aspirin and skin care products, while bogbean, a species that thrives at high latitudes in bogs and shallow water, is commercially approved in Germany to treat upper abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite. Labrador tea, a widespread bog bush, has many health benefits and is also a mosquito repellent. Such species are best cultivated in the wild than grown on farms. The unique conditions of wetlands allow this. Finally, visits to wetlands are powerful tension relievers, especially for those living in a fast and high-pressured urban setting like Hong Kong.

While Mai Po may not match the glamour of a safari or ski resort, it provides a huge opportunity to foster a more caring and considerate corporate culture.

Companies can play a major part in this - and the business rationale for doing so exists. If a bustling centre like Hong Kong, where commerce and trade dominates, could spend the time and effort to preserve nature and safeguard the survival and restoration of species, the powerful message it would send to the world would be that others can, too.

UNEP's 2018 report indicated that global emissions have reached historic levels.Total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including from land-use change, reached a record high of 53.5 Gigatons (Gt) in 2017, an increase of 0.7 Gt compared with 2016.""In contrast, global GHG emissions in 2030 need to be approximately 25 percent and 55 percent lower than in 2017 to put the world on a least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius and 1.5 degrees respectively,"" said the report.What's worse, the report noted that there is no sign of reversal of this trend and that only 57 countries (representing 60 percent of global emissions) are on track to bridge their ""emissions gap"" - meaning ""the gap between where we are likely to be and where we need to be.""The authors of the report noted that nations would need to triple their efforts on climate action without further delay, in order to meet the two-degree-rise limit by mid-century.The report offered concrete ways for governments to bridge their emissions gap, including through fiscal policy, innovative technology, non-state and subnational action, and more.This ninth UNEP emissions report was prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information.

At the UN Biodiversity Conference 2018 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 13-29, senior delegates warned that urgent leadership is needed if the world is to halt the current wave of extinction, often referred to as the ""sixth mass extinction,"" the Guardian reported. Many of the delegates then pointed to China as a possible leader in the fight to protect biodiversity, as other issues, political and otherwise, continue to distract other nations. Scientists have been warning of the sixth wave for some time. In a sobering report published in the leading US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in July 2017, researchers described the rapid global loss of diversity among species as a ""biological annihilation."" It found that all kinds of species, including mammals, insects and plants, are contracting. The report warns that such is the unprecedented rate of species extinction, it will have ""negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization.""The main causes of these losses, says the report, are habitat destruction, overhunting, toxic pollution, invasion by alien species and climate change. But one of the report's authors, Paul Ehrlich, also warns of the consequences of further biodiversity loss from overpopulation and overconsumption, according to the Guardian.Moreover, the annual WWF Living Planet Report 2018, published in October, found that since 1970, populations of vertebrates have decl"

Every week since December, the seventh-grader has made a pilgrimage to the United Nations Headquarters demanding action on climate change. She is one of a cadre of young, fierce and mostly female activists behind the ""school strikes for climate"" movement. On March 15, with the support of some of the world's biggest environmental groups, tens of thousands of youngsters in at least two dozen countries and nearly 30 American states plan to miss school to protest.

And their message is firm: children are done with waiting for adults to save their world. ""Mom, this is so cool,"" Alexandria says, as she reads the latest list of countries where children have pledged to participate in a global strike: Australia, Thailand, Ghana, France. ""Where is Gir ..., Girona?"" They sit on the couch, still in their pyjamas, and Alexandria pulls out the planner she bought to keep track of all her commitments. Each task is colour-coded by geographic scale: pink for global organising; orange for national; yellow for New York. First on the agenda is an interview with a reporter from Britain, who seems caught off guard by the young woman's fervour. ""My generation is really upset."" The deal struck at COP24, the UN climate meeting in December, was insufficient, she says. ""We're not going to let them [...] hand us down a broken planet."" ""Huh. Right,"" the reporter says. ""Big ambitions."" ""Yeah,"" she replies, confident. Afterwards, she changes into her striking uniform: waterproof ski pants and a down jacket, all in white, just like the congresswomen at the State of the Union and the suffragists of old. She packs her bag - planner, thermos, gloves - and grabs her plastic-encased cardboard signs, which read ""SCHOOL STRIKE 4 CLIMATE"" and ""COP 24 FAILED US."" She holds the signs facing inward so other commuters on the subway can't see them. She doesn't like it when people stare. ""They'll probably think it's just a science project,"" Alexandria tells her mother. Then she laughs. ""Well, technically it is. It's project conservation. Project save the Earth."" It's been four months since Alexandria decided the Earth needed saving. Last year, during a visit to see family in northern California, she was caught in the cloud of smoke from the HYPERLINK https://www.scmp.com/photos/world/2172617/wildfire-rages-northern-californiaCamp Fire, which killed nearly 100 people and filled the air with unbreathable smoke. An asthma sufferer, for days afterwards she felt physically ill and emotionally distraught. ""This isn't normal,"" she thought. ""This isn't right."" She began to look up articles on the American West's historic drought, read reports about global warming, asked her mother, a graduate student in the climate and society programme at Columbia University, to explain the drivers behind rising global temperatures. She joined the New York chapter of Zero Hour, a network of young American climate activists. In December, she watched as international negotiators met in Poland to carve out a plan for curbing carbon emissions. A recent UN report found that humanity has until 2030 - the year Alexandria turns 24 - to achieve ""rapid and far-reaching"" transformation of society if we are to avoid the dire environmental consequences of warming 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Yet the agreement that was ultimately reached fell far short of what scientists say is urgently needed. In the midst of all this, Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old from Sweden, took the podium. ""You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes,"" the girl proclaimed to a room full of stunned adults.

We encourage further collaboration amongst the BRICS countries on a better resourced UN, on its administration and budget, on preserving the UN's Member State-driven character and ensuring better oversight of and strengthening the Organisation.19. We express our support for continued cooperation of BRICS members in areas of mutual interest including through regular exchanges amongst their multilateral Missions.20. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to provide equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, towards the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. We pledge our support for the important role of the United Nations, including the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in coordinating and reviewing global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, to reform the UN Development System with a view to enhancing its capability in supporting member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda.

Similar protests were held in Belgium earlier, when more than 10,000 youngsters skipped school again to demand better protection of the globe's climate.The protests were inspired by Greta Thunberg, who began a solo climate protest by striking every Friday in Sweden in August last year. She was invited to address last year's climate summit (COP24) in Poland, where she accused world leaders of behaving like irresponsible children by not doing enough to address climate problems. Thunberg tweeted she would be attending the World Economic Forum in Davos from January 23 to 25.Other rallies took place elsewhere in Switzerland and Germany. In Berlin, protesters focused on a looming decision about when to end the use of coal, which produces large amounts of greenhouse gases that heat the atmosphere.

We congratulated and supported the Argentine Presidency for G20 in 2018 and expressed our gratitude at the hospitality provided.2.We exchanged views on international political, security and global economic-financial issues, as well as challenges facing sustainable development. We recommit ourselves to a world of peace and stability, the central role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, and respect for international law, the promotion of democracy and the rule of law. We reiterate our commitment to working together to strengthen multilateralism and promote a fair, just, equitable, democratic and representative international order.3.We deplore continued terrorist attacks, including against some BRICS countries. We condemn terrorism in all forms and manifestations, wherever committed and by whom so ever. We urge concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, including all the elements identified in the Johannesburg Declaration.4.We reaffirm our full support for the rules-based multilateral trading system, as embodied in the WTO, to ensure transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive international trade. We express our common readiness to engage in frank and result-oriented discussions with other WTO members with a view to improving the functioning of the WTO.5.The spirit and rules of the WTO run counter to unilateral and protectionist measures. We call on all members to oppose such WTO inconsistent measures, stand by their commitments undertaken in the WTO and rollback such measures of a discriminatory and restrictive nature.6.We support work towards improvement of the WTO with the view to enhance its relevance and effectiveness to address current and future challenges. In this work the core value and fundamental principles of the WTO should be preserved and interests of all WTO members should be reflected, in particular those of the developing members.7.The dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO is essential for its proper functioning. Its effective functioning will give members the required confidence to engage in future negotiating in the WTO. We therefore urge that the Appellate Body selection process be initiated immediately, as an essential prerequisite for the stable and effective functioning of the WTO dispute settlement system.8.We reaffirm our commitment to enhance our communication and cooperation and work jointly and collaboratively with other members to enable the WTO to keep up with the changing times, promote inclusive growth and participation of all countries in international trade and play a meaningful role in global economic governance.9.We welcome the G20 Argentine Presidency's theme of Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development and its focus on the Future of Work, Infrastructure for Development and Food Security for Sustainable Future.11.We advocate for a strong Global Financial Safety Net with an adequately resourced, quota-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) at its centre. To this effect, we reaffirm our commitment to the conclusion of the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula so as to ensure the increased voice of the dynamic emerging and developing economies to reflect their relative contributions to the world economy while protecting the voices of the least developed counties, by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings.12.We reinforce our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals that would provide equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, towards the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. We urge developed countries to honour their ODA commitments fully, in time and to provide additional development resources to developing countries in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.13.The global economic expansion continues, however, it has been less balanced and downside risks have risen. We are concerned that the negative spill-overs by policy normalization from major advanced economies has been an important source of volatility of some emerging market economies witnessed recently. We call on all economies to strengthen their policy dialogue and coordination in the spirit of partnership at the G20 and other fora to prevent potential risks from spreading.14.Regarding Climate Change, we recommit ourselves to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the principles of the UNFCCC including the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and urge developed countries to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to enhance their capability in mitigation and adaptation. We call upon all countries to reach a balanced outcome under the Paris Agreement Work Programme during COP-24 that enables operationalization and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We stress the importance and urgency of conducting a successful and ambitious first replenishment process of the Green Climate Fund.15.We reiterate our warm appreciation to South Africa for the success of the 10th BRICS Summit, Johannesburg, 25-27 July 2018 and recommit ourselves to enhancing further our strategic partnership for the benefit of our peoples. We express satisfaction with the achievements of BRICS cooperation in the areas of economy, peace and security and people-to-people exchanges under South Africa's Chairship, including the establishment of the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR), the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre, the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform and the Americas Regional Office of the New Development Bank in Sao Paulo. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implement the outcomes of the Johannesburg Summit and previous Summits.16.We look forward to the 11th BRICS Summit to be hosted by Brazil in 2019 and extend our full support to Brazil as the incoming BRICS Chair.

"COP24","China","COP24_China128","IN BRIEF (Page 2)","December 7, 2018 Friday","China Daily European Edition","Coffee shop adds royal flavors to Palace Museum The Palace Museum opened a coffee shop for the modern-day guests of Chinese emperors recently - the Corner Tower Cafe - and it quickly became a hot spot for visitors, bringing traditional cultural heritage closer to the younger generation. The decor of the cafe will be altered from time to time based on the themes of the exhibitions in the Palace Museum, says Zhang Yadong, who runs the shop. In addition to drinks and food, the Corner Tower Cafe offers cultural and creative items such as stamps, fans and table mats, all of which have designs related to the museum. Training in Portuguese emphasized by Macao The Macao Special Administrative Region has placed ""unprecedented"" importance on encouraging people to learn Portuguese, language and culture scholars say. They added that the efforts by Macao are one answer to the country's call for the SAR to become a commercial and trade cooperation service platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Only 0.6 percent of Macao residents speak Portuguese, according to official statistics. The total population of Macao is more than 650,000. Yao Jingming, head of the Department of Portuguese at the University of Macau, says more seats and scholarships have been provided for local students to study Portuguese. Hydropower operator looks to opportunities China Three Gorges Corp, which built and now operates the world's largest hydroelectric power plant-Three Gorges Dam - is looking forward to further cooperation with Portugal to jointly tap the potential of third-party markets. In addition to the 950-megawatt Moray offshore wind project in Scotland that CTGC and Portuguese power company Energias de Portugal will jointly explore, the Beijing-based company said it looks forward to more exploration of third-party markets around the world. The two sides have made significant progress in third-party markets since a strategic partnership was established in 2011. The companies aim to further combine efforts to become a worldwide leader in renewable energy generation. Contributions of 3 to Angkor Wat recognized The Cambodian government awarded honorary medals to three Chinese cultural heritage conservators in Siem Reap on Dec 4 for their outstanding contributions to the protection of Angkor Wat. The three conservators from the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage in Beijing-Xu Yan, Wang Yuanlin and Gu Jun - were leading experts in the China-led renovation of Ta Keo, a 46,000-square-meter temple dating back to the 10th century in Angkor Wat, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Siem Reap. The renovation began in 2010 and was completed earlier this year. Officials fired over English exam scores Several senior officials with the education and examination management authorities in Zhejiang province were punished on Nov 5 after the weighting of scores in the college entrance examination's English test sparked widespread discontent and challenges from examinees and teachers.

The international community has high expectations for this conference. Hopefully, major countries can reach a historic agreement to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees celsius to 2 degrees celsius by the end of the century,\~thereby alleviating global warming and reducing the impact of green house gases on our planet. As many as 40 countries\~have submitted proposals on emission reduction under their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to lowering overall emission of greenhouse gases. That shows the international community is taking the global warming issue very seriously. US President Barack Obama announced his own clean energy proposal last week, pledging to reduce carbon emission from US power plants by one-third in 15 years, as part of the US-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change. The proposal has sparked controversy in the US, with some\~coal miners and power companies vowing to fight him all the way to US Supreme Court, but it's clear Obama is determined to take on the climate change issue. The Republicans, who are against tougher regulations on carbon emission, could be forced to deal with the issue nationally against the Democrats. Among the key topics in COP21 is green finance and related technologies, a new type of financial activity that supports low carbon emission projects. As an international financial hub, Hong Kong should seize the opportunity to play a leading role in developing green finance in Asia. As a legislator, I have been involved in various discussions about environmental affairs in Legco. The accounting profession and environmental protection are in fact closely related. For example, we can use our expertise to carry out value-for-money assessment of green projects and provide oversight of waste management, air quality improvement, energy recycling and conservation projects to make sure taxpayer's money is spent accordingly. Professional accountants can offer companies advice on how to balance profitability, social responsibility and environmental protection by calculating related costs and risks. This will help companies better manage their sustainability initiatives. With the help of professionals, companies can learn how to implement a green procurement policy in a cost effective way or assess the investment value of low-carbon emission projects. Traditional financial statements are gradually giving to way to integrated reporting, known as ESG (environmental, social and governance) disclosure. Integrated reporting not only improves transparency in corporate performance but also encourages\~companies to implement environmentally friendly policies. Producing this new form of company report can lift the\~general standard of service of the accounting profession. This article appeared in the Hong Kong Economic Journal on Aug. 12.

"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong5","LCQ2: Government's Efforts in Addressing Climate Change","November 25, 2015 Wednesday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Nov. 25 -- Following is a question by the Hon Emily Lau and a reply by the Secretary for the Environment, Mr Wong Kam-sing, in the Legislative Council today (November 25): Question: The Secretary for the Environment (the Secretary) will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 (the Climate Conference) to be held in Paris at the end of this month, and the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit will also be held in Paris at the same time. So far, the Secretary has not announced any new emission reduction commitments for Hong Kong and he has merely indicated that he will co-ordinate the efforts within the Government and communicate with the industries concerned after the Climate Conference. There are comments that this stance is not conducive to promoting international and inter-city discussions on addressing climate change. Regarding the Government's efforts in addressing climate change, will the Executive Authorities inform this Council: (1) given that there are a number of issues on the agenda of the Climate Conference, of the issues the discussion of which will be participated by the Secretary, and the major issues of concern of the authorities; whether the Government will pledge to set more stringent carbon reduction targets; if it will, of the details and the implementation date; (2) given that electricity generation and transportation are the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Hong Kong, and the Scheme of Control Agreement (SCA) which regulates the power sector will expire in 2018, whether the Environment Bureau (ENB) has any plans to require the two power companies to shoulder more responsibilities in reducing GHG emissions under the new SCA; if ENB has such plans, of the details; concerning the reduction of GHG emissions from transportation, apart from the emission reduction measures mentioned in the Hong Kong Climate Change Report 2015, whether the Government has made reference to the experience of other regions and conducted studies on introducing other emission reduction measures; if it has, of the details; and (3) given that the C40 Large Cities Climate Leadership Group has organised the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Awards for three successive years since 2013 to commend cities for implementing effective policies relating to climate change (e.g. promoting low-carbon lifestyle and green buildings) and share the experience with other cities, and that Hong Kong, despite being a member of the C40 Steering Committee, was not granted any awards in those three years, whether ENB has reviewed what relevant policy areas improvements on which Hong Kong needs to make, in order to enhance its efforts in addressing climate change? Reply: President, Established in 2005, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is an alliance formed by cities around the world to address climate change. The C40 endeavours to promote member cities' efforts in sustainable development including carbon reduction. As a member city, Hong Kong is also a member of the C40 Steering Committee. The United Nations (UN) adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and have convened the UN Climate Change Conference (COP) on a yearly basis since 1995. The COP serves to report on the implementation of the UNFCCC, adopt resolutions on regulations and conduct discussions about new commitments. The 21st COP ( COP21 ) will be held in Paris, France in December 2015. My reply to the question raised by Hon Emily Lau is as follows: (1) I will attend the C40 Steering Committee Meeting, C40 Forum, etc. to be held in Paris this December. I will also join the national delegation in attending various activities of COP21 including the High-Level Segment, and will conduct and chair a seminar in the COP21 exhibition centre to discuss Hong Kong's strategies for addressing extreme climate risks. We will keep in view the discussions conducted and agreements reached at COP21 , and will study the agreements in detail, particularly the relevant carbon reduction commitments. We will also review our policies in the light of the latest developments worldwide and local circumstances in addressing climate change in the post- COP21 era. As regards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation, we will continue to encourage the use of public transport services and develop a transportation system with railway as the backbone. The ""Railway Development Strategy 2014"" recommends that seven new railway projects be completed in the planning horizon up to 2031. The expanded railway network will cover areas inhabited by about 75 per cent of our total population. We will keep in view and make reference to the experiences of other regions in transport emissions reduction. Furthermore, the Government has been actively promoting the wider use of electrical vehicles (EVs). With no roadside emissions, EVs are more energy-efficient than conventional vehicles and can help reduce GHG emissions.As at end-October 2015, there were over 3000 EVs in Hong Kong, which was a remarkable increase when compared with the figure in end-2010 (less than 100 EVs). We will continue to develop low-carbon public transport, keeping in view and making reference to the relevant experiences of other regions in their transportation systems. (3) The C40 Cities Awards (formerly known as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Awards) encourages healthy competition among cities around the world to step up their efforts in environmental protection.For the C40 Cities Awards this year, over 216 entries from 94 cities, including Hong Kong, were submitted. Most cities including Hong Kong did not win the Awards. Nevertheless, the two entries from Hong Kong have been recognised as among the 100 global best practices in addressing climate change this year.They will be included in the C40 database of best practices, and will also appear in a new publication titled ""Cities100"". The Government of Hong Kong has been actively taking mitigation and adaptation measures to address climate change. The ""Hong Kong Climate Change Report 2015"" published earlier consolidates the efforts of the relevant Government departments. We will continue to review and optimise our policies and actions on carbon reduction in the areas of optimising our fuel mix, maximising energy efficiency, promoting green road transport, using clean fuel for motor vehicles and turning waste to energy. Thank you, President. Source: Hong Kong SAR Government \"

""We expect the momentum from the UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP21 signing of the Paris Agreement scheduled this April to likely motivate additional and repeat issuance of green bonds,"" said Henry Shilling, a Moody's Senior Vice President. ""In this favorable environment, even after more recent bond market headwinds, and assuming a resumption of the growth rates seen in 2012-14, issuance could exceed US$50 billion by a significant margin,"" said Shilling. ""While volume growth in 2015 had slowed to 16%, it had exhibited gains of 158% in 2012; 255% in 2013; and 233% in 2014."" Shilling was speaking on the release of a new Moody's report, ""Issuance Achieves Record Volume in 2015, Could Exceed US$50 billion in 2016."" Moody's said that further support for issuance in 2015 will come from continuing institutional, high net worth and retail investor appetite for green bonds. The rating agency also says that regulatory encouragement to issue and invest in green bonds along with the presence of newly issued guidelines for such bonds in China and India will bolster issuance as well. In particular, China's green bond market could potentially expand more rapidly than internationally designated green bonds in 2016 due to central bank policy support and incentives announced for financial institutions issuers in the form of collateral eligibility, relending and interest subsidies -- terms which are generally not available in other countries. Early in 2016, green bonds from non-financial corporations received a boost with proposed guidelines by the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Looking back on 2015, Moody's notes that 105 distinct issuers came to market with 197 transactions, averaging US$215 million. Of the total of US$42.4 billion issued, financial institutions were the largest single issuer in terms of type of institution, accounting \"

"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong8","Speech by SDEV at Green Council 15th Anniversary Ceremony Cum Hong Kong Green Awards 2015 Presentation Dinner Gala","December 3, 2015 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Dec. 3 -- Following is the speech by the Secretary for Development, Mr Paul Chan, at the Green Council 15th Anniversary Ceremony cum Hong Kong Green Awards 2015 Presentation Dinner Gala this evening (December 3): Dr Leung (Chairperson of the Green Council, Dr Priscilla Leung), Ms Ho (CEO of the Green Council, Ms Linda Ho), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Good evening. It's my pleasure to address you at the Green Council 15th anniversary ceremony and Hong Kong Green Awards 2015 presentation dinner gala. As we enter the month of December, I cannot help but notice that we have yet to experience the cool temperatures of a typical winter. Indeed, I have not put aside my summer clothes, and perhaps some of us will be disappointed in missing out on the chance to wear the latest winter outfits. But of course the disappearing winter is far more serious than a wardrobe choice; it implies that climate change is an imminent challenge for all of us. In this regard, I am grateful for the work of the Green Council in helping in the fight against climate change. Since its establishment in May 2000, the Council has put forward inspiring green incentives for the industrial and commercial sectors to follow. The Council has awarded its Hong Kong Green Label to environmentally qualified plastic products, electrical appliances, construction materials and more to encourage businesses to supply green products. The Hong Kong Green Award is a further recognition of corporations' efforts in green procurement and management practices. Green building is the way forward --------------------------------- I am sure you are aware that today so happens to be Buildings Day, a highlighted feature of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris. Buildings Day tells us that the building and construction sectors can play a key part in fighting climate change. New buildings of today are the existing building stock of tomorrow, and failure to pursue sustainable building would lock in growth of greenhouse gas emissions for decades. Indeed, more than 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are building-related, and emissions could double by 2050 if we do nothing with our buildings. This is why we are pressing for green reforms, not only in terms of international efforts, but also in the development of our nation and also in Hong Kong. International collaborative efforts in Paris As we speak, more than 190 countries at COP21 are hoping to succeed the legally binding Kyoto Protocol with a new agreement which can allow us to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. More than 50,000 participants from governments, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations are discussing possible reform measures to make this goal a reality. In particular, we expect green buildings will be at the top of their agenda. Hong Kong is also a member of the global village, and that is why the Secretary for the Environment is co-ordinating a party of 10 as part of the Chinese delegation at COP21 . As a prelude to COP21 , our nation unveiled its climate pledge in June this year. China will lower carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 per cent by 2030 from the 2005 level, together with a pledge to peak carbon emissions around 2030. This shows our commitments in the global green movement. Green buildings in Hong Kong Back in Hong Kong, we intend to learn from the experiences at COP21 , and put them into practice by adopting green building reforms. This is a step forward to meet our Energy Saving Plan pledge, which targets a 40 per cent reduction in energy intensity by 2025 using 2005 as the base. Allow me to elaborate further on four aspects. First, the Government has taken the lead in promoting green government buildings. To meet this Energy Saving Plan pledge, we will strive to reduce electricity consumption in government buildings by 5 per cent by 2020 using 2014 as the base year, based on a host of measures. New government buildings with construction floor area above 5,000 square metres are to achieve a high grading under recognised green building labelling schemes. We have also extended the maximum payback period for energy efficiency measures for new government buildings from nine years to 12 years. The longer payback period encourages the use of more new and innovative energy efficient features, such as building management systems. With the establishment of the Innovation and Technology Bureau last month, targeted measures will be devised to incentivise private organisations and capital funds to invest in innovation and technology. Indeed, technological advancements of today will bring about developments of tomorrow. I would ask for the support of all corporations here to invest in the future of our city. Second, we strive to extend the life span of existing buildings by turning them to other uses. This is to avoid extensive demolition and reconstruction works. As we all know, the 27-storey Murray Building was where the Development Bureau was situated before it was relocated to the Central Government Offices at Tamar. When Murray Building was vacated in 2012, it was largely retained and subsequently sold for conversion into a hotel, retaining much of its architectural merits and energy efficient features. Three government buildings in Wan Chai, namely Revenue Tower, Wanchai Tower and Immigration Tower, will also have their 10,000 staff relocated to create new Grade A office space. We envision that the towers will not be torn down, which would result in much wastage, and the towers will be refurbished instead to suit future commercial needs. Indeed, retrocommissioning can help improve the energy efficiency of equipment and lighting systems in an existing building. A building upgrade can even help rectify problems that stem from the design and construction stages. The commercial sector has also done its part in green buildings with regard to its developments. Taikoo Place, one of Hong Kong's best-planned business hubs, offering 550,000 square metres of prime commercial place, has been recognised for its excellence in urban planning and environmental sustainability. Two International Finance Centre, with its almost column-free floors to maximise natural light penetration, was awarded Gold Certification by the US Green Building Council. Third, it is not just buildings that need reworking. With a broader regional perspective, we seek to apply district-wide green technology like the District Cooling System (DCS) in Kowloon East to reduce power consumption. The DCS is an energy-efficient air-conditioning system which consumes 35 per cent less electricity compared to traditional air-cooled air-conditioning systems and 20 per cent less electricity than individual water-cooled air-conditioning systems using cooling towers. The system helps us achieve the new Energy Saving Target by reducing energy intensity. Finally, we are working to expand the green concept from development areas to our comprehensive Hong Kong development framework. The Government is now updating Hong Kong's holistic development strategy, known as ""Hong Kong 2030+: Towards a Planning Vision and Strategy Transcending 2030"". We have aspirations to make Hong Kong a smart, green and resilient city, and aim to optimise the use of transport infrastructure to reduce commuting demand. More integrated green and blue spaces will be explored as part of planning for a more sustainable Hong Kong. In the process, we will not sacrifice housing demand for green developments. Rather, an environmentally friendly city creates synergy among communities, and provides the necessary green spaces for citizens to settle comfortably. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will agree with me that green buildings can not only revitalise a city, but also make a substantial difference to the world. Last but not least, I wish the Green Council every success in the years to come, and congratulate all awardees for your dedication to the green movement. Thank you.

In 2009, Beijing was widely blamed for scuppering what was expected to be an historic climate summit in Copenhagen. Although the Bali Road Map intended the talks in the Danish capital to finalise legal-binding emissions reduction targets, negotiations teetered on the brink of collapse. Then-UK environment minister Ed Miliband later accused the Chinese delegation, led by former premier Wen Jiabao, of having  vetoed the idea of a 50 percent reduction in global emissions by 2050 a move commentators attributed to the leadership\' s devotion to maintaining economic growth, considered an imperative source of legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party.

"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong13","Why the Paris climate deal could be a game-changer","December 16, 2015 Wednesday","EJ Insight","On December 12, an announcement from the COP21 conference in Paris grabbed headlines around the world. After two weeks of negotiations, 195 nations agreed on a plan to reduce carbon emissions and cap global warming at 2 degrees Celsius, or even 1.5 degrees, in the longer term.\~ However, the agreement was toned down as the US convinced other countries to adopt the word ""should"" (instead of the more powerful legal implications of the word ""shall"") in order to bypass a veto by the Republican-controlled US Senate. There were other compromises from previous hardline positions as well, but that was only expected given the negotiations of this magnitude. That said, the slightly toned down agreement is not necessarily less powerful than it may seem. On the contrary, the moral significance of the agreement should not be lost on everyone. The world's nations have finally put forth in a document that they agree with the promise of limiting carbon emissions to prevent dangerous climate change. We should remember that when\~John F. Kennedy said in 1961 that ""I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth,"" the scientists and engineers of NASA did not even have all the knowledge and details of how to achieve the mission. JFK could have said ""I command"" instead of the weaker ""I believe."" But that belief, instead of a command, would turn into a powerful vision that would electrify the world. It would be achieved even after his death, because his words had been the moral force that propelled legions of men and women to achieve what seemed impossible a few years earlier. The Paris COP21 Naysayers will always say that anything short of a mandatory commitment will not work. But that belief is borne out of a lack of trust in the human spirit. Mankind, if given the chance, can rise to the occasion and show why it was given the power of reason and action. We must believe in our own capacity to create change for good. Policymakers should continue with their work of adding details to the agreement. Financiers and big business should lead the way towards the transformation of their enterprises into low carbon ventures. Scientists and engineers should continue to find means to make renewables and cleantech better and cheaper. Governments should lessen the burden for firms that adopt clean energy while penalizing those who burn too much fossil fuel. The penalties can come in the form of carbon taxes or other means. Individuals should exercise their power of choice, even if sometimes (though increasingly no longer true) that choice initially may turn out to be more expensive before it will become cheaper because of innovation and economies of scale. The harder task is now up to us. If we continue with business as usual, and continue with our current path of using fossil fuels indiscriminately, then the words on the agreement forged in Paris COP21 will be just that - words. But if we fit our actions to fulfill the moral imperative of that document, then perhaps by the end of this decade, we will have our own version of the impossible dream here on earth. \"
"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong14","Climate change: How it breeds extremists","December 1, 2015 Tuesday","EJ Insight","Since the Nov. 13 terrorist bloodletting, Paris has been practically under martial law. In this subdued and challenging context, world leaders are convening in the City of Light at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to hammer out a new fglobal agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Could disrupting the talks have been part of the terrorists' agenda? It certainly seems possible. After all, severe environmental conditions in much of the Middle East and North Africa's Sahel region contribute to the sense of desperation that fuels Islamic extremism. Given this, arranging the attacks in such a way that could distract from efforts to ameliorate those conditions while advancing the terrorists' other goals, of course, would seem like a ""winning"" strategy. The situation in the Middle East and the Sahel is certainly dire, with rapid desertification devastating pastoral economies and the livelihoods of farmers, shepherds, nomads, and those who depend on them. This combination of environmental and economic degradation has created fertile conditions for murderous Islamist movements, including Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in Somalia and Kenya and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Where climate change threatens to lay waste to the environment, fanatics have banded together to lay waste to civilization. To be sure, climate change is by no means the primary cause of Islamist extremism. Failed economies and brutal secular dictatorships, together with deep-rooted ethnic and religious rifts, have fueled a volatile combination of fear, instability, and anger. But no one should doubt that the framework of fanaticism has been abetted by the dire environmental conditions that now prevail in much of the Middle East and the Sahel. And those conditions are set to deteriorate further, as rapid population growth puts even greater strain on resources. The surge in carbon dioxide emissions has been fueled not just by industrialization; the UN expects the planet's human population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. That growth will happen disproportionately in the Muslim world, including the Middle East and the Sahel. Indeed, the countries with the highest fertility rates are predominantly Muslim, led by Niger, with 7.6 live births per woman, followed by Somalia with 6.7, and Chad with 6. According to the Pew Research Center, the number of Muslims in the world will nearly equal the number of Christians by 2070, and Islam will become the world's largest religion by 2100. Rapid population growth in countries where the environment is already failing to meet people's needs and where economies show scant signs of creating new employment opportunities, provides a fertile ground for fanaticism. Consider Mali, where Islamist militants attacked a hotel filled with foreigners just one week after the attacks in Paris. Drought and desertification have exacerbated poverty -- the country's per capita GDP is just US$765, placing it 168th worldwide -- and extremely perilous living conditions are reflected in the world's seventh-highest child-mortality rates: 123 of every 1,000 children will not make it to their fifth birthday. In such a poor society, inadequate education leaves people without the knowledge they need to improve their lot, such as by limiting pregnancies or taking advantage of opportunities to boost economic productivity. Under these conditions, it should not be surprising that Islamist terrorism has been a consistent scourge. In short, much of the Middle East and the Sahel are locked in a vicious cycle of environmental degradation, economic failure, and Islamist extremism. The question is how to break out of it. The Paris summit is likely to be a buttoned-down diplomatic battle among countries for grants to support their pledges to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the pledges that will be made, particularly in ravaged lands like Somalia, northern Nigeria and Iraq's Anbar province, is entirely uncertain. The most important factor in the long-term effort to save societies in the Middle East and the Sahel from environmental and economic ruin -- with major implications for combating Islamic extremism -- will not be discussed in Paris. That factor is education. After all, to improve their health and preserve their environment, people need access to information about birth-control methods, modern farming and cooking practices and much else. And to improve their economic prospects, they need the knowledge and skills that employers require. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who serves as UN Special Envoy for Global Education, is working tirelessly to promote access to education among the millions of refugees in the region. It is time for more global players to support this effort, so that it can be expanded across the Middle East and the Sahel. Education is the key to giving strained populations hope for a better future. And hope is fundamental to negating the allure of extremism, in all of its forms. Copyright: Project Syndicate \"
"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong15","Time to bring in the law to ensure sensible livestock production","June 25, 2015 Thursday","EJ Insight","In December, world leaders will meet in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , where they will hammer out a comprehensive agreement to reduce carbon emissions and stem global warming. In the run-up to that meeting, governments worldwide should note one critical but often overlooked fact -- the single biggest driver of environmental degradation and resource stress today is our changing diet, a diet that is not particularly conducive to a healthy life either. In recent decades, rising incomes have catalyzed a major shift in people's eating habits, with meat, in particular, becoming an increasingly important feature of their diet. Given that livestock require much more food, land, water, and energy to raise and transport than plants, increased demand for meat depletes natural resources, places pressure on food production systems, damages ecosystems and fuels climate change. Meat production is about 10 times more water-intensive than plant-based calories and proteins, with one kilogram of beef, for example, requiring 15,415 liters of water. It is also an inefficient way of generating food. Up to 30 crop calories are needed to produce one meat calorie. At any given time, the global livestock population is more than 150 billion compared with just 7.2 billion humans, meaning livestock have a larger direct ecological footprint than we do. Livestock production causes almost 14.5 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions and contributes significantly to water pollution. Moreover, livestock production consumes one-third of the water resources used in agriculture (which accounts for 71 percent of the world's water consumption), as well as more than 40 percent of the global output of wheat, rye, oats, and corn. And livestock production uses 30 percent of the earth's land surface that once was home to wildlife, thereby playing a critical role in biodiversity loss and species extinction. It took more than a century for the European diet to reach the point at which meat is consumed at every meal, including breakfast. But in large parts of Asia, a similar shift has occurred in just one generation. Meaty diets have created a global obesity problem including, of all places, in China, whose expanding international clout is accompanied by expanding waistlines at home. Americans consume the most meat per capita, after Luxembourgers. Given the size of the US population, this is already a problem. If the rest of the world caught up to the US, where meat consumption averages 125.4 kilograms per person annually compared with a measly 3.2 kilograms in India, the environmental consequences would be catastrophic. Already, the signs are worrying. Demand for meat is projected to increase 50 percent from 2013 to 2025, with overall consumption still rising in the West and soaring in the developing world, especially Asia. In order to meet this demand, meat producers have had to adopt an extremely problematic approach to raising livestock. In order to ensure that their animals gain weight rapidly, meat producers feed them grain, rather than the grass that they would naturally consume -- an approach that is a major source of pressure on grain production, natural resources, and the environment. Making matters worse, the livestock are injected with large amounts of hormones and antibiotics. In the US, 80 percent of all antibiotics sold are administered prophylactically to livestock. Yet, this has been inadequate to stem the spread of disease. In fact, with many of the new and emerging infectious diseases affecting humans originating in animals, veterinarians, microbiologists and epidemiologists have been trying to understand the ""ecology of disease"" (how nature and humanity's impact on it spreads disease). Although the environmental and health costs of our changing diets have been widely documented, the message has gone largely unheard. With the world facing a serious water crisis, rapidly increasing global temperatures, staggering population growth and growing health problems such as coronary disease, this must change -- and fast. For starters, to ease some of the resource pressure, livestock producers should switch to water-saving technologies including drip irrigation. At the same time, governments and civil society groups should promote healthier diets that rely more on plant-based proteins and calories. According to recent research, if the world stopped producing crops for animal feed or diverting them to biofuels, it could not only end global hunger but also feed four billion extra people -- more than the number of projected arrivals before the global population stabilizes. Meat consumption actually leads to more greenhouse gas emissions annually than the use of cars does. This is not to say that everyone must become vegetarian. But even a partial shift in meat-consumption habits -- with consumers choosing options like chicken and seafood, instead of beef -- could have a far-reaching impact. Indeed, beef production requires, on average, 28 times more land and 11 times more water than other livestock categories while producing five times more greenhouse gas emissions and six times more reactive nitrogen. Just as governments have used laws, regulations and other tools with great success to discourage smoking, so must they encourage citizens to eat a balanced diet -- for the sake of their health and of our planet. \"
"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong16","A fair, efficient and feasible climate agreement","December 18, 2015 Friday","EJ Insight","How should one evaluate the agreement reached in Paris this month at the United Nations climate change conference ? No sooner was the deal announced on Dec. 12 than the debate erupted. Some avid environmentalists were disappointed that the agreement did not commit firmly to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050. But such a commitment would not have been credible. Individual countries pledged to limit their emissions in the near term, with provisions for future monitoring and periodic reviews of targets. This is far better than setting lofty goals for the distant future while giving little reason to think that they would be met. The important thing is to get started. In four key respects, the agreement is a good one for those who regard global climate change as an important problem and want to take feasible steps to address it. First, and most important, participation is comprehensive, with 188 countries offering individual commitments, called intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). In the past, only rich countries were expected to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions; developing countries were explicitly spared that within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. That had to change, partly because it is in developing countries, not the advanced economies, that emisssions are growing the fastest. Furthermore, countries like the United States would not agree to limit their emissions if they feared that carbon-emitting industry would simply migrate to developing countries. Second, the agreement includes a process of future assessment and revision of targets. Every five years, the parties will take stock and renew the commitments. Targets can be adjusted in light of future developments to be more or less aggressive, (probably more, if the scientists' predictions are borne out). Negotiations on the INDC revisions are to begin in 2018, even though the first set of targets is scheduled to take effect in 2020. Third, the Paris deal takes steps toward transparency in monitoring, reporting and verifying countries' progress. Starting in 2023, countries are to report every five years on compliance with their emissions targets. The US and Europe had to push China and India to agree to this. But without transparency, the INDCs would not be credible. Fourth, the agreement contains mechanisms to facilitate international linkage, including scope for residents of rich countries to finance emissions reductions in poor countries. This is important, because it is cheaper to pay a poor country to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants than it is to shut down an existing plant in a rich country. And achieving the first period's INDCs at low cost will be an important determinant of countries' willingness to take further steps in future periods. Achieving more aggressive environmental goals, particularly limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C, or zero greenhouse-gas emissions in the second half of the century, would of course be desirable in terms of minimizing the risk of disaster scenarios. In fact, the first INDCs, by themselves, are nowhere near enough even to limit warming to 2 degrees C (the global goal that was agreed in Canc\'fan in 2010). But proclaiming ambitious targets is very different from achieving them. It is almost beside the point that the economic cost of pursuing a goal of 1.5 degrees C would be very high. In any case, leaders can't make credible commitments 35 years into the future. Some developing-country leaders may be displeased for another reason: the figure of US$100 billion in finance from rich countries does not appear in the legally binding body of the agreement. The rich countries did admit their moral responsibility to help small island states, for example, cope with ""loss and damages"" from sea-level rise. But they rejected demands for formal acceptance of legal liability. This was a reasonable outcome in a difficult situation. Rich countries can't deny that their past emissions have inflicted harm on the world. In a domestic legal system, an entity whose land was, say, flooded would have a claim to compensation from the entity that had caused the damage. But sovereign countries are not operating in such a system. The US$100 billion in finance has always seemed problematic. The developing countries fear that the rich countries won't deliver the money, at least not in cash; and they are right. The rich countries fear that such ""reparations"" would disappear into the pockets of local elites; and they, too, are right. So it is better not to make promises. The poor countries do have a strong case. The average American still accounts for 10 times the emissions of the average citizen of India, and India should not be deprived of the right to develop economically. But the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets. The efforts that richer countries promised should be - and generally are - greater than the efforts of poor countries. The richer a country is, the earlier the date at which its emissions should peak. The richer it is, the more sharply its target should cut emissions relative to the baseline. With targets that take into account their stage of development, poor countries can be paid for additional emissions cuts under the international linkage mechanisms. In such ways, the Paris agreement ensures both fairness and efficiency. Achieving it was a daunting challenge, and more challenges lie ahead. But the negotiators' success in converging on a plan that offers hope of practical progress is an unambiguous triumph. Copyright: Project Syndicate \"
"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong17","Why Beijing is losing many of its expats","December 25, 2015 Friday","EJ Insight","It could almost have been planned that way. As representatives gathered in Paris at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference this month, a smoggy haze floated over the Chinese capital, 22 times higher than the World Health Organization's limit, and forcing China to issue its first red alert, closing schools and construction sites and restricting traffic. This year, Beijing's population is estimated to have exceeded 22 million, and the city's pollution levels are rising accordingly. Much of the unsightly smog is made up of PM 2.5 -- particulate matter that, when inhaled, can lead to an array of health problems that are more prevalent in China than ever before. As a result, international firms doing business in Beijing are finding it harder than ever to attract and keep foreign talent in the city, which was once a sought-after expat destination. China is one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases but has recently been forced to take a stand against pollution. Its national climate plan, submitted to the UN in July, promises a commitment to spend 41 trillion yuan (US$6.6 trillion) on climate change solutions, making China the first developing country to commit to a carbon peak. President Xi Jinping pledged change at the Paris summit, and government measures have been put in place to curb the smog, most of which is due to the country's dependence on coal-burning power plants, massive industrial factories, chemical industries and rapidly increasing car ownership. At the end of October each year, coal-burning public heating systems add to the particulate load. Companies that violate environmental laws are facing the biggest fines ever, and a Clean Air Action Plan is working to reduce car usage, but these changes are too little, too late. The foreign residents of Beijing are unimpressed by these developments. A German expatriate who works for a leading car manufacturer confides that he intends to take his wife and two children back to Frankfurt after four-and-a-half years of living in Beijing. He recalls that the pollution was even worse before the 2008 Olympic Games and the government's subsequent crackdown on industrial emissions around the capital. Nevertheless, the air is still too bad for his family - what would be an extreme level of smog in Germany is common in Beijing, keeping the children home from school more than their parents consider acceptable. At this year's Green Companies Summit, more than a thousand global business leaders converged to discuss sustainability as part of China's economic growth. Venture capitalist firms and startups floated ideas for change, including industrial and household-scale air treatment units, new water treatment technologies and renewable energy sources providing alternatives to coal. While the United States is experiencing a drop in investment in clean technology firms, the opposite seems to be true in China, where burgeoning companies tend to require less capital than their US counterparts. Over the last two years, different media have reported projects that seem straight from a sci-fi series. One involves an ""air bubble-type structure"" which would enclose a botanical garden, apartments, offices, shops, sports and medical facilities, playgrounds and schoolyards in a filtered and controlled facility. One initiative seems outright incredible - a Canadian company launched a line of bottled mountain air, and its first batch of 500 units sold out! Although change may be on the horizon in Beijing, it is difficult to convince foreign managers and executives to uproot and move to a city with such notorious pollution issues. Companies with operations in China are attempting to prevent an expat exodus by providing generous hardship packages, including hazard pay for higher management. Other companies provide home air filtration systems and extra vacation time to visit families in less-polluted countries, although mountain air and sea breezes can be found only two hours' drive from Beijing. Fighting pollution remains of major importance to Beijing's future if it is to remain the economic centre of the world's second-largest economy. Despite efforts to retain international expats in Beijing, they are showing a tendency to leave rather than stay, although Beijing is still preferred over several locations with better air quality - including India, Russia and Africa. One push factor is that the city has become one of the world's most expensive cities for expats, which can be attributed partly\~to inflation in China and partly to the increasing strength of the Chinese currency, a fact partially borne out by its recent inclusion in the International Monetary Fund's reserve currency basket. Ultimately, the expat exodus could be due less to pollution and more to the increasing costs of maintaining an expat family in Beijing -- and to the growing talent pool of Chinese executives who are ready, willing and able to replace them.

It also provides an account of Hong Kong's climate change actions prior to the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) so that the public can have a more complete picture of Hong Kong's contributions to concerted global action. Hosting the launch event, the Secretary for the Environment, Mr Wong Kam-sing, said, ""The world has to work very hard over the course of the next few decades to reduce carbon emissions by a substantial margin, even as the population rises and development continues rapidly in emerging economies, in order to maintain the 2 degrees Celsius warming scenario within this century. Hong Kong has followed the complex international negotiations for a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, and we are hopeful that a new agreement could be achieved at COP21 in Paris later this year."" Mr Wong added, ""As an international city and a highly advanced economy, Hong Kong wishes to contribute actively to national and global efforts. The HKSAR Government attaches much importance to combating climate change, and has already taken various important actions. These include collaborative efforts by bureaux and departments to undertake various mitigation and adaptation measures. Key stakeholders in the private sector have also taken significant steps."" While climate change is a major challenge, Mr Wong said it also offers the community a chance to improve liveability by embarking on a low-carbon path and acting collectively towards a common goal. This opportunity is very real for a high-density city like Hong Kong, as it has considerable possibilities to enhance environmental assets and physical infrastructure, create green jobs and strengthen social collaboration, he said. Also at the launch event today, the Under Secretary for Development, Mr Eric Ma, said that the Development Bureau and its departments have been actively participating and studying relevant issues in combating climate change, with a view to making the overall planning of Hong Kong and individual development projects comply with the principle of sustainable development, thereby balancing the social, economic and environmental needs of the community. On the public housing and transport fronts, the Under Secretary for Transport and Housing, Mr Yau Shing-mu, spoke on the efforts to combat climate change from various angles including design, setting policy objectives, and operation management. Initiatives include continuous enhancement of the public transport service network and quality so as to attract people to choose public transport as their preferred mobility option, thereby reducing reliance on private cars, as well as implementing energy-saving and carbon reduction measures in the design, building provisions and daily management of public housing, which accommodates nearly half of the population in Hong Kong. In addition, the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory, Mr Shun Chi-ming, briefed participants on global climate projections and how climate change is affecting Hong Kong.

The climate talks in Paris, known as COP21 , quietened down on Sunday.\~ For the most dedicated, issues related to the environment, development, business and science continue to be discussed in meetings, \~conferences and workshops all around Paris. For those who need a break, there are musical evenings and sightseeing tours \- but many of these are still themed on the environment. For those at the heart of the talks, we must hope they are holed up in their hotels working with a spirit of compromise and vision to ensure the Paris meeting keeps the planet on the right track. The good news is that the key working groups last week delivered a draft text on Saturday to their countries\' ministers, who will start work today to achieve a worthwhile agreement.\~ Most of the negotiating blocs, representing alliances of countries in the north, the south, the big, the small, the low-lying and the high-flying, have expressed some optimism that the document they have passed to their ministerial bosses is a good basis for achieving a meaningful outcome. HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/500314068 View image | HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com gettyimages.com The bad news is that the document contains a huge number of unfinished sections, with lots of suggestions for alternatives and additions included in brackets for the ministers and their teams to work through, wrangle about and sort out over the next week. Although there are a few discussions continuing about the negotiation process, there is a feeling that the Paris meetings have avoided the host of complaints about lack of transparency and poor procedure that led to the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate meetings. Protests during the Copenhagen Summit in 2009. Photo: Wikicommons. Few are predicting that the Paris talks will lock us into a binding agreement on emissions that will hold the earth\' s temperature below two degrees.\~ Any definite reduction targets in the agreement are likely to be derived from  nationally-determined plans worked out by countries separately. This will establish some definite reduction targets by all nations, and will demonstrate an acceptance by all countries that we must walk in the same direction on the same path and all be willing to climb the mountains ahead, even if we do so at different speeds.\~ It is also hoped that the final statement will contain an aspirational target on the overall global temperature rise, at either 1.5 degrees or \' well below two degrees.\' HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/500190912 View image | HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com gettyimages.com An important part of the agreement will set out arrangements to ensure all countries report in an open transparent way on emissions reductions, and to establish a clear timetable for reviewing how we are all living up to our promises, taking note of the latest information from the scientists.\~ Some hope that these continuing processes will enable nations to exceed and improve on the initial Paris-agreed targets in future years to achieve the targets that scientists tell us are necessary to avoid catastrophe. The years after Paris need to be marked by a deepening of \~trust and a spirit of  we-are-all-in-this-together. The key sticking point in all of this remains the degree to which the richest countries, who have been pumping out greenhouse gasses for the longest time and at the highest levels, should bear more responsibility for reducing emissions and provide more money to help others both to reduce emissions (mitigation) and cope with the already-harmful effects of a warming planet (adaptation, loss and damage).\~ All agree on this principle of  common but differentiated responsibility between the wealthy and not so wealthy countries. But the unresolved question is  how differentiated? And what does this mean in cash terms? A protester at Hyde Park, London. Photo: Alisdare Hickson via Flickr. Related to this is the question of the role and responsibility of those countries which are neither very poor nor very rich, but rapidly-developing in terms of wealth and carbon emissions. These nations place themselves firmly in the poor country camp for the purposes of these talks, but some feel they could and should do more and that we should not be locked into country categories established over 20 years ago when climate talks began. Some middle-income countries are nervous that the review process planned for every five or so years after the Paris meetings could become an occasion for renewed pressure on them to improve their emissions reduction targets. The representative from the Marshall Islands reminded the meeting that, while a favorite phrase in the talks is  nationally determined , nations are gathered in Paris  to fight for what is globally necessary. HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/500190858 View image | HYPERLINK http://www.gettyimages.com gettyimages.com So while governments and NGOs are cautiously welcoming the fact that the Paris talks have not fallen off the rails, there will still be a long week of hard talking.

Sensing the unease and seizing the opportunity, the French hosts decided against the ineffective HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/timeline/ precedent of binding targets for industrialized countries (only the E.U. has met the agreed on 5% reduction in emissions from Kyoto). Instead, all 196 members were encouraged to bring, \~ HYPERLINK http://www.novethic.com/the-climate-conference-cop21.html potluck style , what carbon reduction schemes they could afford to the table. COP21 participants. What emerged after days of arm twisting was short on detail, but full of positive buzz as a typically fractious bunch showed shared purpose and focus. No small task, considering the chaos six years ago in Copenhagen when developing nations, led by China and India, squared off against developed ones, led by the U.S., scuppering any agreement towards new carbon reduction targets. This time the result was a binding commitment between all members,  to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 \'baC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase 1.5 \'baC above pre-industrial levels. It seems clear, but this momentous statement of intent is anything but- what\' s even the target temperature? Realistically, 2 \'baC above pre-industrial levels, but the aspirational 1.5 \'baC was tacked on to calm panicked island nations, who otherwise will be existent in the abstract.  One thought\~will come up time and again: you will be able to say that on the twelfth of December you were in Paris for the agreement on the climate. And you will be able to be proud to stand before your children and your grandchildren. Contrary to the high flying rhetoric of President Hollande at its close, the accord in Paris has left iceberg sized question marks floating in its aftermath. None, hopefully, too large to sink optimism COP21 is the turning point in our fight to keep Earth the way we like it. One is that pledges are a mixed bag, ranging from ambitious cuts in emissions to promises to merely lower the carbon intensity per GDP point. Another is that pledges were decided as not legally binding, and an effective monitoring scheme was nixed. Finally, concrete HYPERLINK http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/05/paris-climate-summit-developing-countries-angry-financial-commitments financial commitments Photo: CCTV news. The specifics of the 188 pledges are vague, eminently adjustable, and simply not radical enough to meet temperature targets. Added together they are projected to lower the expected 3.6 \'baC temperature increase, but to HYPERLINK http://www.triplepundit.com/special/cop21/national-carbon-commitments-good-but-good-enough/ 2.7 \'baC rather than the promised 1.5 \'baC or 2 \'baC above pre-industrial levels. The promised 28% carbon emission reduction by the \~ HYPERLINK http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa.html U.S . is centered around cleaning up its power plants through the \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/reduce-emissions/what-is-the-clean-power-plan#.VolwMzbMzFI Clean Power Plan , which could be null and void depending on this year\' s election. Photo: triplepundit.com. While HYPERLINK http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china.html China left itself plenty of wiggle room saying it will have reached  peak emissions by 2030 , achieved by shifting to renewable energy sources and planting more trees. The \~ HYPERLINK http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu.html E.U . ambitiously aimed for an economy wide 40% reduction from 1990 levels in greenhouse gases, without mentioning specific industrial sectors this would come from. Avoiding any direct emission cuts, \~ HYPERLINK http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/india.html India simply promised to  lower the emissions intensity of GDP to 33% to 35% by 2030 below 2005 levels , along with increasing non-fossil fuel power generation to only 40% and also increasing forest cover. Regardless, pledges indicate the progress beyond the orthodoxy that economic growth trumps environment. If, of course, they are actually carried out. They aren\' t legally binding, and there is no penalty for failure to implement. Which is why pledges had to be transparent to allow for the press and public to pressure their respective governments. However, in countries that discourage discourse outside of official channels, and tightly HYPERLINK https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/freedom-press-2015#.VnjMAzbMxFI muzzle their press, like China, the government is only accountable to itself. Accountability that certainly hasn\' t been earned considering the mind boggling levels of official excess its anti-corruption drive continues to uncover. Promisingly in China, even without an official outlet there have been protests in response to worsening air pollution and water quality, which have put the Chinese government on notice that they ignore the environment at their own peril. At the heart of disagreement in climate negotiations is the accusation by developing to the developed, that their carbon intensive industrialization is the root cause for current climate change, and that they should be financially culpable. Refusing to allow lawsuits for compensation, developed countries instead informally promised to \' mobilize\' HYPERLINK http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/paris-climate-change-conference/12047133/Final-text-of-climate-deal-to-be-released-imminently.html $100 billion of public and private finance for developing countries every year after 2020. There is no guarantee this exact amount will be available for  adaptation and mitigation , nor is it clear from whom this amount will be collected. This is hardly comforting for countries most at risk from climate change, and who are also the likely source of increasing emissions as they industrialize. It above all failed to set a needed moral precedent of looking beyond narrow national interests, and seeing the broader global need. The consequence is further distrust, in a time is needed. If anything, the Paris accord is a sketch of a path the world should follow. It also showed a powerful recognition that carbon emissions must come down. In many ways, it was probably the best result anyone could have hoped for. But, we don\' t have the luxury of complacency, a fact underlined by the HYPERLINK http://www.livescience.com/50189-warmest-winter-2015.html warmest winter on record. The fuzziness of the pledges in detail and accountability demands the our energy and attention to make sure they are fully implemented. And then we need to demand more. \"

"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong23","Business has vital role in tackling climate change","February 20, 2016 Saturday","EJ Insight","If everybody goes about their business, and if the challenge of climate change is left unchecked, the average global temperature will rise by 4 degrees Celsius\~during this century. We will feel the implications in Hong Kong just as much as everyone else, if not more. The Third National Climate Change Assessment Report, prepared by 550 experts, reports that the temperature along China's coast has been rising faster than the global average. Rising temperatures will cause more extreme weather, natural disasters, frequent storms, flooding and unprecedented droughts - challenges to economies, cities and communities everywhere. Industry sectors, from agriculture to finance, energy, infrastructure and manufacturing, have already started to work toward a low-carbon future to overcome these challenges. And a rising generation of entrepreneurs, innovators and startups understands the way forward is to design for positive environmental and social impact. Climate change cannot be solved by one country or government alone. It is a systemic challenge that requires creativity, imagination and innovation across the private and government sector and the public at large. An important first step is the adoption of the Paris agreement during the Conference of Parties, COP21 So far, 188 countries have submitted\~to the United Nations\~their plans -- called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) --\~to reduce\~greenhouse gases. This covers about 99 percent of global emissions. More needs to be done. The INDCs alone will not get us close enough to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees. Business worldwide has a vital role to play. The We Mean Business coalition invites companies to commit to seven climate initiatives that enable a low-carbon future. Already, 554 companies and investors have committed to taking action.\~ Startups, entrepreneurs, pioneers and innovators with the vision to create positive environmental or social impact have an incredible opportunity to be part of addressing climate change. A rising generation of empowered entrepreneurs are collaborating, designing and building solutions that can disrupt entire industries - something that was unthinkable only a few years ago.\~ Startup companies often conceptualize some of the greatest ideas but often lack the tools to execute them or realize them to their fullest potential. With a lower barrier to some of the industry's best tools, these innovators can imagine, design and create their ideas at a fraction of the time and cost and so bring innovations to the market for positive environmental and social impact. One example is a young Chinese startup: Pionovision aims to bring solar power to millions of families through its unique solar cloth and thin-film technology. The company started in 2014, and since then has implemented various solar projects, supporting many off-grid communities. Recently it helped a school in a remote area in Hebei province; now students can use lights, water purifiers and computers. Actions like these are starting to build momentum toward a low-carbon future. A study published in the scientific journal Nature shows a negative correlation between rising temperatures and worker productivity - the higher the temperature, the lower the worker productivity. Lack of action will lead to global decline. Governments and businesses have it in their hands to address climate change and invest in the right solutions for social and environmental benefits. \"
"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong24","A tough problem to mask","December 11, 2015 6:46 AM GMT","Week in China","The \' Mandate of Heaven\' is a Chinese concept about the right to rule that dates back many millennia. And worryingly for China\' s current leadership when Beijingers looked towards those same heavens this month they didn\' t see a lot: throughout much of December the capital\' s skies have turned eerily dark as thick blankets of smog descended, leading to school closures and cars being ordered off the road. On Monday the city issued its first ever red alert for air pollution. The timing of this onset of grey miasma could not have been more germane \- it would have been one of the last things President Xi Jinping saw of his country as his plane took off for Paris where he attended global climate change talks (that remain ongoing). It was almost as if the heavens were reminding Xi of the ancient social contract: rule wisely and you will remain in power; fail to meet the needs of your people and you will be unseated. In the past natural disasters were a sign that the emperor, or the \' son of Heaven\' , had lost his mandate. But, of course, the smog that descended on Beijing last week was not a natural disaster, at least not entirely. Weather and geography did play a role in trapping the pollution over Beijing but the high levels of PM2.5 particles \- the smallest and most hazardous type \- were locally generated from car emissions and coal-fired power plants. And that\' s where there is a strong connection between air pollution and China\' s carbon emissions \- the latter being the central issue Xi and other world leaders discussed at COP 21 in Paris. Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels and China \- the world\' s biggest carbon polluter \- relies on it to produce two thirds of its electricity. It\' s no coincidence that the smog returned to Beijing this year when the weather began to get cold and in response power stations fired up to meet demand for heat. This encapsulates China\' s central problem in respect to air pollution and climate change \- how does a government carry on improving people\' s livelihoods, or keeping them warm in the winter, whilst also reducing the longer term threat of global warming? Speaking at the COP 21 opening ceremony on November 30 \- when PM2.5 hourly levels in Beijing reached 40 times the World Health Organisation\' s recommended limit \- \~Xi admitted the past three decades of rapid economic growth had  taken its toll on the [Chinese] environment \~but he stressed that China was now taking the issue seriously.  China is making vigorous ecological endeavours to promote green and low-carbon growth, he said.\~ We have the confidence and resolve to fulfill our commitments, he added. His tone and indeed his presence marked a change from the Chinese attitude at the last United Nations climate change talks in Copenhagen in 2009. On that occasion China sent Premier Wen Jiabao to negotiate. However, during key meetings he vacated the room leaving Xie Zhenhua, special envoy on climate change, to remonstrate with Western leaders. The jist of his argument was that developed countries are largely responsible for global warming and international emission caps were another tool to stop China\' s economic rise. The argument was not altogether unreasonable but Xie \- who is still China\' s main negotiator on climate change \- became known as the man who shook his finger at President Obama and China was widely blamed for having sunk the talks. This time China comes to the table with more confidence and a greater motive to participate and drive change. Just before the talks started the Ministry of Science and Technology put out a report saying China is being affected more than other countries by rising temperatures and sea levels. It said that soil erosion and erratic rainfall will lead to crop failure and a loss of food security. It also warned that the country\' s eastern seaboard \- its economic powerhouse \- would be threatened by rising waters. Yet aside from all this there are domestic political reasons for why the Chinese government may be keen to get an agreement in Paris. As The Economist pointed out last week: if 195 nations at COP 21 come together and commit to action that will cap global warming it will help China\' s top leaders push through much needed economic reforms \- namely, shutting wasteful and polluting steel plants and coal pits so the economy can transition to a more service-based growth. Just as with joining the World Trade Organisation or the renminbi being included in the International Monetary Fund\' s special drawing rights basket, a deal in Paris would strengthen the hand of those pushing for reform because even hardliners don\' t want to see China embarrassed on the world stage. So what is China pushing for at these talks? Within hours of this week\' s WiC being published there should be a final agreement. In the run up to the\~talks China committed to stopping carbon emissions growth in 2030 and hinted that with help from the West it could bring that date forward to 2026 or 2023. China can also now lay claim to producing 24% of the world\' s renewable energy \- a figure that could feasibly rise to 42% in the near future. In many ways China leads the world in tackling climate change. But China still sees itself as a developing nation and\~Xi Jinping made it clear in his opening address at the Paris talks that he believes developed nations should shoulder a greater proportion of the burden when combating climate change. He also appeared reluctant to accept terms that might limit China\' s short term room for manoeuvre.  It is imperative to respect differences among countries, especially developing countries, in domestic policies, capacity building and economic structure. A one-size-fits-all approach must be avoided, he said According to reports in the Financial Times this week Chinese representatives have tried to water down proposals for a system that would compel nations to report carbon emissions and climate change plans to the UN \- and likewise a clause that would force it to update emission-reduction pledges every five years from 2020. More broadly China, along with India, looks to be resisting a move to aim for a 1.5 degree (centigrade) cap on global warming by the end of the century \- a move introduced by the low-lying island of Tuvalu as well as Bangladesh and supported by the US. On Wednesday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius presented the final 29-page draft of the agreement to delegates. Around 750 disputed terms or phrases had been incorporated or removed, he said, and about 250 remained. After\~ the report came out the Chinese delegation said it would \' consult\' \~with other nations.  Tonight will be a sleepless night, \~ Xinhua quoted Xie as saying. Meanwhile in Beijing the air on Thursday cleared. The red alert in Beijing has been lifted, Xinhua announced on its official weibo feed. That said, Beijing wasn\' t the worst hit. Anyang in Henan faced air pollution three times worse, says the New York Times, with the index reaching the top of the scale: 999. \"

"COP21","Hong.Kong","COP21_Hong.Kong27","Director of Hong Kong Observatory Highlights Observatory's Latest Developments","March 15, 2016 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","March 15 -- The Director of the Hong Kong Observatory, Mr Shun Chi-ming, spoke on the weather outlook for this year and the Observatory's upcoming initiatives at a press briefing today (March 15). Mr Shun pointed out that the World Meteorological Organization had ranked 2015 as the hottest year globally on record since 1880. The weather in Hong Kong in 2015 was also marked by unusually high temperatures in Hong Kong Observatory's record. There were 18 new records related to temperatures ( HYPERLINK http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/pastwx/2015/ywx2015.htm www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/pastwx/2015/ywx2015.htm ), with the highest average temperature recorded in November since records began. 2016 started with all-time high monthly rainfall in January, more than 10 times the normal value. Temperatures in early January remained above normal, but plummeted in the second half of the month, with temperatures at the Observatory dropping to a minimum of 3.1 degrees on January 24, the coldest day since 1957. However, the global average temperatures in January and February 2016 were actually the hottest since records began in 1880. The trend of more extreme weather under the influence of global climate change is obvious. The Observatory will spare no efforts in upgrading weather monitoring and forecasting capabilities, enhancing public communication and researching into new methods in forecasting the likelihood of extreme weather events. Regarding the weather outlook for 2016, the Observatory expects El Nino to weaken gradually in the coming months, with a half chance of transitioning to La Nina in the latter part of the year. Taking into consideration this trend and various forecast indicators, the Observatory expects the annual rainfall to be normal to above-normal and the number of tropical cyclones coming within 500 kilometres of Hong Kong to be near normal, i.e. between four and seven, with the first tropical cyclone in the season expected to come in June or later. Mr Shun reminded the public to remain vigilant against the threat of inclement weather, heighten awareness towards disaster preparedness and prepare for the coming rain and typhoon seasons. On climate change issues, an international agreement was reached at the Paris climate summit (also known as COP21 ) in December 2015 to limit carbon dioxide emissions. However, the emission reduction pledges made by the countries still fall short of what is required to control the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees (above the pre-industrial level) by the end of this century. Hence, the public needs to step up our efforts to save energy, conserve resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the public also needs to mitigate the impacts of climate change, including extreme weather, heat waves, drought and sea level rise. The Observatory will actively participate in and support the work of the Steering Committee on Climate Change chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration. The public will also continue to strengthen communication with the public and stakeholders to enhance their awareness and preparedness against climate change and extreme weather. For weather monitoring, the Observatory enhanced its Internet satellite imagery services today. The update frequency of satellite images covering eastern Asia has increased from once every 30 minutes to once every 10 minutes. High-resolution satellite imagery covering southern China and the South China Sea are also provided to show the weather conditions over Hong Kong and its vicinity more clearly. Furthermore, global mosaic satellite imagery and true colour imagery are also made available. For strengthening the monitoring of tropical cyclones, this year the Observatory will start using the new dropsonde technology on the aircraft of the Government Flying Service to fly into tropical cyclones over the northern part of the South China Sea to collect meteorological data. The dropsonde allows direct measurement of the vertical changes of pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction through the depth of the atmosphere, enhancing the forecasting capability for tropical cyclones. With the coming rain season, the Observatory plans to launch a new version of the Location-specific Lightning Alert Webpage in the second quarter of this year for members of the public to monitor thunderstorm activities in the vicinity of their locations. With more selectable outdoor activity sites and geographical information options, the new webpage will be particularly useful for property management and swimming pool operators. The Observatory will also enhance the provision of information on heavy rain to the public, and an alert will be sent via the media and mobile phone apps when localised areas are threatened by intense rain so that those affected could better appreciate the latest situation and be prepared. The Automatic Regional Weather Forecast webpage will also be enhanced later this year to provide thunderstorm nowcast in the next hour covering Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region. For the provision of weather information services, the Observatory launched on its website today real-time weather photos taken at Victoria Peak to provide the public and tourists with more weather information on local tourist destinations. The Observatory is also developing a ""Hong Kong Weather Information for Tourists"" webpage to provide one-stop weather information for tourism hot spots in Hong Kong to facilitate better planning of visits and trips. The roll-out of the webpage is expected within this year. For the dissemination channels of weather information, the Observatory will extend the ""MyObservatory"" app to wearable devices, and an updated version of the ""MyObservatory"" app for Apple Watch is expected to be launched mid-year. The Observatory is also planning to introduce later this year ""MetChat for the Day"" to offer gentle reminders to the public on weather, climate and related information through social media platforms and the ""MyObservatory"" app. The Observatory will also enhance its TV weather service in April, increasing the weather programmes from one to two sessions each morning at about 7am and 8am from Monday to Saturday for people going to school or work to get hold of the latest weather information. The programmes will be broadcast on the TV channels, and disseminated directly to members of the public via the ""MyObservatory"" app and the Observatory website. On public education, the major initiatives this year include: (1) The annual Open Day of the Hong Kong Observatory will take place on March 19 and 20 under the theme of the World Meteorological Day - ""Hotter. Drier. Wetter. Face the Future"". The event this year is also one of the highlight events under the ""Appreciate Hong Kong"" Campaign ( HYPERLINK http://www.hko.gov.hk/openday/2016/indexe.htm); www.hko.gov.hk/openday/2016/indexe.htm); (2) To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Science in the Public Service campaign, a roving exhibition on ""Climate Change - Our Response"" will be held at 10 different venues this year. A series of seminars on the applications of science in support of public services will also be organised; (3) A revamped climate change webpage has been launched today, providing relevant information and the latest projections and developments related to climate change. A new feature entitled ""Do you know ..."" is added, providing climate change knowledge in layman's terms to the public; and (4) An e-book on clouds is planned to be launched in the second quarter of this year to enhance the understanding and interest of the public, especially students and youngsters, on clouds. Lastly, Mr Shun announced the launch today of a new corporate video jointly produced with Radio Television Hong Kong, using the core values of the Observatory linked by the seven letters of the word ""science"" (Serve, Care, Innovate, Enthuse, Nurture, Collaborate and Excel) to introduce the development and services of the Observatory to the public ( HYPERLINK http://www.hko.gov.hk/abouthko/aboutus.htm www.hko.gov.hk/abouthko/aboutus.htm Mr Shun's speech at the press briefing is available at HYPERLINK http://www.hko.gov.hk/dhkovoice/speech20160315e.pdf www.hko.gov.hk/dhkovoice/speech20160315e.pdf .

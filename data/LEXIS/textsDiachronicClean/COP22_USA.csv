At the Conference, Governments, many represented at the highest level, issued the Marrakech Action Proclamation. This, as well as decisions adopted in Marrakech, powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all Governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible.The Secretary-General notes that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone.In Marrakech, parties advanced on the rule book for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The agreement entered into force on 4 November, years ahead of expectations. As of today, 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, have ratified the agreement.The Secretary-General applauds the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible towards a 100 per cent clean energy, climate-resilient future.As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. He also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA9","UNESCO SHOWCASES INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AT COP22","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO):The UNESCO Pavilion at the 2016 UN Conference on Climate Change (COP22) opened its doors today with a series of discussions on the solutions that indigenous knowledge can offer to tackle climate change, and how to best support particularly vulnerable local and indigenous communities. Over 400 million of the world's indigenous peoples live in territories that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Indigenous peoples of northern Europe, Siberia and Alaska, pastoralist communities in the Sahel, or island communities in the Pacific Ocean, to name but a few, are already experiencing adverse effects very keenly. Yet they are using their highly detailed knowledge, produced through direct experience over generations, to observe and respond actively to changing climatic conditions.Indigenous representatives presented the main conclusions of the international conference organized by UNESCO and CNRS in support of international efforts to implement the Paris Climate Agreement. Held on 2 and 3 November 2016, it focused on the role that indigenous and local knowledge can play, alongside science, in observing and responding to the impacts of a changing climate.UNESCO has long recognized that we need to bring together understandings, values and solutions from many horizons in order to tackle global challenges. ""Indigenous peoples respond, innovate and adapt to this context of change, and their resilience is rooted in their ways of life and their social solidarity"", stressed Flavia Schlegel, UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for the Natural Sciences. ""They will find a path, whatever the hardships, thanks to their trust in their deeply rooted cultures, and the strength of their observations and knowledge, which are both ancestral and innovative"".Collaboration between indigenous knowledge holders and mainstream scientific research can generate new co-produced knowledge that will enable effective action to cope with climate change. The similarities and differences between different knowledge systems must be better understood, in order to facilitate this collaboration. For example, extreme events are measured by Sami herders in terms of consequence, while climatologist will consider intensity. A series of low-intensity warm and cold spells, resulting in the formation of an ice crust on the snow that prevents reindeer for accessing their food, will be recorded as an extreme event by the Sami but not by climatologists.Indigenous observations and knowledge factor in elements that are often overlooked by scientific experts. In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists traditionally predict weather and climate through the observation of stars, winds, livestock, insects, birds, trees and other wildlife. The information is collected, shared and analyzed through traditional institutions, who triangulate various sources of information.Over generations, indigenous peoples have modified and maintained most of the world's 'wilderness' areas. Fire management, community forestry and indigenous soil enhancement practices have shaped landscapes across the globe. These traditional practices have the potential to enhance carbon sinks and provide benefits back to the communities; they provide tools for the sustainable management of nature. However, defining appropriate ways to engage indigenous knowledge at the intergovernmental level remains challenging, although international recognition of indigenous knowledge of the environment has accelerated, coupled with an increased awareness of the need to safeguard rights of indigenous peoples.A series of thematic days will be ogranized during COP22 at the UNESCO Pavilion in the Civil Society Area of the COP22 conference, to assist Member States through UNESCO's uniquely multidisciplinary expertise and outreach in climate change education, science, culture and communication, mobilizing efforts for enhanced climate change awareness and action.\l"

Mr Taalas presented the findings of WMO\' s statement on the global climate in 2011-2015, the hottest five-year period on record. The report, based on input from WMO Members and partners, was submitted to the United Nations , COP22, to give a longer-term picture of the climate and to address multi-year events like droughts. The report showed that, of 79 studies published by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society between 2011 and 2014, more than half found that human-induced climate change contributed to the extreme event in question. Some studies found that the probability of extreme heat increased by 10 times or more.

Hosted by the United Nations Global Compact, together with UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the secretariat of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the meeting was testament that responsible businesses across the world stand ready, willing and able to take climate action. Additional event partners included the Principles for Responsible Investment and La Conf\'e9d\'e9ration G\'e9n\'e9rale des Entreprises du Maroc. On the occasion of the\~High-Level Caring for Climate Meeting[3], UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged companies to further increase their commitment to climate action. 'Now it is time to turn words into deeds, to seize the opportunity before us for. We have no time to lose that is why Marrakech is critical for strengthening the global climate action agenda, ensuring that we close the gap to meet the below 2\'b0 pathway. And that's where business has an enormous role to play.' Over the course of the\~High-Level Meeting[4], participants mapped out how they plan to accelerate climate action and increase low-carbon investments at the country level. Business representatives shared proposals on how the private sector can support and reinforce national climate priorities on mitigation and adaptation and highlighted the inextricable link between addressing climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Commenting on the private sector's role in addressing climate change,\~Lise Kingo, Executive Director of the UN Global Compact[5], emphasized: 'The climate movement is unstoppable. More and more companies are taking action, and seeing new opportunities for growth and innovation. But we will need companies everywhere to urgently rise to the challenge if we are to achieve our climate goals and the broader 2030 sustainable development agenda. That is why we will increasingly focus our efforts on supporting private sector climate action at the country level.' Building on a decade of successfully engaging business on the international climate agenda, the UN Global Compact announced a new solutions platform\~Pathway to Low-Carbon ...silient Development\~[6]to mobilize the private sector to catalyze country-level action to meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The platform will help companies scale up climate action that contributes to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national SDG plans. The Pathway to Low-Carbon ...silient Development aims to set a new global standard of business leadership on climate while providing a space for companies to review, realign and recalibrate their corporate climate goals. Also today, the UN Global Compact together with partners released the\~2016 Status Report on the Business Contribution to Global Climate Action[7], an assessment of the impact of business initiatives on achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The report found that there are now 30 business-led initiatives registered on the UN-backed NAZCA climate portal, in total including more than 3,300 companies and organizations. Since COP 21, the number of businesses participating in these initiatives has increased by 17 percent and that 27 percent of these business participants have their headquarters in developing or transition economies. Outcomes from the 9 November\~Business and Industry Day[8]\~found that private sector engagement on climate action has grown notably, for example: 77 companies are now committed to the UN Global Compact Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing; 200 companies representing USD $4.8 trillion in market value and responsible for 627 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions per year have committed to set targets aligned with climate science; and a growing number of companies have agreed to the UN Global Compact's Commitment for Adaptation and Resilience launched in June 2016.

We must continue to look forward as words are nothing without action: we must scale-up investment and support the world's cities and regions who will make or break the Paris climate promises"" said Markku Markkula, President of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) - the EU's assembly of local and regional representatives.During the COP22During the climate talks in Marrakech two initiatives were launched by the UN's Climate Champions Hakima Al Haite and Laurence Tubiana to increase cooperation between all levels of government and accelerate the delivery of climate measures on the ground: the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the 2050 Pathways Platform . 'The UN's Climate Champions have worked hard to give cities and regions a stronger voice in the UN climate talks and put in place the finances needed to convert Paris commitments into bankable projects', said President Markkula.While the new Marrakech Partnership focuses on bolstering investments from 2017 to 2020, the 2050 Pathways Platform targets long-term deep decarbonisation action plans - both which the CoR had called for. President Markkula said, ""The EU must now show the way by updating the 2050 Roadmaps to ensure it complies with the Paris Agreement's obligations"". Six European regions have already joined the UN's 2050 Pathways Platform: Baden Wuerttemberg, Catalonia, Greater Manchester, North Rhine-Westphalia, Piedmont, Scotland&#8232;and Wales. 'And there are many more ready to join' President Markkula added.He also welcomed The Marrakech Action Proclamation adopted by Heads of State reaffirming their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and mobilise USD100 million annually by 2020. However, President Markkula warned, ""We still need more ambitious targets if we are to avert the devastation climate change will bring. The EU must upgrade its own commitment of cutting 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 50% instead of 40% by 2030. We must aim for a carbon neutral world by 2050'.Through initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, the world's local and regional governments are key to bridging the gap between governments' climate commitments and the Paris Agreement which seeks to keep temperatures rising well below 2degreeC. A total of 111 countries out of 197 parties to the UN climate convention have ratified the Paris agreement as the COP22 came to an end.Background:The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) set out its position on the COP22 climate negotiations in its opinion Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakech , led by Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia and Chair of the CoR's Commission for the Environment, Climate Change and Energy.The CoR and ARLEM - the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly - co-organsed several events at the COP22 such as the Climate Summit of Local and Regional Leaders and the Covenant of Mayors which is supported by many of the CoR's members showcasing the commitment of their cities and regions in implementing their climate action plans.Several initiatives to boost financing for both climate adaptation and mitigation were announced at the COP22. Among them is the Marrakech Investment Committee for Adaptation (MICA), the Initiative for Renewable Island Energy, the African Capital Markets, the renewal of the Global Environmental Facility and the European External Investment Plan (EEIP). According to the World Bank - which has announced in Marrakech to double its climate finance programme for the MENA region - adapting to climate change could cost $80 to $100 billion per year, 80% of which needs to be invested in cities in order to keep global warming under 2degreeC'.Speeches: CoR President Markkula: Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders, Marrakech ( HYPERLINK http://cor.europa.eu/en/about/president/Documents/Climate%20Summit%20for%20Local%20and%20Regional%20Leaders%2c%20Marrakech/COP-22-Speech-final-watermark.pdfhttp://cor.europa.eu/en/about/president/Documents/Climate%20Summit%20for%20Local%20and%20Regional%20Leaders%2c%20Marrakech/ HYPERLINK http://cor.europa.eu/en/about/president/Documents/Climate%20Summit%20for%20Local%20and%20Regional%20Leaders%2c%20Marrakech/COP-22-Speech-final-watermark.pdfCOP-22 -Speech-final-watermark.pdf CoR President Markkula: COP 22 - The Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy - A Global NetworkCopyright Targeted News Services30FurigayJof-5706394 30FurigayJof\l"

No part of the world can now avoid the fact that climate change is striking harder and faster than many scientists predicted, and that its impacts are taking a higher toll on the most vulnerable communities. As important as marking that the record is yet again broken, we need to loudly mark what needs to be done to hold back such destruction: we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. To make that clear, that means no new oil, coal or gas projects.Decades of progress from scientists and engineers has made renewable energy the cheapest and cleanest source of energy in the world, creating the technological momentum that is matched by the millions of people in all parts of the world demanding climate action. Elected representatives must heed this momentum - it won't cost the earth to keep fossil fuels in the ground, but it will cost the earth if they are dug up.""Around the world, weather events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires are causing the loss of human lives, threatening the livelihoods of millions and the natural systems.   Key climate impacts in 2016NOAA declared 2016 as the second hottest year on record in the United States.- 15 weather and climate disasters caused 138 deaths, $46B in damages.According to WMO's release, long-term indicators of human-caused climate change reached new heights in 2016, as carbon dioxide and methane concentrations surged to new records.Last november, WMO published a provisional statement for 2016 to inform the United Nations Climate Change conference taking place in Marrakech, Morocco (COP22). The final statement will be released in early 2017. For the first time, the assessment considers the humanitarian impact. The following impacts are highlighted in the statement:The most serious drought affected much of southern Africa.The Yangtze basin in China experienced, overall, its most significant flood season since 1999.Extreme heatwaves hit South Africa, and high temperatures set new national records in Kuwait, Iran, Thailand and India.The most damaging wildfire in Canadian history broke out near Fort McMurray, in Alberta.United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that weather-related hazards triggered 14.7 million displacements in 2015, and no region of the world remained unaffected.24 million people have been reported as being in a situation of food insecurity as a consequence of the droughts in eastern AfricaThe Great Barrier Reef suffered the worst bleaching on record with 92% of coral being affected.

They also expect the COP22 to result in concrete policy, technical and financial measures to make the Paris deal operational. 'We need to build on the Paris Agreement which was historic but is not enough. Local and regional governments are taking action and are ready to help but they need sustainable smart investment and a stronger role in the global governance on climate action"", Markku Markkula, President of the European Committee of the Regions said.The President of the European Committee of the Regions - the EU's assembly of local and regional representatives - was speaking during the COP22 Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders which gathered over 1,500 local and regional leaders from across the globe. During his speech, President Markkula said that though the Paris climate agreement set a 2 degree C warming limit, current commitments will see global temperatures increase by more than 3 degree C by the turn of the century. ""Climate change is a matter that goes beyond politics, across borders and is not something you can bargain with. All nations must uphold their climate commitments, take the necessary steps to ensure the sustainable transition of territories worldwide and go further, faster. We must aim to have a carbon-neutral world by 2050"", added President Markkula.Local and regional authorities have a central role in delivering climate action, being responsible for executing around 70% of climate change reduction measures and up to 90% of climate adaptation actions. Climate initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors will soon be the largest coalition of cities and regions, demonstrate that local governments surpass national government targets. This is critical in reaching the Paris objectives.""Cities and regions are key in bridging the gap between climate commitments and objectives"", said Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia who led the Committee's report 'Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakech '. ""We expect the climate talks to result in a global climate governance that formalises a permanent dialogue between cities and regions, national governments and UN bodies. It needs to show how binding targets will be monitored while closely tracking progress through common assessment mechanisms. We urgently need to integrate cities and regions' cuts in greenhouse gas emissions within National Determined Contributions (NDCs)"", concluded Pigliaru.Half of the world's population live in urban areas with cities emitting as much as half of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. According to the World Bank, adapting to climate change could cost $80 to $100 billion per year, 80% of which needs to be invested in cities in order to keep global warming under 2 degree C. Yet today's financing landscape does not provide local and regional authorities with suitable financial opportunities and the right technical support to develop climate projects. During the Summit, cities and regions set out recommendations to mobilise financial flows for locally-tailored climate projects: from increasing the volume of climate-compatible assets to further channelling direct-access to finance through public-private partnerships, creating financial hubs and supporting carbon pricing to boost low-carbon projects.Notes to editor:The COP22The European Committee of the Regions is also actively contributing to the special report on cities and regions that the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) is to deliver in 2023 as well as to closely cooperate with national states and the UNFCCC on the design of a decisive 'Action Plan for Cities and Regions'.The Committee has also welcomed the IPCC decision to organise a 'Cities and Climate Change Science Conference' in 2018. At , the IPCC has launched a call to host the conference to £ll cities recognised for their climate leadership' by January 15, 2017, The aim is to foster research and scientific evidence on cities and climate change in order to enable better climate policy-making at local level.

With U.S. leadership, we saw rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which puts us on an accelerated path towards implementation of our climate goals. We also secured an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of extremely potent greenhouse gases, and saw the adoption of a market-based-measure to set international aviation on the path to sustainable, carbon-neutral growth. The slogan ""FOR THE PLANET"" is projected on the Eiffel Tower as part of the COP21, United Nations in Paris, France, Friday, December 11, 2015. [AP Photo]Now, international government leaders, climate scientists, policy makers, non-governmental organizations and members of the business community are focused on implementation and action at COP22 which will be held in the vibrant and bustling city of Marrakech, Morocco.\~How is this COP different from others?COP22 will focus on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It presents an opportunity to showcase the progress that we have made over the last year. It is also an opportunity to push for ambitious action to reduce emissions -- as well the reporting and communications on countries' progress toward their meeting climate goals. COP22 will also showcase the many actions that non-state actors - like provinces, cities, businesses, and civil society -- are already taking in response to climate change, heeding the signal sent by world leaders that a fundamental shift to a low carbon economy is coming.\~How can I learn more about what the United States is doing at COP22?

'In the time I've spent in public life, one of the things I've learned is that some issues look a bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail.' Trump, on the campaign trail as the Republican nominee, spoke of ripping up the Paris Agreement on reducing greenhouse gasses. Shortly after his surprise victory Trump appointed climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to lead his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. 'Climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place,' Kerry said and explained it is not such an issue for leaders at the Pentagon, the U.S. intelligence community, corporate executives and local politicians. In the audience at Kerry's speech were representatives of the U.N., officials of numerous countries, members of U.S. congressional committees, and environmentalists who spoke among themselves about the uncertainly of American leadership on environmental issues under a President Trump. 'I hope the president-elect will listen to [Kerry's] advice,"" Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan told VOA. Morgan said, 'I have not felt fear' among the international community attending COP22 that the climate change mitigation goals in the Paris Agreement are jeopardized by the impending change of administration in Washington.But Greenpeace and other environmental groups are applauding indications by China it is committed to the agreement. 'One of the country's high level diplomats has assured us that climate actions will continue in China regardless of the U.S. political situation,' said Li Shuo, the climate policy advisor for Greenpeace China. In response to reassuring comments made at the COP22 news conference by the Chinese delegation Li remarked, 'Inside every crisis is an opportunity. China has seized this.' Kerry, in his speech which received a standing ovation, said despite the international consensus there is still no guarantee that the critical goals set will be met, even holding temperature increases to two degrees warming, which many scientists say is a tipping point.'And if we fall short, it will be the greatest instance in modern history of a generation in a time of crisis, abdicating responsibility for the future,' Kerry asserted. 'And it won't just be a policy failure; because of the nature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequence.' Kerry, who has long championed action on climate change, spoke at the conference after an ""awe-inspiring"" trip to Antarctica, where he took a helicopter ride to view the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. COP22, attended by 25,000 delegates, was intended to be a celebration of sorts, with the focus on implementation after years of negotiation, in which the United States played a key leadership role. \l"

The current summit in Marrakech, Morocco is geared to implementation of the pledges all signatory countries made. Echoing the prevalent spirit at the COP, the Paris Agreement is irreversible and inaction would be a disaster for the world.Transforming agriculture - maximizing benefitsBoosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people.Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services; and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation.""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" FAO's Director-General said. ""Countries are recognizing this potential with unprecedented commitments.""Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added.A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate actionFeaturing agriculture-focused initiatives, today's special event co-organized by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Haite (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals.In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, today FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change.Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time.Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative.""At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far.The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative.That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particure, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he said.Cost of inaction far outweighs actionThe world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change.\l"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA22","NEW UN INITIATIVE AIMS TO SAVE LIVES AND CUT CLIMATE CHANGE BY PROTECTING PEATLANDS","November 17, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations:A new global initiative was launched today at the United Nations (COP 22) under way in Marrakech, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and save thousands of live by protecting peatlands the largest terrestrial organic soil carbon stock. According to the UN environment Programme (UNEP), the Global Peatlands Initiative seeks mobilize governments, international organizations and academia in an effort to protect peatlands, which contain almost 100 times more carbon than tropical forests. If global temperatures continue to rise, this could lead to thawing permafrost, switching boreal and Arctic peatlands from carbon sinks to sources, resulting in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and potentially causing climate change to spiral out of control. Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment stressed that despite the Paris Agreement, global temperatures will rise over 3 degrees Celsius this century. ""This will cause misery and chaos for millions of vulnerable people, so we cannot afford to let any opportunity to reduce emissions slip by,"" he added. Mr. Solheim also urged taking action through the Global Peatlands Initiative, as it is ""critical we do not reach the tipping point that will see peatlands stop sinking carbon and start spewing it into the atmosphere, destroying any hope we have of controlling climate change."" UNEP said that peatlands are coming under increased threat from conversion for palm oil and pulp wood production, which may result in environmental problems such as enormous fires in Indonesia and Russia in recent years. In recent years, Indonesia has suffered from peat forest fires, resulting in greater emissions than the daily ones from the entire United States economy. However, emission is not the only negative impact of peatland degradation. The 2015 peat fires in Indonesia may have indirectly killed up to 100,000 people through the toxic haze, in addition to causing $16.1 billion in economic damage, according to recent studies. Therefore, with support from over a dozen partners, a UN Environment team launched the largest effort on peat so far, called the Global Peatlands Initiative, which aims to increase the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of peatlands in countries with significant peat deposits. The initiative was launched at the Global Landscapes Forum, the leading side event of the UN's COP22 climate change talks in Marrakech, Morocco. The Global Peatlands Initiative was founded by the governments of Indonesia, Peru, the Republic of Congo, UNEP, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, CIFOR, Wetlands International, UNEP-WCMC, GRID-Arendal, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, European Space Agency, WRI, Greifswald Mire Centre and StarVision/Sateligence.\l"

The International Symposium of the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the United Nations 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), held during COP 22, discussed how to advance Sustainable Tourism in a Changing Climate.The Symposium aimed at increasing awareness on tourism and climate change-related issues and encourage the sector to engage in actions that reinforce national commitments to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.""The tourism sector is both a vector and a victim of climate change and we are fully committed to contribute to reach the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. This event was essential to advance this agenda, especially the discussion on measurement and reporting requirements as a basis for identifying and prioritizing climate action in tourism"", said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai.""Sustainable tourism creates opportunities and assembles partners to help transform the industry towards low emissions and more efficient and less polluting operations. We must make tourism and every other industry contributor to our climate change action and a sustainable future"", said Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, in her video address to the event.The event focused in particular in the need for partnerships with the private sector and the role of sustainable transportation to accelerate climate action in tourism.""Climate change can only be addressed if actors from all parts of society - governments, businesses, NGOs and consumers - make a global and broad shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. Accounting for 10% of GDP, 7% of the world's exports and one in 11 jobs, tourism is one of the main economic sectors in the world, and as such has to be at the core of this essential transition,"" said Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of the 10YFP Secretariat.The International Symposium was part of the 3-day COP22 Tourism Side Events organized by the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme and hosted by the Ministry of Tourism of Morocco.

Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, said 'COP22 will be an action and implementation COP. As the world's poorest countries, the LDC group calls for fair and ambitious action. We must build upon the foundations set in Paris to construct robust rules to support the Agreement's implementation.' Noting with concern that full implementation of current pledges by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions puts the world on track for 3-3.5\'b0C of warming above pre-industrial levels, Mr Mpanu-Mpanu said: 'Science tells us that beyond temperature increases of 1.5\'b0C the future of our planet stands on increasingly thin ice. It is imperative for communities across the world that countries take seriously their goal to pursue efforts to keep temperatures below 1.5\'b0C. We cannot afford to treat this as an aspirational goal. An upwards spiralling of commitments to cut emissions that is both fair and proportionate to challenge rising before us is vital.' LDCs plan to contribute to these global efforts through the LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative (REEEI) for Sustainable Development, among other ways. Mr Mpanu-Mpanu said: 'the upcoming launch of the LDC REEEI in Marrakech demonstrates the continued commitment of the LDC group to real solutions that benefit real people on the ground. The Initiativewill enable LDCs to leapfrog fossil fuel based energy and generate prosperity by bringing modern, clean, resilient energy systems to millions of energy-starved people.' LDCs are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with hazards including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, increased drought and floods and the spread of tropical diseases threatening health and food security. 'As LDCs, we lack the resources and capacity to adequately protect our communities from the devastating impacts of climate change. In Marrakech we seek greater commitment from developed countries to provide financial support, technology and capacity building to enable LDCs to respond to the climate crisis,' Mr Mpanu-Mpanu said.

The first woman [...] Mary Robinson, the U.N. special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate. Credit: Fabiola Ortiz/IPSBy Fab\'edola OrtizMARRAKECH, Nov 18 2016 (IPS)The world has been too slow in responding to climate events such as El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a, and those who are the least responsible are the ones suffering most , Mary Robinson, the special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, told IPS at the United Nations in Marrakech (COP22).The first woman President of Ireland (1990-1997) and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (1997-2002), Robinson was appointed earlier this year by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the new mandate involving climate change and El Ni\'f1o. I ve seen a window into a new normal and it is very serious. Mary RobinsonDuring the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Robinson strongly advocated for engaging community-led solutions and for incorporating gender equality and women s participation in the climate talks. Global warming is accelerating too much and it is being aggravated by El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a. They do not have to become a humanitarian disaster, but people have now been left to cope for themselves I think we were too slow in many instances and this has become a humanitarian disaster for the 60 million people who are food insecure and suffering from droughts, she said.El Ni\'f1o has been directly associated with droughts and floods in many parts of the world that have severely impacted millions of livelihoods. A warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific waters, the phenomenon occurs on average every three to seven years and sea surface temperatures across the Pacific can warm more than 1 degree C.El Ni\'f1o is a natural occurrence, but scientists believe it is becoming more intense as a result of global warming.How El Ni\'f1o interacts with climate change is not 100 percent clear, but many of the countries that are now experiencing El Ni\'f1o are also vulnerable to climate variations. According to Robinson, El Ni\'f1o and its climate-linked emergencies are a threat to human security and, therefore, a threat to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced in September 2015 as the 2030 Agenda replacing the Millennium Development Goals. I have gone to Central America to the dry corridor in Honduras and have seen women crying because there is no water and they feel very neglected. They feel they are left behind and that nobody seems to know about them. I saw in Ethiopia severely malnourished children, it could affect them for life in terms of being stunted. The same thing in southern Africa. I feel I ve seen a window into a new normal and it is very serious. We need to understand the urgency of taking the necessary steps, Robinson said.Drought and flooding associated with El Ni\'f1o created enormous problems across East Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Pacific. Ethiopia, where Robinson has visited earlier this year, is experiencing its worst drought in half a century. One million children in Eastern and Southern Africa alone are acutely malnourished.It is very likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015, according to an assessment released at the COP22 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary data shows that 2016 s global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El Ni\'f1o event.These long-term changes in the climate have exacerbated social, humanitarian and environmental pressures. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees pointed that in 2015, more than 19 million new displacements were associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. We need a much more concerted response and fund preparedness. If we have a very strategic early warning system, we can deal with the problem much more effectively. Building resilience in communities is the absolute key. We need to invest in support for building resilience now rather than having a huge humanitarian disaster, stressed Robinson.On Nov. 17, during the COP22 in Marrakech, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) a coalition led by France, Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada launched at the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015 announced a new goal to mobilise more than 30 million dollars by July 2017 and 100 million by 2020.The international partnership aims to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific. The idea is to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events.There will be a special focus on women, who are particularly vulnerable to climate menaces but are the protagonists in building resilience. Now we ve moved from the Paris negotiations to implementation on the ground. Building resilience is key and it must be done in a way that is gender sensitive with full account of gender equality and also human rights. We must recognize the role of women as agents for change in their communities, Robinson emphasised.The number of climate-related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years, said Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS, We can see already in Africa the impact of climate change that is undermining our efforts to bring food security for all. Take the example of El Ni\'f1o that has affected all of Africa in the last two years. Countries that had made fantastic progress like Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar are now suffering hunger again. Countries that have eradicated hunger are back to face it again. We need to adapt. Climate change has different impacts on men and women, girls and boys, told IPS Edith Ofwona, the senior program specialist at International Development Research Centre (IDRC).Related Articles HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/mideast-climate-change-will-make-a-difficult-situation-much-worse/Mideast: Climate Change Will Make a Difficult Situation Much Worse http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/convincing-investors-to-unlock-africas-green-energy-potential/Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa s Green Energy Potential{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/adaptation-funding-a-must-for-africa/Adaptation Funding a Must for AfricaTags: HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/advancing-deserts/Advancing Deserts, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/biodiversity/biodiversity, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/climate-change/climate change, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/climate-change-adaptation/climate change adaptation HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/climate-resilience/climate resilience, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/cop22/COP22, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/development-aid/Development & Aid, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/el-nino/El Ni\'f1o, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/environment/Environment, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/food-agriculture/Food & Agriculture, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/global/global, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/headl"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA46","F. HOLLANDE: ""COP22 IN MARRAKESH MUST BE THE COP OF SOLUTIONS.""","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Embassy of France in Washington:Speech by the President of the French Republic at the opening of the 2016 United Nations in Morocco (COP22)Barely a year ago, COP21 was taking place in Paris. I wanted it to be organized in France. I was fully aware of the difficulties we faced. I remembered a number of failures but knew what high hopes there were.However, on 12 December 2015, in exceptional, even appalling circumstances, since terrorist attacks had taken place in Paris, many heads of state and government came, worked, and concluded a historic agreement.The agreement was historic, and what we have to say here is that the agreement is irreversible.It's irreversible legally speaking. It came into force on November 4. More than 100 states, accounting for two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified it.I welcome the efforts led by Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary-General, and Segol ne Royal, COP President, to arrive at that result in record time and at an international agreement of that scope.The agreement is also irreversible in practice, because governmentsthe ones you're representing, businesses, non-governmental organizations and citizens of the world are taking initiatives, launching projects and coming up with concrete solutions enabling us to combine the fight against global warming with development.We're going to move inexorably towards a much lower-carbon model. Already 90% of new electricity is produced by renewable energy sources.More than 70 countries and thousands of businesses have committed themselves to a coalition which has set itself the goal of doubling the share of global emissions covered by a carbon price by 2030. Even the world of finance has committed itself to the process: 80 billion-worth of green bonds has been raised and France itself will set an example by being the first country to issue them, at the start of the year [2017], for investments in the environment and energy transition. That's why the agreement is irreversible legally and practically speaking.Moreover, it is irreversible in people's minds. The climate emergency didn't end in Paris on 12 December 2015. The past few months have been the hottest in modern history and the link has been established between [global] warming caused by manhumansand [natural] disasters. Everyone now knows that if we don't do anything, rising sea levels will flood islands and coasts, including the most populated on our planet. Doing nothing would be catastrophic for the world, terrible for future generations and dangerous for peace.Millions of people would be displaced, [there would be] conflictswe're already experiencing themlinked to access to water and resources, then in Africa, famine linked to drought, which could affect millions of people who, to survive, would be forced to migrate in the hope of finding adequate resources elsewhere to feed themselves.So, taking action for the climate means ensuring the security and stability of the world. I've come here to Marrakesh not to go back over Paris, but to call for coherence and perseverance. The Paris Agreement is the work of everyone. It belongs to everyone, it depends on everyone, it is in the interest of everyone.Barack Obama's role in securing an agreement in Paris was crucial, particularly when it came to decisions taken with China and other countries. The United States, the world's leading economic power and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter, must honor the commitments that were made. It's not only its duty, it's in its interestthat of the American people, who are being hit by climate disruption, because no country is immune. It's also in the interest of American businesses, which have invested in the ecological transition. It's also the desire of cities and federal states, which made active efforts to support us in the climate agreement.FranceI assure you of this herewill hold this dialogue with the United States and its new president, openly, with respect, but with insistence and determination and on behalf of the 100 countries that have already ratified the Paris Agreement.I also want to make an appeal for perseverance. We're all gathered with the aim of limiting temperature rises to below 2C and, if possible, 1.5C. But I assure you, we must move faster. Move faster so that we can implement the Paris Agreement more quickly than plannedeven before 2018. Move faster to implement our national contributions. There too, France wants to set an example and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. Likewise, those same emissions will be cut fourfold by 2050. Moving faster, ever faster. We're also going to close coal-fired power stations by 2023, because we're conscious that time is needed, a transition is needed, but that we must also have this goal.We want to set a carbon price; 22 in 2016, more in 2030. But we must have the determination to be carbon neutral by 2050. I know that not all countries are ready. But France has decided to take the lead in this ""carbon neutral coalition"" by 2050.COP22 in Marrakesh must be the COP of solutions. It must make Africa's future among the top priorities. The world owes the African continent an ecological debt. Of the 50 countries worst afflicted by global warming, 36 are in sub-Saharan Africa.That's why I wanted an Agenda 2020 for Africa to be implemented; the aim is to provide all Africans with access to electricity. An Africa Renewable Energy Initiative was launched in Paris at COP21. 10 billion was promised ; France will provide 2 billion of this over the next five years. But I know this commitment will be exceeded.We now have a road map. The African Development Bank has implemented the procedures; 240 projects have been identified by the COP21 President. We'll make sure to spur the European Union into action, because the destinies of Africa and Europe are linked.Finally, what persuaded many of those who were hesitant to sign the Paris Agreement was the fact that the most developed countries made commitments and above all fulfilled them. The $100 billion by 2020 will be delivered. We must do everything to mobilize it. There too, France will keep its word ; our annual climate finance will be $5 billion a year by 2020, including $1 billion for adaptation.Ladies and gentlemen, I know what this meeting may represent for many people. The idea that the bulk of the work was done in Paris and only the implementation remains to be carried out: nothing could be more wrong. It's now that everything is beginningespecially in the world we know. A world going through terrible ordeals. A world full of uncertainties, with conflicts, threats, terrorism, civilians who are suffering, poverty and massive inequalities.That's why, for those who trade in fear, the world has become an ideal breeding ground. Doubts may sometimes exist as to the international community's ability [to respond]. There may be questions about globalization, which must be brought under control. I'm aware of all the problems that may sometimes prey on our peoples.But there are also reasons for hope, and the Paris Agreement is one. It's proof that the international community can overcome its divisions, take action and protect what we hold most dear.So, Your Majesty, heads of state and government, Secretary-General, delegates, you can't break a promise of hope. You must fulfill it. You must champion it. Here in Marrakesh, we're the guardians of the letter and spirit of the Paris Agreement. We'll keep it alive, because what unites usover and above our differences, our beliefs, religions, situations and modes of developmentis what we share, and that is quite simply our planet.Thank you.\l"

""Frequent power cuts were a norm while I was growing up. In peak summer months, we would not get power for eight to 10 hours a day. And this was still in a town,"" he says.Following his undergraduate studies at India Institute of Technology Roorkee, Singh became more interested in understanding energy and environmental policymaking, while working at a petroleum refinery. Then, as a research associate at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) South Asia office in Mumbai, he worked on environmental regulation reform projects in India, including a pilot emissions trading scheme for industrial particulate matter emissions, conducted with India's Ministry of Environment and Forests. At J-PAL, he also carried out an impact evaluation of public disclosure of industrial air pollution ratings, for which he analyzed emissions data from more than 5,000 firms and worked closely with his team and with regulators to secure approval for a new disclosure program.As he made field visits to some of the most polluted industrial clusters in India, he learned how nuanced the issues can be. ""In India it is common to hold strong positions favoring or opposing development. But that's not helpful, as it's not an either-or question,"" he says. ""Smart policies can be designed that encourage growth while limiting the impact on natural environment and climate. And India already has several forward-looking policies in place.""His work motivated him to come to MIT, where he arrived with a desire to focus on climate and energy policy research for developing countries, but he was not yet sure exactly where his studies would take him.When Karplus learned of a call for researchers to present at COP22 with the RINGO constituency, she alerted Singh, who applied and was selected to present.In Marrakech, Singh shared preliminary findings from his model, which offer initial insights into how carbon pricing and renewable energy support policies compare in terms of their impact on carbon dioxide emissions, the energy system, and the economy. To finalize his research, he plans to expand the model's specifications to reflect policy priorities and physical constraints, especially on details in technology choices. He is also investigating the political and economic factors that drive these choices, and viable design options for increasing the political feasibility of cost-effective policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.While at COP22""I am so pleased and proud that Arun had the opportunity to represent our group in Marrakech. By interacting with diverse stakeholders at the COP, Arun has been able to share his research on India with the world, and compare and contrast its insights with experiences in other countries,"" Karplus says.At MIT, Singh co-leads a student group, Energy for Human Development (e4Dev), with fellow graduate student Turner Cotterman, bringing together members of the MIT community to advance understanding of issues facing the developing world, with guest lectures from notable experts, outreach programs, and educational opportunities. He plans to share his COP22 experience with the group.Singh's first experience with UN climate negotiations has been ""overwhelming,"" he says, from the efforts that go into organizing the COP to how the complex negotiation process functions.""It's very encouraging to see enthusiastic participation of all countries and the near unanimous recognition of climate change as a problem requiring strong collective efforts,"" he says. ""There's no room for skepticism or delaying action.""Singh looks forward to continuing to play a role in informing energy and climate solutions for India with his research, as part of the MIT community dedicated to making a better world.\l"

Smart policies can be designed that encourage growth while limiting the impact on natural environment and climate. And India already has several forward-looking policies in place. His work motivated him to come to MIT, where he arrived with a desire to focus on climate and energy policy research for developing countries, but he was not yet sure exactly where his studies would take him. He started in 2015 as a graduate student in the Technology and Policy Program  which is now part of the Institute for Data Systems and Society  working with Karplus to study policies and regulation in the electricity sector in India, with funding from the MIT Energy Initiative. Then, an opportunity arose to help Karplus and Winchester develop the energy-economic model he now works on as a fellow of the Tata Center for Technology and Design and research assistant in the MIT Joint Program. When Karplus learned of a call for researchers to present at with the RINGO constituency, she alerted Singh, who applied and was selected to present. In Marrakech, Singh shared preliminary findings from his model, which offer initial insights into how carbon pricing and renewable energy support policies compare in terms of their impact on carbon dioxide emissions, the energy system, and the economy. To finalize his research, he plans to expand the model\' s specifications to reflect policy priorities and physical constraints, especially on details in technology choices. He is also investigating the political and economic factors that drive these choices, and viable design options for increasing the political feasibility of cost-effective policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. While at COP22, Singh also had the opportunity to interview developers, investors, and aid organizations that are involved in the expansion of renewable energy in Morocco, supporting Karplus as she contributes to an upcoming book on the commercialization of renewable energy in several African countries.  I am so pleased and proud that Arun had the opportunity to represent our group in Marrakech. By interacting with diverse stakeholders at the COP, Arun has been able to share his research on India with the world, and compare and contrast its insights with experiences in other countries, Karplus says. At MIT, Singh co-leads a student group, Energy for Human Development (e4Dev), with fellow graduate student Turner Cotterman, bringing together members of the MIT community to advance understanding of issues facing the developing world, with guest lectures from notable experts, outreach programs, and educational opportunities. He plans to share his COP22 experience with the group. Singh\' s first experience with UN climate negotiations has been  overwhelming, he says, from the efforts that go into organizing the COP to how the complex negotiation process functions.  It\' s very encouraging to see enthusiastic participation of all countries and the near unanimous recognition of climate change as a problem requiring strong collective efforts, he says.  There\' s no room for skepticism or delaying action. Singh looks forward to continuing to play a role in informing energy and climate solutions for India with his research, as part of the MIT community dedicated to making a better world.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA49","Cakarmis '17 goes to COP22","December 2, 2016 Friday","The Scarlet and Black: Grinnell College","Earlier this month, the international community gathered in Marrakesh, Morocco, for COP22 - a climate change conference following up on the agreement reached one year ago at COP21 in Paris. Grinnell's own Tea Cakarmis '17, who previously worked with the UN agency on Education, Science and Culture was invited by UNESCO and the nation of Palau to participate in the conference. This week, The S&B's Michael Cummings sat down with Cakarmis to discuss her experience in Marrakesh and the future of climate change policy.The S&B: What is COP22 and how does it relate to COP21?Tea Cakarmis: COP22 was intended to be an explanation of how the implementation of COP21 will take place. COP21 in a lot of ways is an ideological promise, we've agreed that climate change is human-caused, that it is something where the science is very conclusive and also something that we need to act on. However, the way you go about it has consistently throughout the COPs been where a deal breaks or makes. In Marrakesh they were discussing how to actually put COP21 into action.The S&B: How did you end up going to Marrakesh this year?TC: I was [working] with UNESCO and I was working with the delegation of Palau. Since day one of my internship, the Paris Agreements were just signed. I started working in February, so it was really, really fresh. The agreement is indisputably one of the biggest accomplishments that have been done since the forming of the UN framework on climate change, [but] the small island states still did not feel as if it was reflective of how alarming the situation is. We talk about 2 degrees Celsius and small island states formed their own sort of aspirational alliance for 1.5 degrees because that's really the only thing that they find could even maybe possibly be satisfying. So we started working on how we could represent them, creatively, outside just the actual official delegations in Marrakesh. Then we came up with a project and when my internship ended they were like, ""Oh, how about you join us in Marrakesh?"" I didn't really think that that was even possible, and it was in the middle of my school year and everything, but then it just sort of worked out. It was amazing.Tea Cakarmis '17 represented Palau at COP22 in Marrakesh, Morocco. Photo contributed.The S&B: What were your responsibilities while in Marrakesh?TC: I personally was in charge of decorating the booth that the delegation of Palau had. ... We were trying to bridge the gap of distance, and so before the conference started I concluded a partnership with Disney France. We actually got them to create a clip for the small island nations specifically for COP, where they featured their new cartoons, animated movies, where it's either an endangered species or just generally island people who are featured in it. It's four spin-offs of ""Finding Nemo."" The other part of it is, we wanted to keep it as digital as possible, but we couldn't do that all the way. We had a partnership with Fondation Cousteau - that's Cousteau the oceanographer - their foundation sort of represents data visually really successfully. What we wanted to show is the human consequence on the ocean. We wanted it to be both engaging in terms of the beauty of the ocean, but also the extent of the human impact on the ocean. We had 10 photos that were the size of one and a half by two meters, so the size of me and bigger, that were placed around - we had our own improvised exhibit space. What I did was basically arrange that space, arrange for the materials to be shipped, the logistical part of that.The S&B: How will a Trump presidency affect international climate change policy?TC: The U.S. delegation [at COP22] was very firm in saying it is business as usual, meaning business as Obama left it. They were very deliberate in saying that Paris is formed in a way that even if you want to pull out of it, you already made your promises that you're going to have to uphold for at least three years, which is luckily how much [Trump's] mandate takes. So even if Trump wants to pull out of Paris, he won't be seeing the benefits of it, or what he believes the benefits can be, until the end of his mandate. So unless he is reelected, pulling out of Paris will not do anything for him as a president.\l"

This year is a pivotal COP, focusing on implementing the historic Paris Agreement from 2015. The COP started with significant shudders as people around the world internalized America's decision to elect Donald Trump as President. Trump, after all, has not been a vocal proponent of the action needed to protect the planet from catastrophic climate change. What I found heartening in this year's COP experience is the continued resilience of climate negotiators, especially those from developing and small island states as well as the ongoing tenacity of NGOs that work valiantly on mitigation and adaptation efforts around the world. Even more so, I was proud of the business engagement. In a mere three days, Ceres, a non-profit organization advocating for sustainability leadership, coordinated an open letter from the business community indicating its support of the Paris Agreement. 365 companies signed on including DuPont, Gap Inc., General Mills, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hilton, HP Inc., Kellogg Company, Levi Strauss ...., L'Oreal USA, Mars Incorporated, Starbucks, VF Corporation, and Unilever.

As climate talks progress in Marrakech, Euro-Mediterranean local and regional authorities have gathered at COP22 to discuss how stronger cooperation in energy and sustainable economic development can boost growth while building resilience to climate change. The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) and the Euro-Mediterranean Local and Regional Assembly (ARLEM) are promoting the Covenant of Mayors during COP22 negotiations to show its value as a replicable model for the implementation of the Paris agreement and the low-carbon transition of territories.COP22 has hosted the second meeting of the Commission for Sustainable Territorial Development of ARLEM, composed of 80 local and regional representatives from the EU and 15 Mediterranean partners. Contributing to the ongoing climate talks in Marrakech, ARLEM has brought two thematic reports into the discussion table: 'Energy and climate change in the Mediterranean Region' by rapporteur Mohamed Sadiki, Mayor of Rabat and 'Cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean', drawn up by Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia. The meeting was chaired by Karim Bennour, President of the Popular Assembly of the Wilaya of Algiers.'Cooperation in the energy sector and the transition towards a low-carbon economy can foster growth and stability in the Euro-Mediterranean region. We need to keep developing sustainable climate projects in energy, transport, forests, resilience, biodiversity and water that are viable and bankable', declared Mohamed Sadiki, Mayor of Rabat. 'We believe the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is the best placed institution to set up sustainable energy funds that boost public-private investments. We also call for an integrated and optimised regional energy market for the Euro-Mediterranean region', concluded Mohamed Sadiki.'Recent political transformations in the Mediterranean are threatening economic development and social cohesion. Enhanced cross-boarder cooperation is key to foster economic dynamism, boost technology transfer and bring innovation forward to create jobs and reduce poverty', said President of Sardinia Francesco Pigliaru during ARLEM's meeting at COP22.'For that purpose, it is essential to support efficient and effective decentralization processes and reinforce the capacities of local and regional authorities to lead cross-border cooperation programmes' added Francesco Pigliaru. The Region of Sardinia is since 2007 the leader of a 209 million EU programme on cross-boarder cooperation in the Mediterranean sea basin involving over 130 Regions from 13 Mediterranean Pigliaru's report is a concrete input to both COP22 climate discussions and the ongoing reform of the European Neighbourhood Policy.ARLEM is to adopt both reports in Malta in February 2017. The Euro-Mediterranean assembly will be present at the Union for the Mediterranean ministerial meeting on energy to be held 1 December 2016 in Rome. Ministers will discuss energy cooperation in the Mediterranean and the ways to scaling up energy investments in the region.As a replicable model to boost sustainable energy investments and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, the European Committee of the Regions presented the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy yesterday during COP22. The objective is to stress the added value of the Covenant in the Southern Mediterranean, Sub-Saharan and Western African countries. The event saw a groundbreaking declaration from the Western African Economic and Monetary Union, committed to mobilize its 3300 municipalities to join the Covenant. The CoR will follow up with its partners and the European Commission on this exceptional commitment.A new multi-level governance that monitors the implementation of the Paris agreement and climate finance are the two main issues at stake in Marrakech. The conclusions of the COP22 climate negotiations are to be issued Friday 18 November.Background:EU's Assembly of local and regional representatives ARLEM brings together 80 Members from the EU and its 15 Mediterranean partners who are representatives of regions and local bodies and hold a regional or local authority mandate. ARLEM is chaired by a co-presidency equally representing the Mediterranean partners and the EU.

We are facing challenging times and we need experience, and we need a high profile, both of which you have,"" he said.HE El-Mhamdi said that apart from wanting to wish HE Barkindo well in his new responsibilities, his visit was also in connection with the upcoming Conference of the Parties (COP 22) meeting to be held in Morocco on 7-18 November 2016.""It is a tremendous event for us and I have been instructed by my government to conduct an outreach campaign for OPEC as I know already that the Organization will again be involved in the talks,"" he affirmed.In thanking the Ambassador for his kind words and support, HE Barkindo pointed out that the climate change meetings were a priority for OPEC since the Organization had been involved in the negotiations since the establishment of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee by the United Nations General Assembly in 1991.It was this Committee that negotiated the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The Treaty entered into force in March 1994 and was presented to the first Conference of the Parties (COP1) meeting in Berlin, in 1995.""The convention was the bible of our negotiations,"" commented Barkindo, adding that it led to the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 and entered into force in February 2005.""All this was made possible because of the active and constructive participation of all developing countries and OPEC,"" he maintained.Barkindo pointed out that he had been Vice President at COP 1 in Berlin, working alongside former research scientist Angela Merkel, the current German Chancellor.""I actually attended and negotiated as Vice Present on several occasions from COP 1 in Berlin to COP 15 in Copenhagen. So you can see that these negotiations are very personal to me.""He was obviously delighted that the Paris Agreement, seen as a major breakthrough in the climate change debate, was reached at COP 21 in Paris in 2015.Turning to Morocco and the host of COP 22, HE Barkindo said he not only considered the Kingdom dear as an African nation, but also as a key developing country that had participated very closely in crafting the convention as well as the Kyoto Treaty in Japan.""I know the position of Morocco very well and it is similar to most developing countries and OPEC,"" he stated.HE Barkindo reiterated that OPEC had been actively involved in all the COP meetings and the Secretary General regularly participated in the high-level segment of the discussions, held towards the end of each conference.""We intend to continue with this tradition in Marrakesh. Our experts and officials will have a meeting room there and they will convene meetings for OPEC Member Countries and other developing states. It is very important for the OPEC Secretariat to be in Marrakesh and I personally look forward to attending the high-level segment,"" he stated.He stressed that Morocco was already an important contributor to the climate change negotiations having convened an earlier meeting in Marrakesh, which he attended, and at which the Marrakesh Accord, a very important agreement in the process after Kyoto, was agreed upon.HE Barkindo told his guests that with the likely attendance of some 200 countries, COP22 would be a heavy responsibility. But he was confident that Morocco, with its long and proud history, and Marrakesh, with all its experience of hosting previous high-level international meetings, would prove the ideal setting for the talks.""All OPEC delegates will be supportive of the efforts of the Moroccan Presidency at COP 22,"" he assured.Also addressing the meeting, Ms. Haddaoui observed that in connection with COP 22 the Moroccan Presidency was working very closely with the French Presidency that hosted COP 21 in 2015, in order to maintain the same high standards set by the French authorities.""It is very important ahead of COP 22 that we know the expectations of OPEC and its Member Countries and to make sure that all countries' views, visions and points of view are considered. We therefore look forward to keeping very close contacts with OPEC to enable us to get a better understanding of what the Organization requires. Hopefully this is just the first in a series of meetings on the subject,"" she said.Ms. Haddaoui presented the Secretary General with up-to-date information from the Moroccan Presidency concerning all aspects of , listing its priorities, its vision, its overall aims and objectives, in addition to the organizational aspects and general information.She also pointed to the website of COP 22 which offered valuable information about all the meetings due to be held in the lead up to the main conference.HE Barkindo invited his visitors to attend OPEC's customary pre-COP Coordination Meeting in October, adding that this would be attended by COP negotiators from OPEC Member Countries who would benefit from the views of officials representing the Moroccan Presidency.\l"

It is of utmost importance for us to send a clear message to the global community that we must all be part of the global climate solution, he said at the conclusion of the meeting on November 18. We are pleased that the Marrakech Conference was able to achieve some clarity, and good progress has been made. This include the adoption of the Terms of Reference and initial work plan for the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB); the established linkage between technology mechanism and the financial mechanism; the indicative framework for the five-year rolling work plan of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM); and the conclusion of the Third Comprehensive Review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building under the Convention and under the Kyoto Protocol.Nonetheless, he warned, there remain outstanding issues which require further discussion after Marrakech.The Group has placed a priority on scaling up of finance, in particular adaptation finance. There can be no enhanced action without enhanced support. Support enables action and action needs support. Enhanced action needs enhanced support in the provision of scaled-up financial resources, technology and capacity-building. Action must cover both adaptation and mitigation, the Special Representative declared.He reiterated that adaptation is a matter of urgency for developing countries whose capacities to carry out actions to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change are limited. We therefore urge that progress in implementing the Paris Agreement must reflect balance between adaptation and mitigation. He said: We came to Marrakech with a challenging task, the challenge of turning agreements into action. COP22 can indeed be considered a COP for action .The speedy and unprecedented entry into force of the Paris Agreement signals the level of urgency and importance with which our leaders and the international community attach to combating climate change. We are here to accelerate climate actions, and this has been underscored by the Marrakesh Action Proclamation which we endorsed yesterday and the tireless efforts of the High Level Champions over the past year. After nearly four years, only 73 parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance to the Doha Amendment. The Group reiterates that the unfinished business of the pre-2020 actions and ambition, which are long overdue, must be urgently addressed.The Group sees the Kyoto Protocol as a fundamental building block in its post-2020 efforts. We urge all Parties that have not done so to ratify the Doha Amendment expeditiously. Meanwhile, speaking earlier on behalf of Group of 77 and China, Surasak Karnjanarat, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Kingdom of Thailand, declared that countries of the Group of 77 and China have been the most affected by the adverse impacts of climate change.

The delegation is also focusing its efforts on inter-institutional dialogue with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Committee of the Regions in order to highlight the importance of adopting a new governance framework, enabling civil society organisations and local communities to engage in climate action, and thus tap into the enormous potential of citizen involvement.To accomplish the goals of the agreement, Michel Dubromel, member of the EESC delegation, emphasised the need to explore the huge potential of organised civil society by minimising the obstacles standing in the way of concrete local climate action. ""We must identify the mechanisms and measures for organised civil society to be truly involved and for climate action to deliver massively, while proposing elements of a new climate governance infrastructure.""That is why the EESC and its partners - the European Committee of the Regions (CoR), the French Committee for Sustainable Development (Committee 21 France - C21F) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) decided to work together to create a new international coalition on climate for multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance. The coalition is looking into the conditions for success of climate actions by non-state actors, possibilities for replicating valuable initiatives as well as the potential hurdles to be overcome.Stefan Back, member of the EESC delegation at COP22, said: ""The EESC is fighting for a framework - based on the principles of ""bottom-up climate action"" and ""think global, act local"" - that acknowledges the variety of roles played by civil society stakeholders, recognises their different levels of resources, takes factors of success into account and creates positive and real conditions for climate action"".

Nothing except pretend that the issue is being dealt with by someone else, on the ground. Inner City Press asked Ban Ki-moon's deputy spokesman Farhan Haq, again on November 14, transcript here:Inner City Press: I wanted to ask you about COP22. One, I wanted to ask, you'd said, I think, on Friday that you that that the Secretariat, I guess was in contact with, I don't know if it was UNFCCC or the Moroccan authorities about this accredited attendee Suleima Barouk [Beiruk]. Seems like she's still not arrived, unless you have different information. I wanted to know, what has the UN done given that her accreditation has been published, is, is ,exists, and the only grounds for blocking her was her ac her self-identification as being from Western Sahara?Deputy Spokesman: Well, like I said, we had been told that the issue is, is being worked out on ground, so I believe that that should be, hopefully, resolved there and you can, you can ask the COP22 organizers how that's working.ICP Question: UNFCCC, well, I asked UNFCCC, and Mr. Nuttall had said that, basically, Morocco said because she's self-identified as Western Sahara, she's not coming. So I wanted to know, from your perspective, given that that was the last that it was, I've heard from anyone on Friday, from the perspective of the Secretariat, given that the Secretary-General is there and giving a speech, is it the kind of thing that he expects to raise, if not with the King, to somebody that his stated goal about NGOs is, in fact, not being respected?Deputy Spokesman: Well, we certainly want our stated goals about the representation of NGOs, including all of those who are accredited NGOs, to be respected. That's the point of principle. I do believe the discussions had been continuing on the ground, and, hopefully, they'll be able to resolve it there. Yeah. Yeah.Ban gave in to Morocco's demand to pull out 83 members of its MINURSO mission in Western Sahara and has yet to get most of the returned.Now Ban's UN is proposing to give in further, sources have exclusively told Inner City Press, even as it has been restricted to minders in the UN since\~being ousted[1]\~without due process[2]\~in February by\~Spain's highest UN official, Cristina Gallach.[3]And Morocco's Ambassador\~Omar Hilale[4]\~on November 7 approached Inner City Press and said he understands and agrees with those who ""have a problem"" with Inner City Press, and that the parliamentarian banned from attending COP 22 in Morocco was not accredited by the UN.\~Audio here.[5]But a document Inner City Press has obtained and\~published on Scribd, here,\~[6]shows the individual has been accredited by the UNFCCC. While Ban's spokespeople have told Inner City Press to £sk UNFCCC' and that Ban's Secretariat has been speaking with UNFCCC about Ms Beirouk's situation because Ban believes all accreditees should be able to attend, the UNFCC's timely response to Inner City Press leaves unclear if she will continue to be Banned. Inner City Press asked:'Please state UNFCCC's understanding of the status of Ms. Beirouk, and position on Morocco blocking her attendance. Separately, since UNFCCC's logo is used on COP22.ma, please state UNFCCC's position and action on the statements on that website about Morocco having a border with Mauritania and a land mass that includes Western Sahara.' UNFCCC's spokesperson Nick Nuttal responded:'Dear Mathew, This is our understanding of the situation. When we (UNFCCC) heard about this situation, we sought clarification from the Moroccan Government. We were advised that the Ms Beirouk was travelling on an African Union passport and specified her nationality as Western Sahara and for Morocco this is not considered a valid travel document. We were also advised that Ms Beirouk has a Spanish passport and has traveled freely in and out of Morocco on that many times. Mathew as for your second questions I don't know the answer right now and need to ask one of our experts. I'll get back as quickly as I can.' It's appreciated. First, the claim that Ms.Beirouk is not accredited appears to be false. Second, if the only Ban is Morocco's position on her passport, then Ban should act on what his spokespeople say his position is. We'll have more on this.

Weisenmiller expressed support for the United States\' long-term vision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent or more by 2050. On November 16, the U.S. submitted the Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP22) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Canada, Germany and Mexico are the other countries that have submitted strategies. The U.S. was among the first countries to submit a long-term climate change strategies to the UN as part of the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year. The Paris Agreement calls for limiting the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius or even 1.5 degrees Celsius. Under the Paris agreement, the U.S. pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The long-term strategy, which builds upon the existing pledge, states that the U.S.  can meet the growing demands on its energy system and lands while achieving a low-emissions pathway, maintaining a thriving economy, and ensuring a just transition for Americans whose livelihoods are connected to fossil fuel production and use.  Making that transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy nationally would mean investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and zero-emission vehicles, policies that California has adopted to combat climate change, Weisenmiller said. On the final day of the Marrakesh climate change conference, California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., Oregon Governor Kate Brown, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and British Columbia Premier Christy Clark issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to climate action.  Today, as COP22 comes to a close \- two weeks after the Paris Agreement came into force \- leaders from across the globe have renewed their commitment to climate action. In California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia \- from the Mexican border to the edge of the Yukon Territory \- we stand with the international community. Our success demonstrates that taking action on climate change goes hand-in-hand with robust job creation and a thriving clean energy economy, said part of the November 18 statement. California is a world leader in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants. State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\'f3n (D-Los Angeles) led a delegation of California officials who attended COP22.  California has ambitious climate goals, but only represent 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emission, so it is imperative that we reach out to partners at the subnational and national levels if we have any chance of slowing climate change, said Weisenmiller. Last year, California and Baden-W\'fcrttemberg, Germany formed the Under2 Coalition \- an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. With 29 new members added at a signing ceremony at Marrakesh, a total of 165 jurisdictions have joined the coalition representing more than a billion people and $25.7 trillion in combined gross domestic product \- more than one-third of the global economy. This year, Brown signed Senate Bill 32, which requires California reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Last October, he signed SB 350 to double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings and generate half of the state\' s electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

This, as well as decisions adopted in Marrakech, powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible.The Secretary-General notes that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone.In Marrakech, Parties advanced on the rule book for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, years ahead of expectations. As of today, 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions have ratified the agreement.The Secretary-General applauds the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future.As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries.\l"

CBRE's Anastasiya Kostomarova, a member of the UN\~Sustainable Development Solutions Network - Youth, reflects on her time at the conference. This year's gathering marked the moment when countries reaffirmed their commitment to the deal and agreed that the intricacies of its implementation will be worked out by 2018, instead of 2020.\~With governments coming to terms with the fact that it is now time to roll up the sleeves and put detailed strategies and technological roadmaps for net zero emissions into place, the atmosphere in Marrakech clearly indicated a shift in dialogue towards concrete solutions that deliver drastic carbon emissions reductions, consistent with the 2\'b0C threshold. This was the very focus of the Low-Emissions Solutions Conference (LESC), co-organized by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the Government of Marrakech, and International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), in partnership with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The conference brought together over 700 participants  among them world-leading scientists, engineers and experts, business and industry leaders, and governments  to discuss latest technological innovations and best practices for achieving a low-carbon economy. The conference featured 18 technology sessions; from energy efficiency and sustainable materials, to low-carbon freight and shipping. Each session was ripe with examples that the business community is increasingly invested in both reducing its carbon footprint, and seizing opportunities offered by the transition to the low-carbon economy. As of last month  just two years following its launch  200 companies with a $4.8 trillion in market value have joined the Science Based Targets initiative. At the LESC session on ICT, Frances Way  COO of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)  said that alongside concerns around reputational risk and mandatory compliance, for example in product efficiency regulations, what they observe is a growing recognition of a clear business case for reducing carbon footprint: a 10% increase in electricity costs could add as much as US$4-10 million per annum in operating costs for ICT companies, while energy efficiency and conservation has brought CDP participants over billion of dollars of savings[1][2]. General Motors alone estimates that investment in clean energy and conservation is already saving the company US$5 million annually[2][3]. Eric Rondolat, CEO of Philips Lighting, pointed out that ICT developments are strengthening the appeal of energy efficiency in delivering savings, with technologies such as motion sensors enabling up to half of the 80% potential efficiency savings in lighting systems. Moreover, Frances Way emphasized that companies are now starting to look beyond Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; for instance, eleven ICT companies that have joined the CDP supply chain program have collectively engaged with more than 250 suppliers in Asia[3][4]. In a time of political uncertainty, with the US presidential election sending reverberations throughout negotiation rooms, business needs to step up. In the weeks following the election result, more than 300 private CEOs wrote an open letter[4][5]\~to the President-elect Trump, urging him to reaffirm US commitment to the Paris Agreement. At COP22, many US-based companies at LESC stressed that the election results will have no impact on their carbon reduction targets. Once again, we heard it loud and clear: business leadership will be central in carrying the climate agenda forward.

We are therefore here to reaffirm that the EU will deliver on its commitments whatever happens.What is the main achievement of the COP22?I would say the Marrakesh Action Proclamation that reaffirms the willingness of all countries to fight against climate change and to support sustainable development. By 2020 countries should reveal their 2050 long-term commitments to address climate change.What is the Parliament already working on in order to implement the Paris agreement?We will already be delivering concrete policies next month when we vote on the reform of the EU's carbon market. We will soon start work on reducting emissions from individual EU countries. Tthis is the so-called effort sharing legislation and there is also a new legislative proposal on land-use, land-use change and forestry.What has the EU already done? How advanced are we in implementing the Paris agreement?We are on track to implement our initial 2030 commitments. We are also set to surpass our 2020 goal of a 20% cut in emissions and are now aiming even higher.What could be the biggest challenge for the EU during the implementation process of the Paris agreement?That could be consolidating the trust that allowed 197 countries to agree on a common declaration in Marrakesh. This is why it is so important that we reaffirm, in spite of the many political uncertainties we face, that the EU will deliver on its commitments.The target is decarbonisation. The question is only about how much the EU itself wants to lead this revolution and push other global actors to follow this path.\l"

I was also fortunate to hear from some of the world's leading innovators in this area. Representatives of the aviation industry, shipping industry, energy sector, agriculture sector, product manufacturing sector, and sustainable cities movement all delivered powerful messages of progress, with a clear call for further action. As a business paradigm, the circular economy represents a maturing of the global business community. Under this philosophy, biological and mineral resources are no longer simply there for the taking, but are precious natural capital to be stewarded. Air, water, and ecosystems are no longer viewed as dumping grounds for wastes, but are community commons that must be protected. And products are not simply trinkets to be used and discarded, but are designed to serve their function, then to be reused, repurposed, or recycled with the least possible waste. In essence, the circular economy seeks to emulate the earth's complex balancing act that sustains life, wasting nothing in the process. Now, in this period of unprecedented climate change, it is essential for companies, governments and institutions to apply the lessons of the circular economy to our greatest challenge - stabilizing the Earth's climate.

The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs announced a tender in mid-August to modify 64 mosques initially in six of the kingdom's cities to reduce the energy[1] they consume. Its goal is a 40-percent reduction in energy costs[2] at 15,000 mosques around the country that consume an average of 90 kilowatts a day, said the SIE state energy investment company. Studies have shown that energy consumption can be cut by 60 percent, with estimates showing savings of as much as 68 percent at Rabat's majestic As-Sunna mosque. This can be achieved through energy-saving lighting, photovoltaic electricity generation and solar water heating, and without harming the appearance of the mosques. The upgrades will also benefit the faithful, with access to hot water for washing and air conditioning available in prayer rooms, said SIE. Another upshot would be the ""strong social impact"" through the creation of 5,000 jobs and a new growth market, it said. ""The return of the investment made will be based on the energy savings achieved."" German development organisation GIZ, which supports the project, describes it as a ""win-win"" situation that will also raise awareness of renewable and efficient energy in Morocco. ""It is based on the idea that Moroccan companies... involved in these mosques will be repaid through savings made by the building manager,"" says GIZ's Jan-Christoph Kuntze. Morocco is preparing to launch an ambitious project to turn its mosques green as a commitment to clean energy Potential to create jobs All of the technology needed is ""already available on the local market"", he said, adding that this gave the project the potential to create jobs. ""The mosques can play a multiplier role"" of raising awareness about the need to save energy and adapt to cleaner sources. King Mohammed VI has pushed a proactive policy of environmental awareness in the northwest African country of nearly 34 million people, 99 percent of whom are Muslim. Marrakesh will host the next world climate conference[3], COP22, from November 7 to 18. One of the main challenges for Morocco, which hosted COP7 in 2001, is to ratify the Paris Agreement signed last year by 195 countries to fight global warming. COP22 will ""highlight the country's commitment to work for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and to continue to support developing countries... affected by the impact of climate change"", Mohammed said in a speech in June. The king was behind an ambitious plan launched in 2009 to develop renewables and enable the country bereft of hydrocarbons to support nearly half of its energy needs this way. The ultimate aim is to raise the share of renewable energy to 52 percent of all consumption. Central to this was the opening of Noor I the first stage of what will be the largest solar power plant in the world near Ouarzazate on the edge of the Sahara desert. As Morocco counts down to COP22, its people are being exposed more and more to events and initiatives showcasing the country's involvement in protecting the planet. Its ""green mosques"" project is expected to take centre stage in the drive for change being highlighted at the conference.

The Paris Agreement, adopted last year at COP21, was a defining moment in international climate negotiations. Now that the Paris Agreement has entered into force, COP22 is a meeting focused on action and implementation. Here in Marrakech we are focused on ways to drive ambitious action by governments, civil society, and the private sector to work in sync towards common goals.I truly believe that Morocco is the perfect host for this year\' s COP. Under the leadership and vision of King Mohammed VI, Morocco has taken bold steps to becoming a leader in clean energy, committing to ensure that 52 percent of its generation capacity is from renewables by 2030. The most visible manifestation of these impressive efforts is the Noor Solar Complex, the first phase of which was inaugurated last February. When complete, Noor will be the world's largest concentrated solar power plant with the potential to produce enough energy to power over one million homes by 2018. Morocco\' s national ban on plastic bags under the  Zero Mika campaign is another example of its bold action to protect the environment. We are proud of our own collaboration with Morocco to protect its environment, particularly its national parks and forests. Through the first US-Morocco Sister Park initiative, we have linked the Great Basin National Park in Nevada with Toubkal National Park, located near Marrakech, to foster collaboration between two parks facing the similar environmental challenges. The U.S. Forest Service and the Moroccan High Commission for Water, Forests, and the Fight Against Desertification have successfully collaborated to protect Morocco\' s rich forests from forest fires. And during COP22, the Millennium Challenge Corporation\' s Government of Morocco partner, MCA-Morocco will highlight its $127 million dollar investment in sustainable industrial zones, including a discussion on how sustainable industrial zones can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Mission to Morocco is also doing its part to support \' s goals through our support to local organizations and emerging Moroccan leaders who are putting environmental protection into practice. For example, we are supporting Moroccan NGO Dar Si Hmad, which developed a way for rural women to convert fog to precious drinking water for remote communities in Southern Morocco. This innovative project is being recognized by a UN Climate Change award that highlights the contributions of women for change. We have also worked with social entrepreneur Saad Abid, who represented Morocco at Our Ocean Conference in Washington D.C. this year.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA75","CIEL Issues Statement on Outcome of COP22","November 14, 2016 Monday 6:19 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Center for International Environmental Law issued the following statement:The negotiators meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) of the UNFCCC had an important mission: keep up momentum generated by the adoption of the Paris Agreement and prove that the international community is serious about implementing the goals and commitments defined in Paris. COP22 demonstrates that countries DO want the Paris Agreement to be successful, and the United States election results did not distract from this mission.Showing real leadership, the 47 countries in the climate vulnerable forum (CVF) announced they will rely on 100% renewable energy by 2030 or 2050 at the latest. Historic polluters must follow their lead and support these countries in meeting this commitment, including by offering the necessary funds.Overall however, the progress made at COP22 was slow. In real terms, this leaves the planet - and all its inhabitants - in the same position as last year, with the scale of ambition and commitments too low to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees.Unless countries increase the pace of the negotiation over the next two years and deliver strong rules for implementation, people across the globe will experience the increasingly severe impacts of a changing climate and the harmful impacts of poorly implemented climate mitigation projects. Governments must increase ambition and strengthen the rules around public accountability and transparency for climate actions taken by governments and companies.Human rights obligations require governments to make science-based emissions reductions, and they require historic emitters to provide the necessary finance to meet the 1.5 degree goal.We witnessed some progress on the integration of gender equality, the recognition of the value of traditional and indigenous knowledge in designing the methods of implementation of the Paris Agreement, and increasing emphasis on the importance of building the capacity of developing countries to integrate human rights into the core of their climate responses. In 2017, we expect further progress on addressing climate-induced migration, gender equality, and indigenous and traditional knowledge.We urge parties to use the next six months to think critically about the role the public can and should play in developing national climate policies, strengthening transparency and accountability, and in assessing good practices and progress on meeting the 1.5 objective necessary to ensure the survival of people, species, and the planet.Copyright Targeted News ServicesEditorVail-5705296 EditorVail\l"

Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge) Anil Madhav Dave addresses a press conference on 'Ratification of Paris Agreement - the Way Forward', in New Delhi on October 1, 2016.Press Information Bureau India will strongly put forward its case and throw its weight behind the cause of developing nations at the upcoming 12-day 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) at Marrakech in Morocco, which begins on November 7. Interacting with reporters on Satuday, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge) Anil Madhav Dave said India, at the global climate forum, will ""put across its views based on Indian, or Gandhian lifestyle in Morocco."" He added: ""Issues related to raising finance under Green Climate Fund (GCF) and technology transfer will also be raised at COP22.""India and developing countries are currently fighting developed countries on the terms of the goals they have to share in order to address climate change and combat global warming. The developed nations want to put the burden of it on developing nations like India. The developing nations, however, are looking to their developed counterparts for funds and technological know-how to overcome the challenges posed by climate change and global warming. Interestingly, Dave's comments came a day before India was slated to ratify the Paris agreement on climate change. According to an official statement from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, here are the topics India is expected to raise at COP 22: Enhancing Ambition and promoting action between 2016 and 2020:\~The Paris Agreement is for post-2020 period. Currently, we are operating under the pre-2020 action framework and must not wait any further to take action. The developed countries should ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. At Morocco, we must agree to set up an action roadmap for 2016-2020 for raising ambition and achieving pre-2020 goals. Mobilising means of implementation i.e finance, technology and capacity-building support before and after 2020:\~$11 billion per year climate finance goal has not been met. At Morocco, India will insist for a concrete roadmap from developed countries. $10.3 billion committed to the Green Climate Fund does not match the enormous finance and technology requirements indicated by developing countries in their INDCs. On the technology and capacity-building front also, not much headway has been made. The new Technology Framework under the Paris Agreement should help to remove barriers to technology access and provide finance for meeting higher technological costs. Furthering the cause of adaption and loss and damage:\~India is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The first review of the loss and damage mechanism at COP 22 is an opportunity for India to ensure that this mechanism provides tangible and concrete solutions. Most important of these would be to ensure that there are tools to address adaptation, financial risk management and finance needs for dealing with extreme and slow onset events.

Credit: Fabiola Ortiz/IPSMARRAKECH, Nov 18 2016 (IPS) The world has been too slow in responding to climate events such as El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a, and those who are the least responsible are the ones suffering most , Mary Robinson, the special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, told IPS at the United Nations in Marrakech (COP22).The first woman President of Ireland (1990-1997) and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (1997-2002), Robinson was appointed earlier this year by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the new mandate involving climate change and El Ni\'f1o. I've seen a window into a new normal' and it is very serious. Mary RobinsonDuring the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Robinson strongly advocated for engaging community-led solutions and for incorporating gender equality and women's participation in the climate talks. Global warming is accelerating too much and it is being aggravated by El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a. They do not have to become a humanitarian disaster, but people have now been left to cope for themselves...I think we were too slow in many instances and this has become a humanitarian disaster for the 60 million people who are food insecure and suffering from droughts, she said.El Ni\'f1o has been directly associated with droughts and floods in many parts of the world that have severely impacted millions of livelihoods. A warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific waters, the phenomenon occurs on average every three to seven years and sea surface temperatures across the Pacific can warm more than 1 degree C.El Ni\'f1o is a natural occurrence, but scientists believe it is becoming more intense as a result of global warming.How El Ni\'f1o interacts with climate change is not 100 percent clear, but many of the countries that are now experiencing El Ni\'f1o are also vulnerable to climate variations. According to Robinson, El Ni\'f1o and its climate-linked emergencies are a threat to human security and, therefore, a threat to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced in September 2015 as the 2030 Agenda replacing the Millennium Development Goals. I have gone to Central America to the dry corridor in Honduras and have seen women crying because there is no water and they feel very neglected. They feel they are left behind and that nobody seems to know about them. I saw in Ethiopia severely malnourished children, it could affect them for life in terms of being stunted. The same thing in southern Africa. I feel I've seen a window into a new normal' and it is very serious. We need to understand the urgency of taking the necessary steps, Robinson said.Drought and flooding associated with El Ni\'f1o created enormous problems across East Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Pacific. Ethiopia, where Robinson has visited earlier this year, is experiencing its worst drought in half a century. One million children in Eastern and Southern Africa alone are acutely malnourished.It is very likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015, according to an assessment released at the COP22 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary data shows that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El Ni\'f1o event.These long-term changes in the climate have exacerbated social, humanitarian and environmental pressures. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees pointed that in 2015, more than 19 million new displacements were associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. We need a much more concerted response and fund preparedness. If we have a very strategic early warning system, we can deal with the problem much more effectively. Building resilience in communities is the absolute key. We need to invest in support for building resilience now rather than having a huge humanitarian disaster, stressed Robinson.On Nov. 17, during the COP22 in Marrakech, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) a coalition led by France, Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada launched at the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015 announced a new goal to mobilise more than 30 million dollars by July 2017 and 100 million by 2020.The international partnership aims to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific. The idea is to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events.There will be a special focus on women, who are particularly vulnerable to climate menaces but are the protagonists in building resilience. Now we've moved from the Paris negotiations to implementation on the ground. Building resilience is key and it must be done in a way that is gender sensitive with full account of gender equality and also human rights. We must recognize the role of women as agents for change in their communities, Robinson emphasised.The number of climate-related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years, said Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS, We can see already in Africa the impact of climate change that is undermining our efforts to bring food security for all. Take the example of El Ni\'f1o that has affected all of Africa in the last two years. Countries that had made fantastic progress like Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar are now suffering hunger again. Countries that have eradicated hunger are back to face it again. We need to adapt. Climate change has different impacts on men and women, girls and boys, told IPS Edith Ofwona, the senior program specialist at International Development Research Centre (IDRC).Related IPS Articles HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/mideast-climate-change-will-make-a-difficult-situation-much-worse/Mideast: Climate Change Will Make a Difficult Situation Much Worse' http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/convincing-investors-to-unlock-africas-green-energy-potential/Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa's Green Energy Potential{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/adaptation-funding-a-must-for-africa/Adaptation Funding a Must for AfricaPictures for this storyThis story includes downloadable print-quality images Copyright IPS, to be used exclusively with this story.

On Sunday afternoon UNFCCC executive secretary Patricia Espinosa laid out plans for this year's negotiations and beyond. 'The ambitions set out in Paris cannot be scaled down, so from now on countries can only increase their commitment,' she said. Preview:\~US election result to dominate COP22 UN climate summit[2] There is much on the plate, from the need for better adaptation worldwide, and increased support for developing countries, to enabling a push towards cleaning up the global economy and embrace renewables. 'Investors are seeing a lot of opportunities in Africa' she said. But the elephant in the room of this year's COP are the coming US presidential elections. When asked whether she was concerned about their outcome, Espinosa tried to reassure the audience - highlighting the binding nature of the Paris Agreement, which entered into force last week. But while the US would have a hard time formally pulling out of the agreement, it's clear a climate change denier in charge of one of the world's major emitters would be a serious and unpredictable threat to the global climate response. WRI's Eliza Northrop: 'Recognizing the urgency of setting their sights higher, countries agreed at COP21 to come back in 2018 to take stock of initial progress and most importantly to use 2018 as a springboard for countries to enhance their national climate plans in 2020. To put us on track for 2018 to become that springboard moment, at COP22 negotiators need to indicate they will decide on rule and processes for the Paris Agreement by that year.' Locals say Marrakech has received a facelift to honour the thousands of delegates, with Moroccan flags and COP22 stickers everywhere to be seen: even on knackered Mercedes taxis belching black smoke. To make the launch Mustapha Bakkoury, chairman of Masen (Moroccan Agency of Sustainable Energy S.A.)[3] has announced a 1 billion dirham (USD 272 million) climate bond, a first for Africa. Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow: 'The Paris Agreement demanded a rapid decarbonisation of the global energy system so it's fitting that in the sun-drenched nation of Morocco we should see this shift really start to shine. The costs of solar and wind energy continue to fall and as the market volatility of polluting fossil fuels causes havoc for investors now is the time to see governments really giving renewables clear political backing.'

EI: education a key tool  Teachers of the world, united under the EI banner, believe that education and teachers are the most powerful agents you can trust in the fight against climate change, stressed Sinyolo. He acknowledged that adequate training, tools, resources, and support from governments and society are necessary for teachers to successfully deliver effective education for sustainable development (ESD) and climate change education (CCE). New measures should be taken to adopt a model of sustainable development that meets the current needs of society without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, Sinyolo added. Implications of new economy EI believes that  education is the fuel of the future and a key tool to achieve sustainable development and to raise global awareness on climate change, he added. Indeed, the education sector has a crucial role to play in the transition to a low carbon global economy, and a new type of economy has massive implications for workers and the education and training that will be needed to prepare young people for life and for work. Teachers and educators are crucial in the delivery of quality ESD and CCE, he said.

The deal entered into force earlier this month after the European Parliament gave its consent[1] to the EU's ratification.This week a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Giovanni La Via, chair of Parliament's environment committee, takes part in the COP22 conference in Marrakesh. Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, the European commissioner responsible for climate action, will brief the delegation on a daily basis. MEPs will also engage in talks with NGOs, industry and delegations from various countries.COP22: 'COP of action'The focus of this week's round of talks will be on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Delegates will work on making national climate plans as clear and transparent as possible, and on ensuring that the actions taken are traceable and that standardized reporting methods are used. There will also be discussions on enhanced action prior to 2020. As part of the Paris agreement developed countries promised to mobilize at least $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Aiming to deliver on the commitments made, the negotiations in Marrakesh will revolve around who should pay into these funds and how they should be used. There will also be discussions on the need for further support for developing countries in terms of technology and capacity-building.More informationMore on the role of Parliament in the fight against climate change[2] Paris Agreement parties need to pledge more emission cuts, say MEPs[3] UN climate change conference in Marrakesh: questions and answers[4] Commission website on COP22[5] COP22 website[6] [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930STO44532/photos-climate-deal-approved-and-signed-by-parliamenthttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930STO44532/photos-climate-deal-approved-and-signed-by-parliament HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/top-stories/20141118TST79414/climate-changehttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/top-stories/20141118TST79414/climate-change [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930IPR44569/climate-paris-agreement-parties-need-to-pledge-more-emission-cuts-say-mepshttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930IPR44569/climate-paris-agreement-parties-need-to-pledge-more-emission-cuts-say-meps [ 4]: \~ http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3590_en.htmhttp://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3590_en.htm [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0112_en.htmhttp://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0112_en.htm [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/enhttp:// cop22 HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/en.ma/en/ \l"

Following the momentous Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, progress towards ratification ofthe Paris Agreement has been far swifter than those gathered this time last year in France had envisaged. The timeframe agreed in Paris mapped a pathway to ratifi cation and entry-into-force in 2020. Given that international treaties have historically taken a long time to ratify (the Kyoto Protocol was agreed in 1997 and came into effect in 2005) and the UN climate talks have been largely unsuccessful for the past decade, the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreement is almost unprecedented.

Henrik Grape, coordinator of the WCC Working Group on Climate Change. ""We, people of faith, have something important to contribute. Climate change is more than politics, technical solutions or a question of environment. It is about a moral duty to act and about our understanding of what it means to be a human on this earth.""We need the innovations and political decisions, but we also need a vision and long-term aspirations, said Grape. Faith should play a central part to bring the people of the earth together for a common vision that will last and help to bring transformation that the earth so desperately needs.Justice and equity are part of the spiritual vision the faith communities can bring. ""And faith communities also can bring hope. Hope is something more than just prognosis. The origin of hope is transcendent - people of the faith are people of hope. And hope is the first step in the path of transformation"", said Grape.Grape quoted St Augustine, saying that hope has two beautiful daughters: their names are Anger and Courage. Anger at the way things are, and Courage to see that they do not remain as they are. ""Faith can be the carrier of hope and its beautiful daughters. Anger, on inequalities and on the greed that destroys the earth, and possibilities of future generations. And courage to start the transformation needed for a more just and equitable world"".Lindsey Fielder Cook, climate change representative of Quaker United Nations office, reminded participants that the root cause of the anthropogenic climate change is human behaviour: ""We are the problem, but we are also the solution. We cannot and should not think that this solely can be done through technical fixes. We need a transformation of the human behaviours which are the root causes"". When policies and regulations made by governments are rights-based, they are more supported by their citizens. ""For this reason, holistic inclusion of human rights in the implementation of the Paris agreement is critical to reaching sufficient, fair, effective and therefore ambitious mitigation and adaptation to protect all species - including us"", said Fielder Cook.The public discussion, formally titled ""Trust and peacebuilding approaches for ambitious climate action"" was a side-event at UN climate change conference COP22 in Marrakech, and it was organized by the World Council of Churches in cooperation with Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University, Quaker Earthcare Witness and the Quaker United Nations Office.Live stream of the event (audio and presentations): HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwULaTTXBc&t=9shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSwULaTTXBc&t=9sDocuments shared by speakers (side-event Friday, 18 Nov. 11.30-13.00): HYPERLINK https://seors.unfccc.int/seors/reports/events_list.html?session_id=COP22https://seors.unfccc.int/seors/reports/events_list.html?session_id= HYPERLINK COP22Photos from faith-based events at COP22: HYPERLINK http://www.oikoumene.org/cop22photosWCC work on care for creation and climate justice: HYPERLINK http://www.oikoumene.org/en/what-we-do/climate-changeCopyright Targeted News ServicesEditorVail-5709226 EditorVail\l"

The largest-ever delegation of students and researchers from the University of California San Diego and Scripps Institution of Oceanography is headed to Marrakech for the upcoming 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22), where they will inform international policy negotiations with climate science findings. (View Scripps at COP22 video here.) An estimated 20,000 people from 196 participating countries will flock to the North African city from November 7-18 to participate in the annual global climate change policy conference, led by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and held each year at a different location around the world. This 2016 University of California contingent of 23 researchers, students, and staff is part of the UC Revelle Program for Climate Science and Policy, a non-governmental organization that represents the UC system at the annual COP summit. As a leader in understanding and protecting our planet, Scripps Oceanography comprises 17 of the total UC delegates, which includes an unprecedented 10 Scripps graduate students, five faculty members, one postdoctoral researcher, and one staff member. Two graduate students from UC San Diegos School of Global Policy and Strategy will also participate in the conference, providing cross-campus collaboration and expertise in the field of public policy. ""Scripps Oceanography has been at the forefront of climate change research for more than half a century, and Im very pleased that our world-class delegation of faculty and students will again be presenting the latest scientific research at COP22, said Scripps Director Margaret Leinen. ""Understanding the science behind global climate change and the role of the ocean in this change is critical for world leaders to make informed decisions about the future of our planet."" Throughout the two-week conference, Scripps Oceanography will have an increased presence from that of previous years by hosting its first-ever solo exhibit, titled, Observations: From the Deep Sea to the Sky. The boothwhich will be paper-free in keeping with increased sustainability effortswill highlight the critical programs and new observational technologies used by Scripps and the climate science community that help national and regional governments understand the hydrological cycle. Scripps will showcase how these advanced instruments allow scientists to monitor and understand the effects of climate change on the environment, revealing a clear picture of potential instability affecting everything from deep-ocean ecosystems to the phenomena governing monsoons, atmospheric rivers, and other vital sources of water for society. Members of the UC delegation, including graduate students, will also participate in a record number of press conferences and panel discussions that showcase Scripps science and demonstrate the importance the ocean plays in regulating climate across the globe. The broad scope of COP22-related activities will give Scripps graduate students the opportunity to share and communicate important research with people ranging from policymakers to the public. I am absolutely honored to represent Scripps science at COP22, said Charlotte Beall, a third-year Scripps PhD student studying climate science and first-time COP attendee. Beall and Scripps Professor Amato Evan will participate in a press conference on Nov. 16 where they will discuss how a more arid environment increases dust emissions and erosion, and how dust emissions, through long-range transport, can significantly influence precipitation in locations thousands of miles away from the source. By attending COP22, I am hoping to engage diverse groups of climate and water resource stakeholders in research on aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions, and to facilitate connections between climate and aerosol scientists in the U.S. and climate scientists in critical regions of the world, said Beall. Third-year Scripps graduate student Rishi Sugla will also be attending the conference for the first time, and said hes thrilled to have the opportunity to serve as an ocean ambassador in a setting where he can learn about science policy firsthand. There is a lot of wonderful science done at Scripps that has potential to not only influence policy, but also have real positive impacts on the day-to-day life of people around the world. However, there is often a disconnect between those who work on the ground and policymakers with the ongoing scientific research, said Sugla, a geoscience student. Its clear that Scripps is trying to bridge this gap, and while at COP22 I hope to understand how an international climate agreement is developed and constructed, as well as the role of scienceor lack thereofin the process. The outcome of COP21, last years conference held in Paris, was a landmark agreement to fight climate change signed by 195 countries, as well as inclusion of ocean science in final COP agreements text for the first time. The delegation at COP22 will build upon the successes of COP21 and carry forth the message of the oceans crucial role in absorbing the impacts of climate change. This year, Scripps Oceanography is collaborating with the government of Chile toward the broad goal of including the oceans in nationally determined contributions to a greater extent. A press conference on Nov. 8 will showcase this international research partnership and its studies on marine ecosystems. Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a distinguished Scripps professor of climate and atmospheric sciences, will hold a high-level press conference on Nov. 14, where he will be discussing countries prospects for holding global warming to 1.5 above pre-industrial levels. Distinguished Scripps Professor Lisa Levin, Scripps graduate students Natalya Gallo and Kirk Sato, and international colleagues will hold a press conference on Nov. 10 that focuses on the role of the deep sea in climate mitigation, impacts of rising CO2 on deep-sea ecosystems and their services, law and policy gaps for climate and the high seas/deep sea, and deep-ocean research and observation in a climate context. Other Scripps-led press events include a Nov. 9 discussion on the global warming hiatus, presented by Distinguished UC San Diego Professor and former Scripps Director Charles Kennel and graduate student Dillon Amaya; a Nov. 11 presentation about monitoring the global carbon cycle and heat budget through observing systems, presented by Scripps Associate Professor Todd Martz and graduate student Yassir Eddebbar; and a Nov. 15 discussion on the fate of marine protected areas in future oceans, led by Scripps postdoctoral scholar Maya deVries and graduate students Travis Schramek and Sato. Scripps students will also participate in Oceans Action Day on Nov. 12, a day of ocean-themed science discussions and events organized as part of the UNFCCC Global Climate Action Agenda. This event will further highlight and build upon a strategic five-year action plan on oceans and climate that was first showcased during Oceans Day at COP21. Its a wonderful opportunity to be participating in COP22 since the Paris Agreement from last years meeting will come into force at the onset of this meeting, said Sugla, reflecting the enthusiasm expressed by nearly the entire UC delegation. After wanting to attend the last two meetings, Im psyched to finally have a shot to go. Longtime Scripps supporters Ellen Lehman, David and Peg Engel, Gail Fliesbach, investment fund Global Good, and others provided funding to send the student delegates to COP22.\l"

Before the Conference wraps up on 18 November, State Parties hope to define the rules for the accord and to lay out a viable plan for providing at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to support climate action. Adopted by 196 States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) last December, the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It entered into force in record time on 4 November 2016. The Marrakech Conference includes a number of meetings and high-level events, including the high-level segment to be attended by dozens of heads of State and Government, on Tuesday 15 November. During the first week of COP 22, in parallel with the negotiations between the Parties, a series of thematic days on forests, water, cities, energy and transport highlighted the crucial role of non-state actors, including businesses, cities and non-governmental organizations, to implement the Agreement. On Saturday, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, co-host of , welcomed the fact that 105 countries have now ratified the Paris Agreement.  It gives the Agreement a lot of weight and a lot of credibility , she said at a press conference.  It has happened in record time , she added.  So we really hit the ground with this unexpected success in many ways of the entry into force of the Agreement much earlier than expected.

Both recognize the importance of working together for Inuit and Nunavummiut.""Climate change disproportionately affects Nunavut, and Nunavummiut are especially vulnerable to its impacts,"" said Nunavut Minister of Environment Joe Savikataaq. ""Working with NTI to address this issue and present a united voice on this issue can only strengthen our cause. I look forward to promoting an understanding of Nunavut's unique circumstances and the need for flexible options for the North.""""Our climate is changing. Our home is changing. NTI is looking forward to working with the GN in representing Inuit on this global initiative to mitigate the impacts of climate change in our communities. Our partnership is guided by the Inuit rights set out in the Nunavut Agreement, and is based on our respect and care for the land, animals and the environment,"" said NTI Acting President James Eetoolook.In January 2017, in Iqaluit, NTI and the GN will co-host the largest climate change adaptation initiative in Nunavut's history, and involve participation and input from Inuit from across the territory.In celebration of International Circumpolar Inuit Day on November 7, NTI and the GN reaffirm their commitment to build on and strengthen their partnership. A shared commitment to joint activities and a strong voice will make sure that Nunavummiut understand the impacts of climate change, and that the voice of Inuit is represented at national and international discussions. Building this partnership will show how government and Indigenous organizations can work together and value one another's input on issues that matter to Inuit and Nunavummiut.Copyright Targeted News Services30VitinMar-5708142 30VitinMar\l"

It entered into force in record time on 4 November 2016.The Marrakech Conference includes a number of meetings and high-level events, including the high-level segment to be attended by dozens of heads of State and Government, on Tuesday 15 November.So we really hit the ground with this unexpected success in many ways of the entry into force of the Agreement much earlier than expected. But now at the same time we have more urgency to get to work and finalize the elements we need in order to have a fully operational Paris AgreementDuring the first week of COP 22, in parallel with the negotiations between the Parties, a series of thematic days on forests, water, cities, energy and transport highlighted the crucial role of non-state actors, including businesses, cities and non-governmental organizations, to implement the Agreement.On Saturday, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, co-host of COP 22, welcomed the fact that 105 countries have now ratified the Paris Agreement. It gives the Agreement a lot of weight and a lot of credibility, she said at a press conference.It has happened in record time, she added. So we really hit the ground with this unexpected success in many ways of the entry into force of the Agreement much earlier than expected. But now at the same time we have more urgency to get to work and finalize the elements we need in order to have a fully operational Paris Agreement.The President of COP 22, Salaheddine Mezouar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, underscored ""an extremely positive state of mind, a commitment of everyone to maintain the momentum and help COP 22 be the one we all wanted, a COP of action, a COP of commitment, a COP that confirms the determination of all Parties, the international community as a whole, to continue climate action.Mr. Mezouar stressed that the main priorities of the Moroccan Presidency of COP 22 are to create a bridge between the world of negotiations and the world of action, to get Parties to increase their national commitments, to focus on climate finance and to transform climate initiatives launched at COP 21 into concrete projects.Asked about the uncertainties raised by the US presidential election, Mr. Mezouar said that the participants of the Marrakech Conference remained ""confident"" and that it was necessary ""to stay the course"" and keep this extraordinary momentum.\l"

Thank you for your presence in Marrakech and for your commitment to climate action. Reaching zero hunger by 2030 is crucial for achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. People who are well nourished live, learn and work longer, and contribute to economic growth and human development. Despite great progress in the fight against hunger, nearly 800 million people are undernourished today. Climate change threatens to aggravate matters even further. Erratic weather patterns and an increase in the outbreaks of pests and diseases are affecting our ability to produce the food we need. We have seen such impacts in recent months as El Ni\'f1o hit Africa, Asia, Central America and other parts of the world. The Paris Agreement recognizes the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change. Countries are already making progress by including agriculture and food systems in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Agricultural sectors are leading elements in 90 per cent of the national climate pledges for developing countries. Our challenge now is to scale-up investments in rural development and support climate adaptation. Decisions at COP22 hold immense potential to accelerate and amplify global action towards a world free of hunger and malnutrition. Climate change, extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition must be addressed together, and sustainable, resilient and inclusive agriculture and food systems that deliver for people and planet are key to doing so. Agriculture and food systems that are people-centred, sustainable and resilient are central to achieving the transformations envisioned in the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. I urge all Governments and partners to deliver on our promise to be the Zero Hunger Generation.

According to the Moroccan steering committee, this is the  African COP . The event will feature an  Africa Pavilion , with activities supported by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the New Partnership for Africa\' s Development (NEPAD) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) institutions that work to create favourable conditions for corporate investments in Africa. Thus, in Africa (and globally), the debate on climate change is captured by banks and corporations the very institutions that, through their relentless pursuit of profit above all else, are the main drivers of global climate change. The themes they have chosen to highlight in this space are telling: climate financing, technology transfer, agricultural industrialisation and adaptation. Make no mistake, alternative strategies that can significantly lower our greenhouse gas emissions ways of living and producing that fall outside these business-oriented parameters will not be discussed. Quite the contrary: on display will be the abysmal gap between the reality of peasant communities in Africa and around the world on one hand, and the blindness of our policymakers to this reality on the other. The latter continue to focus almost exclusively on  technology as the solution, even when many of the technologies they promote have been shown to actually worsen climate change and destroy the planet. The AfDB in particular, while supporting this  African COP , is quite far from understanding the climate emergency facing African farmers.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA99","Canada's Environment Minister Leads Canada's Delegation to COP22","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Terrebonne: Electric Energy Quebec has issued the following release news: One year ago in Paris, close to 200 world leaders came together to tackle climate change through the historic Paris Agreement. Working with business leaders, governments at all levels and civil society are developing solutions to climate change, which will not only ensure a sustainable planet but also grow a clean economy. This transition driven by market forces is unstoppable, and Canada intends to be at the forefront. The Paris Agreement was the first step on the road to a cleaner, more prosperous future for families and businesses around the world. The next steps are just as important, as Canada takes bold action to meet our 2030 emission-reduction target, to build a clean economy, and to create more opportunities for middle-class Canadians. Today (Novmber 13), Minister McKenna heads to Marrakech, Morocco, to lead Canada's delegation at the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. She will be joined by provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous leaders, Opposition Members of Parliament, businesses, youth, and civil society. At this year's climate-change conference, Minister McKenna will continue to provide the leadership Canada has shown internationally on climate change. Canada will build on the momentum of this year, including the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in refrigerants and air conditioners, and the International Civil Aviation Organization's historic agreement to mitigate emissions from airplanes. COP22 will put the Paris Agreement into action, with a focus on swift implementation. Canada will highlight the role of businesses; provincial, territorial, and municipal governments; and Indigenous groups as key to address climate change. As the countries that contribute the least to the causes of climate change are often the most affected by it, COP22 will also facilitate continued collaboration between developed and developing countries to address climate change. Addressing climate change is not only vital for communities around the world but also vital to the global economy. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord committed the developed world to mobilize $100 billion per year to support green growth and climate resilience in developing countries. This commitment will create tremendous opportunities for business growth and innovation as companies invest in and market clean technology. Minister McKenna will work with the Canadian business delegation and with her international counterparts to connect our innovators with those who need them. Minister McKenna will deliver Canada's national statement, and she will participate in several high-level meetings on issues including carbon pricing, clean-technology growth, support for developing countries, short-lived climate pollutants, gender and climate policy, as well as health and the role of Indigenous communities in climate solutions. Quote ""To address the global challenge of climate change effectively, all countries need to work together now to put the Paris Agreement into action. As we build on the momentum of the past year, Canada is proud to play a leadership role, once again, in international efforts to address climate change, which will ensure a more sustainable and prosperous future for our children and grandchildren."" - Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Canada ratified the Paris Agreement on October 5th, following a vote in Parliament. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4th. Canada's delegation to COP22 will include Indigenous leaders; representatives from the provinces, territories and municipalities; youth; business leaders; opposition members; and Government of Canada negotiators and experts. According to the World Bank, the Paris Agreement will help open up nearly $23 trillion in new opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets, between now and 2030.

AFLED is based in Bamako, Mali, and works to empower girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 35.Diallo-Dram\'e9 explained that because adaptation to climate change is inextricably related to access to education, climate adaptation must therefore also envision a holistic solution of educating women and sending girls to school. ""We work to empower girls' citizenship and to involve them in decision-making, we encourage them to be part of political scenario in Mali,"" she said.Women in the Sahel region are responsible for the well-being of the family, often having to walk long distances to fetch water and food on unsafe roads, she noted, adding that ""resources are rare in the Sahara region, and most of the time men leave women to farm. They have their own traditional methods for adaptation, but it is not enough, they need help.""As an African voice advocating for gender issues to be included in the climate talks in Marrakech, Diallo-Dram\'e9 regretted that this issue was not being properly addressed in the negotiations. ""I have the feeling that in those high-level meetings we, African women from the Sahel, are going to stay behind because we are not there at the table. We are not able to address the gender issue in our countries, governments don't understand, all legislation regarding gender and human rights is just on paper and is not being implemented. When you talk about climate justice it is going to be for the West and not for us,"" she said.For the last two weeks at COP22 (November 7-18, 2016), country delegations negotiated implementation of the new global agreement to tackle climate change adopted in Paris in 2015. The Paris Agreement embraces a language sensitive to gender equality and recognises Parties' responsibility to respect and promote human rights obligations through climate change action calling for ""gender-responsive adaptation measures and capacity-building activities"".In Marrakech, Parties were expected to carry on with the Lima Work Programme on Gender \- which is a two-year work programme on gender launched at COP20 in 2014. Civil society groups had strongly advocated a clear plan of action on gender within the UNFCCC and financial support for the activities under the Lima Work Programme.""We start from the point that we are not victims, we are advancing now on the discourse of empowerment,"" Mait\'e9 Rodr\'edguez Bland\'f3n, coordinator for the Guatemala Foundation in the Central American country, told IDN.""Climate resilience will come from empowering women in their communities. Women are very well organised at the local level and they know their role. We focus on changing the perception from being a victim to becoming a key actor and protagonist for change."" Bland\'f3n leads the Women and Peace Network in Central America with grassroots women's organisations from Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras. Her work has focused on grassroots women's movements struggling for land rights, women's rights and safer cities for women over the past decade.She said that there was too much dialogue and not enough action at COP22.Engaging indigenous women's voices has also been a concern for Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. ""Indigenous women have a very important role because they are the ones who are really involved in subsistence low-carbon food production. They are the ones who take care of the environment within their territories. Their role is to really ensure that the biodiversity is sustained,"" she told IDN.Tauli-Corpuz believes that COP22 did have a strong gender focus.""Women are here to make sure that their rights will also be addressed in the decisions being reached. Indigenous women are the strong allies for climate change solutions, they should be at the core of the discussions,"" she said.Civil society organisations and non-state actors had a crucial role in COP22, Driss El Yazami, Head of the Civil Society Team at the conference and President of the National Human Rights Council of Morocco, told IDN. ""Women's groups from several countries gathered here to lay the first foundations of an African Network of Women for Climate Justice. Reaching the Paris Agreement was itself influenced by civil society and non-state actors. The Paris Agreement recognises the important engagement of the various actors, including non-governmental organisations,"" she added.Around 1,500 local and regional leaders representing more than 780 local and regional governments from 114 countries gathered in Marrakech and launched a roadmap for action to start a global campaign to localise climate finance in 2017 and implement a 'Global Action Framework for Localising Climate Finance' by 2020.\l"

The Marrakech work has not been the most glamorous, but its a key step in the chain reaction needed to roll out the agreement.Countries commitment to the Paris Agreement also passed its first stress test this week with the US election results. Unequivocally, they restated that they are in this for the long haul.The reality is that the world is moving ahead on this issue. This irreversible momentum will only build as market signals and commitments across all sectors of society continue pouring in.Already, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement underscoring its historic importance. Nations also began submitting their long-term roadmaps for decarbonisation.But theres still work to do. The emissions gap continues to grow between what science tells us is needed to protect the planet from the worst impacts of climate change and the goals governments set in Paris. Urgently reducing emissions and preparing for the climate change impacts that are already affecting us is essential for the worlds future prosperity, safety and security.In Marrakech, countries agreed to take stock of progress in two years and make every effort to come back with more ambitious targets and plans before 2020 to ensure we work quickly to close the widening emissions gap. This is a critical outcome this week that further solidified progress on the Paris Agreement.While parties work to finalize the Paris Agreement fine print by the next major political moment in 2018, more needs to be done in the next few years to clarify consistency of national targets. In addition, there are still gaps in finance and adaptation, despite some announcements here on financing for adaptation and capacity building. We expect to see developed countries up their game significantly on finance and other support beyond current projections, and are very encouraged to see China and other countries stepping up their south-south cooperation.This work was bolstered by the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of around 50 countries that committed to reviewing and improving their current emissions-cutting goals in 2018 and shifting to 100% renewable energy by 2050 or before.Here in Marrakech the negotiations kick-started a critical discussion about the rules for implementing the agreement and accelerating climate action. It set the path for the next set of negotiations to complete those rules and raise ambition, paving the way to tighten national commitments, improve preparedness at home and provide financial support in l"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA107","AT COP22, UN WOMEN TO SPOTLIGHT CENTRAL ROLE OF WOMEN IN CLIMATE RESPONSE","November 8, 2016 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM):Events and activists to amplify co-benefits between gender equality and climate action for sustainable developmentMedia Contacts:Maria Sanchez, Ph: +1 646 781-4507; Email: maria.sanchez [at] unwomen.orgHouda Areski, Ph: +212 (0)6 70105995; Email: houda.areski[at]unwomen.orgOisika Chakrabarti, Ph: +1 646 781-4522; Email: oisika.chakrabarti[at]unwomen.org(New York, 7 November) Following the historic Paris Agreement, as the first Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 22) convenes in Marrakech from 7-18 November, the meeting provides a unique opportunity to ensure policy direction towards implementation of gender-responsive climate actions at all levels. The Paris Agreement, signed by 197 Parties (ratified by 94 to date) commits to promote gender equality obligations when addressing climate change.The impacts of climate change are not gender neutral. In the past 10 years 87 percent of disasters have been climate related. While disasters impact all segments of the population, evidence shows there are differences in how men and women are affected by, cope with and respond to such disasters. Climate change impacts women differently and disproportionately more than men. For example, women accounted for 67 per cent of the fatalities of the Indian Ocean Tsunami. Post-disaster assessment in Myanmar in 2015 showed that women and girls had lower recovery capacity due to lower incomes and fewer productive assets, and higher food insecurity and malnutrition. This differentiated impact is due to the structural barriers women face, from discriminatory laws, to social norms, and the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work. This is played out during disasters with women often being the last to escape as the ensure the safety of family members before ensuring their own and women and girls being vulnerable to sexual violence as they become food and water collectors post-disaster. Additionally, in the aftermath of disasters, discriminatory social norms such as food hierarchies and limited mobility, can also exclude women from life-saving services and decision making processes. Similarly, in agriculture, where women comprise 43 percent of the agricultural workforce, climate change exacerbates the existing barriers faced by women farmers, who have less resources, technology and land security due to discriminatory policy framework or harmful social norms.While the differential impact of climate change on women is increasingly understood, the critical role women and girls can play as leaders and agents of change in climate action and management of natural resources is often overlooked in climate negotiations, investments and policies. In most developing countries, for example, women are the primary household energy managers and key actors in the food system, and can be powerful actors in the transition to sustainable energy and climate resilient agricultureAt COP22UN Women events at COP22UN Women events will showcase best practices, initiatives and voices of women and girls at the forefront of climate response.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA108","Climate simulator plays role in COP15","February 2, 2017 Thursday","The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College","A climate simulator developed by a team of Dartmouth alumni played a key role in negotiations at the 15th United Nations held in Copenhagen last month. The Climate Rapid Overview and Decision-support Simulator, known as C-ROADS, provided real-time analysis used to inform negotiators during the talks.The Dartmouth alumni involved in the development of C-ROADS include Beth Sawin '88 and Drew Jones '90 of the Sustainability Institute, Tom Fiddaman '87 of Ventana Systems and John Sterman '77, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology System Dynamics Group and a management professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern '73 attended the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.C-ROADS is a ""decision-maker-oriented"" simulation that provides information on how greenhouse gas emission reductions will affect the global climate climate, according to the C-ROADS web site. The model allows users to calculate potential climate changes, including variations in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, global surface temperature and sea levels.Although climate models have been available for some time, C-ROADS changed the nature of negotiations at COP15, because C-ROADS made it possible to perform climate analyses quickly enough to provide immediate feedback to negotiators, according to Sterman.""C-ROADS is closing a big feedback loop between people's actions and their consequences,"" Jones said in an interview with The Dartmouth.According to Sterman, the advantage of C-ROADS lies in both its scientific reliability and its simple user interface.""C-ROADS is both grounded in and consistent with the best available climate science, as well as transparent, fast and easy to use,"" he added.Seven members of the C-ROADS team attended COP15. Jones and Sawin were present for the entire duration of the talks, according to Sawin.C-ROADS was more successful in Copenhagen than the team had anticipated, Sawin said. The group's web site, ClimateInteractive.org, received approximately 300,000 hits during the conference. The team's data was also published in major media outlets including the International Herald Tribune.Prominent political leaders, including U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern '73 and Sen. John Kerry D-Mass., have also recognized the advantages of using C-ROADS, according to Sterman. ""[Kerry] has taken a keen interest in C-ROADS and is a very strong advocate of its use,"" Sterman said.Currently, only the United States and China are officially using C-ROADS, but other countries have approached the developers and are considering the possibility of using the simulator, according to Jones.""C-ROADS is a tool for supporting joint conversation,"" Sawin said. ""We can see the possibility of greater cooperation.""The developers are now adapting the program to provide decision makers with more information about climate impact, including its effects on biodiversity, soil respiration, permafrost exposure and agricultural conditions.Jones and Sawin are meeting with top climate advisors from China's National Development and Reform Commission this week to develop a version of C-ROADS for the Chinese.""We want to empower not just the U.S. State Department, but other equivalents of the State Department around the world to do this kind of analysis themselves,"" Sawin said.C-ROADS was originally based on Fiddaman's doctoral dissertation at MIT. Later, in collaboration with the Sustainability Institute, the model gained momentum as developers realized there was an ""appetite"" for the technology, Fiddaman said in an interview with The Dartmouth.All the alumni involved in C-ROADS trace their initial interest in sustainability to the influence of late environmental studies professor Donella Meadows.""Dana Meadows taught us to make simulations relevant to decision making,"" Jones said.Although simulations provide political leaders with valuable information, they still have to gain public support to make progress in combating climate change, Fiddaman said.""President Obama wasn't able to promise more than he thinks the Senate can deliver, and the Senate can't go further than what they think the voters will support,"" Sawin said.The C-ROADS team has created several versions of the program to increase its usage. C-ROADS ""Common Platform,"" a version that can run on a laptop, was designed for use by climate analysts during COP15 negotiations, Sawin said.

The convention, which hosted over sixty heads of state, focused on taking concrete action in order to achieve the priorities laid out by the Paris Agreement, especially those related to adaptation, transparency, technology transfer, mitigation, capacity building and loss and damages. Despite the results of the US election, global leaders took the COP as an opportunity to reiterate their commitment to ensuring climate action moves forward. Salaheddine Mezouar, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs who chairs the conference on climate change, began the event by assuring the world that there is  no going a back on this fight Latin American countries in particular showed solidarity and reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the global efforts against climate change. Two main issues stood at the forefront of the agenda for countries in the region: the reporting and administrative structure of the agreement and financing schemes to support their efforts. The Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, representing eight countries in the region, publicly announced their commitment to ratify the Paris Agreement, pressed for greater clarity and transparency on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and emphasized the need for greater financing for developing countries. What Latin America brought to the table While much took place during the last two weeks, here is a recap of select actions from Latin American countries in Marrakesh: Chile, with President Michelle Bachelet in attendance, reiterated their commitment to climate action presenting their 3rd national Communication with updated national emissions inventory numbers. Chile also recently presented its new National Strategy on Climate Change and Vegetation Resources and created a Climate Change Agency. President Bachelet expressed the responsibility that Chile holds to work expeditiously on the implementation of the Agreement and the importance of a transparent global collective and collaborative effort to succeed in its implementation. Mexico presented their Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy listing priorities for action in the coming decades to reduce emissions 50 percent by 2050 and move towards a low carbon economy. (To read more about Mexico\' s progress toward its climate pledge read NRDCs issue brief here.) Mexico\' s delegation also highlighted the country\' s progress implementing their emission reduction goals through incremental renewable energy and emissions reductions targets. Highlighting progress at the national level through the passage of the General Climate Change and Energy Transition laws, Senator Silvia Garza Galv\'e1n commended the joint work of the executive and legislative branches to fulfill their climate commitments. Meanwhile, Governor of Jalisco, Aristoteles Sandoval Diaz, called on local action to support and push national efforts forward and urged world leaders to refrain from politicizing the issue of climate change. In a sign of the importance of cross-border collaboration, Mexico and Chile agreed to a US $14 million partnership with Canada to finance the adoption of clean technologies and waste management policies in order to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. Costa Rica and the Ivory Coast have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop greater collaboration between the two nations on issues of climate change and forestry with a focus on reducing deforestation. Colombia announced a plan to link forest protections to its peace process. The announcement included a plan to recognize indigenous claims to huge areas of rainforest. Recognition of native land tenure protects forests from illegal loggers and gives huge boosts to carbon storage. Brazil launched the BioFuturo Platform, a coalition of 20 countries that want to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels and biomaterials as an alternative to fossil fuels. (To read more about Brazil\' s progress toward its climate pledge read NRDCs issue brief here.) Meanwhile, Argentina\' s Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Sergio Bergman, announced he will focus on achieving zero deforestation and bringing a profound change in the country\' s energy matrix. During his speech, he said ""Climate challenge is not a technical one but an ethical one. It is about human rights and human responsibilities We must decide whether we are part of the problem or the solution. There must be a new link between politics and the economy and this is cannot be achieved without leadership."" Fifteen countries, including Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru, signed on to the second  Because the Oceans declaration. The signatories reaffirmed the initial declaration signed in Paris last year during COP21 and once again called for a high-level UN conference to develop a plan of action under the UNFCCC to protect the world\' s oceans from the effects of climate change. COP22 also saw the launch of the NDC Partnership aiming to enhance cooperation among nations to provide greater access to technical knowledge and financing to support developing countries NDCs.

Photo by: Mitchell Maher / International Food Policy Institute / CC BY-NC-NDMore than 1 billion people on the planet lack secure rights to the land they rely on for their livelihood, a problem that has long been recognized as an obstacle to economic development in the poorest parts of the world. Now, experts say, it's also proving to be an obstacle to solving climate change, with at least one-fourth of the world's forest carbon stored on communal land. The issue will get some attention at the upcoming COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco. But it stands as one of many side panel discussions on agriculture, implementation of the landmark Paris climate agreement and climate-related displacement, to name a few. ""It [the connection] is not understood or appreciated,"" explained Chris Jochnick, president and CEO of Landesa, a nonprofit that works to secure land rights for the world's poorest people. Jochnick spoke with Devex at the 11th annual Columbia International Investment Conference in New York this week, focused on climate change and sustainable investment in natural resources. He explained how land insecure farmers typically operate with ""short-term horizons,"" thinking mostly about basic productivity. They likely do not have the time or money to consider all of the climate-friendly practices and tools they should be implementing. ""When we recognize something like one-fourth of global emissions is attributed to agriculture, and most agriculture is done by smallholder farmers, if they are not practicing climate-smart techniques that is a huge loss in terms of what we could be doing. This undercuts everything we're trying to do on climate change,"" Jochnick said. Present NASA projections of global sea level rise by year 2100 range from 0.2 to 2.0 meters. The Paris climate change agreement, agreed upon in December 2015, commits governments to reduce emissions to help limit rising global temperatures to under 2 degrees Celsius. The deal went into effect Friday, just in time for COP22, the United Nations annual climate change conference.Land rights are included as part of the Sustainable Development Goals an evolution from their exclusion from the Millennium Development Goals. This has not translated into language in the Paris agreement, however, and in most national climate action plans. Or, for that matter, in a funding boost, Jochnick told Devex. Though he said he has witnessed a growth in partnerships with the development of the 2030 development agenda. Women, meanwhile, are generally more likely to not have land in their names. ""The minority of countries are looking at it, but it's the minority. Women and land rights in particular are virtually absent and that is just so shortsighted, because ... land is at the center of so many issues, so if you can't get that right, you are really building on a house of sand,"" Jochnick said. The Ford Foundation, though, is paying attention to new youth-focused funding opportunities in this area, and how the narrative can be reshaped to focus on people who are advocating for their land, not just those who are painted as victims, said Penny Davies, a program officer of the Ford Foundation's Equitable Development team.""There's a lot of talk about vulnerable communities and a significant number of people are actually protecting their forests and not being recognized for that work,"" she said. ""We're relying on young people to have a relationship with those forests and land. ... I'm keen on promoting youth engagement and positive things, people who are proud of their territory.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA117","Indigenous Knowledge offers innovative solutions to address climate change","November 7, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Paris: UNESCO has issued the following news release: The UNESCO Pavilion at the 2016 UN Conference on Climate Change (COP22) opened its doors today with a series of discussions on the solutions that indigenous knowledge can offer to tackle climate change, and how to best support particularly vulnerable local and indigenous communities. Over 400 million of the world\' s indigenous peoples live in territories that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Indigenous peoples of northern Europe, Siberia and Alaska, pastoralist communities in the Sahel, or island communities in the Pacific Ocean, to name but a few, are already experiencing adverse effects very keenly. Yet they are using their highly detailed knowledge, produced through direct experience over generations, to observe and respond actively to changing climatic conditions. Indigenous representatives presented the main conclusions of the international conference organized by UNESCO and CNRS in support of international efforts to implement the Paris Climate Agreement. Held on 2 and 3 November 2016, it focused on the role that indigenous and local knowledge can play, alongside science, in observing and responding to the impacts of a changing climate. UNESCO has long recognized that we need to bring together understandings, values and solutions from many horizons in order to tackle global challenges.  Indigenous peoples respond, innovate and adapt to this context of change, and their resilience is rooted in their ways of life and their social solidarity , stressed Flavia Schlegel, UNESCO\' s Assistant Director-General for the Natural Sciences.  They will find a path, whatever the hardships, thanks to their trust in their deeply rooted cultures, and the strength of their observations and knowledge, which are both ancestral and innovative . Collaboration between indigenous knowledge holders and mainstream scientific research can generate new co-produced knowledge that will enable effective action to cope with climate change. The similarities and differences between different knowledge systems must be better understood, in order to facilitate this collaboration. For example, extreme events are measured by Sami herders in terms of consequence, while climatologist will consider intensity. A series of low-intensity warm and cold spells, resulting in the formation of an ice crust on the snow that prevents reindeer for accessing their food, will be recorded as an extreme event by the Sami but not by climatologists. Indigenous observations and knowledge factor in elements that are often overlooked by scientific experts. In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists traditionally predict weather and climate through the observation of stars, winds, livestock, insects, birds, trees and other wildlife. The information is collected, shared and analyzed through traditional institutions, who triangulate various sources of information. Over generations, indigenous peoples have modified and maintained most of the world\' s \' wilderness\' areas. Fire management, community forestry and indigenous soil enhancement practices have shaped landscapes across the globe. These traditional practices have the potential to enhance carbon sinks and provide benefits back to the communities; they provide tools for the sustainable management of nature. However, defining appropriate ways to engage indigenous knowledge at the intergovernmental level remains challenging, although international recognition of indigenous knowledge of the environment has accelerated, coupled with an increased awareness of the need to safeguard rights of indigenous peoples. A series of thematic days will be ogranized during COP22 at the UNESCO Pavilion in the Civil Society Area of the COP22 conference, to assist Member States through UNESCO's uniquely multidisciplinary expertise and outreach in climate change education, science, culture and communication, mobilizing efforts for enhanced climate change awareness and action.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA120","Report from COP22: Focus shifts to implementing the Paris agreement","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington: Green Building Council has issued the following news release: At COP22 in Marrakech, participants focused on what will be needed to implement last year's historic Paris climate agreement. With unprecedented speed, the historic Paris Agreement has entered into force less than one year after representatives of more than 190 countries came together for the climate negotiations. The signing of the agreement paved the way for this year\' s Conference of Parties, (COP22), in Marrakech, Morocco, to focus on implementation. Doubling down on climate commitment At the outset of COP22, climate news was both sobering and motivating. The UN released its annual Emissions Gap Report documenting in detail what we already knew that even the current Paris Agreement pledges (known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs) are insufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees, and UNEP calls for the world to cut an additional 25 percent from predicted 2030 emissions. Scientists also warn we need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees to avoid the worst consequences. The magnitude of scale-up required is staggering. The IEA estimates that investment of $1 trillion annually in low carbon energy by 2030 is needed. U.S. Special Envoy Jonathan Pershing emphasized how important it is to make sure the Paris Agreement is successful in these early years, saying that positive reinforcement will build momentum and motivate further ambition. In Marrakech, national delegates got to work, developing the  rule book for how to implement several key sections of the Paris Agreement. For example, working groups and subsidiary bodies were considering technology investment pathways; carbon accounting rules to promote environmental integrity and support transfers; and the data sources to be used in the global  stocktake, which will be conducted in 2018 and every five years thereafter to assess the collective progress toward the agreement\' s goals. When the unexpected U.S. election results came in midweek, the international community had questions, but remained focused on strengthening its commitment to the task at hand. International market transformation The overarching theme at this year\' s COP was the inevitability of massive market transformation, which is already under way, particularly in regard to renewable energy. Host country Morocco is a case in point. After phasing out its subsidy of fossil fuels over the past decade, the nation shifted to wind and solar and recently received the lowest-ever wind energy cost of $30/MWh for its tender. Moreover, China\' s recent shift in policy away from coal motivated in part to address health concerns related to air pollution along with the drop in natural gas prices have already flattened coal consumption globally. In addition, the IEA issued its World Energy Outlook 2016, finding that the combination of cost reductions across the energy sector and government policies will enable a doubling of both renewables and improvements in energy efficiency over the next 25 years. Economic benefits to climate action Along with the market signals, the economic opportunity presented by climate action was on full display at the conference, prominent in the speeches and pavilions of national governments from around the globe. Jill Duggan of We Mean Business and the Prince of Wales Corporate Leadership Group called the Paris Agreement  a fantastic business opportunity and described the private sector as a crucial partner in securing a prosperous and sustainable low-carbon economy for all. Duggan was joined by many governments and thought leaders alike in recognizing a strong business voice as essential to successful implementation of the agreement. USGBC was pleased to participate in a UNFCCC panel, along with the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE), Philips Lighting, the Alliance to Save Energy (ASE), Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, that focused on how businesses are supporting action while growing the economy. Data from Bloomberg Finance, in partnership with BSCE, illustrated the decoupling of energy consumption and GDP growth in the U.S.: as our GDP expanded 83 percent over the last 25 years, energy consumption only ticked up 17 percent. USGBC presented tools like the recently launched arc platform and carbon metric tracking. Examples of new business models to deliver clean energy and energy efficiency were discussed and the panel focused on solutions that are supporting Paris Agreement goals.

One meeting focus will be on global forest initiatives meant to store carbon, such as REDD+. Negotiators will look at ways in which to effectively engage tropical countries such as Indonesia, which continues clear-cutting its rainforests and replacing them with vast tracts of oil palm plantations. Another discussion will focus on 'loss and damage,' and seek pragmatic ways in which the world's nations can financially support countries suffering from major disruptive climate change disasters. The insurance industry questions whether projected gigantic climate change losses can be insured against. A major concern is that fossil fuel companies and transnational corporate lobbies, which wield tremendous influence at UN climate conferences, will be able to dull the teeth of any climate change-curbing mechanisms put in place. Environmental NGOs will be on hand to guard against such efforts. An open-air market in Marrakesh, Morocco. The city is hosting November's COP22 Climate Conference and decisions made there could shape its future. If the rising heat brought by global warming isn't abated, then parts of North Africa could become inhabitable by mid-century, according to a 2016 study. Feliciano Guimara es licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic licenseThe first question I ask officials heading to Marrakesh, Morocco for this November's United Nations Climate Summit known as COP22: How do you top Paris? 'There is a lot of political momentum coming from Paris,' answers Dan Bodansky, a climate adviser to the White House and a law professor at Arizona State University. 'But will it actually lead to a dynamic where there are changes on the ground in terms of what countries are actually doing?' That is exactly the sort of nuts-and-bolts pragmatic role negotiators hope COP22 will play apr\'e8s Paris. The Paris Agreement is without question an historic achievement. World leaders authored the first-ever blueprint to broadly tackle climate change. The agreement was ratified globally with unprecedented haste and achieves the force of law this week, on November 4th, four years earlier than anticipated. Meanwhile, more than 100 countries, including the U.S., China and India, agreed last month to dramatically limit the future use of hydroflourocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners. Another climate victory was hailed. But those headed to COP22[1] will emphatically tell anyone listening: Folks, we're not there yet. We're not even close. So COP22, the Conference of the Parties  running from November 7-18  will need to top Paris in many very practical ways.The global media spotlighted COP21, where the Paris Agreement was finalized in December 2015. But it is at COP22 this November  an event not likely to be well covered by journalists  that the world's nations must begin hammering out the nuts-and-bolts mechanisms needed to cut carbon emissions and reduce planetary average temperatures. Photo courtesy of NASACreating an operations manual for curbing climate change Marrakesh negotiators must get nuts-and-bolts meticulous about exactly how the world's nations will reduce carbon emissions; how we will adapt to more extreme weather events; where we will reduce deforestation and promote reforestation; how we will inspire innovative clean-energy solutions; and, maybe most importantly, how we will raise the trillions necessary to make the singularly vital planet-saving goal of Paris happen  keeping global temperatures from rising another 0.5 degree C by 2100. 'We need an operational manual for the Paris Agreement,' Nick Nuttal, spokesman for the UN Climate Conference says from Bonn, Germany. 'This is where Marrakesh needs to make a lot of progress. How will developed and developing countries report what they are doing? Transparency is key. We need to trust that your NDCs [nationally determined contributions] are being achieved.' If these initial voluntary carbon emission cuts  pledged in Paris  are not achieved, and then quickly toughened, particularly by developed nations, then the world faces the growing wrath of a destabilized climate system. Faster sea-level rise. More drought. More ferocious hurricanes and typhoons. And more climate-change refugees[2] fleeing uninhabitable tropical regions, coasts and low-lying island nations. Climate scientists agree that this is the price of waiting two decades to marshal the political will to approve the Paris Agreement, which commits 195 nations to a vastly reduced carbon future. As a range of officials make clear, the pathway to that future remains undefined and unbuilt, thus raising the stakes in Marrakesh.Logging in Malaysia.

In Paris, forests and their preservation through carbon offset programs like REDD+[3] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) were recognized as crucial in absorbing and storing CO2 emissions in order to buy time while the world moves rapidly from burning fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. 'It's really nice to be working in global forests right now,' WRI's Harris says from Washington, D.C. 'The recognition of forests as a climate-change mitigation strategy  reducing emissions and increasing carbon sinks  is more visible. But right now it's all talk, and progress is being made too slowly.'

Day after day in Marrakech, I was struck by two things. First, the world increasingly gets it: cities need to be at the heart of this fight for our planet. Second, we're on the cusp of tremendous economic opportunities here as well.""As the COP process has evolved, so too has the municipal presence. We have grown from observer status, to staging side events, to taking our full place on official national delegations. In Marrakech, cities were the focus of some of the highest-profile discussions. On Tuesday, I spoke at an event highlighting the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, a new initiative convening 7,100 cities to coordinate local climate action.""Here in Canada, municipalities influence half of our country's GHG emissions. And we were able to tell the world how we are responding with some of Canada's most innovative low-carbon practices. Since 1994, the 300 member municipalities of FCM's Partners for Climate Protection program have cut 1.8 million tonnes from Canada's carbon footprint - through building retrofits, district heating, low-GHG waste systems and more. FCM's Green Municipal Fund is seeding deep local innovation that has already cut nearly half a million tonnes of GHGs.""Some of the richest potential to reduce Canada's GHG emissions lies in scaling up this local innovation. This is why the new federal commitment to invest in green infrastructure can be the heart of Canada's climate strategy - if it puts local solutions first. And I do want to commend federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna for her leadership here. As a down payment on the progress we need, her government recently funded FCM's Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program. This will give local governments new tools to make smart infrastructure decisions that support GHG reductions and climate resiliency.""In Marrakech, Minister McKenna championed the message that confronting climate change presents great economic opportunities as well. FCM strongly agrees. We believe Canada has the talent and culture of innovation to help lead a global shift toward clean technology and deep conservation. And by scaling up local solutions, we will be generating sustainable growth, new sectors of green jobs, cleaner water for our children, and yes, faster commute times as well. Canada's cities and communities are ready. FCM will continue working with all our partners -- federal, provincial, Indigenous, international -- to meet Canada's climate challenge, while improving our quality of life from coast to coast to coast.""Copyright Targeted News ServicesEditorVail-5705887 EditorVail\l"

Several events were held throughout this Water Action Day, including a high level panel organized by the host country of this global summit on climate change in the United Nations blue zone.The African Development Bank (AfDB) was represented by its Director for Water Supply and Sanitation, Mohamed El Azizi in the discussions panel. The Moroccan Junior Minister for Water, Charafat Afilal; Water Ministers Barmou Salifou, Niouga Ambroise Ouedraogo and Sidick Abdelkerim Haggar from Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, respectively, as well as the Director of the Moroccan Office of Electricity and Potable Water (ONEE), Ali Fassi El Fihri, took part in this roundtable's lively discussions.Water mentioned in 85% of INDCsWater is at the heart of many challenges posed by climate change, and calls for as many solutions. Even a slight increase in the earth's temperature will have serious consequences: climate variability is increasing and its impacts are more numerous, more serious and longer lasting, particularly extreme climate events (floods and droughts, for example). Such phenomena lead to increased water pollution, higher incidence of malnutrition, more migration and more significant losses, particularly in infrastructure and agricultural production. More than 85% of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) presented by countries participating in the Paris Agreement cite water as a key adaptation issue, the UNFCCC noted during COP22.""Water insecurity leads to heightened conflicts, tension among populations, and causes migrations that threaten global stability,"" stated Minister Charafat Afilal.""Africa is the continent that is most vulnerable to climate change,"" said Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the AfDB's Water Supply and Sanitation Department. He added, ""It's about providing justice, in the context of climate financing, to this continent, which has suffered the consequences of climate change without having been responsible for it. African countries are concerned with the complex and difficult access to climate financing, particularly for fragile countries.""Large water adaptation projects financed by AfDB in MoroccoThe Bank has financed large projects for climate change adaptation in Morocco. Among these are the water transfer project between the Rabat and Casablanca watersheds that impacts the daily lives of 5 million people, the Marrakech region water supply project, benefitting 2 million people, and the Tetouan region potable water supply security project via the transfer of water from the Tangier Med port facilities to the Moulay El Hassan Bel Mehdi dam. ""I would like to congratulate the Bank for its ability to react, responding quickly to our financing needs for this project,"" stated ONEE Director Ali Fassi Fihri. ""[It] has ensured service continuity for potable water in the area, because without supplementary service prior to the end of 2016, the entire Tetouan area would be confronted with a catastrophic water shortage.""On the Water Action Day, Morocco used the opportunity to officially launch a new initiative, ""Water for Africa "". This initiative began prior to COP22, in July 2016 in Rabat, during the International Conference on Water and Climate, organized by the country in partnership with the World Water Council. The goal is to mobilise the international community to develop an emergency action plan on water to confront climate change in Africa and thereby mobilise the necessary financial resources.

Speaking at the high-level action day on agriculture and food security, Graziano da Silva noted that climate change impacts on agriculture - including crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, land and water - are already undermining global efforts to assure food security and nutrition. And the rural poor are the most affected. With over 90 percent of countries referring to the important role of agriculture in their national plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change, Graziano da Silva stressed that ""it is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution."" Last year's conference in Paris led to the world's first legally binding global climate deal. The current summit in Marrakech, Morocco is geared to implementation of the pledges all signatory countries made. Echoing the prevalent spirit at the COP, the Paris Agreement is irreversible and inaction would be a disaster for the world. Transforming agriculture - maximizing benefits Although agriculture contributes to nearly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fundamental part of the solution to boost resilience and combat climate change impacts - especially in developing countries where agriculture is often the backbone of the economy. Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people. Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services; and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. ""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" FAO's Director-General said. ""Countries are recognizing this potential with unprecedented commitments."" Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added. A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, today's special event co-organized by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Hait\'e9 (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals. In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, today FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative."" At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particure, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector.

Temperature readings are breaking record after record, confirming that the world is day by day drawing dangerously closer to the threshold beyond which climate disruptions will no longer be manageable. Extreme meteorological phenomena fires, droughts, torrential rains, extended heat waves are following each other at an alarming rate as well, exposing millions of men and women to material and psychological disarray. In the face of such a situation, a wait and see attitude simply will not do. It is now more urgent than ever to amplify and step up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to generalise the implementation of policies commensurate with the transformations in progress and to come. Also, in the days before the COP 22 held in Marrakech, the ETUC has identified five priority demands, which largely mirror those of the international trade union movement as formulated by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC).The Paris Agreement must be implemented now!ETUC demands that no effort be spared to have the Paris Agreement implemented rapidly, as it lays the foundations for action against climate change that will be global for the first time. The ETUC welcomes the ratification of the agreement by the EU and call Member states to confirm their commitment through a rapid ratification of the text. The ETUC hopes that the early entry into force of the agreement will open the way to the application of its main provisions without delay. It is vital in fact to analyse national contributions and improve them where warranted as promptly as possible. Investment mainly public investment, just transition and the creation of quality jobs should be at the heart of national contributions, which must be developed with the participation of social partners.No devil in the details!To accelerate the implementation of the agreement, ETUC also calls on the successful completion at the COP22 in Marrakech of negotiations on elements of the Agreement on which a decision is still pending, and the ""Transparency Framework,"" the ""Global Stocktake,"" ""Guidel"

This year's climate negotiations followed a year of historic progress: more than 175 nations signing the Paris Agreement on Earth Day 2016, the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, the Paris Agreement's entry into force on November 4 -- which was years ahead of schedule -- the U.S. electric sector already meeting the Clean Power Plan's 2024 goal for reducing carbon emissions and 2030 target for reducing coal use, and 47 countries from the Climate Vulnerable Forum announcing their commitment to 100 percent clean energy between 2030 and 2050.In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement:""The world came together in Paris to take unprecedented action to tackle the climate crisis, and in Marrakech, we came together to affirm that no individual country or leader has the power to derail that momentum. The Sierra Club is heartened by the committed resolve and continued dedication leaders around the world have shown to meaningful and lasting climate action. Climate leaders, activists, businesses, labor leaders, faith groups, environmental justice advocates, and youth leaders from across the globe convened in Marrakech with the goal of working to avert the worst effects of the climate crisis. In fact, nations are reaffirming their commitments, nearly 50 nations committed to going to 100 percent clean energy, and new research shows the U.S. is already on the path to meet key carbon reduction goals before they are even implemented. It is clear that this progress will not be stopped, even in the face of threats by President-elect Trump.""If history has taught us anything, it is that it is the people who have the power to make change possible. We know that it was the power of grassroots activists and everyday citizens that brought us the historic Paris Agreement last December and it is that same power that will move the world forward toward a just and equitable clean energy economy.""The Sierra Club and our 2.4 million members and supporters are proud to be a part of that movement, and we're as committed as ever to continuing to work with our friends and allies to ensure a safe and stable climate for our communities, our families, and our planet.""###About the Sierra ClubThe Sierra Club is America's largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 2.4 million members and supporters. In addition to helping people from all backgrounds explore nature and our outdoor heritage, the Sierra Club works to promote clean energy, safeguard the health of our communities, protect wildlife, and preserve our remaining wild places through grassroots activism, public education, lobbying, and legal action.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA132","IMPERIAL URGES CLIMATE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER HOW TO FUND LOW-EMISSION TECHNOLOGY","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Imperial College London:Representatives from Imperial are travelling to Morocco to attend the United Nations (COP22), which starts today.For two weeks in the country's capital, Marrakech, staff, students and climate communicators will engage with international policymakers, learn about the negotiation process and talk about how research, innovation and finance can provide solutions to the climate change problem.The Grantham Institute, together with Imperial College Business School, are also organising anofficial side-eventat the conference, to encourage discussion about how investment banks that target companies developing low-emission technologies, and other funding schemes will be needed to tackle climate change.THE STORY SO FARThe Paris Agreement was drawn up at the COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, where 197 nations agreed to limit global warming to 'well below two degrees' above pre-industrial temperatures, and to aim for a more ambitious limit of one and a half degrees.Throughout the year, governments have confirmed their commitment to the treaty, and reducing their emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane from sources such as industrial processes, fossil fuel power plants, combustion engines and agriculture.By 5 October more than 55 countries, representing more than 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and including the largest emitters (the European Union, China, India and the United States), had accepted the Agreement's terms enough for the UN to confirm it would come into effect this month.Grantham Institute Co-Director, Professor Joanna Haigh, said: ""It was remarkable that 195 countries unanimously reached an agreement in Paris. Even more amazing was that the primary stated objective, of keeping the average global warming below one and a half degrees, was not even on the table before that meeting. A further achievement is that the treaty has legally entered into force within less than 12 months. All that is hugely important.""The previous climate change agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, took five years to come into effect.""Now, of course, the harder work begins in finding routes to achieve the stated objectives,"" said Professor Haigh.DEVIL IN THE DETAILSAs next steps, delegates at the COP22 conference will flesh out details of the concepts and principles agreed in Paris. Amongst these are provisions for adapting to climate change, financial contributions from industrialised nations to those at risk from the effects, rules about tracking progress of mitigation, and the potential to use trading or market mechanisms to deliver its goals.The devil is usually in the detail of such an agreement so getting these right in Marrakech really mattersMs Alyssa GilbertHead of Policy and Translation, Grantham Institute""The devil is usually in the detail of such an agreement so getting these right in Marrakech really matters,"" said Alyssa Gilbert, Grantham Institute Head of Policy and Translation.Grantham Institute Senior Policy Research Fellow, Ajay Gambhir, said: ""On the positive side, countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, with a transparency and accountability framework that is likely to encourage countries to step up their action.""Low-emission technologies are also becoming increasingly cost-effective, making it more viable to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases nations produce. As countries discover what works, their experience should create further momentum towards an emission-free global energy system.""INTERNATIONAL ACCORD""Right now there are no legally binding targets on individual countries and regions, and the current voluntary pledges are inadequate in putting us on a path towards the Agreements goal of keeping global warming 'well below two degrees',"" explains Gambhir.International efforts will be needed to increase governments' ambitions for the Nationally Determined Contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and to reach some agreement on methods for their monitoring and verification.Gilbert is particularly interested in the plans to keep track of progress starting with a so-called 'global stocktake' in 2023.""There is an ongoing debate on the appropriate levels of transparency and reporting on countries' progress. The delegates in Marrakech will be thrashing out some of the details of what these protocols will look like,"" she said.BREAKTHROUGH COALITIONNational delegates to the climate summit will add details to the Agreement and demonstrate their home countries are willing to progress from setting an ambitious goal to actually working towards achieving it.Professor Haigh said: ""The immediate next steps should be for governments to implement the easy-to-achieve energy saving measures such as improving efficiency and reducing waste. They must act fast on reducing urban pollution, facilitating low-emission transport and reducing meat consumption; all of which would deliver benefits, and future cost-savings, for public health and sustainable development"".Gambhir added: ""The flow of finance from industrialised countries to help poorer countries tackle climate change remains a sticking point. At this stage, very little money has been committed compared to whats been estimated to be needed and the Agreement makes no legal requirement for specific funds to flow.""However, developing countries are unlikely to withdraw from the process, given that climate change is an existential issue for many of them, threatening rising sea levels and a range of other harmful impacts.""Speaking to national journalists at aScience Media Centre press conferencelast Tuesday, Professor Haigh said: ""Research and development funds for innovation in clean technology were promised in Paris by governments and the private sector, and these should be mobilised without delay.""Research and development funds for innovation in clean technology were promised in Paris by governments and the private sector, and these should be mobilised without delayProfessor Joanna Haigh CBEShe added today: ""The business and finance communities need to be fully involved as partners in achieving the necessary progress, and efforts should be made to expand the emissions trading markets already operating very successfully in a few parts of the world.""At the COP22The event, ""Investing in the planet: Green banks and other financial tools to scale up mitigation technologies"" will take place at the Conference centre on 14 November 2016, and is open to all official conference delegates.

Over many years of involvement in developing and implementing EU climate policy, the JRC has accrued substantial technical expertise in a number of areas central to the international climate negotiations. This expertise is deployed during the conference in three distinct ways, all of them geared at advancing the EU's goals: scientific and technical advice to EU negotiators; contributions to debates engaging other delegations and their experts; and analyses released in time for the conference to inform related debates in the broader scientific and policy arena.

The side event, Investing in the Planet: Green banks and other financial tools to scale-up mitigation technologies, was hosted by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE), Imperial College London, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).The event looked examined practical solutions to implement the Paris Agreement, with the help of chemical engineers and financial institutions. Dr Rachael Hall, from IChemE's Energy Centre Board gave the first presentation, an overview of deployment technologies available to mitigate climate change.Outlining the various pathways to a zero-carbon economy, as demonstrated in IChemE's technical policy document Chemical Engineering Matters, Dr Hall said:""Our reliance on fossil fuels will not stop overnight, but IChemE's energy vista shows how chemical engineering can support a variety of solutions. We need to make better use of waste streams, we need to integrate our processes and ensure each and every Joule of energy is efficiently used.""Her presentation discussed the benefits of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Hall acknowledged that the most efficient use of CCS is as a bridging technology during the transition from oil and gas, and highlighted the various benefits including that it still remains the lowest cost storage solution.Concluding her presentation with her own knowledge of smart networks, Hall spoke about the right investment needed to maximise the potential and accessibility of technologies. She made clear that a low-carbon world would still need to provide the resilience and capacity the world's growing population had become accustomed to.Hall said: ""We need to invest in the future, build a strong research base and collaborate with an open-minded network of experts and enthusiasts.""Mark Apsey, also a Board member of IChemE's Energy Centre, gave his presentation on the pathways for organisations to deliver energy efficiency projects. Outlining various 'road blocks' to implementing greener energy solutions, he made clear that more needed to be done to incentivise delivery.Apsey said: ""There is an inherent short-termism in organisations, and no pressure to look at energy efficiency as a priority area. We need direct intervention from government to help tackle this - either by implementing a climate change tax, or by offering rewards to those who comply. There also needs to be a way to enforce efficiency technologies - taking inspiration from UK Health and Safety legislation, companies must be pressured to report their annual emissions.""Apsey concluded that there were three areas that needed to be tackled if the targets outl"

This conference comes within a climate of hope and of legitimate aspirations for all of humanity, said the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, Salaheddine Mezouar, who was elected today by acclamation as President of COP 22, formally the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  The unprecedented mobilization of the international community and its political will, expressed at the highest levels, have been crowned by the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement. This is unrivaled progress [ ] and now we must build on this momentum, give tangible meaning to this major step forward through decisions geared towards implementation, he stated. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22, where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on 15 November. Before the meeting wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. In his remarks today, Mr. Mezouar urged participants  to be more ambitious, and stressed that  the eyes of the world are on us [ ]  We have a huge responsibility before humanity and we must join forces in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations. We must provide them with the resources to adapt to the disastrous consequences of climate change.

In the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development,"" State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), affirmed their ""commitment"" to the ""full implementation"" of the Paris Agreement. They welcomed the ""extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide."" As of Friday 18 November, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, in time for COP 22, which has been under way since 7 November. ""This momentum is irreversible it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels,"" adds the Proclamation. ""Our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).""President of COP 22 Salaheddine Mezouar. Photo: UNFCCCNegotiations between State-Parties were continuing on Friday afternoon on aspects of the implementation of the Agreement. ""We continue to negotiate on a number of things"", said the President of COP 22, Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, at a press conference. Welcoming the outcome of the Conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, he noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In a statement issued by his spokesperson in New York, Mr. Ban applauded the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. ""As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" said the statement, adding that the UN chief also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. The Marrakech Proclamation calls for ""the highest political commitment to combat climate change"" and calls for ""strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,"" underscoring the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability. State-Parties also call ""for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement"" and ""for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries."" In the Marrakech Proclamation, developed country reaffirmed their $100 billion mobilization goal per year by 2020 to support climate action by developing countries. All countries also called on all non-state actors to join them ""for immediate and ambitious action and mobilization, building on their important achievements."" Alongside the negotiations, the two-week Marrakech Conference focused on various actions and initiatives taken by Governments and non-state actors to address climate change. On Thursday, the Conference launched the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action Agenda to further scale up cooperative efforts in which businesses, sub-national and local governments and civil society team up with national governments to promote low-emission and resilient development.

Among the measures agreed upon at last years meeting in Paris was the need to address the socio-economic impact of climate change, taking into account the special needs of developing countries.In response to this, the three agencies highlighted the tool box of trade measures that can enable the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. These include:reducing costs and deploying key climate technologies quickly to where they will have the biggest impactstimulating investment in energy, infrastructure, transport, information technology and other key sectors of the new climate economyfostering the competitive markets that encourage individuals, enterprises and entire industries to learn from past experience, innovate and do better.Participants agreed to continue working together to help countries explore the role of trade in delivering Nationally Determined Contributions, which countries had submitted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The participants also resolved to explore the complementary benefits of trade and climate policies, for example in lowering air pollution.Bonapas Onguglo, Head of the Trade Analysis Branch in the Division of International Trade in Goods, Services and Commodities, said: Trade can help meet the shared challenge of economic diversification. Trade provides the most direct route for transferring innovations from market to market and especially into the developing world. Trade can help generate employment, which is an important policy goal for many developing countries.Aik Hoe Lim, Director of the WTOs Trade and Environment Division, said: Trade is a powerful tool to lower the cost of key green technologies, and to help their quick and large scale deployment to where they are needed. Over 40 WTO members are currently negotiating an Environmental Goods Agreement that seeks to eliminate tariffs on a broad range of environmental goods, while creating opportunities for new jobs and economic diversification. This is just one example of how the WTO supports sustainable development in its day-to-day work.Anders Aeroe, Director of Markets and Institutions at ITC, said: Trade has an important role to play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and helping developing countries and their small, medium sized enterprises (SMEs) address the impact of climate change. Trade enables low-cost deployment of climate-friendly and sustainable technology and builds economic diversification. Through climate-proofed Aid for Trade, ITC will continue to support inclusive and environmentally sustainable trade for developing countries and their SMEs.\l"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA150","Climate Change Policymakers Can Be Swayed","April 14, 2017 Friday","US Official News","New York: Fordham University has issued the following news release: Photo Policymakers are reluctant to change their minds when it comes to complex subjects like climate change, even when they\' re presented with data that contradicts their preconceived notions. But new research shows that in some cases, it\' s possible to sway them with just the right presentation of that data. In a recent study co-authored by David Budescu, Ph.D., Fordham\' s Anne Anastasi Professor of Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology, 217 policymakers who attended the 2015 United Nations in Paris were asked to predict how much global temperatures will increase by the year 2100. In a control study, a group of MBA students were recruited and asked to predict the same question. The question was put to both groups before seeing three different graphical depictions of predicted temperature increases from data gathered from 30 climate models, and again after they viewed each graph. Budescu said the idea was to see if policymakers and climate negotiators who tend to use scientific information in a very conservative way and rarely allow it to influence their beliefs might reconsider their perspective if the same information were presented to them in different formats. One graph was a boxplot that covered 90 percent of the predicted temperatures from the 5th to 95th percentile of the data; The second graph was the same boxplot but also showed the extreme data points outside the 90 percent range of predicted temperatures; The Third graph contained the same boxplot but also included all 30 data points (inside and outside of the box). The original judgments of the two groups were highly similar, but the MBA students, who had no preconceived notions about the subject, updated their beliefs about future temperature increases after seeing each of the model predictions. But policymakers were largely unconvinced. It was only the last format, with more detail, that convinced some policymakers to alter their predictions of future temperature increases, even though all three graph presentations illustrated the temperature increases.

Offering expert support to government partners, GIZ is assisting in all phases of design and implementation of project activities to be launched in all of Morocco's mosques.Morocco Boasts one of the World's Largest MosquesAfter 32 years in the planning, Morocco's Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca finally opened its doors to worshippers and tourists in 1993. Now an iconic national landmark, the Hassan II Mosque was built in part as a mausoleum to honor King Hassan II's father, Mohammed V, who passed away in 1961. Plans to build the mausoleum had not progressed by 1980, and so, during a celebration to honor King Hassan II's 60th birthday celebration, Hassan II directly requested a new building for Casablanca. 'I wish Casablanca to be endowed with a large, fine building of which it can be proud until the end of time,' stated[6] King Hassan II. 'I want to build this mosque on the water,' he added, referring to a verse in the Qur£n, 'because God's throne is on the water. Therefore, the faithful who go there to pray, to praise the creator on firm soil, can contemplate God's sky and ocean.'

Working tirelessly to promote the economic welfare of his realm, Mohammed VI is beloved in his nation and around the world for his visionary efforts. Especially in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, Morocco is making far better progress than any other nation on the African continent.

Approximately 14 percent (or 2 GW) is planned to be met by solar PV and solar thermal plants. The approach of the 22nd United Nations of the Parties (COP22) being held November 7-18 in Marrakech is spurring progress, but there is lots of room for improvement. As of yet, Morocco has not developed any remuneration policy framework encouraging investors, be they residential homeowners, business owners, or even utility-scale plant developers. However, as pv magazine[13] noted recently, 'the Moroccan government is finally moving to clear the regulatory hurdles in the way of PV development. This could include introducing provisions under which households and building owners can receive feed in payments for electricity produced by rooftop PV systems.' It took 32 years and one big birthday bash to build the celebrated Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca. Perhaps the COP22 in Marrakech is just what Morocco needs to successfully launch itself into the Renewable Energy Age. Stay tuned, we'll be covering the action!

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA156","Washington: Meet the fossil fuel lobbyists and climate science deniers at the Marrakech COP22 talks","November 17, 2016 Thursday","US Official News","Washington: Corporate Accountability International has issued the following news release: It\' s no secret fossil fuel companies will have to fundamentally change their business models if countries are serious about tackling climate change. With so much skin in the game, it\' s no surprise they find ways to try and influence climate policy at the highest level. The international climate talks in Marrakech this week has provided the perfect opportunity for corporate lobbyists and climate science deniers to push their high carbon agendas. Who\' s who Prior to the COP22 negotiations currently underway in Marrakech, Corporate Accountability International released a mapshowing how fossil fuel representatives can get access at the highest level. Many of the groups they identify do indeed have a presence in the inner \' blue zone\' of the talks, where negotiators meet to hammer out the details of global climate policy. Most non-state actors and companies are officially consigned to the \' green zone\' in a separate section of the venue). Here\' s a rundown of the climate science deniers and fossil fuel representatives to keep an eye out for, taken from the conference\' s official participant list: Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI): The CEI is a neoconservative think tank that  questions global warming alarmism, makes the case for access to affordable energy, and opposes energy-rationing policies . Their crew listed as  participants at COP22 includes some familiar climate science deniers, including: Myron Ebell, the man tapped to lead the EPA\' s transition for Donald Trump and head of the CEI\' s Center for Energy and Environment. He hasn\' t been spotted at the conference yet. Harlan Watson, who was head of the delegation to the UNFCCC when the US refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol, is also here as an \' adjunct scholar\' of the Centre for Energy and Environment. Marc Morano, the Communications Director at CFACT, a conservative think-tank in Washington D.C. that has received funding from ExxonMobil and Chevron, is here. So is Craig Rucker, CFACT\' s Executive Director, and Michael Goetz, past Vice President and Counsel for CFACT Europe. Rupert Darwall, an  expert at the UK\' s Centre for Policy Studies, who promotes climate science denial, is also here on a CEI badge. International Emissions Trading Association (IETA): The CEI\' s delegation pales in comparison to IETA\' s 80-strong list. IETA is a business organisation that aims  to build international policy and market frameworks for reducing greenhouse gases at lowest cost . IETA\' s members include fossil fuel companies BP, Chevron, Shell, Rio Tinto, Statoil and Total. It has a \' business hub\' tent hidden away inside the blue zone at the Marrakech conference, and has been running lots of corporate sponsored events during the conference. IETA has provided badges for plenty of fossil fuel representatives including Christine Faure Fedigan, French energy company Engie\' s head of corporate strategy; Arthur Lee, Chevron\' s principal advisor on environment and climate change; and Charlotte Wolff-Bye, Statoil\' s vice president of sustainability. World Coal Association: The World Coal Association does pretty much what you\' d expect; lobby on behalf of the world\' s dirtiest fossil fuel companies. It lists climate deniers Peabody among its many paying members. There have already been a number of actions at the conference highlighting that coal has no place in a climate constrained world. The association\' s CEO, Benjamin Sporton, policy director, Milagros Miranda Rojas, and policy advisor Liam McHugh, all have badges at COP22. Shell and BP: There are other fossil fuel personnel here under other non-state actor badges. Marianne Funk, Shell\' s senior advisor, is here with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Tanya Morrison, Shell\' s International Government Relations Manager, is here with the International Chamber of Commerce. Andrea Abrahams, a global director for BP, is here with World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Corporate influence The Paris Agreement, signed last year to much fanfare, opened the door for the increased involvement of corporate lobbyists. Paragraph 134 of the Paris Agreement,  welcomes the efforts of all non-Party stakeholders to address and respond to climate change, including those of civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities . Paragraph 135  invites the non-Party stakeholders referred to in paragraph 134 above to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions and/or to build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change . While these clauses were partially aimed at increasing the role of NGOs and indigenous communities in the climate negotiation process, it also opened the door for more corporate lobbying. On the second Tuesday at the talks, Corporate Accountability International and representatives from Latin America and Asia delivered a petition to the US government asking it to act to end corporate conflicts of interest in the UNFCCC process. It wants policies similar to those of the Global Tobacco Treaty. Article 5.3 of that treaty bars partnerships, financial relationships, revolving door cases and industry participation in the policymaking process. When asked what could happen if the UNFCCC don\' t implement new rules about corporate influence, Maya Golder Kraser from the US-based Centre for Biological Diversity told DeSmogUK:  The science is very clear that to get to 1.5 degrees we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, which is obviously directly in conflict with the interests of the fossil fuel industry. So what's at stake is that we just don't meet our commitments at all. In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\l"

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, has concluded Canadas participation at COP22, in Marrakech, Morocco, demonstrating the countrys strong support for international action on clean growth and climate change. Minister McKennas focus at the international climate-change conference COP22 was the swift implementation of the Paris Agreement, the development of a global low-carbon economy, and the competitive advantages for business and industry in low-carbon solutions. Minister McKenna also highlighted throughout the week the key role played by all levels of government, as well as businesses, Indigenous peoples, civil society, and youth in addressing climate change. Canada believes that the private sector will play an important role in bringing about the transition to a stronger, more sustainable economy and creating a better tomorrow for future generations. Canadian businesses are well-positioned to succeed in a global low-carbon economy, creating more well-paying jobs for Canadas middle class while contributing to our progress in addressing climate change. While in Marrakech, Minister McKenna delivered Canadas national statement, and she participated in several high-level discussions on issues including carbon pricing, clean-technology growth and innovation, gender and climate policy, and health. Canada also submitted its mid-century strategy to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, making it one of the first countries to do so. The strategy looks beyond 2030 to start a conversation on the ways we can further reduce emissions for a cleaner, more sustainable future by 2050. Several investments were also announced in support of climate efforts and clean-technology deployment in developing countries, as part of the historic $2.65-billion commitment the Government made in Budget 2016. Quote The Government of Canada is committed to finding ambitious solutions to climate change and to create a better future for our children and grandchildren. The global economy has shifted towards cleaner, more sustainable growth, and the momentum is irreversible. Working together, we are setting ourselves on a sustainable and prosperous path for the future. Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Of the 195 countries that signed the Agreement, 109 have already ratified it, bringing it into force years earlier than expected. At COP22, Canada announced progress on the delivery of its pledge to provide $2.65 billion over five year, including $1.8 billion in funding for a range of climate-change mitigation and adaptation initiatives to support developing countries transition to low-carbon, sustainable economies, $14 million to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, like methane, through partnerships with Mexico and Chile; $3M contribution and joined the World Banks Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, which aims to find new ways for developing countries to reduce their emissions and collaborate with partners on clean energy projects like geothermal, solar and wind power, as well as pricing carbon pollution; $2.5 million to the Climate Technology Centre and Network to help developing countries access technologies in sectors such as energy, water, forestry, and agriculture; and $2 million to the National Adaptation Plans Global Network, which helps weave climate change adaptation considerations into developing countries policy, planning and decision-making. Globally, clean-energy investment rose to their highest levels, at $329 billion in 2015. The mid-century strategy is a living document and focuses on longer-term mitigation pathways to 2050, starting with a pathway consistent with net emissions falling by at least 80% in 2050 from 2005 level&#8206;s.- 30 -\l"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA160","POPE'S MESSAGE FOR THE 22ND MEETING OF THE CONFERENCE OF PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE (COP22)","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Vatican Information Service (VIS):Pope Francis has sent a message to the Moroccan minister for foreign affairs, Salaheddine Mezouar, who will chair the 22nd meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change (COP22), taking place in Marrakech, Morocco from 7 to 18 November. In the text, the Holy Father recalls that the Paris Agreement has set out a clear path requiring the collaboration of all the international community, and he quotes extensively from his encyclical Laudato si', exhorting the promotion of a culture of care for the environment, and reiterating that the fight against climate change is closely linked to the war on poverty. The following is the full text of the message: ""The current situation of environmental degradation, closely connected to the human, ethical and social degradation that unfortunately we experience every day, calls upon all of us, each with his or her own role and competences, and leads us to meet here with a renewed sense of awareness and responsibility. The Kingdom of Morocco hosts the COP22 a few days after the entry in force of the Paris Agreement, adopted less than a year ago. Its adoption represents the important awareness that, faced with issues as complex as climate change, individual and / or national action is not enough; instead it is necessary to implement a responsible collective response truly intended to 'work together in building our common home'. On the other hand, the rapid entry into force of the Agreement strengthens the conviction that we can and we must employ our intelligence to guide technology, as well as to cultivate and also to limit our power, and to 'put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral', able to put the economy at the service of the human person, to build peace and justice and to safeguard the environment. The Paris Agreement has traced a clear path on which the entire international community is called to engage; the COP22 represents a central stage in this journey. It affects all humanity, especially the poorest and the future generations, who represent the most vulnerable component of the troubling impact of climate change, and call us to the grave ethical and moral responsibility to act without delay, in a manner as free as possible from political and economic pressures, setting aside particular interests and behaviour. In this regard I convey my greetings to you, Mr. President, and to all the participants in this Conference, along with my strong encouragement that your work in these days be inspired by the same collaborative and constructive spirit expressed during COP21. After this latter there began the phase of implementing the Paris Agreement: a delicate moment of exchange, entering in a more concrete way into the formulation of rules, institutional mechanisms and the elements necessary for correct and effective implementation. These are complex aspects that cannot be delegated solely to technical expertise but which require continual political support and encouragement, based on the recognition that we are 'we are one single human family. There are no frontiers or barriers, political or social, behind which we can hide, still less is there room for the globalisation of indifference'. One of the main contributions of this Agreement is that of stimulating the promotion of strategies for national and international development based on an environmental quality that we could define as fraternal; indeed, it encourages solidarity in relation to the most vulnerable and builds on the strong links between the battle against climate change and that of poverty. Although there are many elements of a technical nature involved in this field, we are also aware that it cannot all be limited solely to the economic and technological dimension: technical solutions are necessary but they are not enough; it is essential and proper to take into careful consideration also the ethical and social aspects of the new paradigm of development and progress. Here we enter into the fundamental fields of education and the promotion of lifestyles that favour sustainable models of production and consumption; and we are reminded of the need to promote the growth of a responsible awareness of our common home. In this task, all the States Parties are called to give their contribution, along with the non-party stakeholders: civil society, the private sector, the scientific world, financial institutions, sub-national authorities, local communities, indigenous populations. In conclusion, Mr. President and all participants in the COP22, I convey my best wishes that the works of the Marrakech Conference be guided by that awareness of our responsibility that must drive each one of us to promote seriously a 'culture of care which permeates all society', care in relation to creation, but also for our neighbour, near or far in space and time. The lifestyle based on the throwaway culture is unsustainable and must have no place in our models of development and education. This is an educational and cultural challenge which must respond also to the process of implementing the Paris Agreement if it is to be truly effective. While I pray for the successful and fruitful work of the Conference, I invoke upon you and all the participants the Blessing of the Almighty, which I ask you to convey to all the citizens of the countries you represent"".\l"

""The Green Climate Fund is an important resource that helps communities in developing countries prepare for the ill effects of climate change, like increasing droughts that undermine the livelihoods of small farmers.""&#8234;The Green Climate Fund was established in 2010 during the United Nations Climate Change Conference, and is now an independent organization underwriting major renewable energy projects that support climate mitigation and helping the world's most vulnerable adapt to the inescapable impacts of climate change.CRS has programs across the globe to help poor communities, many of whom are being disproportionately affected by climate change. CRS helps these communities adapt through climate-smart agriculture, by diversifying their incomes, and restoring critical watersheds, for example. The Green Climate Fund supports these kinds of adaptation measures.""At CRS we see the effects of climate change first-hand on the ground every day, and we also know there are ways to help people with the new challenges they face,"" O'Keefe said.The Catholic Church has been a leading voice in calling leaders and people of goodwill to rise above politics in order to respond to climate change. In 2001 the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) noted that ""global climate change is not about economic theory or political platforms, nor about partisan advantage or interest group pressures. It is about the future of God's creation and the one human family.""In 2009 Pope Benedict lamented ""how can one remain indifferent in the face of problems such as climate change, desertification, the degradation and loss of productivity in vast agricultural areas"" that was leading to what he termed ""environmental refugees."" And in his 2015 encyclical, Laudato Si', Pope Francis implored politicians to be ""courageous"" and ""to take up"" the responsibility and costs associated with responding to climate change.""It is more important than ever for the United States to lead the international community in helping to address the impacts of climate change on the poor,"" O'Keefe said.

For us, churches, that gave a huge feeling of encouragement - that there is a future we are fighting for, worth struggling and hoping and praying for. We are in the kingdom of Morocco - but we are experiencing the glimpses of what the Kingdom on earth is like.""African young leaders of their churches in the ACT group were participating in creative, competent, yet youthful ways, causing people to smile everywhere they walked. ""At first they chanted in English, then in French - it was moderate. But then they were taught to chant ""climate justice now"" in Arabic and they turned that into singing - people all around in the streets were smiling, laughing and applauding - there was instant resonance"", said Kennedy. ""It was like a move of the spirit - it was just incredible. And it gives me hope that the young generations get it and they will make it happen. ""As a churches and faith communities, we know that we need to be in negotiating rooms and strategizing rooms - but we also need to be in the streets, said Kennedy, adding that the voice of the participating faith groups was heard well in the streets of Marrakech, as they were singing at the top of their lungs at the end of the procession. ""In some ways it is the role of people of faith to come along and clean up the mess left behind. When they were singing 'We are marching in the light of God,' everyone could relate to that"", said Kennedy, describing the experience as a marvellous and genuine witness. ""It came out of the depth of their souls - you could not help to start singing along with them. That's real liturgical leadership, where you are just drawn to sing along.""The COP 22COP22 is regarded as a crucial next step for governments and other parties to operationalize the Paris Climate Change Agreement adopted last year, which came into force just a few days before the conference.Related links:Photos from faith-based events at COP22: HYPERLINK http://www.oikoumene.org/cop22photoswww.oikoumene.org/cop22photos HYPERLINK http://www.oikoumene.org/cop22photoshttp://www.oikoumene.org/cop22photosFaith communities explore concrete climate action at (WCC news release from 10 November 2016): HYPERLINK http://www.oikoumene.org/en/press-centre/news/faith-communities-explore-concrete-climate-action-at-cop22http://www.oikoumene.org/en/press-centre/news/faith-communities-explore-concrete-climate-action-at- http://www.oikoumene.org/en/press-centre/news/faith-communities-explore-concrete-climate-action-at-cop22cop22Advocates urge transition to low-carbon economy, clean energy (Joint news release by ACT Alliance/LWF/WCC from 9 November 2016): HYPERLINK http://www.oikoumene.org/en/press-centre/news/advocates-urge-transition-to-low-carbon-economy-clean-energyhttp://www.oikoumene.org/en/press-centre/news/advocates-urge-transition-to-low-carbon-economy-clean-energy30FurigayJane-5702131 30FurigayJane\l"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA168","Climate Change Workshop Tackles Solutions to a Global Problem","February 7, 2017 Tuesday","US Official News","Harrisburg: Drexel University has issued the following news release: There may be more hurdles to environmental progress in the United States today than in the immediate past, but the Drexel students and faculty involved in the climate action movement expect the global fight to carry on apace. The cohort who attended November\' s climate change conference in Morocco, sponsored by the Office of International Programs and the Institute for Energy and the Environment, presented their findings Jan. 30 in the Paul Peck Alumni Center and led a discussion about how the Drexel community can take action to support the environment on an individual and institutional basis. The 22nd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP22, which five students and five faculty members attended, focused on implementation of the landmark Paris agreement reached the year before to curtail the damage humans are doing to the environment. Franco Montalto, PhD, the director of the North American Hub of the Urban Climate Change Research Network at Drexel and an associate professor in the College of Engineering, gave a brief overview of the extent of that damage to set the stage for the afternoon\' s presentations. In a series of startling charts and graphs showing the stark changes in greenhouse gas emissions and global warming in recent years, he set up a simple question.  What now? Montalto asked.  What can different nations do? There are no silver bullets, according to Carol Collier, director of Drexel\' s Environmental Studies and Sustainability Program, but there is reason for optimism. She told the audience, which included a few dozen students, that the push toward action in Morocco left her hopeful. Despite the steep hill to climb to limit global warming, efforts in the areas of reforestation, climate-smart soils and water resources all offer paths to progress. Much of the change in America is likely to come from cities, Hugh Johnson, a senior associate in the Institute for Energy and the Environment, said. About 70 percent of American emissions come from cities, leaving plenty of opportunity for focused efforts to make incremental progress, he said. For those fearing that the new administration\' s apparent distrust of climate science will set the country back, he suggested Canada\' s recent experience as a point of comparison. Hundreds of government scientists were fired under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and government discussion of climate change was banned; cities nonetheless continued to move forward to find new solutions on their own. Johnson also said the business case for environmental progress is clear. Companies including Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Apple are leading the march toward renewable energy, he said. Like Collier, he was optimistic about what he saw at COP22.  It was right after the election and there was no backing down, said Johnson. Eugenia Victoria Ellis, PhD, director of the dLUX light lab and an associate professor in the College of Engineering and the Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, focused her portion of the presentation on the role of the built environment  everything humans have created, invented and constructed to facilitate living on Earth  in climate change. Nearly half of the energy consumption in the United States comes from buildings, including three-quarters of the electricity used. In terms of per capita emissions, the United States is twice as harmful to the environment as China and three times as harmful as any other country.  We\' re the worst offenders worldwide, she said. The built environment, though, presents many opportunities for change in an effort to meet the goal of limiting global warming to 2\'b0C in the coming decades.  If we look at buildings as a whole and we want to reduce their energy consumption to meet 2\'b0C goals, this can be done by using low-energy lighting and designing the building envelope to reduce heating and cooling needs, said Ellis. Following the presentations, the students who attended COP22 split the crowd into four groups to discuss plans for action. The conversations focused on how Drexel can divest from fossil fuels, opportunities for local activism, ways to encourage state representatives to take action and how to become more climate-friendly on a personal level. Those in attendance walked away with new ideas and a mind for action, much like the students and faculty at the conference in Morocco.  It was an extremely valuable addition to our development, not only as students but as citizens of the United States, said Dalton George, a COP22 attendee and a graduate student in the Center of Science, Technology and Society.

Brown Jr. today called on the scientific community - the ""truth-tellers"" and ""truth seekers"" - to mobilize for the climate fight.""The time has never been more urgent or your work never more important. The climate is changing, temperatures are rising, oceans are becoming more acidified, habitats are under stress - the world is facing tremendous danger,"" said Governor Brown at the American Geophysical Union's annual fall meeting in San Francisco. ""It'll be up to you as truth-tellers, truth seekers to mobilize all your efforts to fight back. We've got a lot of firepower. We've got the scientists, we've got the universities, we have the national labs and we have the political clout and sophistication for the battle - and we will persevere. Have no doubt about that.""""We will pursue a path of collaboration and bold political advancement - whatever they do in Washington - and eventually the truth will prevail,"" Governor Brown continued. ""This is not a battle of one day or one election. This is a long-term slog into the future and you are there, the foot soldiers of change and understanding and scientific collaboration.""Governor Brown's remarks follow yesterday's action to prevent further coastal oil and gas drilling, reduce ocean acidity and boost renewable energy development in California. In recent weeks, Governor Brown issued a joint release with the governors of Oregon and Washington and the premier of British Columbia reaffirming their commitment to climate action at the close of COP22. The Governor also announced 29 new members to the Under2 Coalition, an international climate pact formed by California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. A total of 165 jurisdictions have now joined the coalition representing more than a billion people and $25.7 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy.California's Leadership on Climate ChangeCalifornia is playing a world-leading role in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants.In September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems.This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon.Over the past year and a half, the Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon.These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document.The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations.Photo Captions1.)

The global community is more united than ever not just in accepting the [climate change] challenge, but in confronting it with real action, in making a difference. [State Department photo]Secretary Kerry reiterated the importance of the international community moving 'expeditiously' to put the Paris agreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions. 'In a powerful statement of the whole world's broad commitment to this agreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 percent of the world's emissions have now formally committed to bold, decisive action - and we are determined to affirm that action and to stick with it out of Marrakech,' he said. Secretary Kerry touted the significance of the framework of the Paris Agreement, which embraces an 'essence of common but differentiated responsibilities' where each country does what it can to address climate change. Through the agreement, the international community has pulled together an array of tools to help developing nations invest in infrastructure, technology, and the science as well as adapt to the climate impacts that many countries are already confronting.As Secretary Kerry noted, the agreement 'leaves no country to weather the storm of climate change alone.' We have to continue to defy expectations. We have to continue to accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. And we have to continue to hold one another accountable for the choices that our nations makes. [State Department photo]Secretary Kerry also highlighted important progress that the international community has made on climate change since adopting the Paris Agreement last December, including a sector-wide aviation agreement on carbon-neutral growth and the Kigali agreement--an international agreement to phase down the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons. According to Secretary Kerry, these advancements demonstrate how the the United States and its partners are moving the needle in the right direction as 'global leaders have woken up to the enormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward together towards a clean energy future.' In addition to the efforts of governments, Secretary Kerry made a point to emphasize to the role of the private sector and the market in advancing global efforts to combat climate change. Over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded more than six-fold and last year alone, investment in renewable energy was at an all-time high at nearly $350 billion. While our emissions are being driven down by market-based forces clean energy is expected to be a multi-trillion dollar market in the future and it benefits all countries to have businesses involved in the expansion of clean energy economy. As Secretary Kerry said, ""The energy curve is bending towards sustainability.The market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and that trend will only become more pronounced.""Climate change directly impacts everyone across all seven continents. We all must do our part to #ActOnClimate[1]. pic.twitter.com/7IvF6SwWDV[2] John Kerry (@JohnKerry) November 11, 2016[3]Following his recent trip last week to Antarctica, Secretary Kerry shared how the visit was a clear and urgent reminder of the danger facing our planet if we do not act swiftly, doing all we can to reverse climate change. Given the real threat of melting ice sheets and rising sea waters, Secretary Kerry warned, 'We can't wait too long to translate the science that we have today into the policies that are necessary to address this challenge.' Secretary Kerry closed his remarks by requesting of the audience and larger international community to always remember the stakes. He concluded, 'Let us stand firm in support of the goals that we set in Paris and recommit ourselves to double our efforts to meet them. Let us say that when it comes to climate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as Winston Churchill admonished, we will do what is required.'

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA176","Protests Over Fishmonger's Death Test Moroccan Monarchy's Nerves","Voice of America","Newstex Blogs","Nov 03, 2016( Voice of America: HYPERLINK http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex) Grainy video images and the screams of a young fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to stop police destroying his stock have shocked Moroccans and brought thousands on to the streets to protest. Five years after pro-democracy protests shook Morocco, this week's unrest is a reminder of pent-up frustrations the monarchy has managed to tame in the past with limited constitutional reforms, heavy welfare spending and tough security. With a rallying cry against the Makhzen - a term used to describe the royal establishment - protesters have vowed to stage more demonstrations over Mouhcine Fikri's death in the northern city of Al-Hoceima, which was captured on video by witnesses and widely shared on social media. They say he is a symbol of abuses against Moroccans and has revived the spirit of the February 20 movement which led the pro-democracy demonstrations that swept the country. The political and social stability of Morocco is closely watched by Western governments as it is the only country in North Africa where jihadist groups have failed to gain a foothold, and is an important partner against Islamist militancy in terms of intelligence-sharing. The public anger over the death has echoes of how Tunisia's own 2011 uprising began, when a young street vendor set himself on fire after police confiscated his fruit and vegetables. That uprising swept Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali from power and triggered ""Arab Spring"" revolts across the region. But there are fundamental differences with Morocco, where now and even five years ago calls for greater freedoms and reform have not been directed at toppling the king. Morocco has a deeply rooted monarchy - the Muslim world's longest-serving dynasty - while Tunisia's autocracy was based around Ben Ali, who came to power in 1987, and his family. Preventing a repeat of 2011 The political protests - rare in Morocco - will nevertheless test the nerves of a kingdom that presents itself as a model for economic stability and gradual change and a haven for foreign investment in a region torn by violence and political upheaval. The monarchy wants to prevent the unrest from escalating to the level of the 2011 protests, which lasted about a year and forced King Mohamed to cede some of his absolute powers to the elected government. Protest organizers say the anger at Fikri's death, which shocked even staunch royalists, has rekindled the broader resentment at the establishment over joblessness and the big gap between rich and poor that drove those pro-democracy protests. ""People learned from February 20 movement to not let themselves to be fooled, so we will fight with all our strength for the dignity that Fikri died for,"" said Nasser Zafzafi, one of the organizers. ""We do not want scapegoats, but for the truly responsible to be punished, including high officials."" Most of the kingdom's 34 million people follow a moderate form of Islam and the country has long acted as a bridge for Westerners to Islamic and African culture. The king holds executive powers but also claims religious legitimacy as the commander of the faithful. Royal condolences In an attempt to calm tensions, King Mohamed, currently touring Africa, ordered the interior minister to visit the victim's family and present royal condolences - a rare gesture of conciliation by the monarchy at a time of public protests. The minister said Fikri did not deserve what happened to him and promised the investigation would punish those responsible. Just like other governments in North Africa, Moroccan authorities often heavily police protests, nervous over popular unrest since 2011. Tunisia has seen rioting twice this year in its south over jobs and unions are warning over austerity plans. But the security forces appear to have taken a more low-key, hands-off approach this week, waiting in side streets and staying away from where demonstrations rallied. The authorities' more conciliatory approach this week, compared with in 2011 and during other more minor unrest since, could be partly down to the timing, according to political analysts. The protests erupted at a sensitive moment as the kingdom prepares to host the 2016 United Nations in November (COP22) and the prime minister begins to form a coalition government after elections last month. ""The Moroccan regime knows how to buy peace, especially now that the country is hosting COP22,"" said Mohammed Larbi Ben Othmane, a political scientist in Rabat university. ""They know how to adapt, you would even see members of the royal cabinet protesting with people if they need to do so, but they will never show weakness."" Ultimate authority Fikri's death last week prompted thousands of people to take to the streets for four days of protests in Al-Hoceima and major cities across the country including the capital Rabat and Marrakesh, among the biggest rallies Morocco has seen since 2011. Moroccan authorities have charged 11 people, jailing eight of them, over the death of Fikri who was crushed in a trash truck while trying to stop police from destroying 500 kilograms of swordfish they say he purchased illegally. The general prosecutor said on Tuesday those charged on involuntary manslaughter were two interior ministry officials, two local fisheries officials and a veterinary chief. Activists accused police officers at the scene of ordering garbage men to ""grind"" Fikri but the police denied those accusations. The involvement of local officials has fueled anger at the establishment and a frenzy of postings on social media blaming the Makhzen, reminding many of the February 20 movement calls to curb the monarchy's absolute powers. When protests erupted in 2011, the king called a referendum which backed constitutional reforms that saw him cede some of his powers to the government and guarantee more rights, including freedom of speech. He remains the ultimate authority in Morocco, however. Many February 20 activists were disappointed by the reforms, which they believe did not go far enough to bring democracy, and any suggestion of a resurgence of the movement is sensitive for a monarchic political system that critics describe as a medieval and archaic. ""What happened shows that all the people who thought the February 20 movement was dead were wrong,"" said Ben Othmane. ""Moroccans did not lose that capacity to resist."" \l"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA177","Paris Climate Treaty Goes into Force, COP-22 Starts in Marrakesh","November 7, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Washington: Competitive Enterprise Institute has issued the following news release: The Paris Climate Treaty went into force, or as the Associated Press story put it  became international law, on 4th November. Ninety-seven countries accounting for approximately two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions have now ratified the treaty. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told a press conference,  We remain in a race against time. But with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world has the plans we need to make the shift to a low-emission, climate-resilient path. The treaty\' s entry into force is well-timed to provide a boost to the Twenty-Second Conference of the Parties (COP-22) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will begin meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco on 7th November. On the other hand, the U. S. presidential election on 8th November could dampen spirits at COP-22 if Donald Trump wins. Trump has promised in several speeches that as president he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Treaty and stop funding for the UNFCCC, including its Green Climate Fund. This would put President Trump at odds with the leaders of every country in the world, which is apparently something that doesn\' t bother him. China\' s  climate chief, Xie Zhenhua, took a pre-emptive swipe at Trump on 1st November. According to a Reuters story, Xie warned,  I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends. If they resist this trend, I don't think they'll win the support of their people, and their country's economic and social progress will also be affected. China clearly wants the United States to abide by the treaty and fulfill its Nationally Determined Contribution, which requires the U. S. to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. China\' s NDC pledges that its emissions will peak no later than 2030.

The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the\~21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC[23]\~in\~Paris[24]\~and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.\~It was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day[25]) at a ceremony in New York.\~As of April 2017, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the treaty, 144 of which have ratified it.\~After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force.\~The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016. The head of the\~Paris Conference[26], France's foreign minister\~Laurent Fabius[27], said this ""ambitious and balanced"" plan is a ""historic turning point"" in the goal of reducing\~global warming[28]. One year on, the ratification of the Paris Agreement was celebrated by the Mayor of Paris\~Anne Hidalgo[29]\~by illuminating the\~Eiffel Tower[30]\~and the\~Arc de Triomphe[31], Paris' most iconic monuments, in green. (Via Wikipedia[32])  Clean Power Plan[33]\~ The\~Clean Power Plan\~is an\~Obama administration[34]\~policy aimed at combating\~anthropogenic climate change[35]\~(global warming) that was first proposed by the\~Environmental Protection Agency[36]\~in June 2014.\~It is widely expected to be eliminated under President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order on March 28, 2017 mandating the EPA to review the plan. Proposed actions under President Trump President\~Donald Trump[37]'s proposed\~2018 United States federal budget[38]\~defunded the Clean Power Plan.\~On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an\~executive order[39]\~directing EPA Administrator\~Scott Pruitt[40]\~to review the Clean Power Plan.\~EPA will need to go through the formal rulemaking process to change the existing rule,\~and in 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case\~Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency[41]\~that EPA regulation of carbon dioxide is actually required by the\~Clean Air Act[42], which is still in effect. Trump explained this decision calling the Clean Power Plan a ""job-killing regulation"" which some see as false, saying ""the potential for job growth in the clean energy sector dwarfs any potential job growth in the fossil fuel economy"". Opposition argues that with the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the United States will not be able to meet the greenhouse gas emission standards agreed to under the\~Paris Agreement[43], and in turn, will have to withdraw from the agreement. Without it, the United States is projected to fall over 20% short of its pledge.\~Because the Clean Power Plan was a significant part of how the United States intended to meet the emission targets it set for the Paris Agreement, this action may discourage other countries from upholding their own commitments.\~Janet McCabe[44], an Obama Administration EPA department head, stated that the decision completely disregards the impacts of climate and the cost and benefits associated with the started programs. According to her it will lead to several more years of uncertainty and potentially lost opportunity as well as a worsening public image of the United States internationally. However she is hopeful that the decision's impact on the industry's direction toward a cleaner energy system won't be severe as several states already meet the 2022 target carbon dioxide emissions established in the Clean Power Plan.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA183","Commission Welcomes Entry into Force of Paris Agreement Ahead of UN Climate Conference in Marrakech","November 4, 2016 Friday 2:57 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Commission issued the following news release:The Paris Agreement legally enters into force today; 30 days after the EU's ratification pushed it past the threshold to take effect. The historic event comes less than a year after the landmark agreement was adopted and just days ahead of the UN climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco.The Vice-President in charge of the Energy Union, Maros Sefcovic said: ""Today's entry into force of the Paris Agreement, less than a year after its adoption, shows one thing: that the entire world shares a pressing sense of urgency when it comes to fighting climate change. Inaction is not an option; slowing down is not our course of action. We are ready to seize this momentum to speed up work on the clean energy transition, in our Union and globally. We are ready to work at all levels, including the local level, to bring the benefits of this transition to our citizens.""Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: ""This is a great day for Europe and for the planet. I am delighted that the EU's ratification has enabled the Paris Agreement to enter into force in time for our meeting in Marrakech. We must maintain this extraordinary momentum by encouraging countries to continue ratifying the deal, and by moving full steam ahead with our preparations to put it into action across the world. Marrakech will be about action and implementation. It's time for results.""The annual United Nations climate change conference will take place from 7 to 18 November 2016 in Bab Ighli, Marrakech. Following the rapid entry into force of the global climate deal, the first meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1) will also open during the conference.The Marrakech conference aims to demonstrate that the shift to a global low-carbon economy is underway, and act as a catalyst for further action. As the global climate agreement has entered into force much earlier than expected, the EU is keen to move rapidly on the international framework to help countries put in place the policies and measures to deliver on their Paris pledges. This means that the work programme established in Paris, and started in Bonn earlier this year, must advance as swiftly as possible, while keeping participation open to all countries regardless of whether they are still ratifying the Agreement.The EU expects to see tangible progress on key elements of the Paris package, including on access to finance for developing countries and on developing and strengthening the skills and processes needed in developing countries to implement their domestic climate plans. The EU and its Member States are the biggest contributors of public climate finance to developing countries. Together they provide around a third of public funding available for action to tackle climate change and account for almost half of the pledges in the Green Climate Fund.COP 22 will have a strong focus on strengthening climate action before 2020, when most of the national climate action plans put forward by countries in the run up to Paris start. The high-level event on global climate action on 17 November and the thematic action days being held throughout the conference offer an opportunity to reflect on progress made on existing initiatives as well as for announcements of new initiatives.The EU will be represented in Marrakech by Laszlo Solymos, Minister of Environment for Slovakia, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, and Miguel Arias Canete, EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy.Events during COP 22The EU strongly supports the Global Climate Action Agenda aimed at catalysing multi-stakeholder action. A series of events has been organised around themes, for example, the role of forests, transport, buildings and renewable energy in the fight against climate change. The EU will host more than 100 events at the EU Pavilion (see link below). These events, organised by a wide variety of organisations from Europe and the rest of the world, will address a broad range of climate-related issues from the energy transition and long term strategies to deforestation and innovative climate finance.EU press briefings in MarrakechThe EU delegation will hold regular press briefings which will be streamed live and 'on demand' at: HYPERLINK Further information:DG Climate Action - Marrakech conference page ( HYPERLINK http://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0112_en.htmhttp://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0112_en.htm)Questions and Answers on the UN climate change conference in Marrakech ( HYPERLINK http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3590_en.htmhttp://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3590_en.htm)Commission assessment of the Paris Agreement (March 2016) ( HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-110-EN-F1-1.PDFhttps://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-110-EN-F1-1.PDF)Paris Agreement ( HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htmhttps://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm)Copyright Targeted News Services30FurigayJane-5694341 30FurigayJane\l"

In the last two weeks, hundreds of organizations banded together to stand up to all new fossil fuel development, and dozens of climate vulnerable countries committed to 100% renewable energy futures. Climate science, the Paris Agreement, and millions of people around the world demand an end to new fossil fuel development and a just transition to renewables.""Stephen Kretzmann, Executive Director, Oil Change International""While the U.S. election could have derailed the negotiations, what's happened in Marrakech has given hope that global action on climate change will not be deterred by isolated politicians. These negotiations' outcome once again failed to meet the urgency of the climate crisis, but countries and social movements came together to keep pushing forward at a time when resolve is essential. The lessons of Marrakech are clear: Don't look to bureaucrats or climate-denying Presidents to take the lead on global climate action.

But before he entered the political arena, Trump was quite clear about his stance. On Dec. 6, 2009, just before the United Nations in Copenhagen, Trump and three of his children signed a proclamation recognizing the significance of climate change that was reproduced as a full-page ad in The New York Times.The proclamation, signed by nearly 100 business leaders, suggested that significant business opportunities exist in adapting and exporting technology associated with mitigating the effects of climate change. It further stated that, ""We have the ability and the know-how to lead the world in clean energy technology to thrive in a global market and economy.""We can only hope that, as president, Trump will act on his past wisdom and advocate for a renewable energy policy that will stimulate the economy, create jobs and increase the quality of life for all citizens by reducing air and water pollution.As Utahns, let's consider supporting a sustainable path to the future through all levels of government, grassroots groups (such as the nonpartisan Citizens Climate Lobby) and the private sector.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA186","AT THE NEXUS OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE","September 3, 2016 Saturday","IPS - Inter Press Service","With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it's clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal.Here at World Water Week, which concluded on Friday, Susanne Skyllerstedt, programme officer for Water, Climate Change and Development at the Global Water Partnership (GWP), says her organisation is working with Sub-Saharan African governments to incorporate adaptation strategies into the partnership's climate change programme.""For us, resolutions of COP21 are part and parcel of what we are implementing and those of COP22 (in Marrakech) will be embedded in our long-term agenda of ensuring water security in Africa and rest of the developing world in a bid to attain water-related sustainable development goals,"" she told IPS.GWP is a Stockholm-based organisation that has been involved in fostering integrated water resource management around the world for the last 20 years. GPS has four regional offices in Africa covering Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa.As an inter-governmental entity, GWP works with organisations involved in water resources management. These range from national government's institutions, United Nations agencies to funding bodies. Other stakeholders include professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector. GWP has a water and climate change programme to support governments on water security and climate change resilience.Already, said Skyllerstedt, GWP has a programme that was started in Africa through the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) together with the African Union Commission and other development partners. The programme has been a key platform for supporting African governments.These include support on national climate change adaptation programmes more so in the sphere of policy formulation. For Sub-Saharan Africa countries noted for vulnerability to impacts of global climate change, the programme is key in supporting climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.Through monitoring and evaluation programmes conducted in the recent past, GWP has learned vital lessons and is cognisant of areas that need more resources to achieve the desired goals. Already, she said, GWP is running a three-year programme on climate change aimed at achieving sustainable development goals linked to water, energy and food through climate resilience.She said they are implementing initiatives aimed at enabling countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to acquire highly relevant technologies on sustainable water management. ""We have demo programmes on new technologies being implemented by our partners in Africa but they need to be scaled up to have a major impact,"" she said.GWP is also addressing the challenge of water pollution, to ensure availability of cleaner water for human consumption and other uses. It is collaborating with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to promote water security and hygiene. ""The aim is to incorporate water, sanitation and hygiene component in climate resilience,"" Skyllerstedt explained.GWP is also developing tools for better planning on water, sanitation and hygiene to help communities during calamities such as floods.""We have an urban planning project focusing on urban water systems and infrastructure we work with national government and other partners on issues planning putting into consideration matters of access to water and sanitation facilities as well as water related calamities.At the same time GWP collaborates with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on drought and flood monitoring.""We work with experts and stakeholders to ensure national plans take into account climate change-related hazards,"" Skyllerstedt said. ""Many African countries face challenges in fighting impacts of extreme weather such as floods and droughts, and here is where the adaption programme is relevant.""For the next three years GWP intends to widen its support to encompass not only national climate change adaptation programmes but also Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that countries published prior to the 2015 United Nations in Paris.""National Adaptation Programmes (NAPs) and NDCs should be merged to avoid duplications,"" she observed.The biggest challenge to implementation of GWP programmes by its partners in Africa and elsewhere remains access to financial resources.""During the COP21 in Paris last year, there were lots of pledges on financing initiatives for enhancing water security and its access by the poor. Unfortunately, our partners are not able to access the money due technical bottlenecks,"" she said.The situation has compelled GWP to embark on enhancing the capacity of their partners in Africa in the spheres of \~project design as well as making of investment plans and strategies.Skyllerstedt spoke to IPS during the World Water Week held in Stockholm, Sweden from 28 Aug. 28 to Sep. 2 and organised by the Stockholm International Water Institute.\l"

Happy Monday. This is a precursor, or at the top of the briefing, we thought it would be useful since today marks the start of COP22 in Marrakech, Morrocco. If we had our special envoy for climate change come and brief you on some of the expectations for that conference. Jonathan Pershing is with us today and will be able to give you, as I said, an overview of the conference, and then answer a couple of questions.Okay, Jonathan?PERSHING: Thanks.Thanks very much, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks, everyone.PERSHING: So 2016 is really an historic year on the climate change issue, on the climate change front. Over the past few months alone, we've seen a number of major events that have occurred. First and foremost, the Paris agreement itself entered into force. The technical date of entry into force was on Friday, this past Friday. That was 30 days after 55 countries, and at least -- representing at least 55 percent of global emissions had signed onto the deal, had joined the agreement. By the way, since the 55 threshold was met, we're now just over 100 countries, so it's really continuing to grow quite rapidly. But at the same time, over the course of the year, we've had a number of other major agreements. We agreed in Montreal on the agreement on civil aviation for the first time in history, capturing some of the emissions from international civil aviation, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. And the second is an agreement that was reached in Kigali in Rwanda, also in October, in which we've agreed to phase down substances called hydrofluorocarbons, which also are major greenhouse gasses, and look for substitutes that replace those.So the meeting starts today. It's actually just begin in Marrakesh, Morocco, so we're seeing significant movement on that front, and it's much smaller than Paris, about 15,000 representatives will be in attendance, compared to almost 50,000 in Paris. But it's got a couple of large scale activities that are going to be undertaken.The first bucket is actually taking cognizance of and moving forward politically based on these political agreements. The entry into force in Morocco, the Kigali agreement on Montreal protocol gasses, and ikeo (ph), there's a huge political momentum. Entry into force now really shapes the agreement and the structure.The second is the movement and aggressive acceleration of the timetable on the detailed development of rules and regulations and guidance that come out of the Paris agreement. We'd originally thought those would really be postponed for some time, there's going to be a five or a six year process. The very rapid entry into force has changed the dynamic, and we now anticipate we'll have those concluded by 2018. So a very rapid acceleration of the work of the technical guidance in detail.And the third is, this is a conference of the parties around implementation. We finished the big framing of the negotiation in Paris. Now it's implementation agenda. And we'll have experts, including our Secretary of Energy who will be there, but experts from across multiple sectors, agriculture, forestry, people who deal with water, the impacts of climate change as well as ways to reduce emissions that cause climate change. And that elevation will be a chance for CEOs, for ministers, for academics to all elevate and frame what we can do and to move from this negotiating phase into an operational phase. And that's going to occupy us for some time, and we should be very clear the risks and damages of climate have become more apparent in the last year as well, and this is going to be a race as we try to work on the problem and solve the problem before those damages become so significant that we can't do so so easily anymore.So this is a major shift in where we've been moving from these negotiating rounds into an implementation round. So with that, I'm happy to take questions that people might have around what's going to happen and where we stand. QUESTION: (inaudible) background call with some officials last week about COP22 and there was some discussion I think about zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2050 as a goal. I'm just wondering where that comes from. Is this something the United States is looking to do multilaterally, or take the lead on that particular issue?PERSHING: Thanks very much. No, there is no formal goal for 2050. What there is, though, is an agreement that's contained in the Paris -- the Paris Agreement itself that calls for countries to develop what are called mid-century strategies. The United States is working on ours. We are hoping to conclude it and complete it before the end of the year. And in that, we will be looking at a variety of scenarios where we can do significant global and U.S. reductions in emissions. It's not around a particular target number, it's around trajectories. How can you do these radical reductions. The president has indicated that we would at least be working to an 80 percent reduction by the year 2015.QUESTION: Where does zero carbon...(CROSSTALK)PERSHING: That's not us.QUESTION Okay.TONER: Any more questions. PERSHING: Thanks.TONER: Thanks so much, Jonathan. We appreciate it. Take care.END\l"

The United Nations warns that huge emissions cuts are now needed to meet the global goals.United Nations climate chiefs said humanity would look back on Friday as the day the world ""shut the door on inevitable climate disaster and set off with determination towards a sustainable future.""In a joint statement released on Friday, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the upcoming COP 22 climate talks in Morocco, said the Paris agreement would help to ""overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change.""""Its early entry into force is a clear political signal that all the nations of the world are devoted to decisive global action on climate change,"" they said.Fifteen years to actEspinosa, along with Mezouar - who is also Morocco's foreign minister - warned that the world community would need to come together within the next 15 years to ensure ""unprecedented reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and unequalled efforts to build societies that can resist rising climate impacts.""They warned that emissions are not yet falling, with carbon dioxide (CO2) levels breaking new records in 2016. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere passed a critical and symbolic threshold of 400 parts per million last year, the UN said.By 2030, emissions are expected to reach 54-56 billion tones of carbon dioxide equivalent, far above the level of 42 billion tones needed to have a chance of meet one of the key components of the Paris accord - limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.Will targets be met?Even if all pledges linked to the Paris accord to cut emissions are kept, the planet will heat up some 3.0 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by century's end, a recipe for climate devastation, according to a UN Environment Program report released on Thursday.But environment chiefs have welcomed the news that the roll-out of renewable energy has surged faster than most predictions a decade ago, now accounting for 23 percent of energy production.Renewable technologies have become cheaper than previously estimated, attracting $300 billion (260 billion euros) in investment in 2015.More than 190 states signed the landmark deal, agreed in the French capital last December. To date, 94 nations have either ratified or acceded to the agreement.New climate talksNext week, diplomats from 196 nations will gather in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh for the COP22 climate talks to draw up a ""rule book"" on how to proceed next.Among the questions will be how to best disburse $100 billion (90 billion euros) a year to poor, climate-vulnerable nations.While the conference takes place, American voters will decide their next president, with many of the 15,000 COP22 attendees watching intently to see if Republican nominee Donald Trump - who has publicly denied climate change is taking place - makes it to the White House.mm/kl (AFP, Reuters) \l"

Governor Brown Welcomes Australian and Mexican States to Under2 Climate Coalition","February 3, 2017 Friday","CaliforniaNewswire","SACRAMENTO, Calif. /California Newswire/ - This past week, Calif. Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. welcomed the states of Aguascalientes, Mexico and Victoria, Australia to the Under2 Coalition - the global pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences.""California will continue to join with leaders across the globe - including our partners in Mexico - to stop climate pollution,"" said Governor Brown.With the addition of today's signatories, the Under2 Coalition has now grown to 167 jurisdictions representing more than one billion people and $25.9 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy.Victoria is Australia's second most populous state, includes the city of Melbourne and covers nearly 90,000 square miles. Aguascalientes is located in north-central Mexico and is home to more than 1 million people. Aguascalientes Governor Martin Orozco Sandoval signed the pact during a meeting today with Governor Brown.The Under2 Coalition, the collective of governments who have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.Later today, the state of Aguascalientes will also sign an agreement with the California Energy Commission to cooperate on clean energy programs and policies, including energy efficiency, renewable energy development and grid integration, low and zero-emission vehicles and clean energy technology.California's Leadership on Climate ChangeIn September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems.This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon.The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon.These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document.The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations.More information about the Under 2 Coalition can be found at HYPERLINK http://www.under2MOU.orgwww.under2MOU.org.\l"

The first entry into force threshold of at least 55 parties officially joining the agreement was met in September. The second entry into force threshold of parties totaling at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions was met today after the E.U. and seven Member States submitted their instruments for ratification at the United Nations:""Climate change represents a grave existential threat to life as we know it on Earth and we are seeing the effects of global climate change today. As those changes become more apparent each year and threaten more lives and communities around the world, it has become increasingly obvious that we cannot waste any more time. We need solutions.I am proud that the United States along with 63 other parties, including China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and now the European Union, have acted swiftly to bring the historic Paris Agreement, the world's most significant global cooperative effort to combat climate change, into force in less than a year's time from when the deal was reached last December at COP21. I will do all I can to ensure the United States fulfills its obligations and serves as an example to every nation of what is possible when we put our science, leadership, and ingenuity to work on behalf of humanity.When I was in Paris last year, the sense of urgency and optimism among the gathered stakeholders was incredible. Im therefore not surprised that the strong commitment to action in Paris has been sustained and acted upon. Leaders and citizens alike know how much is at stake, and I am hopeful even more countries will soon formally enter into the agreement.Now the hard work of implementing the Paris Agreement must begin in earnest, and COP22 in Marrakech signifies the first great opportunity for implementing the roadmap towards achieving its important goals. I am firmly committed to realizing the United States' commitment to the Paris Agreement, to advancing our cooperation with our global partners, and achieving a bright, safe, healthy, and clean energy future for Maryland, the United States, and the world over.""\l"

Isabel Kreisler, Oxfam International\' s climate change policy expert said:  We\' re pleased to congratulate 72 countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement and brought it into force.  The Paris Agreement\' s credibility test starts today. Each and every country has pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, but our world is still on track to warm up to 3\'b0 Celsius more, much higher than the Agreement\' s stated goal of 1.5\'b0. Countries will need quickly and aggressively cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions further.  Oxfam estimates that only a fraction of the money that rich countries are spending on climate change is reaching the most vulnerable communities that desperately need it most. Figuring out how to close this gap and strengthen the resilience of these communities should be high on the list of priorities ahead of November\' s United Nations in Morocco.

Professor Sir Brian HoskinsChair of the Grantham Institute Climate Change and the EnvironmentThe initiative The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change proposes over 30 indicators, for example tracking the spread of infectious diseases, deaths or illness resulting from heatwaves or droughts, and health problems caused by air pollution. The initiative will also identify policies that provide win-win solutions for health and climate.The initiative was announced on Monday at the United Nations (COP22) taking place in Marrakech, Morocco.Researchers Dr Kris Murray at the Grantham Institute and Professor Paolo Vineis at Imperial's School of Public Health are contributing to the development of the Lancet Countdown.Dr Murray is working on developing indicators to track climate change impacts on health from infectious diseases, such as the changing distributions of mosquitos that carry dangerous infectious diseases like dengue. Professor Vineis is working to determine the effect of policies that aim to cut emissions and improve health, such as promoting healthy, sustainable diets, such as reducing high meat consumption in the developed world.With the aim of ensuring the case for action on health and climate change is more widely evidenced and understood, the Lancet Countdown is designed to inform decision-making and drive an accelerated policy response to climate change. It will complement other initiatives, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its achievements for climate science.linking Climate and healthProfessor Sir Brian Hoskins, an eminent expert in meteorology and climate change and chair of the Grantham Institute Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College London, said:""We know climate change will lead to a rise in average global temperatures over the twenty-first century.

'No one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is happening, and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in Paris,' Kerry said. Trump's Nov. 8 victory landed smack dab in the middle of the COP-22 summit, where government officials, business leaders, and experts from across the world held follow-on negotiations to the Paris deal. On the campaign trail, Trump openly called to cancel the climate change agreement, which would unravel one of the Obama administration  and Kerry's  most high-profile legacies. Though the deal boasts nearly 200 signatories, its future without U.S. leadership is in question[2]. Yet Trump has already rolled back other pledges he made as a candidate, conceding his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border could just be a 'partial fence[3]' and saying he would keep parts of Obamacare[4]. This trend could bode well for proponents of the climate change deal, who are worried Trump will stick to his campaign promise of abandoning the agreement. Had Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, a staunch supporter of the Paris agreement, beat Trump, Kerry's speech would have been more of a victory lap than a grave attempt to reassure nervous negotiators. But she did not. And so Kerry's ultimate message in Marrakech seemed to be directed at Trump. 'While I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue,' Kerry said, ostensibly to those in Marrakech, and perhaps to one soon to be very powerful man back in New York, 'I will tell you this: In the time that I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail.' 'Make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential,' he said. 'We don't get a second chance. The consequences of failure would in most cases be irreversible,' Kerry added.

Still, the program must go on, and two temporary wooden structures that reflect the African country's architecture and moderate and sub-tropical climate have been erected to mark the occasion. The first is the Ark22 designed by Paris-based firm Malka Architecture[3] and Oualalou Choi[4], based in Paris and Casablanca. Made from layers of stacked wooden bars sourced from local forests, the large building appears to be both slight and hefty. The louver-like walls allow for ventilation while keeping the interiors cool. A wide, pointed arch establishes the entrance. The Agora22 is made up of two restaurants and was built using oriented strand board. Its open, vernacular design incorporates multiple heights, patios, verandas, skylights, and rooftop terraces that provide views of the surrounding landscape.

With over 12,000 participants, 200 kiosks, and 200 conferences, the conference hall was packed. The participants and speakers represented 36 countries including Morocco, China, and France. First launched in 1995, the annual event was organized by R\'e9seau Environment.""This edition was a great success, with an increase in participation, but above all, an increased diversity of participants, through the integration of events parallel to the programming of AMERICANA,"" Jean Lacroix, CEO of R\'e9seau Environment, explained. ""The diversity of the protagonists and sectors represented a decompartmentalization and convergence of interests for joint action in favor of the environment.""The conference was predominantly francophone, though many of the conferences featured real-time English translation headsets.Each day there were three presentations of each topic. The first two days brought leaders of green municipalities and innovators into discussion with other municipality leaders who would like to make their cities more efficient and environmentally sustainable. One lecture, titled ""Circular economy, regional economic development and clean energy transition,"" featured Jacky Aignel, the mayor of Le Men\'e9, France. Le Men\'e9 is a 100 per cent RES (Renewable Energy Sources) city focused on implementing an exclusively renewable energy strategy. He explained how his city transitioned to green power.Le Men\'e9 isn't the only green-minded city in France. Jacques Saint-Marc, the former secretary general of the Interministerial group for mobility and electric vehicles in France, explained in his talk, ""Innovating - easier than it looks: solutions for creative cities and businesses,"" how France is mitigating the effects of climate change through their implementation of rentable electric vehicles (EVs). The EVs are designed to complement the transportation system of trains and bikes that were already in place. The government of France has offered subsidies to companies willing to install this technology. One firm-the Bollor\'e9 Group-has taken advantage of the offer and plans to install 16,000 charging stations across the country.One of the participants of the conference, Jonathan Arnold, representing Canada's Ecofiscal Commission, explained that he enjoyed the conference, but found it difficult to network effectively due to its size. The Ecofiscal Commission is a think-tank that creates policy reports and advises politicians on how their plans could be implemented. His interests lie specifically in water and waste management. Arnold came prepared and had already emailed groups and individuals in his field to let them know that he was coming so that they could meet. The most interesting, if not terrifying, fact he learned at the conference was that if there was an oil spill tomorrow in Montr\'e9al, there would only be enough water reserves for up to 16 hours.The last panel was titled, ""From COP22 to driving forces: the role of the young generation in sustainable development implementation."" Its speakers included Nicolas Eyssallenne, representing the Canadian delegation of young business professionals at the COP22 conference in Marrakech: Cap DD, and Marie-Chantal Vincent representing \'c9cosyst\'e9mie.

The country has also taken steps to adapt its agriculture, with better water management and more climate-resistant crops, while also lowering its emissions by eliminating most energy subsidies and with the construction of the large solar plant in Ouarzazate, World Bank senior official Hafez Ghanem noted. This is the kind of comprehensive climate action we will support across the region, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, he added.The World Bank Group announced on November 15 a HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/11/15/a-new-plan-to-support-action-on-climate-change-in-the-arab-worldnew plan to ramp up support for countries in the MENA region by nearly doubling the portion of Bank financing dedicated to climate action, taking it to around 1.5 billion dollars per year by 2020.The plan focuses on four priorities: food and water security; sustainable cities adapted to new climate conditions; the transition to low-carbon energy; and the protection of the poorest that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change.The Marrakech Conference follows the adoption by 196 UNFCCC States Parties last December, of the HYPERLINK http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/finale-cop21/Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital \~ HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52802where it was approvedThe Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22, which has been under way since 7 November.

Download the iRain app to find out","January 13, 2017 Friday","US Official News","Berkeley: University of California has issued the following news release: Climate researchers and weather forecasters get their rain data from a network of precipitation-sensing satellites that orbit Earth. iRain, a new mobile phone app developed by engineers at the University of California, Irvine puts the same precision rainfall information into the pockets of the public. The free app, available for iPhone and Android devices, provides timely satellite rain data via UC Irvine's globally recognized weather tracking and analysis system. iRain also allows users to enter their own rain or snowfall observations \- heavy, moderate, light, none \- to join a globe-spanning cadre of citizen hydrologists.  The beauty of iRain is that it\' s an access point for an entire system that detects, tracks, and studies precipitation on our planet, says lead developer Phu Nguyen, assistant adjunct professor of civil & environmental engineering.  We process the data from satellites and offer it to the end user, free of charge. As far as I know, we\' re the only institution offering such a device.  The beauty of iRain is that it\' s an access point for an entire system that detects, tracks, and studies precipitation on our planet, says lead developer Phu Nguyen, assistant adjunct professor of civil & environmental engineering. Credit: Brian Bell/UC Irvine Features of the mobile app include a tool that displays the top 50 current extreme weather events around the world, animations that show varying levels of rainfall intensity and movement, a function to choose different time spans, and a tool to zoom in to a local area. Many of the functions of the app are also available through a website, which is useful for researchers who often need to generate and download reports. UC Irvine uses data from U.S., European, and Japanese satellites in collaboration with agencies such as NASA and NOAA to produce rainfall information now being accessed by people in more than 180 countries.  The power of iRain is that it brings state-of-the-art rainfall estimation based on actual observations to anyone, anyplace in the world at any time, says Robert Pietrowsky, director of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Institute for Water Resources, who helped launch the app at the United Nations in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November. iRain is part of UC Irvine\' s PERSIANN project, the culmination of decades of research and development by scientists and engineers in Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing. Nearly 20 years ago, Kuo-lin Hsu, professor of civil and environmental engineering, created an algorithm for the retrieval of rainfall data from satellite images. His algorithm is based on technologies that enable rainfall estimations to grow in precision and reliability over time based on the accumulation of data. Hsu says one of the key challenges for his developers over the years has been to reduce the wait time between retrieval of data, processing, and distribution through government servers. With the launch of iRain, UC Irvine demonstrates that it\' s possible to compress that down to about an hour.  The meteorological agency in the African nation of Namibia is using our data, and we\' re seeing it used in China, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian nations that have a serious stake in flood monitoring, says Hsu.  Support from UNESCO has enabled us to dramatically expand the number of users for the data around the world. Now people don\' t need resources to launch their own weather satellite, they just need an Internet connection to receive real-time data.  We had a vision on how we could use satellites to come up with estimates of rainfall that would have applications for flood forecasting and other purposes, says CHRS director Soroosh Sorooshian, Distinguished Professor of civil and environmental engineering.  At a meeting in Italy years ago, I presented the concept of introducing machine learning tools such as artificial neural networks to address the problem. There were many skeptics in that audience, but here we are today; people around the world are benefiting from our efforts.

Frydenberg brought up the issue of Australia's Carmichael coal mine, which will be one of the world's largest and is estimated to produce annual emissions that rival that of New York City. Activist groups have been fighting against the development of the mine, and it was recently revealed in Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked emails that one was funded by a U.S.-based trust called the Sandler Foundation. Accordingly, Frydenberg raised the issue with Ernest Moniz, U.S. Energy secretary. The move was awarded the ""fossil of the day award"" ? a dubious distinction from the Climate Action Network that honors some of the worst performers at the climate summit. Meanwhile, former Australian President Tony Abbott said in a recent interview that there has been an over-the-top ""moral panic"" over global warming. ""One of the encouraging things about the election of [Donald] Trump is that we should finally be able to see this issue in better perspective,"" he said. While acknowledging that countries should take ""reasonable steps"" to curb greenhouse gas emissions, he also criticized the imposition of ""socialism in the name of misguided environmentalism"" (Michael Slezak, London Guardian, Nov. 16; Gareth Hutchens, London Guardian, Nov. 16). ?

But they tried to remain positive. 'It's clear that Donald Trump[3] is about to be one of the most powerful people in the world, but even he does not have the power to amend and change the laws of physics, to stop the impacts of climate change,' said\~Alden Meyer[4], director of strategy and policy at the Union for Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in the U.S., at a press conference held shortly after the election was called[5]\~early Wednesday. 'He has to acknowledge the reality of climate change, he has a responsibility as president-elect now.' The U.S. presidential election results came as a surprise to many who on Tuesday thought Hillary Clinton[6]\~would be elected and plans to continue the Obama administration's work on climate change would make press conferences a relative non-event. But Trump's name is on everyone's lips as many wonder where America will stand in future negotiations. Some groups have not been as diplomatic. 'The election of Trump is a disaster for our continent,' Geoffrey Kamese, a senior program officer for the group Friends of the Earth Africa, said in a statement. 'The United States, if it follows through on its new president's rash words about withdrawing from the international climate regime, will become a pariah state in global efforts for climate action.' The U.S. delegation had previously planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions[7] from the amount released in 2005, by between 26 and 28 percent by 2025. The prospect of a presidency helmed by Trump, who has said that\~climate change is a hoax[8] perpetrated by the Chinese, throws that into question. He has threatened to ignore those pledges and leave the Paris deal[9], end all funding[10] on the issue, appoint climate deniers to lead major government agencies and roll back President Barack Obama's sweeping environmental legacy.\~His election won't help the fight[11] against climate change. The previous climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, failed to meaningfully address climate change because the United States backed out, a move that set back climate change progress two decades. But climate advocates tried to spin the fallout from Trump's election positively, arguing that other nations aren't likely to wait for the U.S.  the world's second largest polluter  to take action. 'Other major countries in this process will continue to go ahead with the climate commitments that they have made under Paris, not because they're trying to please the United States, but because it's in their own self interest to protect their people from the impacts of climate change,' Meyer said. However, he continued to note inaction on behalf of America could certainly impact other international negotiations. Katherine Egland, chairman of environmental and climate justice for the NAACP, stressed that for the Paris Agreement to succeed, 'no one country can be perceived as not doing its fair share.' 'We remain a nation of honor  our word is our bond,' she said. 'We have signed a binding agreement along with scores of other countries and we will demand that agreement be honored.' Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, senior director of international climate cooperation for the World Wildlife Fund, said despite the outcome, 'the momentum for climate action has never been greater.' 'At this point, given the progress that we have seen, we are confident that the nations of the world will keep focusing on the work that needs to go ahead,' she said at a press conference. 'With the momentum that we have behind us we need to remain confident that the arc of climate justice will bend towards solutions.'This article originally appeared on The Huffington Post HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change_us_58230c75e4b0aac6248872c3http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change_us_58230c75e4b0aac6248872c3 [ 1]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wins_us_5822958ee4b0e80b02cdcbda?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wins_us_5822958ee4b0e80b02cdcbda?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cop22-climate-change-morocco_us_581f0a8fe4b0e80b02ca9a32?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ HYPERLINK cop22 -climate-change-morocco_us_581f0a8fe4b0e80b02ca9a32?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/alden-meyer.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/alden-meyer.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/results/president?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/results/president?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/12/11/what-is-the-u-s-commitment-in-paris/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/12/11/what-is-the-u-s-commitment-in-paris/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 9]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change-paris_us_573ca22ee4b0ef86171ce812?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change-paris_us_573ca22ee4b0ef86171ce812?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 10]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change-policy_us_581f57bde4b0e80b02caa351?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change-policy_us_581f57bde4b0e80b02caa351?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 11]: \~ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change_us_5822b97fe4b0aac624883f9d?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change_us_5822b97fe4b0aac624883f9d?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 \l"

The side event explored synergies between India and Africa on decentralized renewable energy solutions and discussed how Indian and African private sector could collaborate to propel Africa's climate smart growth.Both India and Africa face the daunting task of defining right to power and ensuring energy access. India and Africa have huge potential of collaboration to address the challenge of economic and energy poverty through decentralized and off-grid energy clean energy solutions. It was highlighted how adoption of clean energy in Africa is hampered not by the absence of right policies but by the dearth of innovation systems.Both India and Africa need market driven distributed architecture for clean energy production and consumption. It is important to make off-grid renewable energy solutions more affordable through economies of scale - as has been shown by the Indian example of massive uptake of LEDs and low-cost solar power from solar parks. There is huge scope for innovative business models in agro-forestry, waste management, solar pumps in the region. It is important to learn from successful models of financial inclusion such as m-pesa and m-kopa.The FICCI Side Event, most importantly, highlighted that India-Africa partnership must be based on domestication of technology. India and Africa can explore collaborative partnerships in three areas for upscaling off-grid clean energy - first, in development and adoption of standard for off-grid products/systems; second, in skilling; and third, in building innovation, both in terms of technology and business models.Copyright Targeted News Services30FurigayJof-5700821 30FurigayJof\l"

It is a pleasure to be here at COP22, and to participate in this discussion on the importance of gender equality in tracking progress of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goal on climate action. I believe we are all in agreement that gender equality is central to successful climate action and gender inequality an obstacle to successful and sustainable development. While the impacts of climate change threaten everyone, we know that climate change is not gender neutral. Gender differences determine both the scale and severity of its impacts. While it threatens livelihoods and security across the board, women and girls commonly face higher risks and greater burdens, particularly when they are living in poverty. The unequal participation of women in decision-making and access to resources and information compound inequalities and often prevent them from fully contributing to climate-related planning, policy-making and implementation. Yet, the evidence is clear that their participation in community representation is central to delivering both successful climate action and sustainable development. This is why a critical aspect of UNDP\' s efforts to address climate change is to ensure that policies and programmes at all levels promote the participation of women and guarantee that benefits are equally distributed across society. UNDP is supporting the integration of gender issues into the National Communications and Biennial Update Reports, in which countries provide regular information and status updates on their progress towards implementation of the UNFCCC. Not only does the Convention encourage countries to integrate gender considerations into specific areas of work, including in these National Communications; but incorporating gender aspects into national systems for monitoring and reporting also contributes to increased transparency, improved planning, enhanced effectiveness and better results. In this regard, UNDP has developed a gender-responsive tracking tool for national climate action and sustainable development, which helps national governments integrate gender into their climate action planning and policy-making and ensures the participation of women at all levels. This Gender-Responsive National Communications Tool Kit provides step-by-step guidance on how to integrate gender into the development of National Communications \- from the preparation stage to stocktaking and analysing national circumstances, workshops to initiate communication processes, and reporting on constraints, gaps and needs that ought to be addressed in future planning. UNDP launched the toolkit in English last year. This year, to expand its use worldwide, the toolkit was translated into French and Spanish, with the support of the Governments of Belgium and Uruguay. The toolkit is already contributing to the integration of gender into planning on climate change. The Government of Albania, for example, used it to develop guidel"

(Image credit: L.A. Cicero)Now, representatives of 196 countries are in Marrakesh, Morocco, through Nov. 18 to hash out details of managing the pact and ensuring all signatories meet the goals they committed to, not only cutting carbon output but also financing adaptation in developing countries and other objectives (Paris Agreement highlights).Stanford climate scientist Katharine Mach, who helped inform some of the decisions that went into the Paris Agreement, talked with Stanford Report about opportunities and obstacles for the Marrakesh meeting, formally known as the 22nd gathering of the Conference of the Parties (COP22) to the U.N.

In addition, it has taken concrete steps to ensure that 52% of the national energy supply comes from clean sources by the year 2030. By the same token, we have proposed a set of initiatives as part of implementing the Paris Agreement, especially with respect to adaptation and financing. These include the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture.""""Holding this conference in Africa,"" he said, ""is an incentive for us to give priority to tackling the adverse repercussions of climate change, which are growing worse and worse in the countries of the South and in insular states whose very existence is in jeopardy."" ""The environmental issue is a critical problem which must be tackled in the most serious and responsible way,"" he told the assembled world leaders. He continued, ""What is at stake is the very existence of man. It is therefore our joint duty to work hand in hand to protect him. Accordingly, countries must not be pressed from the start into accepting decisions they will be unable to comply with. This is not to say that they reject them. It only means that they do not have the necessary means to implement them.""The King urged ""all parties to work on translating our commitment to the values of justice and solidarity into actions, by: -- Providing the countries of the South, especially the least developed, as as will enhance their capacities and enable them to adapt to climate change; -- Advanced countries honoring their commitments and mobilizing 100 billion -- All the parties being involved in facilitating the transfer of technology, and working for the development of research and innovation -- Non-Governmental players, including companies, local communities, NGOs from civil society, giving strong impetus to the Global Climate Action Agenda.""""The time has come to redress the situation,"" the King concluded. ""We have no alternative but to work to make up for lost time, through continued, comprehensive mobilization and positive harmonization, so that the coming generations may lead an enjoyable and dignified life together.""At a press conference earlier this week, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed his gratitude to King Mohammed VI for convening the Marrakesh conference -- and for Morocco's ongoing leadership. ""I am grateful for His Majesty convening this very important COP meeting, immediately after the Paris Agreement,"" he said. "". . . Morocco is a very important country, Member State of the United Nations, not only on the African continent or in the Middle East but as a whole, providing many young men and women to keep peace and security around the world. And Morocco has been showing a great example based on democratic institutions, making sustainable development and championing climate change actions.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA227","At the Nexus of Water and Climate Change","September 3, 2016 Saturday 9:30 PM GMT","iCrowdNewswire (English)","At the Nexus of Water and Climate ChangeBy http://www.ipsnews.net/author/justus-wanjala/Justus WanjalaIn less than 15 years, a 40 percent global shortfall in water supply versus demand is expected if we carry on with business as usual. Credit: BigstockSTOCKHOLM, Sep 3 2016 (IPS) With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it's clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal.Here at HYPERLINK http://www.worldwaterweek.org/World Water Week, which concluded on Friday, Susanne Skyllerstedt, programme officer for Water, Climate Change and Development at the \~ HYPERLINK http://www.gwp.org/Global Water Partnership For us, resolutions of COP21 are part and parcel of what we are implementing and those of COP22 (in Marrakech) will be embedded in our long-term agenda of ensuring water security in Africa and rest of the developing world in a bid to attain water-related sustainable development goals, she told IPS. GWP is a Stockholm-based organisation that has been involved in fostering integrated water resource management around the world for the last 20 years. GPS has four regional offices in Africa covering Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa.As an inter-governmental entity, GWP works with organisations involved in water resources management. These range from national government's institutions, United Nations agencies to funding bodies. Other stakeholders include professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector. GWP has a water and climate change programme to support governments on water security and climate change resilience.Already, said Skyllerstedt, GWP has a programme that was started in Africa through the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) together with the African Union Commission and other development partners. The programme has been a key platform for supporting African governments.These include support on national climate change adaptation programmes more so in the sphere of policy formulation. For Sub-Saharan Africa countries noted for vulnerability to impacts of global climate change, the programme is key in supporting climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.Through monitoring and evaluation programmes conducted in the recent past, GWP has learned vital lessons and is cognisant of areas that need more resources to achieve the desired goals. Already, she said, GWP is running a three-year programme on climate change aimed at achieving sustainable development goals linked to water, energy and food through climate resilience.She said they are implementing initiatives aimed at enabling countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to acquire highly relevant technologies on sustainable water management. We have demo programmes on new technologies being implemented by our partners in Africa but they need to be scaled up to have a major impact, she said.GWP is also addressing the challenge of water pollution, to ensure availability of cleaner water for human consumption and other uses. It is collaborating with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to promote water security and hygiene. The aim is to incorporate water, sanitation and hygiene component in climate resilience, Skyllerstedt explained.GWP is also developing tools for better planning on water, sanitation and hygiene to help communities during calamities such as floods. We have an urban planning project focusing on urban water systems and infrastructure we work with national government and other partners on issues planning putting into consideration matters of access to water and sanitation facilities as well as water related calamities.At the same time GWP collaborates with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on drought and flood monitoring. We work with experts and stakeholders to ensure national plans take into account climate change-related hazards, Skyllerstedt said. Many African countries face challenges in fighting impacts of extreme weather such as floods and droughts, and here is where the adaption programme is relevant. For the next three years GWP intends to widen its support to encompass not only national climate change adaptation programmes but also Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that countries published prior to the 2015 United Nations in Paris. National Adaptation Programmes (NAPs) and NDCs should be merged to avoid duplications, she observed.The biggest challenge to implementation of GWP programmes by its partners in Africa and elsewhere remains access to financial resources. During the COP21 in Paris last year, there were lots of pledges on financing initiatives for enhancing water security and its access by the poor. Unfortunately, our partners are not able to access the money due technical bottlenecks, she said.The situation has compelled GWP to embark on enhancing the capacity of their partners in Africa in the spheres of project design as well as making of investment plans and strategies.Related IPS Articles HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/08/nurturing-african-agriculture/Nurturing African Agriculture  HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/08/adaptation-to-climate-change-need-for-a-human-rights-approach/Adaptation to Climate Change: Need for a Human Rights Approach{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/08/climate-smart-agriculture-for-drought-stricken-madagascar/Climate-Smart Agriculture for Drought-Stricken MadagascarSummary:With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it s clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal.See Campaign: HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/09/at-the-nexus-of-water-and-climate-change/http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/09/at-the-nexus-of-water-and-climate-change/Justus WanjalaTags: \~ HYPERLINK IPS News Agency, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/English, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/icn-internal/inter-press-service/Inter Press Service HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/europe/Europe, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/civil-society/Civil Society, \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/icn-internal/wire/WireThe post HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.com/2016/09/03/nexus-water-climate-change/At the Nexus of Water and Climate Change appeared first on \~ HYPERLINK http://icrowdnewswire.comiCrowdNewswire.\l"

The professors said they were coming forward with the information to discredit Moscow as an honest broker in peace talks.After years of taking a back seat to the U.S. in Mideast diplomacy, Russia has increasingly sought to take a leadership role in the region.In Washington, a spokesman said the U.S. State Department is following the Russian efforts closely and would ""be supportive"" of any kind of effort to bring the parties together.Meanwhile, the Palestinian Supreme Court indefinitely postponed municipal elections scheduled for Oct. 8, a surprise move that reflects infighting in Mr. Abbas' Fatah party, tension between Fatah and Islamic militants from Hamas and rising instability in Palestinian cities.\l"

More than 70 artists and artists' collectives will have their work on display at Saturday's festival, and most of the pieces reflect on the festival's general theme, ""Climate Chaos / Climate Rising.""Nathan Young, curatorial assistant for the event, said the theme was influenced by the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. This year, the festival will act as a platform for artists to explore the impact and intricacies of climate change through interactive installations and performances.One such attraction, Making the Best of It: Dandelion, is an art project that will begin its 12-month long installation on Saturday at Northern Sparks, Young said. The project is a pop-up food refuge and community dinner, where participants can discuss how climate change affects their food consumption habits and diet.Backyard Phenology, another installation on display during the festival, is an art piece that encourages people to gather and discuss their perception and observations of climate change, Young said. Co-sponsored by the Walker Art Center and North Lights and Sundance Institute, participants of Virtual Reality: A New Frontier, can view a collection of virtual reality works created by local and international artists.Throughout the night, festival-goers can watch a choreographed dance ? entitled Census ? that includes over 100 performers.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA234","ADAPTATION FUNDING A MUST FOR AFRICA","November 13, 2016 Sunday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The Paris Agreement hammered out at the summit on climate change in the French capital last year committed all parties to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. The big question at the follow-up meeting here in Marrakech is how that deal will be implemented, especially for the developing nations of Africa.""We have three major objectives at this COP: [the first is] to set a foundation for a strong technical and legal framework of the Paris Agreement,"" said Seni Nafo, chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN).Dubbed the 'COP of Implementation,' the summit dubbed COP 22 is seen by the African group as an opportunity to refine some of Paris's unfinished business.Despite adoption last year, a number of key decisions in the PA such as modalities for achieving the 2 degree C. threshold, mechanisms to enforce compliance and achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation, among others, were deferred to COP 22.With the deal based on Nationally Determined Contributions, it is feared the challenge of access to climate finance for Africa might get further complicated as it has been discovered that most countries' NDCs are vague, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).""ACPC is ready to support African countries in the revision of their Nationally Determined Contributions, most of which have been found to be defective,"" James Murombedzi, Officer in Charge at ACPC told IPS, adding that his organisation wants to see an inclusive implementation of the PA.Murombedzi said this would, however, not be possible if COP 22 does not lay a strong foundation.The talk over the years has been capacity building to achieve the required levels of preparing bankable proposals in most African countries. Nevertheless, experts have urged caution even as the continent pushes for this need.According to Balgis Osman Elasha, Principal Climate Change officer at the African Development Bank, Africa should avoid the 'Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) trap' by perpetually pushing capacity building and miss out on serious climate funding opportunities.Elasha says ""Africa could not benefit from the CDM because it was caught up in the capacity building mode while others were taking action.""CDM of the Kyoto Protocol provided for emissions reduction projects aimed at assisting parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments.As highlighted, a balance between adaptation and mitigation features prominently in the negotiations. And for African economies, adaptation is not a question of the future but now.Available data shows that most countries are already facing economic challenges which are likely to be worsened by climate change effects. For example, cereal production is expected to decrease by up to 49 percent in Africa by 2050 due to the impacts of climate change, exacerbating food insecurity.And Zambia's Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Lloyd Mulenga Kaziya underscored the need for urgent action especially the improvement of hydromet services. ""Zambia is deeply affected. In the past five years, our rivers have been drying up while the frequency of droughts has increased affecting our smallholder farmers in terms of production, and to make matters worse, information flow to the affected communities is not readily available,"" said Kaziya, adding that the southern African country requires urgent support to upgrade hydromet systems and integrate them in all key sectors such as Mining, Energy and AgricultureWith these critical needs identified, the AGN is determined to ensure that Africa's voice is heard at the negotiating table -- especially now as the rules and modalities for implementation are being discussed.But on its part, the continent is not seating idle. At COP 21, the Africa Renewable Initiative (AREI) was launched to pave the way for Africa's transition to inclusive green growth. AREI already has resulted in significant financial commitment of over 10 billion dollars for renewable energy projects in Africa, according to the African Development Bank, one of the partners of the initiative.The tone for Africa's demands at this year's COP was clear on day one of the event as Salahedinne Mezouar, the COP 22 President, said: ""Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change,"" underscored Mezouar, implicitly referring to Africa-the most exposed region whose contribution to global carbon emissions is just about 5 percent.As negotiations enter the second week, the African group remains optimistic that most outstanding issues, especially means of implementation, would be resolved for smooth implementation of the Paris Agreement.\l"

""This opens up space for the EU to forge a new relationship with China and build on the global political momentum of the Paris Agreement.

The White House confirmed that scheduling conflicts caused postponement of the early afternoon meeting, as Bloomberg News first reported this morning. ""It's rescheduled. It's because some of the principals decided to travel last minute today,"" an aide told E&E News. The change comes as the business community weighs in on the climate change pact that has caused a monthslong conflict within the administration (Climatewire, April 18). Cheniere Energy Inc.'s executive vice president, Anatol Feygin, yesterday said the company, which oversees multiple liquefied natural gas operations, believes the 2015 agreement can foster demand for domestic energy resources and support continued growth of American industry. Feygin made the comments in a letter to George David Banks, a special assistant to the president for international energy and environment. ""After more than a year of selling U.S. manufactured LNG to more than 19 countries across the world, Cheniere firmly believes that domestic energy companies are better positioned to compete globally if the United States remains a party to the Paris Agreement,"" Feygin wrote. Exxon Mobil Corp., BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have also welcomed the Paris Agreement to varying degrees, along with executives from Cloud Peak Energy Inc., Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. Critics of the deal launched an effort to hold President Trump to his campaign promise to ""cancel"" the deal. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is circulating a petition and video urging Trump to withdraw. Kevin Book, an analyst at Washington-based ClearView Energy Partners LLC, in a note to clients yesterday said he thought the White House has already resolved to stay in the Paris Agreement. He speculated that the news the White House was holding a meeting about Paris leaked because that decision had already been reached, and opponents wanted to have more input.

Less than a year later, the landmark Agreement has entered into force and has been ratified by the UK as a sign of the continued commitment to climate action across the world.Welcoming the completion of the domestic Parliamentary process that facilitated ratification, Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said:The Paris Agreement sends a clear signal that cutting emissions globally will not only help countries respond to the impact of climate change, but it is also compatible with economic growth.As we ratify this landmark agreement, we look ahead to continuing our leadership on climate action and ensuring that British business continues to play a key role in this new global low carbon economy. It will benefit the UK while we implement our industrial strategy to deliver the economy that works for all.Nick Hurd MP, Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry, who has been negotiating for the UK and promoting British business at the 22nd UN climate change Conference of the Parties (COP22) in Marrakesh said:The UK is ratifying the historic Paris Agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all.COP22 in Marrakesh is an important milestone which marks the shift from aspiration to implementation. We are going to use this positive momentum to grow the UK low-carbon sector, which is already worth over 46 billion, as we continue to provide secure, affordable and clean energy to our families and businesses.The Paris Agreement provides a framework for governments as well as business and investors to keep global warming well below 2C, pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.Paris negotiations have set us on an irreversible route towards low-carbon growth. The Marrakesh talks, which conclude today, focused on bringing the Paris Agreement into reality.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA242","Students active at Copenhagen","January 31, 2017 Tuesday","The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College","Inspired by the involvement of two Dartmouth delegations in the 15th United Nations held in Copenhagen in December, students and professors at Dartmouth have become focused and motivated to pursue creative solutions to climate change.Alumni at the conference included U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern '73, the lead negotiator for the United States, and members of the team that developed the Climate Rapid Overview and Decision-support Simulator, known as C-ROADS, a model that determines the long-term impacts greenhouse-gas emission reductions will have on a country's climate.A delegation from the Tuck School of Business traveled to Copenhagen for December's climate-change conference.Prior to COP15, students in biology professor David Peart's ""Science for Sustainable Systems"" class were already navigating the complex issues facing international delegates at the conference, according to Peart. Classes like this encourage Dartmouth students to ""think creatively about complex issues,"" Peart said, fostering an educational climate that may account for the involvement of members of the Dartmouth community at COP15.""I'd like to think that our approach to liberal arts encourages students to think creatively about complex global problems,"" Peart said.Interactions at the conference led student delegations to realize that they must take an active part in the climate change discussion, instead of merely leaving political leaders to sort out the problem, according to several participants.The group from Tuck the only business school formally represented at the conference focused on the implications of climate-change decisions on business and society.""Unlike other issues of global significance, climate change is an issue where businesses happen to be front and center in terms of cause-and-effect relationships,"" Tuck professor Anant Sundaram, the leader of the Tuck delegation, said in an interview.Sundaram, who teaches a class on business and climate change, said he believes companies will play a significant role in the future of sustainable development, as they are responsible for large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. They need to come up with technologies to solve the issue, he said.Sundaram called COP15 a ""massive turning point"" in the global approach to climate change. Although attending the Copenhagen conference did not significantly change his views, Sundaram said his own opinions and those of others were reinforced by the conference's findings.""COP15 was a huge change from six months ago when some countries weren't as eager to work on this issue,"" he said. ""Now one can confidently say that everyone is on board, and we can get to some serious negotiation.""""Academic institutions play a key role because they can propagate to the masses much faster,"" he said. ""Who knows? The next leaders that come out of Dartmouth could have a big impact on future policy.""The Climate Justice Research Project, lead by environmental professor Michael Dorsey, conducted research at COP15 by surveying attendees. The project is aimed at promoting climate-change decisions and economic development while maintaining social justice.Dorsey credited environmental studies professors Andrew Friedland and Ross Virginia and geography professors Chris Sneddon and Susanne Freidberg with cultivating students' interest in the relationship between the environment, energy and political economy.""Their foundation has helped inspire and enthuse a generation of Dartmouth students and [alumni] to not just want to participate but have the requisite skills to do so,"" Dorsey said.In his ""Science for Sustainable Systems"" class last Fall, Peart said he divided students into groups representing affluent nations, rapidly-developing nations and less-developed nations as part of a mock COP15 conference using C-ROADS technology.""For me, the most exciting thing was to have students feel the immediacy of this issue and to understand what the international community is grappling with,"" Peart said.At COP15, C-ROADS was used by delegates to provide real-time climate models based on the provisions of negotiated agreements, according to Peart.Peart said that students quickly adopted the concerns of the countries they represented as their own and were disappointed with the results of the mock negotiations. Despite their investment in the simulation, they were unable to limit the extent of climate change to the proposed target level.""They were representing so intensely the interests of their groups and they negotiated hard but didn't quite get to their goal,"" he said.Peart said simulations and mock negotiations educate students in ways that traditional lectures cannot because they mirror how policy makers form decisions.""Leaders approach every big issue strategically and in systems terms,"" Peart said. ""Educators should be thinking the same way.""Late environmental studies professor Donella Meadows sparked initial interest in sustainability for many of the developers of C-ROADS, according to Drew Jones '90, who attended COP15.""She opened our eyes to the power of a systems view on making the world a better place,"" Jones said.\l"

Continue reading MARRAKECH: Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa s Green Energy PotentialConvincing Investors to Unlock Africa's Green Energy PotentialBy HYPERLINK Friday PhiriMustapha Bakkoury, President of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), speaking at the COP22 in Marrakesh. Credit: Friday Phiri/IPSMARRAKECH, Nov 16 2016 (IPS) Lowering investment risks in African countries is key to achieving a climate-resilient development pathway on the continent, say experts here at the U.N.-sponsored Climate Conference.Mustapha Bakkaoury, president of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), says his country's renewable energy revolution would not have been possible if multilateral partners such as the African Development Bank had not come on board to act as guarantors for a massive solar energy project, tipped to be one of a kind in Africa.Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone. HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souss-Massa-Dr%C3%A2aSouss-Massa-Dr\'e2a HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OuarzazateOuarzazate, is expected to produce 580 MW at peak when finished, and is hailed as a model for other African countries to follow. Africa has legitimate energy needs, and development of Africa will happen through mobilisation of energy resources, Bakkaoury told IPS at COP 22 after a roundtable discussion on de-risking investment in realising groundbreaking renewable energy projects.Bakkauory believes it is possible for Africa to develop its energy sector while respecting the environment. What we say is that there is no fatality between having energy resources and respect towards the environment, and Africa has abundant resources to do this through its key partner the African Development Bank, he said, noting the instrumental role of Africa's premier multilateral financier to renewable energy in Africa.And in affirming its continued commitment to universal access to energy for Africa, Alex Rugamba, AfDB Director for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, told IPS that the Bank's commitment has shifted gear as it has now a fully-fledged vice presidency dedicated to Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth. Rugamba added that the Bank has learnt valuable lessons from various initiatives it is already supporting, and knows what is required to move forward with the initiatives without many challenges.Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone. Private sector cannot be ignored because the money they have is more than what is available under public financing, she says.But the risk is believed to be too high for private investors to off-load their money into Africa's renewables, a relatively new investment portfolio with a lot of uncertainties. German Parliament State Secretary Thomas Silberhorn says the highest risk in Africa is politically related. It's not about economic risks alone, but also political risks, said Silberhorn. You don't need to convince German investors about solar energy because they already know that it works, what they need is reliability on the political environment and sustainability of their investments. Silberhorn, who gave an example of a multi-million-dollar project in Kenya currently on hold due to political interference, added that ways to reduce political risks should be devised for Africa to benefit from private sector investments in renewables.But even as risk factors abound, World Bank's Tuck believes there is hope for Africa, citing Zambia, where record cheap solar energy has been recorded. Through a competitive bidding process, we have in Zambia under the Bank's Scaling Solar' program, recorded the cheapest price at 6.02 cents per KWh, she said, heralding it as a model to follow in de-risking climate investments for Africa's growth.And in keeping with the objective of universal energy for all, experts note the need to ensure that the end users are not exploited at the expense of investors. While the state should not interfere in this business model to work, modalities have to be put in place to ensure that the people for which energy is needed, afford it, otherwise, the project becomes useless, said MASEN's Bakkaoury.Following up on this key aspect and responding to the political risk question, Simon Ngure of KenGen Kenya proposes a key principle to minimise political interference involvement of the local communities. If you involve the local communities from the onset, regardless of whether governments change, the projects succeed because the people will have seen the benefits already, said Ngure, who also noted policy restructuring as another key component to de-risk climate investments.Agreed that de-risking investment is a crucial component, small grants are another issue that the African Union Commission's implementing Agency, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), believes could unlock the continent's challenge of access to climate financing.NEPAD Director of Programmes Estherine Fotabong told IPS that it was for this reason that the agency established the http://www.nepad.org/programme/climate-change-fundNEPAD Climate Change Fund One of the objectives of the fund is to support concrete action for communities on the ground, but most importantly, to help with capacity building of member states to be able to leverage financing from complicated climate financial regimes, said Fotabong, citing HYPERLINK http://www.ecowas.int/ECOWAS which she said used the funding to leverage financing from the \~ HYPERLINK http://www.greenclimate.fund/homeGreen Climate Fund, one of the financing regimes under the \~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/green_climate_fund/items/5869.phpUNFCCC.Related IPS Articles http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/climate-change-a-goat-farmers-gain/Climate Change, A Goat Farmer's Gain  HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/11/adaptation-funding-a-must-for-africa/Adaptation Funding a Must for Africa  HYPERLINK http://www.ipsnews.net/2016/10/africa-and-the-paris-agreement-which-way-forward/Africa and the Paris Agreement: Which Way Forward?Pictures for this storyThis story includes downloadable print-quality images Copyright IPS, to be used exclusively with this story.

Ogle, also a senior research scientist in the Natural Resources Ecology Laboratory, will work with Universidad Nacional de Colombia to help researchers develop a better understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and methods to account for the emissions. Over the course of two weeks, he will provide lectures and offer training activities and hands-on computer modeling work. Ogle will also take part in field research, visiting the Orinoco River Basin, where agriculture is expanding and researchers in Colombia are gathering data on corn production systems, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through conservation management practices. Colombia conducts greenhouse gas inventories already, Ogle said.  But researchers at the university want to develop more sophisticated methods for agriculture and croplands, he explained. More specifically, they want to improve on the inventory accounting methods as they relate to agreements made at the 2015 United Nations . Stephen Ogle soil sample Stephen Ogle on a soil sampling trip in the Southeastern United States. Ogle has worked with more than 20 national governments on improving greenhouse gas emission inventories and complying with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reporting requirements. He is currently collaborating with Vietnam, South Africa and Bangladesh through projects sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  If this project is successful with Colombia and they use the new method for greenhouse gas emissions reporting, it is likely that other countries will start to adopt more sophisticated methods that, in turn, will lead to more accurate emissions reporting by governments, Ogle said.

The COP22 conference on 7-18 November focuses on ways of implementing the first universally binding global deal on climate change, a matter of huge urgency for the planet. Parliament is represented at the talks by a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via.At the COP21 climate talks last December, 195 countries adopted the Paris agreement on climate change. The world's first universally binding climate deal, it sets out a global plan on how to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. The deal entered into force earlier this month after the European Parliament gave its consent to the EU's ratification.This week a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Giovanni La Via, chair of Parliament's environment committee, takes part in the conference in Marrakesh. Miguel Arias Caete, the European commissioner responsible for climate action, will brief the delegation on a daily basis. MEPs will also engage in talks with NGOs, industry and delegations from various countries.COP22: 'COP of action'The focus of this week's round of talks will be on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Delegates will work on making national climate plans as clear and transparent as possible, and on ensuring that the actions taken are traceable and that standardised reporting methods are used. There will also be discussions on enhanced action prior to 2020.As part of the Paris agreement developed countries promised to mobilise at least $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Aiming to deliver on the commitments made, the negotiations in Marrakesh will revolve around who should pay into these funds and how they should be used. There will also be discussions on the need for further support for developing countries in terms of technology and capacity-building.\l"

''I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians,'' she added. ''As far as I'm concerned, it's their choice, but I choose to reflect the times.''Institutions can make that choice, too. The International Center of Photography did when it opened its doors in 1974 as a showcase for socially concerned photography, which encompassed photojournalism and so-called street photography. For over 40 years, the center has stayed on mission, even as the technology of picture-making has expanded, and the main street has become the internet. A new exhibition, ''Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,'' reflects those shifts. It's as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past because digital media -- smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds -- outnumber photographic prints. The embrace of the digital was probably inevitable for the center, an institution that clearly doesn't want to freeze into a yesterday-museum. But it necessitates a rethinking of old ideas. It requires seeing photography as part of a larger, amorphous category, one morally up for grabs, called visual culture. And it requires recognizing that in the digital present, visual culture does more than reflect reality: For better and for worse, it creates it. For the center, the transition has been bumpy. It started decisively with the 2016 exhibition ''Public, Private, Secret,'' the institution's inaugural venture on the Bowery. Some people loathed the show, finding it a meanspirited mess that mixed too many media to no discernible end. (For me, it captured the random, narcissistic viciousness of internet culture to a T, and gave it a history.) ''Perpetual Revolution'' is an improvement. It pushes the use of new media even further, but in a directed way, and with nuances attributable, my guess is, to the fact that this is a group effort. The center curators Carol Squiers and Cynthia Young have led a team that includes the assistant curators Susan Carlson and Claartje van Dijk, and the adjunct curators Joanna Lehan and Kalia Brooks, with assistance from Akshay Bhoan and Quito Ziegler. Different curators handled individual sections, but everyone was working with a shared model. The opening section, on climate change, gives a sense of the governing method. It starts with a familiar photograph: the 1968 NASA shot of the Earth, as seen from the moon, an image that became a kind of logo for a nascent ecology movement, which produced the Environmental Protection Agency two years later. Next comes a bit of digital wizardry in a recent video charting temperature changes across the globe during roughly the past century. Then the apocalypse, or what looks like one, in a clip from the 2012 film ''Chasing Ice,'' in which melting glaciers, filmed by the American photographer James Balog, split apart and collapse in agonized slow motion.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA255","Climate Change In COP 22: Irreversibility Of Action And Rulebook Development Despite Elephant In Room - Analysis","December 22, 2016 Thursday","Eurasia Review","The design of the Paris Agreement set the stage for a technical meeting in COP 22 but the stakes were raised in the aftermath of the US election. The rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement has accelerated the development of the Paris rulebook that is expected to be finalised in 2018. Implementation, increased ambition and a just transition are the pending tasks in the minds of negotiators amid statements of the irreversibility of climate action.By Lara L\'e1zaro-TouzaSince the adoption of the Paris Agreement the world of climate politics and policies has experienced a year of accelerated change. Scientific data on ever-increasing temperatures, evidence of our limited mitigation, adaptation and finance actions, a rapidly changing energy landscape, the UK vote to leave the EU, the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the establishment of a Global Market- based Measure (GMBM) under the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and the US elections have all kept the climate community busy prior to the climate meeting in Marrakech.After the political climax in Paris, and given the design of the Paris Agreement, COP 22 was expected to be a technical meeting. Progress was indeed made as regards the initial understanding of countries' positions, processes and plans. And, for the first time after a big negotiating breakthrough such as that opened up by the Paris Agreement, there was no major backtracking or re-opening of the agreed text.The unexpectedly fast entry into force of the Paris Agreement has led to an accelerated roadmap for the development of the Paris rulebook that will govern international climate action in the post Kyoto-Protocol era. Hence, the transitional period from ratification to implementation and rule development will be necessarily short. Some may argue that excessively so, as agreeing on the entire set of rules for a permanent climate governance system is likely to be a complex endeavour that could benefit from a longer development timeframe.Other interesting developments announced at the Marrakech climate meeting, aside from the political declaration (the Marrakech Action Proclamation for our Climate and Sustainable Development) include: the Partnership for Global Climate Action that seeks to engage Parties and non-Parties in pre-2020 action (in the absence of a Doha Amendment entry into force); the 2050 Pathways Platform to foster the development of deep decarbonisation initiatives across sectors; and the Climate Vulnerable Forum Vision, where 48 climate vulnerable developing countries from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific have pledged to go 100% renewable. Finally, there is a joint declaration to develop a Roadmap for Sustainable Electricity Trade between Morocco, Portugal, Spain, France and Germany.AnalysisContextThis section will discuss the contextual factors that preceded COP 22 in Marrakech. These include: the scientific data available as regards climate change; the insufficient advances in mitigation commitments compared to our 2\'baC benchmark as well as our insufficient adaptation finance efforts; a brief reflection on the changing narrative of the economics of climate change since the publication of the Stern Review 10 years ago; advances in the competitiveness and deployment of renewable energy; unforeseen political events; citizen views on climate change; and climate and related agreements since the adoption of the Paris Agreement.(1) ScienceScientific information regarding climate change in 2016 has not been positive. In July NASA reported that the first six months of the year had been the hottest on record since 1880. Additionally, Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest extent for five out of the six first months in 2016 since records began in 1979 (NASA, 2016). By mid-November the Washington Post reported that Arctic scientists were warning that mean temperatures in that area were a staggering 20\'baC warmer than usual (Mooney & Samenow, 2016). These and other (more contested and alarming) findings (see Hansen et al., 2016) come after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC's Fifth Assessment report that warned that climate change is unequivocal, with a clear anthropogenic component and already affecting humans and ecosystems alike (IPCC, 2014).(2) Commitments and gaps: mitigation and adaptation financeIn terms of progress made towards our temperature goal, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) emissions gap reports have been telling us since 2010 that there is a wide and non-diminishing gap1 between our commitments and a pathway consistent with a 2\'baC target (see UNEP, 2010; UNEP, 2011; UNEP, 21013; UNEP, 2014; UNEP, 2015; and UNEP, 2016b). In fact, the 2016 Emission Gap Report (UNEP, 2016b) warns that climate action both pre-2020 and pre-2030 has to be significantly ramped up to meet our goals. This is so because full implementation of the INDCs will overshoot our 'well below' 2\'baC by over one degree centigrade (UNEP, 2016b).As regards action to bridge the emissions gap, the latest UNEP report recommends further improvements in energy efficiency in the building, transport and industrial sectors. In the building sector, building energy codes and energy certificates are recommended. At an industry level the adoption of energy management systems and standards should be pursued. On the transport front the report focuses on improving vehicle efficiency, promoting electric mobility2 and improving logistics.Additionally, UNEP (2016b) underl"

In October, 113 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ratified the Paris Agreement, representing 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. Following this achievement, two urgent matters lie ahead: the development of elaborate and concrete road maps to achieve the goals set in the agreement and fulfilling what is left in the Kyoto Protocol. Marrakech was, without doubt, the beginning of the post-Paris era. Climate finance was under the spotlight during the conference, discussed widely across national pavilions and at side events. Deep concerns were shared by developing countries, especially the least developed and most vulnerable. Although developed countries promised at Copenhagen in 2009 to give annual aid of $100 billion (94 billion euros; 79 billion) from 2010 to 2020 to help developing countries cope with climate change, so far there is still an annual $40 to $70 billion gap to fill. Additionally, this is only the financing shortage within the Kyoto time frame. The world is facing an even bigger challenge when it comes to the Paris Agreement. Last year, before the Paris Conference, developed countries, led by the European Union and the United States, secretly formed a  high ambition coalition with 79 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, but excluding China and India. The group emerged at the end of the conference to push for a legally binding plan to hold the global temperature increase to within 1.5 C by 2100, instead of the former agreed target of 2 C. The final version of the Paris Agreement, therefore, states  pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels . This plan serves the best interests of vulnerable countries. But the climate finance conundrum dragged the ambition down to earth at COP22, with the name  Donald Trump contributing to the process. Noticeably, the landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the east. China was widely expected to play a leading role at COP22, an expectation reinforced by the pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump\' s election.

However, the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) in many ways is also a painful reminder that 197 countries have ratified a convention enforced after the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 only now.""For twenty-two years, then, the world's leading authorities and politicians have fundamentally agreed on the problems of global climate change and have held endless consultations and high-level conversations on something that requires practical measures and tangible action. Twenty-two years, however, is an unacceptably long period to respond to the environmental crisis, especially when we are conscious of its intimate and inseparable connections to global poverty, migration and unrest"", stated Bartholomew I.After 22 years, it is finally time - and long overdue - for all of us to discern the human faces impacted by our ecological sins, noted Bartholomew I, for it is human beings - all of us, but especially the ""least"" and the most vulnerable or marginalized among us - who are irreversibly impacted. ""How, then, can any nation justify the suffering of its people? How can any industry defend the exploitation of its customer? Unless we all perceive in our attitudes and actions, as in our deliberations and decisions, the faces of our own children - in the present and in future generations - then we shall continue to prolong and procrastinate the development of any solution"".In a message delivered to the UNFCCC on 16 November, Bartholomew I wrote: ""What price are we prepared to pay for profit? Or how many lives are we willing to sacrifice for material or financial gain? And at what cost would we forfeit or forestall the survival of God's creation? It is our humble, yet bold prayer that all parties at the COP22 will recognize and respond to the high stakes involved in climate change.""The statement of Bartholomew I was received by James Grabert, UNFCCC Sustainable Development Mechanisms coordinator. Although the Paris agreement provides the blueprint for national contributions and the tools for international support and cooperation, all of us have the opportunity to take action, said Grabert.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA259","SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE JONATHAN PERSHING ON THE OPENING OF THE COP-22 CLIMATE CONFERENCE","November 7, 2016 Monday 12:30 PM  EST","US Fed News","WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 -- The U.S. Department of State issued the following press release:MR TONER: Hey folks. Happy Monday. Just as a precursor, or at the top of briefing, we thought it would be useful, since today marks the start of COP-22 in Marrakesh, Morocco, if we had our special envoy for climate change come and brief you on some of the expectations for that conference. Jonathan Pershing is with us today, and he'll be able to give you, as I said, an overview of the conference and then answer a couple questions.With that, Jonathan. Thanks.MR PERSHING: Thanks. Thanks very much, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks to everyone.So 2016 is really an historic year on the climate change issue, on the climate change front. Over the past few months alone, we've seen a number of major events that have occurred. First and foremost, the Paris Agreement itself entered into force. The technical date of entry into force was on Friday, just past Friday. That was 30 days after 55 countries and at least - representing at least 55 percent of global emissions had signed onto the deal, had joined the agreement. By the way, since the 55 threshold was met, we're now just over 100 countries. So it's really continuing to grow quite rapidly.But at the same time, over the course of the year, we've had a number of other major agreements. We agreed in Montreal on an agreement on civil aviation, for the first time in history capturing some of the emissions from international civil aviation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. And the second is an agreement that was reached in Kigali in Rwanda, also in October, in which we've agreed to phase down substances called hydrofluorocarbons, which also are major greenhouse gases, and look for substitutes that replace those.So the meeting starts today. It's actually just begun in Marrakesh, Morocco. So we're seeing significant movement on that front. And it's much smaller than Paris. About 15,000 representatives will be in attendance, compared to almost 50,000 in Paris. But it's got a couple of large-scale activities that are going to be undertaken.The first bucket is actually taking cognizance of and moving forward politically based on these political agreements - the entry into force in Morocco, the Kigali agreement on Montreal Protocol gases, and ICAO. There's a huge political momentum; entry into force now really shapes the agreement and the structure.The second is the movement and aggressive acceleration of the timetable on the detailed development of rules and regulations and guidance that come out of the Paris Agreement. We'd originally thought those would really be postponed for some time; there was going to be a five- or a six-year process. The very rapid entry into force has changed the dynamic, and we now anticipate we'll have those concluded by 2018. So a very rapid acceleration of the work, of the technical guidance and detail.And the third is this is a Conference of the Parties around implementation. We finished the big framing of the negotiation in Paris; now it's the implementation agenda. And we'll have experts, including our secretary of energy who will be there, but experts from across multiple sectors, agriculture, forestry, people who deal with water - the impacts of climate change as well as ways to reduce emissions that cause climate change. And that elevation will be a chance for CEOs, for ministers, for academics to all elevate and frame what we can do and to move from this negotiating phase into an operational phase.And that's going to occupy us for some time, and we should be very clear the risks and damages of climate have become more apparent in the last year as well. And this is going to be a race as we try to work on the problem and solve the problem before those damages become so significant that we can't do so so easily anymore. So this is a major shift in where we've been, moving from these negotiating rounds into an implementation round.So with that, happy to take questions that people might have around what's going to happen and where we stand.MR TONER: Go ahead.QUESTION: We were on a background call with some officials last week about COP-22, and there was some discussion, I think, about zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2050 as a goal. I'm just wondering where that comes from. Is this something the United States is looking to do multilaterally, or take the lead on that particular issue?MR PERSHING: Okay, thanks very much. No, there is no formal goal for 2050. What there is though is an agreement that's contained in the Paris - the Paris Agreement itself that calls for countries to develop what are called mid-century strategies. The United States is working on ours. We are hoping to conclude it and complete it before the end of the year. And in that, we will be looking at a variety of scenarios where we can do significant global and U.S. reductions in emissions. It's not around a particular target number; it's around trajectories. How can you do these radical reductions? The President has indicated that we would at least be working to an 80 percent reduction by the year 2050.QUESTION: So where does zero carbon (inaudible)?QUESTION: Okay, okay.MR TONER: Any more questions? Have we exhausted you already? (Laughter.) Okay.MR PERSHING: Thanks.MR TONER: Thanks so much, Jonathan. Appreciate it. Take care.

After approximately two weeks of negotiations and meetings, the conference culminated in 195 countries adopting the first legally binding and universal agreement on slowing global warming.The agreement, which comes into force in 2020, establishes an international action plan for avoiding dire climate change by limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, according to the European Commission.Prominent among the Dartmouth participants in the conference, also known as COP21, was U.S. State Department's special envoy for climate change Todd Stern '73, the lead negotiator for the U.S. delegation.Morgan Curtis '14 and Leehi Yona '16 both attended COP21 representing SustainUS, a youth-led delegation advocating for justice and sustainability in United Nations meetings on sustainable development, climate change, eradicating poverty, biodiversity loss and women's rights.As a youth delegate and a Dartmouth senior fellow, Yona followed the negotiations at the conference, conducted interviews of delegates and academics attending the conference, participated in symbolic protests and wrote opinion pieces, she said.Before arriving in Paris, Curtis spent the five months before the conference cycling and gathering stories in eleven countries on a Climate Journey project. She focused on grassroots mobilization in climate action and gathering the stories of people who have made the transition from individual to collective action for the climate.Curtis recalled her two weeks at the conference as the ""most stimulating, difficult and transformative"" of her life.A group of students from the Tuck School of Business also attended COP21 as observers.Corporations are both the problem and solution to climate change as they are the biggest contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases, Sundaram said. He added that the industry will have to do a lot of the research and development that goes into developing these clean energy technologies to solve the climate change problem.Patrick Turevon Tu'16, observed many of the ""behind the scenes negotiations"" and attended the various panels and lectures held throughout the second week of the conference.""I tried to attend a lot of the business lectures on building a clean energy market and investing in clean energy,"" Turevon said.Sundaram said he finds it important for his business students to see how global negotiations and consensus building processes work or do not work.The main objective of this annual conference is to review and revise the implementation of the Rio Convention, which in 1992, established a framework for action aimed at stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.Although delegates and leaders from countries meet annually, an agreement is not reached every year, environmental studies professor and Union of Concerned Scientists delegate at COP21 Anne Kapuscinski said.""This [conference] was really important because the international agreement that these nations are currently operating from was the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020,"" Kapuscinski said. ""Countries have been hard at work for the past 20 years to negotiate a new agreement and it was understood and agreed upon that at this meeting, they were going to try to reach a new agreement for the global community.""The countries at this conference took a more cooperative approach in Paris. States agreed to individually reduce their carbon emissions to a specific target rate and mutually enforce and coerce each other into continuing to lower their emission numbers in the future, Kapuscinski said.Before and during COP21, countries submitted individual comprehensive national climate action plans to reduce carbon emissions. The long-term goal of the plans was to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. The governments also agreed to track each country's commitment through an extensive transparency and accountability system.The COP21 agreement will not be implemented until 2020 and the monitoring and verification mechanisms to see if countries are abiding by their commitment will not be in place until 2023, Sundaram said.Although the agreement is a step forward, Sundaram said he is less optimistic about its timel"

Volunteerism allows communities affected by urban policies and practices to participate in the planning and implementation of urban projects, and volunteers can play a key role in bringing together local authorities and community actors.In this context, during a side event organized by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme at Habitat III, a panel of experts in urban planning and volunteerism has discussed the idea of localizing the New Urban Agenda while promoting local capacity through volunteerism in intermediate cities. Volunteerism can contribute to local governance and the implementation of the New Urban Agenda with an inclusive and sustainable participatory focus.The organization of Habitat III has been supported by over 700 volunteers trained by UN Volunteers through a youth volunteering programme by UNV and the Habitat III Secretariat. The programme goes beyond logistical support and includes the involvement of young people in the socialization of the New Urban Agenda.This initiative stems from UNV's previous experience organizing large United Nations events in Peru the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2014, and the Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund in 2015.Quito, Ecuador\l"

Parliament is represented at the talks by a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via.At the COP21 climate talks last December, 195 countries adopted the Paris agreement on climate change. The world's first universally binding climate deal, it sets out a global plan on how to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. The deal entered into force earlier this month after the European Parliament gave its consent to the EU's ratification.This week a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Giovanni La Via, chair of Parliament's environment committee, takes part in the conference in Marrakesh. Miguel Arias Canete, the European commissioner responsible for climate action, will brief the delegation on a daily basis. MEPs will also engage in talks with NGOs, industry and delegations from various countries.COP22: 'COP OF ACTION'The focus of this week's round of talks will be on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Delegates will work on making national climate plans as clear and transparent as possible, and on ensuring that the actions taken are traceable and that standardised reporting methods are used. There will also be discussions on enhanced action prior to 2020.As part of the Paris agreement developed countries promised to mobilise at least $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Aiming to deliver on the commitments made, the negotiations in Marrakesh will revolve around who should pay into these funds and how they should be used.

State actors and policymakers will likely face challenges after U.S. shale production subsides and oil prices increase, he said. Tanaka also addressed climate change and said significant political motivation will be required to maintain carbon dioxide emissions within reasonable limits. In 2007, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrote that a rise in global mean temperature of more than two degree Celsius by the end of the century ""poses significant risks to many unique and threatened systems.""""The [International Energy Agency] believes that, despite the [2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference], CO2 emissions will continue to grow,"" Tanaka said. ""To make it to the two degree Celsius trajectory, you have to really reduce CO2 emissions with different technologies.""These changes would be costly, according to Tanaka, and would require sufficient political mobilization in order to invest in a more diverse ""energy mix,"" including renewable and nuclear energy. The influence of large carbon producers is particularly important in combatting this issue, Tanaka added.""If China starts getting serious about combatting climate change, then other countries will follow,"" he said.Read more in University News Medical School Students Challenge Harvard HUDS Health Care Proposals\l"

This is Nicole Deaner with the State Department Press Office. Thanks for joining us today to discuss COP22, which as you know, starts next week in Marrakesh and will be the first such meeting since the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. We're pleased to have on the call today Dr. Jonathan Pershing, the special envoy for climate change at the State Department, as well as John Morton, director for energy and climate change for the National Security Council. They will both give brief remarks, and then we will go to your questions.As a reminder, today's call is considered on the record.With that, I'll turn it over to Director Morton.MR MORTON: Hi, good morning, folks. This is John Morton speaking. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. I'm just going to begin with some very top-level kind of framing remarks and then turn it over to Jonathan to discuss more of the specifics of the -- of our preparation for the COP.So I think it's fair to say that we are all really looking forward to the COP, which, as you know, begins next week. We're coming into this year's COP with a tremendous amount of positive momentum. Reaching the Paris Agreement in December of last year was clearly a watershed moment for the international community and one that was appropriately reported in that way. But frankly, by all measures, this year, 2016, has been a truly historic year for international climate action. We have seen in the last two months alone the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement, much, much faster, years faster, than most people expected. And with that entry into force, that puts us on a much accelerated path toward implementation of the goals that we laid out in Paris a year ago.We have secured an ambitious amendment, as you know, to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and use of HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, a group of the extremely potent greenhouse gases, which by some accounts, that agreement will -- puts us on a path to avoiding up to a full half a degree centigrade of warming. And subsequently to that, we achieved adoption of a global market-based measure to set international aviation on a path to sustainable and carbon-neutral growth. And international aviation, as you may know, is one of the fastest growing segments of greenhouse gas emissions.So in the last couple months alone, due to the really kind of concerted work of this Administration and the president himself and many others throughout the international community, we've set the tone for coming into Paris in a -- coming into Marrakesh, excuse me, in a very, very positive light.So as we look forward to the two weeks ahead, we see COP22 is really a COP of implementation and action. So the Paris Agreement was a turning point in terms of setting in place a framework, an international framework for action. And in the COP that is approaching, we intend to really intensify our work in turning toward implementation.So we are -- in many ways we're at an unprecedented stage in climate negotiations because we finally have a framework for implementation that applies to all countries. Getting to this point required really eight years of consistent attention from the President, from -- beginning back in Copenhagen and driving through the entry into force of the Paris Agreement at unprecedented speed. And we think it's very fitting for the Administration's final COP to be one which is focusing -- turning its attention from negotiations to implementation. And I'm sure Jonathan will have more to say about what exactly that looks like.So I just wanted to frame the kind of how we got here over the last year, say that we're really looking forward to the two weeks ahead. And as we shift from negotiations to implementation, that will be the primary focus of our participation at COP this year.So with that, over to Jonathan.MR PERSHING: Thanks very much. This is Jonathan Pershing. Thanks all for joining us. I'll make just a few brief comments; we'll turn to questions.The first point is just to emphasize John's comment: This is now increasingly getting into an implementation agenda. The Moroccans themselves are calling this a COP of action. An action agenda is therefore one of the big things that they've got. That's going to feature work by businesses, by cities, by states and civil society, either themselves or in partnership with others on a variety of topics. So they've got an energy discussion, an agriculture discussion, an oceans discussion, a cities discussion, a whole variety of these, that really begin to elevate the implementation side.The second is there's going to be a series of discussions around the details and the negotiation of specific advancing -- as John noted, it's a framework a little bit in Paris in some components. This is the start now of the detailed implementation agenda. Guidel"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA279","COP22 Press Briefing with Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing","November 14, 2016 Monday 7:55 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The U.S. Department of State issued the following special briefing:Moderator: Good afternoon. Welcome. Thank you for joining us today with this press briefing with the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Dr. Jonathan Pershing. At the outset, Dr. Pershing will give a few opening remarks. Then we will open it up to questions. In the interest of trying to get as many questions heard as we can, we will take rounds of three, which Dr. Pershing will then answer. We have roving mics. When you ask a question, we ask that you please wait until you receive a mic, stand, and identify yourself and your outlet. We're only taking questions from the press today at this briefing. And we... there's a potential possibility that we will have another briefing later in the week so stay tuned for that. I will now turn it over to Dr. Pershing. Thank you.Dr. Pershing: Thanks very much Emily. And thank you all for joining. As you know President Obama and our Administration have made climate change a top priority, and we have made significant strides to cut carbon pollution at home, to help bolster our resilience to the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to combat this global challenge.The continued global momentum we have seen since Paris has been reflected in the successes of the last several weeks, including most particularly the Paris Agreement passing the thresholds needed to enter into force.Here, in the context of the climate talks, we've begun the transition away from negotiation and toward implementation. Our Moroccan hosts have really been excellent throughout, and we look forward to working with them going forward. The U.S. team has spent the last week in a series of consultations and informal meetings to determine the shape of various working groups and initiatives launched by the Paris Agreement. We've made real progress in many of them, although some dialogues and contact groups are expected to continue this week before concluding.We've been focused in particular here on the work to flesh out the transparency system, which is the bedrock of this agreement. Further, discussions on adaptation communications have helpfully focused on the guidance that will build on the extensive work of the adaptation committee. Conversations on the global stock-take have also been very productive. Parties have shared a range of views, but all are converging on a process grounded in robust scientific inputs from the IPCC. We're also tremendously excited this week to launch the first CMA under the Paris Agreement - namely, the first meeting of parties who have joined the Agreement.As you're also likely aware, we have a high-level delegation from the U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz has been here on the ground doing work on clean energy deployment and our Mission Innovation initiative. Secretary Kerry will join us tomorrow and Wednesday to hold a series of bilateral meetings and will deliver a speech that highlights the urgency of addressing climate change and the importance of continued ambitious climate action around the world.Furthermore, as we all know, soon we will see a transition to a new presidential administration in the United States. In the coming weeks, we expect personnel from the transition team to arrive at the State Department and begin planning the shape and thrust of American diplomacy for the next four years. At this time, I do not have information about when that process will start or who will play a role in it, and I cannot speak for President-elect's team, or to their outlook on international climate policy.What I do know, however, is the power of the movement and the enormous momentum created in Paris and built throughout the year since. Parties are deeply invested in seeing this work bear real fruit. With the Agreement having entered into force, it is no longer a question of whether to accelerate the Agreement's implementation - but rather a question of when and how.The Paris Agreement protects economic growth and the environment - all while providing nationally-determined flexibility to accommodate differing circumstances. It is durable. It is inclusive. It is ambitious.I also want to note we need new action going forward. We need to find strategies that protect our economic development while decarbonizing our system. We will release our strategy on Wednesday to suggest some sense of the trajectories that address this goal.I will finish by noting that it was a global effort that made the Agreement possible. And the passion and the dedication that drove it is in evidence throughout COP22. Heads of state can and will change, but I am confident that we can and we will sustain a durable international effort to counter climate change.I look forward to your questions. Thank you.Question: Thank you very much, sir. My name is Wardarif. I'm Bureau Chief of the Moroccan News Wire based in Washington. As you know sir, there are numerous press reports according to which President-elect Trump is seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from a global agreement regarding the combat against climate change. What credence can we give to these reports and what should be the international community be expecting?Question: Dean Scott. Hi, Jonathan. Dean Scott, Bloomberg BNA. My question is somewhat relevant in terms of what targeting the UNFCCC would do in terms of the U.S. continuing to maintain a seat at the table for a myriad of issues that go well beyond climate, more than two decades after the UNFCCC was agreed to.Question: Hi, this is Crystal Sun working for Phoenix New Media, which is a news website in China. Mr. Pershing, you've only been on this job for seven months, do you think you can lose this job in the following two months?Dr. Pershing: Thank you so much. The last one is actually the easiest one to answer. So thank you very much. As many of you may not know, the U.S. process is one in which the President appoints a series of individuals who serve in his administration or her administration. I was appointed by the President and my term, in any event, independent of the outcome of the election would end on January 20. So it's independent of the outcome here. So yes, I will end then.With regard to the first question, I don't really have any good insight for you. We are not yet in touch with the transition team. As I noted, they have not yet been named for our agency. We're waiting to talk with them. I anticipate that will happen soon after I return to Washington. But in the absence of that, we don't have any information to offer about our expectations for them. They haven't been in touch with us.With regard to the second question on the outcome of the finance -- the UNFCCC. Are there issues beyond climate? Of course there are. This is deeply tied in a broad way, climate deeply tied in a broad way to the issues of sustainable development. And as we think about what that means, if we don't avoid some of the damages and some of the risks, there are consequences to our economies. If we see them in every part of our system. If I look only at the United States, there's now substantially increased likelihood, because of climate change, that we will see flooding such as that that affected Louisiana only a couple of months ago. We see an increased likelihood that a storm like Superstorm Sandy, which came through New York, will be more significant and more frequent. We see in the American Southwest and in California an increase in drought. That also seems increasingly tied to the change in climate. So for me it's not so much the individual institutions, it's the question of the damages that we're trying to avoid. It's a question of how we collectively, as a global community, take these next steps. And I believe the U.S. economic community, the business community, state and local government communities, civil society will move in this direction. And I think that's going to be an imperative for all of us as we take this next years and next decade of action.Question: Thanks very much. Jessica Shankleman from Bloomberg News. There's a high level meeting on climate and finance on Wednesday. Oxfam says the G77 wants adaptation finance quadrupled. There's a lot of talk about the 100 billion dollar roadmap. Can these climate finance targets be met if the U.S. withdraws its climate finance funding as the President-elect has said he will do and if so, how?Question: Thank you. Karl Ritter from AP. I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about what kind of concerns you are encountering from partner countries in these negotiations in relation to the change of administration in the United States. And also, if you could comment on what withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would mean for the special relationship that the Obama administration developed with China on climate change.Question: Pilita Clark, Financial Times. Just following on from Carl's question, Nicholas Sarkozy said on the weekend that he believed that if Trump did actually pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement then the EU should offer and should look at a carbon border tax. I wonder if you've picked up any similar comments was you've been talking to other countries at this meeting. And also, there's obviously been a huge amount of speculation on how the U.S. could actually withdraw from the agreement. You probably know more than anyone else in the room about the mechanics of that. I just wonder if you could go through how quickly this could indeed occur if you were, for example, to withdraw from the Convention or if it goes to a House vote or perhaps another option.Dr. Pershing: So thank you very much. With regard to the first question on finance, my thinking has been that the U.S. has historically managed to pay its interests and commitments in these activities. I'm struck in that sense by the Bush Administration which agreed on a financial fund for technology, which we took a little longer to pay off but did in fact pay off. That was the Bush Administration moving forward. My personal view around this is that we will continue to meet our commitments. But I note that perhaps more important than that is the need to leverage private sector investment. The U.S. contribution to the Green Climate Fund over the years that we have pledged is about $3 billion dollars. If we come a little short of that, it will have only a marginal effect on the $100 billion. What I do know is that the leverage that we need has to increase. And the leverage that's already in this system is much smaller than what we think we can achieve. If we look at our effective financial institutions, they tend to leverage risk on the order of five or ten times for every dollar spent. The current structure leverages less than one dollar for every dollar spent. We can do better. And to me, we are very close already. We're close to the $100 billion already. The expectation we can exceed that easily with additional leverage is very high.The second comment. With regard to the negotiation and the election and what the relationship with China will be. I've had the chance to meet with the senior representative here from China and he has indicated as he has in the press (and you have seen his comments) that China intends to move forward. It doesn't surprise me. Frankly, the deal, the agreement was struck on the basis of national circumstances and agreements by nations of activities in their interest. Of course, they're going to move forward. These are things you would do because they are part of your development trajectory. I'm hearing the same from the Europeans. I'm hearing the same from the Brazilians. I'm hearing the same from Mexico and from Canada and from smaller nations like Costa Rica and from Colombia. I don't think the U.S. change here is going to affect the development pathway. I think people take the issue, as they ought to, as a serious problem. And, they are moving.With regard to the last question as to what the mechanics are, it's actually quite variable, unclear. I don't really want to speculate on what the new guys would do, but in every agreement there are provisions for how a person or a country might withdraw from it. And there are the same in this one. It takes a fair amount of time under the Paris Agreement. The process requires first a three-year waiting period and then a year between notification and action. That's the Paris Agreement process. But, I also note that there's flexibility for a country. And the new administration may decide to take advantage of some of that flexibility in its action. But it's premature to speculate. The new administration may look at the commitment globally, at the interest globally in the issue and may decide to move forward that are consistent with its own polities. We'll have to wait and see.Question: This is Lucia Graves with Pacific Standard Magazine. You mentioned that are some areas of flexibility with regard to the agreement. In general we're transitioning away from negotiation to implementation, as you said, are there any areas, where with the new administration possibly being less accepting of the Accord, you might have room for flexibility to negotiate? My name is Lucia Graves. I'm with Pacific Standard Magazine.Question: Alex Carlin from PR Watch. Addressing the transition, when the new guys come in and you're in a meeting with those people, we have a new situation that is unprecedented. Their policy is not an adult rational policy based on math or science, its something else. Dealing with an existential problem for the planet, you have two questions: can you appeal to them on a basic, rational level, in other words, educate them, number one. Can you set up any kind of symposiums where you educate them that two plus two is four and not five. And second, can you demonstrate to them that if they continue with this childish position, we, America, will lose our status, we will become a pariah state, we will be humiliated. Can you appeal to these people in your unique situation where you are going to be in a one-on-one meeting with the new team? We need people like you to do that. I just have a question on whether you have thoughts on that transition.Question: Vanya Walker-Leigh, Malta Business Weekly. Apologies for the cold. The UNEP gap report issued a few days ago once again urged the importance of not only post 2020 emission reductions on a much larger scale than is on the table now, but pre-2020 reductions. Do you think the COP22 should come out with a formal decision to review and increase the cap pledges and the set the commitment period commitments.Dr. Pershing: Thank you very much for these questions. With regard to the first one, the flexibility that exists in the Agreement is fairly broad around nationally determined contributions and countries are able to turn those indicative, intended NDCs into NDCs. There's also flexibility about how a country implements it. We did not choose, in the Paris Agreement, to say what policies you had to adopt. Instead, we asked each country to identify its approach, and to act accordingly. So there's a lot of flexibility available to nations in their determinations.With regard to the second question, we look forward to talking to the transition community. They haven't been named yet. We don't know who they are. We don't know their backgrounds. We will certainly work to convey the importance that we find in this issue to them as they move forward.With regard to the third question on the UNEP gap report, we recognize the urgency of additional aggressive action. And if you come on Wednesday you will have a chance to hear a presentation where we will relay some of our own insights on trajectories and opportunities for the long term goal that may include activities that we begin immediately and some that might wait for new technology, that may include programs at a state and local level as well as things that might be done nationally and that might be in collaboration with others.Question: Hello sir. My name is Claus Hecking. I work for Die Zeit, Germany's biggest weekly magazine. One question about the renewables. Are they economically competitive already in all parts of the U.S. or do they still need the support of the government such as the tax credits Mr. Trump wants to abolish?Question: Marlow Hood, with Agence France-Presse. Can you imagine a political argument that might be convincing to Mr. Trump as to why he should stay in the Paris Agreement and adhere to its terms? Question: Elaine Mills from Argus Media. Mr. Pershing, just a follow up to a previous question. What do you think the likelihood that if the Trump administration pulls out of the Paris deal that countries like China and the EU could introduce a carbon border tax and how is the U.S. likely to react do you think? Thank you.Dr. Pershing: Thank you very much. With regard to the cost of renewables, it depends a little bit on the circumstances in which they are being installed. We have a number of cases where you are not connected as easily to the grid or the grid capacity is more constrained, in those cases it is already commercially and economically cost effective. However, we also note that it is a Republican Congress that chose to undertake the tax credits and I would assume that they will continue. In that context, with those in the next five years I think that the price will continue to come down. And if we look at the market, the market is betting that will happen because the value of stocks goes up in the expectation of increasing returns on the investment. As I look forward this past year for economic reasons, we'll have more investment in renewables than we did in carbon based fuels.On the AFP question, with regard to the political argument for Mr. Trump, I really can't speculate. I don't have a sense of how the transition team will play out or what things he will find persuasive.In regards to the Argus question on the institutions and the response in terms of a European border tax, I don't know there as well.

With help from avant-electronica producers Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke, she presents goosebumps-inducing protest music for an era marked by drone bomb strikes and global climate change.Hopelessness as a whole picks up where previous songs of dissent left off. ANOHNI employs Bob Dylan's lyrical stylings as demonstrated on his 1963 ballad ""A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall"" and adopts the dancing-while-marching vibe of John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band's 1969 rally chant ""Give Peace a Chance."" Vocally, she channels Nina Simone's mournful rendition of Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit.""You might remember when Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke discussed politics and music in an interview with fellow environmental activist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot last Fall, just before debuting two new politically charged songs at the Pathway to Paris concert held in conjunction with the United Nations in December. In the interview that was published by French magazine Telerama, he said: ""In the '60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. ... It's much harder to do that now.""Yorke has written his fair share of songs calling out the global climate change crisis, including the entirety of his 2006 solo album The Eraser, yet he insisted in that interview: ""If I was going to write a protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It's not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone's mind.""Mere weeks later, ANOHNI shared ""4 Degrees,"" the first single off Hopelessness and the first song released under the singer's new moniker. The driving electronica track seems like the perfect response to Yorke's suggestion that the protest song as a call to arms might be dead.""4 Degrees"" doesn't outwardly condemn corporate polluters or pro-fracking politicians; the song doesn't advise listeners to boycott anything or vote for anyone. Instead, the singer chooses to revel in the horror of total environmental destruction to the point of ecocide, and invites the listener to simply look the reality of global climate change in the eye.The song cites recent studies that suggest the planet's temperature is on track to rise 4 degrees by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions from human activity continue at their current rate; that increase of global temperature will lead to mass extinction of various species. 2016 Legal Monitor Worldwide.\l"

Only $500 million of that pledge has been disbursed so far.""That could be worrisome, as that money was never approved through the U.S. Congress and we now have a president who is unwilling to put that type of money out there,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, the chief negotiator for Congo and chairman of a group of least developed countries.The Green Climate Fund pledges are part of a wider effort by rich countries to mobilize $100 billion annually for poor countries, announced by Clinton in 2009 when she was U.S. secretary of state. The plan calls for scaling up financing to that level by 2020. So far rich countries say they're about two-thirds there, though many developing countries challenge that assessment.Climate activists are calling on rich countries to raise their contributions, fearing that withdrawing U.S. funds could have a domino effect.""The U.S. is supposed to be the leader in raising this $100 billion,"" said Lidy Nacpil of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice. ""So if the U.S. is not going to give, why will the other countries give?""Trump told an oil industry conference in North Dakota in May that he would ""cancel"" last year's landmark Paris Agreement on climate change ""and stop all payments of the United States tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.""To formulate his energy policy, Trump has chosen Myron Ebell, who believes an alarmist, overzealous environmental movement has used global warming as a pretext for expanding government. Ebell backs opening up more federal lands for logging, oil and gas exploration and coal mining, and he has urged the Senate to vote to reject the Paris climate accord.Many negotiators in Morocco hoped Trump didn't really mean what he said when he voiced opposition to the climate accord.""There will be a distinction between campaign policies and real policies,"" Chinese negotiator Gu Zihua said. ""We should still wait and see what kind of measures the U.S. will take on climate change.""Mpanu Mpanu said a U.S. withdrawal would ""hinder"" but not stop the effort to raise climate money for developing countries.""Instead of us being in the elevator bringing us to the next floor, we may have to take the stairs,"" he said. ""But we will still get there.""'WE NEED  A MOVEMENT'Meanwhile, in Antarctica Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that citizens who care about limiting emissions might have to march in the streets to push for more aggressive action.Kerry became the highest-ranking American official to visit Antarctica when he landed for a two-day trip.

These childhood deaths occur despite the fact that both illnesses are largely preventable through straightforward and cost effective solutions like exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, quality primary healthcare and reducing household air pollution. These findings are included in a new UNICEF report 'One is Too Many: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea' released today. Pneumonia in particular remains the leading infectious killer of children under five, claiming the lives of nearly a million children in 2015 approximately one child every 35 seconds, and more than malaria, TB, measles, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all childhood pneumonia deaths are linked to air pollution, a fact UNICEF said world leaders should keep in mind during ongoing climate change talks at COP22. ""We have seen clearly that air pollution linked to climate change is damaging the health and development of children by causing pneumonia and other respiratory infections,"" said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Fatoumata Ndiaye.

Designed by UN Environment, the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism, Michelin and the Moroccan non-profit Association Mawarid for Environment and Energy, the map marks out hotels with the Cl\'e9 Verte (or  Green Key ) environmental label, green restaurants, spas and hammams that use natural local products, and over nine traditional craft shops. Of course, the Passeport Vert, or Green Passport, also includes the city\' s main attractions, alongside recommendations for reducing your carbon footprint such as cycle hire and bus routes. These recommendations will also be shared on social media as actions tourists can take to travel responsibly and walk with light footsteps in the city. The Green Passport has been making an appearance at major events and tourist destinations since 2008. Most recently, it was part of initiatives by UN Environment to green the footprint of the 2014 Football World Cup in Brazil, 2016 Rio Olympic Games, Rio+20 environmental conference, the Paris Conference on Climate Change and 2010 Football World Cup in South Africa. The idea behind the Passport is to support cities to educate and inform tourists who often use three times more water than residents in a city to help them reduce their carbon footprint. Activities have included training the hospitality industry, administering sustainability labels for gastronomy, and awareness and education campaigns specific to tourists and the industry that seek to reduce tourism\' s contribution of more than 5 per cent of the world\' s global emissions.  UN Environment\' s Green Passport provides tourists with the knowledge they need to be responsible travellers. Cities and the hospitality industry are critical partners for sustainable tourism and we\' re delighted to see the Green Passport land in Marrakech, said Nays\'e1n Sahba, Director of Communications, UN Environment. During the Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games, for example, UN Environment worked with Airbnb and shared Green Passport materials with over 100,000 travellers to Rio, posted social media content on its channels, organized and participated in green activities with their hosts and gave reusable bags to more than 2,000 tourists. The partnership has been extended for two more years. The tips offered in the Green Passport aim to change the behaviour of the one billion tourists that travel internationally every year, essentially aligning them better with the vision of sustainable development developed by countries last year through a set of agreements. Achieving sustainable tourism, for example, features explicitly in targets under at least three of the Sustainable Development Goals, pertaining to climate change, resource efficiency and the use and care of marine resources.

Mars combined this call to action with an announcement of plans for a wind farm in Mexico-its third major wind energy commitment in as many years.Mars has an ambition to eliminate all fossil fuel use from its operations by 2040. Today the company is urging business and global leaders to do the same by setting ambitious goals that go beyond the national targets agreed at COP21.Barry Parkin, Mars, Incorporated's Chief Sustainability & Health and Wellbeing Officer, commented: ""This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society. It is imperative that global businesses, like Mars, do their part to face down those threats.""Mars' new wind farm in Mexico is the latest in a series of major renewable electricity projects. In just over a year, Mars has announced three new wind projects across three continents:In 2015, Mars opened its 118-turbine wind farm at Mesquite Creek, Texas. The wind farm now generates the equivalent of 100% of the electricity needed to power the entirety of the Mars U.S. operations.In 2016, Mars announced a partnership with Eneco to activate a 20-turbine wind farm in Scotland that is providing electricity from renewable sources equal to what's required to power all of its U.K. operations.In 2017, Mars will activate its new wind farm partnership with Vive Energia and Envision to provide the equivalent of 100% of the electricity required to power its five plants in Mexico-located in Quer\'e9taro, Nuevo Le\'f3n and Jalisco. This project is expected to drive a greenhouse gas reduction of over 25,000 tonnes of CO2-e.Damian Ryan, Acting CEO of The Climate Group said:\~""It's fantastic to see Mars progressing internationally-this latest announcement is another piece in the jigsaw for achieving its goal of 100% renewable energy globally by 2040. The move will also help to develop a growing renewables market in Mexico. It sends a clear signal of support to the Yucatan government that demand for renewables is rising, and that there's an alternative to using polluting fossil fuels in this environmentally sensitive area.""At COP21 in Paris, Mars joined the chief executives of the world's leading food companies to publish an open letter to global leaders pledging individual and collaborative action on climate change and urging governments to forge clear international agreements at the meeting. Also last year, Mars signed on to the American Business Act on Climate, led by the White House. The Act is a commitment to climate action that aims to rally business, government, academic, technical and scientific communities to tackle climate change in the U.S. and on a global scale.Mars' commitments are underpinned by the science-based goals that steer all of its sustainability programs-including achieving zero waste to landfill across all its sites by 2015, and eliminating 100% of GHG emissions from all global operations by 2040.For more information on Mars Incorporated's sustainability programs and wind energy projects, visitMars.com.About Mars, Incorporated:Mars, Incorporated is a private, family-owned business with more than a century of history and some of the best-loved brands in the world.

Research topics in the collection includeReservoir response and plume evolution.Fluid migration through leakage pathways.Groundwater impacts.Atmospheric leakage.System integrated assessment.Strategic monitoring.Ground motion/induced seismicity.NRAP brings together scientists and engineers from across the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory complex to improve understanding of environmental risk performance of geologic CO2 storage. Led by the Office of Fossil Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, NRAP also includes members from the National Nuclear Security Administration (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory) and the Office of Science (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory). The partnership applies DOE's unique core capabilities in the science-based prediction of critical behaviors of engineered-geologic systems.Release of the IJCC special issue coincides with the completion of NRAP's first phase of research, which has resulted in the generation of first-of-kind scientific data, methodologies, and simulation tools to support quantitative assessment of environmental risks associated with industrial-scale GCS. Potential risks include impact to groundwater resources, leakage to the atmosphere, and induced seismic activity. Developing credible, science-based, characterization of those risks is key to overcoming barriers to the technology's wide-scale commercial deployment. Successful deployment of carbon-capture and -storage technology will play a critical role in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion and cost-effectively meeting the goals set in COP21, the 2015 United Nations .NRAP is now transitioning into a second phase, in which the risk-assessment methodologies and tools developed during phase 1 will be applied to real-world CO2 storage sites, and new tools and findings will be generated to help effectively manage carbon-storage operations. A significant focus will be how to strategically monitor a geologic system to reduce uncertainty in its performance and build confidence that CO2 is effectively and safely stored.For more information about NRAP, please visit the NRAP website.\l"

At the Conference, Governments, many represented at the highest level, issued the Marrakech Action Proclamation. This, as well as decisions adopted in Marrakech, powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all Governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible. The Secretary-General notes that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In Marrakech, parties advanced on the rule book for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The agreement entered into force on 4 November, years ahead of expectations. As of today, 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, have ratified the agreement. The Secretary-General applauds the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible towards a 100 per cent clean energy, climate-resilient future. As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. He also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries.

Brown Jr., D-Calif., issued the following news release: California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., Oregon Governor Kate Brown, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and British Columbia Premier Christy Clark today issued the following statement on the final day of the United Nations Climate Conference in Marrakech, Morocco ( COP22 ): COP22 comes to a close - two weeks after the Paris Agreement came into force - leaders from across the globe have renewed their commitment to climate action. In California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia - from the Mexican border to the edge of the Yukon Territory - we stand with the international community. Our success demonstrates that taking action on climate change goes hand-in-hand with robust job creation and a thriving clean energy economy. We know what's at stake because we have seen the destruction firsthand - from year-round wildfires and historic drought to devastating sea-level rise. These impacts don't respect borders or wait for the next election. California's Leadership on Climate Change California is playing a world-leading role in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants. Last year, California and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany formed the Under2 Coalition - an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. With the addition of 29 new members earlier this week following a signing ceremony at COP22 , a total of 165 jurisdictions have joined the coalition representing more than a billion people and $25.7 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy. In September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. Over the past year and a half, the Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations.

Lilly Berkley, University Communications Remy Franklin, a master's student in the University of Arizona's School of Geography and Development, was among a delegation of 13 young climate justice leaders to travel to Morocco to participate in this month's United Nations Climate Change Conference . The conference, called COP22 and held in Marrakech, was organized for this year's round of United Nations negotiations on climate change. The talks came one year after a historic agreement was reached in Paris at COP21, and many questions remained about how the goals laid out in Paris would be reached. ""Joining SustainUS at COP22 was an incredible opportunity to act on climate change through a combination of policy tracking, research and creative protest,"" said Franklin, whose travel was partly funded by a grant from the Agnes Nelms Haury Program in Environmental and Social Justice, housed at the UA Institute of the Environment. ""SustainUS brings together a team of young leaders with diverse skill sets to advance justice and sustainability by acting on climate through multiple avenues."" Franklin will give a presentation on Dec. 6 at 6 p.m. in Room S230 of the ENR2 building to discuss his experience abroad and his hopes for a sustainable future. During the conference, Franklin and other delegates with SustainUS, a national youth-led organization that works to advance justice and sustainability, organized events and shared via social media the effects climate change will have on youth, indigenous peoples and those on the frontlines of fossil-fuel extraction. ""I gained valuable on-the-ground perspective about the COP,"" Franklin said. ""It's more than the formal negotiations. It's a gathering space for climate justice activists from all over the world, and a chance for social movements and NGOs to build connections."" Franklin, who studies the opportunities and barriers for solar energy, ultimately hopes to influence global leaders on ways to re-evaluate current climate initiatives. In Tucson, he works with the UA Public Political Ecology Lab, most recently developing the lab's website for a new initiative called the Climate Alliance Mapping Project. Through the project and his own research, Franklin grapples with complex questions about energy, climate and society, while working to promote socially just responses to climate change and a just transition to renewable energy. Franklin also said that he appreciated being involved with COP22 to advance efforts toward actions on climate change. ""Today's youth are the first generation to widely face the consequences of climate change,"" Franklin said. ""We recognize that climate change is a social justice issue. The impacts will hurt vulnerable people most, and we have an obligation to amplify their stories. The climate movement has an unprecedented opportunity to display its political will. Now more than ever, our collective voices are needed."" \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA9","UNESCO SHOWCASES INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AT COP22","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): The UNESCO Pavilion at the 2016 UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP22 ) opened its doors today with a series of discussions on the solutions that indigenous knowledge can offer to tackle climate change, and how to best support particularly vulnerable local and indigenous communities. Over 400 million of the world's indigenous peoples live in territories that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Indigenous peoples of northern Europe, Siberia and Alaska, pastoralist communities in the Sahel, or island communities in the Pacific Ocean, to name but a few, are already experiencing adverse effects very keenly. Yet they are using their highly detailed knowledge, produced through direct experience over generations, to observe and respond actively to changing climatic conditions. Indigenous representatives presented the main conclusions of the international conference organized by UNESCO and CNRS in support of international efforts to implement the Paris Climate Agreement. Held on 2 and 3 November 2016, it focused on the role that indigenous and local knowledge can play, alongside science, in observing and responding to the impacts of a changing climate. UNESCO has long recognized that we need to bring together understandings, values and solutions from many horizons in order to tackle global challenges. ""Indigenous peoples respond, innovate and adapt to this context of change, and their resilience is rooted in their ways of life and their social solidarity"", stressed Flavia Schlegel, UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for the Natural Sciences. ""They will find a path, whatever the hardships, thanks to their trust in their deeply rooted cultures, and the strength of their observations and knowledge, which are both ancestral and innovative"". Collaboration between indigenous knowledge holders and mainstream scientific research can generate new co-produced knowledge that will enable effective action to cope with climate change. The similarities and differences between different knowledge systems must be better understood, in order to facilitate this collaboration. For example, extreme events are measured by Sami herders in terms of consequence, while climatologist will consider intensity. A series of low-intensity warm and cold spells, resulting in the formation of an ice crust on the snow that prevents reindeer for accessing their food, will be recorded as an extreme event by the Sami but not by climatologists. Indigenous observations and knowledge factor in elements that are often overlooked by scientific experts. In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists traditionally predict weather and climate through the observation of stars, winds, livestock, insects, birds, trees and other wildlife. The information is collected, shared and analyzed through traditional institutions, who triangulate various sources of information. Over generations, indigenous peoples have modified and maintained most of the world's 'wilderness' areas. Fire management, community forestry and indigenous soil enhancement practices have shaped landscapes across the globe. These traditional practices have the potential to enhance carbon sinks and provide benefits back to the communities; they provide tools for the sustainable management of nature. However, defining appropriate ways to engage indigenous knowledge at the intergovernmental level remains challenging, although international recognition of indigenous knowledge of the environment has accelerated, coupled with an increased awareness of the need to safeguard rights of indigenous peoples. A series of thematic days will be ogranized during COP22 at the UNESCO Pavilion in the Civil Society Area of the COP22 conference, to assist Member States through UNESCO's uniquely multidisciplinary expertise and outreach in climate change education, science, culture and communication, mobilizing efforts for enhanced climate change awareness and action. \"

Hosted by the United Nations Global Compact, together with UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the secretariat of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the meeting was testament that responsible businesses across the world stand ready, willing and able to take climate action. Additional event partners included the Principles for Responsible Investment and La Conf\'e9d\'e9ration G\'e9n\'e9rale des Entreprises du Maroc. On the occasion of the\~High-Level Caring for Climate Meeting[3], UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged companies to further increase their commitment to climate action. 'Now it is time to turn words into deeds, to seize the opportunity before us for. We have no time to lose that is why Marrakech is critical for strengthening the global climate action agenda, ensuring that we close the gap to meet the below 2\'b0 pathway. And that's where business has an enormous role to play.' Over the course of the\~High-Level Meeting[4], participants mapped out how they plan to accelerate climate action and increase low-carbon investments at the country level. Business representatives shared proposals on how the private sector can support and reinforce national climate priorities on mitigation and adaptation and highlighted the inextricable link between addressing climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Commenting on the private sector's role in addressing climate change,\~Lise Kingo, Executive Director of the UN Global Compact[5], emphasized: 'The climate movement is unstoppable. More and more companies are taking action, and seeing new opportunities for growth and innovation. But we will need companies everywhere to urgently rise to the challenge if we are to achieve our climate goals and the broader 2030 sustainable development agenda. That is why we will increasingly focus our efforts on supporting private sector climate action at the country level.' Building on a decade of successfully engaging business on the international climate agenda, the UN Global Compact announced a new solutions platform\~Pathway to Low-Carbon ...silient Development\~[6]to mobilize the private sector to catalyze country-level action to meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The platform will help companies scale up climate action that contributes to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national SDG plans. The Pathway to Low-Carbon ...silient Development aims to set a new global standard of business leadership on climate while providing a space for companies to review, realign and recalibrate their corporate climate goals. Also today, the UN Global Compact together with partners released the\~2016 Status Report on the Business Contribution to Global Climate Action[7], an assessment of the impact of business initiatives on achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The report found that there are now 30 business-led initiatives registered on the UN-backed NAZCA climate portal, in total including more than 3,300 companies and organizations. Since COP 21, the number of businesses participating in these initiatives has increased by 17 percent and that 27 percent of these business participants have their headquarters in developing or transition economies. Outcomes from the 9 November\~Business and Industry Day[8]\~found that private sector engagement on climate action has grown notably, for example: 77 companies are now committed to the UN Global Compact Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing; 200 companies representing USD $4.8 trillion in market value and responsible for 627 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions per year have committed to set targets aligned with climate science; and a growing number of companies have agreed to the UN Global Compact's Commitment for Adaptation and Resilience launched in June 2016.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA12","AfDB Helps Morocco Prepare for COP22","October 21, 2016 Friday 5:07 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The African Development Bank issued the following news release: Climate experts have been placed at the service of the Moroccan Government by the African Development Bank (AfDB) to support the preparation and organization of the upcoming 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Morocco will host COP 22 from November 7-18, 2016. With extensive experiences in climate adaptation, mitigation, climate finance, environment, capacity building, technology transfer, and project pipeline development, these experts are expected to provide day-to-day support to the COP 22 Task Team and advise the Moroccan Government on other relevant COP 22 issues. ""By providing technical assistance, the AfDB hopes to help Morocco, and other African governments better articulate their position in the UN negotiation process in a way that delivers favorable outcomes to enable Africa adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change,"" says Alex Rugamba, Director of the Energy, Environment and Climate Change Department and Chair of the AfDB Climate Change Coordination Committee. The elevation of adaptive capacities and the call to strengthen climate change resilience in the Paris Climate Change Agreement offers a unique opportunity for African countries to develop innovative climate-resilient development. With a recognition that climate change exerts a direct impact on livelihoods through water, AfDB experts will also be looking to identify and propose for funding projects linking water resource management and climate resilience. ""The role of water security has moved to the fore since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, particularly with regards to adaptation to climate change. Water resources will come under increasing stress due to economic development, demographics, and climate change and successful efforts to enhance resilience and to adapt to climate change will have to take water security as a starting point,"" says Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the Water and Sanitation Department. The AfDB has considerable experience in supporting African countries at the COPs. The Bank is currently supporting the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), and the Committee of African Heads of States and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC). At COP21 last year, the Bank's support was instrumental in the adoption of the Paris Agreement, and for the design and launch of two major African solutions in Paris, namely the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) and the African Adaptation and Loss and Damage Initiative. Funding for the experts is from various sources including the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), and the African Water Facility (AWF). Both water-related initiatives are looking to explore funding opportunities on projects linking climate adaptation and water and building a strong pipeline of projects. The African Development Bank has an active water portfolio of 2.6 billion Euro in 37 African countries, covering rural and urban water supply and sanitation as well as water resource management at both national and trans-boundary level. The city of Marrakesh in Morocco will host the annual UN Climate Change Summit from November 7-16, 2016. Thousands of delegates from governments, civil society, academics, and private sector are expected at the gathering to discuss further practical ways to implement the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement adopted at COP21 in December 2015. With the agreement entering into force on November 4, 2016, COP22 will also serve as the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1).

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA13","COP22: Marrakech Sets New Path for Faster Local Climate Action","November 21, 2016 Monday 5:30 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Committee of the Regions issued of news release: EU cities' and regions' goals echoed at COP22 as multi-level governance and climate finance make progress. &#8203;""Marrakech is a step forward for our climate. By setting a new path for increased cooperation between national, regional and local governments and working to get the finances right, the world is making progress. We must continue to look forward as words are nothing without action: we must scale-up investment and support the world's cities and regions who will make or break the Paris climate promises"" said Markku Markkula, President of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) - the EU's assembly of local and regional representatives. During the COP22 During the climate talks in Marrakech two initiatives were launched by the UN's Climate Champions Hakima Al Haite and Laurence Tubiana to increase cooperation between all levels of government and accelerate the delivery of climate measures on the ground: the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the 2050 Pathways Platform . 'The UN's Climate Champions have worked hard to give cities and regions a stronger voice in the UN climate talks and put in place the finances needed to convert Paris commitments into bankable projects', said President Markkula. While the new Marrakech Partnership focuses on bolstering investments from 2017 to 2020, the 2050 Pathways Platform targets long-term deep decarbonisation action plans - both which the CoR had called for. President Markkula said, ""The EU must now show the way by updating the 2050 Roadmaps to ensure it complies with the Paris Agreement's obligations"". Six European regions have already joined the UN's 2050 Pathways Platform: Baden Wuerttemberg, Catalonia, Greater Manchester, North Rhine-Westphalia, Piedmont, Scotland&#8232;and Wales. 'And there are many more ready to join' President Markkula added. He also welcomed The Marrakech Action Proclamation adopted by Heads of State reaffirming their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and mobilise USD100 million annually by 2020. However, President Markkula warned, ""We still need more ambitious targets if we are to avert the devastation climate change will bring. The EU must upgrade its own commitment of cutting 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 50% instead of 40% by 2030. We must aim for a carbon neutral world by 2050'. Through initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, the world's local and regional governments are key to bridging the gap between governments' climate commitments and the Paris Agreement which seeks to keep temperatures rising well below 2degreeC. A total of 111 countries out of 197 parties to the UN climate convention have ratified the Paris agreement as the COP22 came to an end. Background: The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) set out its position on the COP22 climate negotiations in its opinion Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakech , led by Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia and Chair of the CoR's Commission for the Environment, Climate Change and Energy. The CoR and ARLEM - the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly - co-organsed several events at the COP22 such as the Climate Summit of Local and Regional Leaders and the Covenant of Mayors which is supported by many of the CoR's members showcasing the commitment of their cities and regions in implementing their climate action plans. Several initiatives to boost financing for both climate adaptation and mitigation were announced at the COP22 . Among them is the Marrakech Investment Committee for Adaptation (MICA), the Initiative for Renewable Island Energy, the African Capital Markets, the renewal of the Global Environmental Facility and the European External Investment Plan (EEIP). According to the World Bank - which has announced in Marrakech to double its climate finance programme for the MENA region - adapting to climate change could cost $80 to $100 billion per year, 80% of which needs to be invested in cities in order to keep global warming under 2degreeC'.

The International Symposium of the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the United Nations 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), held during COP 22 , discussed how to advance Sustainable Tourism in a Changing Climate. The Symposium aimed at increasing awareness on tourism and climate change-related issues and encourage the sector to engage in actions that reinforce national commitments to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. ""The tourism sector is both a vector and a victim of climate change and we are fully committed to contribute to reach the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. This event was essential to advance this agenda, especially the discussion on measurement and reporting requirements as a basis for identifying and prioritizing climate action in tourism"", said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai. ""Sustainable tourism creates opportunities and assembles partners to help transform the industry towards low emissions and more efficient and less polluting operations. We must make tourism and every other industry contributor to our climate change action and a sustainable future"", said Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, in her video address to the event. The event focused in particular in the need for partnerships with the private sector and the role of sustainable transportation to accelerate climate action in tourism. ""Climate change can only be addressed if actors from all parts of society - governments, businesses, NGOs and consumers - make a global and broad shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. Accounting for 10% of GDP, 7% of the world's exports and one in 11 jobs, tourism is one of the main economic sectors in the world, and as such has to be at the core of this essential transition,"" said Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of the 10YFP Secretariat. The International Symposium was part of the 3-day COP22 Tourism Side Events organized by the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme and hosted by the Ministry of Tourism of Morocco. The Programme is a partnership led by UNWTO with the Governments of France, Morocco and the Republic of Korea as co-leads, with support of the 10YFP Secretariat at UN Environment, aimed at accelerating the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production. It was followed by a networking event involving financial institutions on sustainable tourism as well as by the Annual Conference on Saturday 12 November, where members of the network exchanged experiences and discussed priorities and next steps in the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme. \"

No part of the world can now avoid the fact that climate change is striking harder and faster than many scientists predicted, and that its impacts are taking a higher toll on the most vulnerable communities. As important as marking that the record is yet again broken, we need to loudly mark what needs to be done to hold back such destruction: we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. To make that clear, that means no new oil, coal or gas projects. Decades of progress from scientists and engineers has made renewable energy the cheapest and cleanest source of energy in the world, creating the technological momentum that is matched by the millions of people in all parts of the world demanding climate action. Elected representatives must heed this momentum - it won't cost the earth to keep fossil fuels in the ground, but it will cost the earth if they are dug up."" Around the world, weather events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires are causing the loss of human lives, threatening the livelihoods of millions and the natural systems.    Key climate impacts in 2016 NOAA declared 2016 as the second hottest year on record in the United States.- 15 weather and climate disasters caused 138 deaths, $46B in damages. According to WMO's release, long-term indicators of human-caused climate change reached new heights in 2016, as carbon dioxide and methane concentrations surged to new records. Last november, WMO published a provisional statement for 2016 to inform the United Nations Climate Change conference taking place in Marrakech, Morocco ( COP22 ). The final statement will be released in early 2017. For the first time, the assessment considers the humanitarian impact. The following impacts are highlighted in the statement: The most serious drought affected much of southern Africa. The Yangtze basin in China experienced, overall, its most significant flood season since 1999. Extreme heatwaves hit South Africa, and high temperatures set new national records in Kuwait, Iran, Thailand and India. The most damaging wildfire in Canadian history broke out near Fort McMurray, in Alberta. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that weather-related hazards triggered 14.7 million displacements in 2015, and no region of the world remained unaffected. 24 million people have been reported as being in a situation of food insecurity as a consequence of the droughts in eastern Africa The Great Barrier Reef suffered the worst bleaching on record with 92% of coral being affected. Six months after bleaching scientists discover more than two thirds of the northern section of the Reef is dead. Copyright Targeted News Services EditorVail-5749835 EditorVail \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA18","COP22: Governments Must Uphold and Go Beyond Paris Climate Promises","November 14, 2016 Monday 11:24 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Committee of the Regions issued of news release: As climate talks continue in Marrakech, thousands of local and regional leaders from across the world have called on governments at all levels to uphold and go beyond the commitments made in Paris last year. They also expect the COP22 to result in concrete policy, technical and financial measures to make the Paris deal operational. 'We need to build on the Paris Agreement which was historic but is not enough. Local and regional governments are taking action and are ready to help but they need sustainable smart investment and a stronger role in the global governance on climate action"", Markku Markkula, President of the European Committee of the Regions said. The President of the European Committee of the Regions - the EU's assembly of local and regional representatives - was speaking during the COP22 Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders which gathered over 1,500 local and regional leaders from across the globe. During his speech, President Markkula said that though the Paris climate agreement set a 2 degree C warming limit, current commitments will see global temperatures increase by more than 3 degree C by the turn of the century. ""Climate change is a matter that goes beyond politics, across borders and is not something you can bargain with. All nations must uphold their climate commitments, take the necessary steps to ensure the sustainable transition of territories worldwide and go further, faster. We must aim to have a carbon-neutral world by 2050"", added President Markkula. Local and regional authorities have a central role in delivering climate action, being responsible for executing around 70% of climate change reduction measures and up to 90% of climate adaptation actions. Climate initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors will soon be the largest coalition of cities and regions, demonstrate that local governments surpass national government targets. This is critical in reaching the Paris objectives. ""Cities and regions are key in bridging the gap between climate commitments and objectives"", said Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia who led the Committee's report 'Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakech '. ""We expect the climate talks to result in a global climate governance that formalises a permanent dialogue between cities and regions, national governments and UN bodies. It needs to show how binding targets will be monitored while closely tracking progress through common assessment mechanisms. We urgently need to integrate cities and regions' cuts in greenhouse gas emissions within National Determined Contributions (NDCs)"", concluded Pigliaru. Half of the world's population live in urban areas with cities emitting as much as half of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. According to the World Bank, adapting to climate change could cost $80 to $100 billion per year, 80% of which needs to be invested in cities in order to keep global warming under 2 degree C. Yet today's financing landscape does not provide local and regional authorities with suitable financial opportunities and the right technical support to develop climate projects. During the Summit, cities and regions set out recommendations to mobilise financial flows for locally-tailored climate projects: from increasing the volume of climate-compatible assets to further channelling direct-access to finance through public-private partnerships, creating financial hubs and supporting carbon pricing to boost low-carbon projects. Notes to editor: The COP22 The European Committee of the Regions is also actively contributing to the special report on cities and regions that the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) is to deliver in 2023 as well as to closely cooperate with national states and the UNFCCC on the design of a decisive 'Action Plan for Cities and Regions'. The Committee has also welcomed the IPCC decision to organise a 'Cities and Climate Change Science Conference' in 2018. At COP22 , the IPCC has launched a call to host the conference to £ll cities recognised for their climate leadership' by January 15, 2017, The aim is to foster research and scientific evidence on cities and climate change in order to enable better climate policy-making at local level. It is to support national governments, member states, regions and cities to deliver the Paris Agreement, the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Speeches: Pres.

With U.S. leadership, we saw rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which puts us on an accelerated path towards implementation of our climate goals. We also secured an ambitious amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of extremely potent greenhouse gases, and saw the adoption of a market-based-measure to set international aviation on the path to sustainable, carbon-neutral growth. The slogan ""FOR THE PLANET"" is projected on the Eiffel Tower as part of the COP21, United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, Friday, December 11, 2015. [AP Photo]Now, international government leaders, climate scientists, policy makers, non-governmental organizations and members of the business community are focused on implementation and action at COP22 which will be held in the vibrant and bustling city of Marrakech, Morocco.\~How is this COP different from others? COP22 will focus on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It presents an opportunity to showcase the progress that we have made over the last year. It is also an opportunity to push for ambitious action to reduce emissions -- as well the reporting and communications on countries' progress toward their meeting climate goals. COP22 will also showcase the many actions that non-state actors - like provinces, cities, businesses, and civil society -- are already taking in response to climate change, heeding the signal sent by world leaders that a fundamental shift to a low carbon economy is coming.\~How can I learn more about what the United States is doing at COP22 ?

'In the time I've spent in public life, one of the things I've learned is that some issues look a bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail.' Trump, on the campaign trail as the Republican nominee, spoke of ripping up the Paris Agreement on reducing greenhouse gasses. Shortly after his surprise victory Trump appointed climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to lead his Environmental Protection Agency transition team. 'Climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue in the first place,' Kerry said and explained it is not such an issue for leaders at the Pentagon, the U.S. intelligence community, corporate executives and local politicians. In the audience at Kerry's speech were representatives of the U.N., officials of numerous countries, members of U.S. congressional committees, and environmentalists who spoke among themselves about the uncertainly of American leadership on environmental issues under a President Trump. 'I hope the president-elect will listen to [Kerry's] advice,"" Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan told VOA. Morgan said, 'I have not felt fear' among the international community attending COP22 that the climate change mitigation goals in the Paris Agreement are jeopardized by the impending change of administration in Washington.But Greenpeace and other environmental groups are applauding indications by China it is committed to the agreement. 'One of the country's high level diplomats has assured us that climate actions will continue in China regardless of the U.S. political situation,' said Li Shuo, the climate policy advisor for Greenpeace China.

Kerry, in his speech which received a standing ovation, said despite the international consensus there is still no guarantee that the critical goals set will be met, even holding temperature increases to two degrees warming, which many scientists say is a tipping point.'And if we fall short, it will be the greatest instance in modern history of a generation in a time of crisis, abdicating responsibility for the future,' Kerry asserted. 'And it won't just be a policy failure; because of the nature of this challenge, it will be a moral failure, a betrayal of devastating consequence.' Kerry, who has long championed action on climate change, spoke at the conference after an ""awe-inspiring"" trip to Antarctica, where he took a helicopter ride to view the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. COP22 , attended by 25,000 delegates, was intended to be a celebration of sorts, with the focus on implementation after years of negotiation, in which the United States played a key leadership role. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA21","AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY AT HEART OF CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION FAO UNVEILS NEW GLOBAL FRAMEWORK FOR ACTION ON WATER SCARCITY AT COP22 SUMMIT","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): The world must rapidly move to scale up actions and ambitions on climate change FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva told delegates at the United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP22 ) in Morocco today. Speaking at the high-level action day on agriculture and food security, Graziano da Silva noted that climate change impacts on agriculture - including crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, land and water - are already undermining global efforts to assure food security and nutrition. And the rural poor are the most affected. With over 90 percent of countries referring to the important role of agriculture in their national plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change, Graziano da Silva stressed that ""it is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution."" Last year's conference in Paris led to the world's first legally binding global climate deal. The current summit in Marrakech, Morocco is geared to implementation of the pledges all signatory countries made. Echoing the prevalent spirit at the COP, the Paris Agreement is irreversible and inaction would be a disaster for the world. Transforming agriculture - maximizing benefits Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people. Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services; and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. ""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" FAO's Director-General said. ""Countries are recognizing this potential with unprecedented commitments."" Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added. A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, today's special event co-organized by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Haite (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals. In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, today FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative."" At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particure, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he said. Cost of inaction far outweighs action The world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change. \"

According to the UN environment Programme (UNEP), the Global Peatlands Initiative seeks mobilize governments, international organizations and academia in an effort to protect peatlands, which contain almost 100 times more carbon than tropical forests. If global temperatures continue to rise, this could lead to thawing permafrost, switching boreal and Arctic peatlands from carbon sinks to sources, resulting in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and potentially causing climate change to spiral out of control. Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment stressed that despite the Paris Agreement, global temperatures will rise over 3 degrees Celsius this century. ""This will cause misery and chaos for millions of vulnerable people, so we cannot afford to let any opportunity to reduce emissions slip by,"" he added. Mr. Solheim also urged taking action through the Global Peatlands Initiative, as it is ""critical we do not reach the tipping point that will see peatlands stop sinking carbon and start spewing it into the atmosphere, destroying any hope we have of controlling climate change."" UNEP said that peatlands are coming under increased threat from conversion for palm oil and pulp wood production, which may result in environmental problems such as enormous fires in Indonesia and Russia in recent years. In recent years, Indonesia has suffered from peat forest fires, resulting in greater emissions than the daily ones from the entire United States economy. However, emission is not the only negative impact of peatland degradation. The 2015 peat fires in Indonesia may have indirectly killed up to 100,000 people through the toxic haze, in addition to causing $16.1 billion in economic damage, according to recent studies. Therefore, with support from over a dozen partners, a UN Environment team launched the largest effort on peat so far, called the Global Peatlands Initiative, which aims to increase the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of peatlands in countries with significant peat deposits. The initiative was launched at the Global Landscapes Forum, the leading side event of the UN's COP22 climate change talks in Marrakech, Morocco. The Global Peatlands Initiative was founded by the governments of Indonesia, Peru, the Republic of Congo, UNEP, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, CIFOR, Wetlands International, UNEP-WCMC, GRID-Arendal, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, European Space Agency, WRI, Greifswald Mire Centre and StarVision/Sateligence. \"

The International Symposium of the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the United Nations 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), held during COP 22 , discussed how to advance Sustainable Tourism in a Changing Climate. The Symposium aimed at increasing awareness on tourism and climate change-related issues and encourage the sector to engage in actions that reinforce national commitments to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. ""The tourism sector is both a vector and a victim of climate change and we are fully committed to contribute to reach the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. This event was essential to advance this agenda, especially the discussion on measurement and reporting requirements as a basis for identifying and prioritizing climate action in tourism"", said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai. ""Sustainable tourism creates opportunities and assembles partners to help transform the industry towards low emissions and more efficient and less polluting operations. We must make tourism and every other industry contributor to our climate change action and a sustainable future"", said Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, in her video address to the event. The event focused in particular in the need for partnerships with the private sector and the role of sustainable transportation to accelerate climate action in tourism. ""Climate change can only be addressed if actors from all parts of society - governments, businesses, NGOs and consumers - make a global and broad shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. Accounting for 10% of GDP, 7% of the world's exports and one in 11 jobs, tourism is one of the main economic sectors in the world, and as such has to be at the core of this essential transition,"" said Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of the 10YFP Secretariat. The International Symposium was part of the 3-day COP22 Tourism Side Events organized by the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme and hosted by the Ministry of Tourism of Morocco. The Programme is a partnership led by UNWTO with the Governments of France, Morocco and the Republic of Korea as co-leads, with support of the 10YFP Secretariat at UN Environment, aimed at accelerating the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production.

""Last year we had a late crop and harvested well. This year we decided on an early crop and the beans are struggling to survive. This year we are looking at one ton per hectare, compared to 15 tons last year."" The variability in his harvests comes from the change in weather patterns. He chose to farm beans because they are a drought resistant crop, but the heavy rainfall is now a problem. ""Growing up we could easily predict the weather. If the cold came in from Mozambique and the rains started in Chimoi, we knew it would only be a matter of time before the rains started here. We could even predict the amount. If there were a lot of wild mazhanje (sugar plum) during the year, we knew the rainfall would be heavy,"" Mushamba explains. The changing weather patterns around Zimbabwe, as a result of global warming, is evident to almost everyone in the agricultural sector, which the Zimbabwe Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper calls ""the backbone of Zimbabwe's economic development and the anchor for poverty eradication."" Without predictable planting and harvesting seasons, farmers have to devise new strategies for producing food, families have to find alternate sources of nutrition and income, and communities have to find ways to protect those left most vulnerable. The Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund has recently begun implementation of a $1.5 million Climate Change Technical Assistance (TA) program that seeks to further develop Zimbabwe's strategies for climate smart agriculture, energy and water use, and forestry. The technical assistance also seeks to mainstream climate change into public investment planning, create a pipeline of bankable climate adaptation investments, and help authorities to mobilize climate-related financing. This assistance will help fill knowledge gaps on how climate change is affecting agro-ecological zoning, irrigation, and livestock which will help farmers plan better. This component will also assess and build technical capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanization and Irrigation Development (MAMID) for irrigation planning and modeling. The growing frequency and severity of droughts is increasing food insecurity and accelerating the demand for irrigation at a faster rate than farmers or the government can finance. To counter this, the assistance will also study the new water requirements and advise on appropriate irrigation technologies that are water-efficient and small scale. This will help to introduce innovative landscape management techniques into the forestry sector, and work on mitigating the impact of climate change in the water-energy nexus. The program will also help Zimbabwe to implement its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the climate agenda and to mobilize more climate financing. ""This technical assistance comes at the right time to provide the baseline and assist the country in coming up with solid project proposals to attract funding for implementing our NDC,"" said Washington Zhakatha, a director working on climate change for the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Climate Change. The timing coincides with the launch of the NDC Partnership between developing and developed countries and international institutions, last year at the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris ( COP22 ). This partnership, to which Zimbabwe is a member, is working to ensure countries receive the support they need to achieve ambitious climate and sustainable development goals. As communities struggle to make sense of the new weather patterns, this technical assistance will help them to adapt and anticipate the effects of climate change. Farmers like Mushamba will benefit from the government's efforts to understand the extent to which climate change could shift the geographic location and characteristics of zones. The program under the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF) will run until 2019. \"

At the closing plenary on Thursday afternoon, Rev. Henrik Grape, coordinator of the WCC Working Group on Climate Change, spoke on behalf of faith-based non-governmental organizations. He said that two signs of hope from 2015 - the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement - are pivotal international instruments that have the potential to direct the world toward a more just and sustainable future. ""It is absolutely critical for COP 22 to translate the hope generated in Paris last year into higher ambitions and concrete actions"", said Grape, adding that rich, industrialized countries are historically the primary emitters and beneficiaries of greenhouse gas emissions - and there is a moral obligation for these countries to act and act now. ""As a fellowship of people of faith, we carry a hope that impels us to speak and act. The impoverished, the future generations and creation herself must be at the center of any climate policy and agreement"", said Grape. ""This hope drives us to participate in a pilgrimage of justice and peace on the earth and with the earth - a gift and a home for all of us, and whose bounty ought to be shared and enjoyed in equitable and sustainable ways."" Grape called on COP22 parties to show that the Paris Agreement is for real and to ramp up the ambitions to keep the global average temperature increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. He also called for a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy through ending fossil fuel subsidies and boosting investments in renewable energies. The WCC also called for ensuring that the various mechanisms under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, such as adaptation, loss and damage, capacity-building and finance, are developed to contribute to a just and resilient society for all. Securing a scaled-up, transparent and sustained support to poor and vulnerable nations from wealthy and developed nations is crucial as well, said Grape.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA36","MARRAKECH: 'THE EYES OF THE WORLD ARE UPON US,' CHAIR OF UN CONFERENCE SAYS AS NEW ROUND OF CLIMATE TALKS OPENS","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations: The United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as ' COP 22 ,' opened today in Marrakech, Morocco, just days after the entry into force of the landmark Paris Agreement which has now been ratified by 100 countries. ""This conference comes within a climate of hope and of legitimate aspirations for all of humanity,"" said the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, Salaheddine Mezouar, who was elected today by acclamation as President of COP 22 , formally the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""The unprecedented mobilization of the international community and its political will, expressed at the highest levels, have been crowned by the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement. This is unrivaled progress [...] and now we must build on this momentum, give tangible meaning to this major step forward through decisions geared towards implementation,"" he stated. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on 15 November. Before the meeting wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. In his remarks today, Mr. Mezouar urged participants ""to be more ambitious,"" and stressed that ""the eyes of the world are on us"" [...] ""We have a huge responsibility before humanity and we must join forces in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations. We must provide them with the resources to adapt to the disastrous consequences of climate change."" Left to right: Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Hoesung Lee; UNFCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, COP 22 President Salaheddine Mezouar and COP 21 President Segolne Royal at the opening of COP22 in Marrakesh, Morocco. Photo: UNFCCC ""Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given"", she continued, underscoring that: ""Marrakech is our moment to take forward climate action at the international and national levels as a central pillar of the successful realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is our opportunity to take the next steps towards an inclusive, sustainable path for every man, woman and child."" Ms. Espinosa underlined key areas in which work needs to be taken forward. She stressed that finance is flowing, but it is not enough. Moreover, nationally determined contributions now need to be integrated into national policies and investment plans. She said support for adaptation needs to be given higher priority, and progress on the loss and damage mechanism has to be ensured to safeguard development gains in the most vulnerable communities. The President of COP 21, which agreed the Paris accord last year, Segolne Royal, French Minister of Environment, Energy and the Sea, who has passed the baton to Mr. Mezouar, welcomed the ratification of the Paris Agreement by 100 countries as of this past Sunday. ""It's an historic event,"" she said at a press conference just before the official opening of the COP 22 ""[The clock is ticking] because the year that just ended was the warmest, because the melting of glaciers is accelerating, because desertification is devastating, because the massive urban concentrations call for a new model urban development,"" she continued. Ms. Royal stressed the importance of climate justice, particularly for Africa. ""Africa is the great challenge of [this Conference]. COP 22 is an African COP, and that is where the priority and hope are,"" she said. ""In Africa, climate change is cruel and unfair. The continent suffers the most through no fault of its own. Among the 50 countries which are the most [affected] by global warming, 36 are located in sub-Saharan Africa."" Non-governmental organizations present at COP 22 , including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Climate Action Network, also welcomed the entry into force of the Paris Agreement but said at press conferences that there was still a long way to go, particularly in terms of funding and concrete implementation of commitments. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA37","Africa Day at COP22: African Leaders Demonstrate Commitment, Action to Address Climate Change","November 18, 2016 Friday 9:28 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The African Development Bank issued the following news release: African Heads of State and Government marked Africa Day in the Africa Pavilion at the UNFCCC 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) on 16th November with focused and strategic discussion on the ratification and roll out of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the key continental initiatives to support member states' efforts. President Alpha Conde of the Republic of Guinea presided over the High Level gathering also attended by the Presidents of Botswana, Ian Khama; Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf; Togo and Faure Gnassingbe, Ministers from the continent, heads of Pan African Institutions; the African Union Commission, the African Development Bank, the Economic Commission for Africa, NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency and; development partners. The Africa Day event had the theme of ""Moving from Commitment to Action with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)"". As Climate Change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world, with Africa already experiencing some of the most severe impacts, the continent's leaders have proactively responded with the establishment of the Committee of Africa Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on Climate that have thus far, tremendously influenced global negotiations. Presence of heads of state at COP22 and the Africa Day event further demonstrated the importance placed on securing the continent's interests within the global climate governance mechanism and in defining the roadmap to reduce the global temperature rise to 'well below' 2oC goal, considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the threshold for averting dangerous changes to the climate system. COP21 in Paris in November 2015 delivered the landmark Paris Agreement in which the Intended NDCs emerged as the game changer and primary mechanism for reducing global temperature rise. To date 46 African countries have signed the Paris Agreement and 27 out of 103 countries have ratified the Agreement that entered into force on 4th November, 2016. Africa has seized the opportunity of COP22 , dubbed ""the COP of Action"", to demonstrate leadership in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, through the NDCs and in ensuring that the means of implementation, namely finance, capacity building, technology development and transfer - the cornerstones of implementation - are provided. Beyond COP22 Emphasising the importance of energy access, President Conde noted that out of 1 billion Africans 700 million have no access to energy. ""Since 2002, we have fought to ensure that production is accelerated and increased,'' further expressing satisfaction at the funding for AREI as an indicator that Europe is taking steps to deliver on commitments for implementation. President Conde said that Africa needs to develop on the basis of an energy mix : ""we also need to develop fast, and the faster Africa has access to energy the faster Africa will develop"", he said. AfDB President, Akinwumi Adesina said energy is the engine of Africa's growth and development and reinforced the need for an energy mix of on and off-grid systems. ""Let's turn pledges on paper into projects on the ground. Let us together deliver success for Africa. Let us together light up and power Africa!"" he urged. ""All these initiatives fit very well into our African Union Agenda 2063 where we want to have a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth, and which commits Africa to pursue a sustainable development path where climate resilient programs play a major role while we protect our environment through renewable energy"", said Chairperson of the Africa Union Commission (AUC), Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, in a statement read on her behalf by Dr. Elham Mahmoud Ahmed, Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy, AU Commission. Mr. Abdalla Hamdok, ECA Executive Secretary a.i, emphasised the importance of aligning Africa's climate change initiatives with sustainable development noting that ""The impacts of climate change in Africa are increasing in complexity resulting in new and emerging threats to lives and livelihoods, catalysing new migration dynamics, disasters and conflict and lost economic opportunities."" Egypt's Minister of Environment and President of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN), Mohammed Fahmy, also welcomed the initiatives and encouraged good governance and transparency as the foundation of implementation. COP21 and 22 Presidents, Segolcne Royal of France and Salaheddine Mezouar of Morocco, also participated in the event. 'This is an African COP, the biggest economies must fulfil their commitments to Africa', said Ms Royal. COP22 President Salaheddine Mezouar said Africa must and will electrify at the lowest cost, and that the COP 22 roadmap should ""respond to the issues of financing, access to electricity and capacity building to increase the success of projects."" Further emphasizing that it was time to put an end to cliches about African countries' ability to carry out projects. Copyright Targeted News Services 30FurigayJane-5704206 30FurigayJane \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA40","Towards COP22: African Ministerial Conference On Ocean Economies and Climate Change","August 27, 2016 Saturday","US Official News","Washington, D.C: World Bank Group has issued the following news release Diversifying economies beyond land-based activities and along coasts all in a climate-intelligent way is critical to achieving the SDGs and delivering smart, sustainable and inclusive growth globally. A success on the ocean economy and climate change agendas at COP-22 in Marrakesh would be to: (i) act on and implement the commitments made in Paris, (ii) help Africa adapt to a changing climate and (iii) mobilize resources to help it transition towards an inclusive, resilient and low-carbon trajectory, by maximizing the potential of one of its greatest assets - its oceans. The aspiration in Marrakesh is to deliver transformational investment packages to enhance Africa's capacity to build climate-resilient ocean economies, based on ecosystem carrying capacity. Some priority ocean-related action areas for Africa as part of a broader global ocean action agenda include fisheries and aquaculture, integrity of the coastline, ports and shipping, renewable energy, tourism, and horizontal themes such as capacity building and finance. 1. Building on commitments made on the SDGs in NY and at COP-21 in Paris, the World Bank's Africa Climate Business Plan as well as the WBG's Climate Change Action Plan, The African Ministerial Conference and Investment Forum (Mauritius, September 1-2, 2016) will be a decision-forcing two-day event that will: (a) Muster international political leadership and elevate the international political discourse, narrative and momentum on the interconnectedness of the ocean economy and climate change agendas. (b) Place Mauritius as an African international center of ocean economic forum to attract African leadership, as well as institutional investors and donors in the area of ocean economy and climate change. (c) Prepare the grounds for the announcement of an \'e2African Oceans Finance Package) for the benefit of African countries in the region that will be carried through to COP-22 (Marrakesh). A series of analytical work and papers on key topics, areas and sectors (such as climate change, ocean economy, disasters and natural calamities, fisheries and aquaculture, renewable energy, ports and shipping, tourism, marine spatial planning, low-carbon growth and long-term sustainability, natural capital accounting, building centers of excellence, costs of pollution and degradation, etc.) will be commissioned, prepared and highlighted at the Conference. A series of public-private sector investment roundtables will be organized. 2. A dedicated African Ocean Financing Day ( COP-22 (a) Take forward the outcome of the upcoming African Ministerial Conference and Investment Forum on the Ocean Economy (all within the Blue Economy Development Framework adopted by the World Bank and client countries at the Spring Meetings 2016) to the COP-22 (Marrakesh). (b) Host a two-hour, Africa-focused, high-level session, announcing an \'e2Africa Oceans Finance Package) which would entail an investment agenda catalyzed by a number of government and company commitments and partnerships in pursuit of climate-smart investments in African ocean economies.

She also reminded the conferees of the work it now entails for governments: UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa (Photo by IISD/ENB | Kiara Worth, iisd/ca)'Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given. We have embarked on an effort to change the course of two centuries of carbon-intense development. The peaking of global emissions is urgent, as is attaining far more climate-resilient societies.' Espinosa then outlined five key areas for intense concentration at the conference:Finance to allow developing countries to green their economies and build resilience. Finance is flowing. It has to reach the level and have the predictability needed to catalyze low-emission and climate-resilient development. Nationally determined contributions[4]  national climate action plans  which now need to be integrated into national policies and investment plans.

Mezouar welcomed the national representatives to the 'Rose City' of Marrakesh. Tabia, the red Hazou plain mud and water composing the walls, minarets, buildings, gardens, and monuments, dyes the entire cultural capital a salmon pink. COP22 signs and banners flutter everywhere. Mezouar spoke of his nation's pride and its continental diligence in hosting the meeting: 'It emphasizes Africa's desire to take its destiny in hand, to reduce its vulnerability and strengthen its resilience. Our work here in Marrakesh must reflect our new reality. No politician or citizen, no business manager or investor can doubt that the transformation to a low-emission, resilient society and economy is the singular determination of the community of nations.' The statement was particularly important in light of some African governments apparently regretting the ambition of emissions targets[5] submitted to date toward the Paris Agreement.\~Of the 54 members of the Africa Group  an important negotiating bloc  only 15 had ratified the Paris deal as of November 3. The President also reiterated that the Paris Agreement has not succeeded in reaching the goal of a maximum global average temperature of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius: 'I would like to invite you over the coming eleven days to be more ambitious than ever in your commitments. All over the world, public opinion must perceive change. It has to be a change at all levels, from local projects through to those that cross international borders and it must create genuine win-win partnerships.' With last year's President S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, Mezouar then handed out solar lanterns to all the national representatives. Holding up the lights in solidarity, the delegates paid homage to the clean technology transformation that is essential to achieve the Paris goals. Throughout the day Monday and for the rest of this week, the plenaries for the Conference of the Parties (COP), meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP), Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), and Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) convene.

Patricia Espinosa has pointed out that 'the international effort to bring the Paris Agreement into force in less than a year  an unexpectedly rapid result  reflects the strong, common political will to shift as quickly as possible towards the low-carbon, resilient economies and societies, which are the only way to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.' 'Climate action  faster, smarter, bigger, and better  reduces the greenhouse gas emissions which drive climate change and at the same time catalyzes the clean power economies and climate-resilient societies which are the foundation on which the future health, wealth and well-being of all people now depend.' Says WRI, the timetable is pressing. 'The Paris Agreement's primary goal  to limit global warming to well below 2\'b0C and as close to 1.5\'b0C as possible to prevent dangerous tipping points in the climate system  means that global emissions must peak soon then be driven down very rapidly.

Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, said ' COP22 will be an action and implementation COP. As the world's poorest countries, the LDC group calls for fair and ambitious action. We must build upon the foundations set in Paris to construct robust rules to support the Agreement's implementation.' Noting with concern that full implementation of current pledges by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions puts the world on track for 3-3.5\'b0C of warming above pre-industrial levels, Mr Mpanu-Mpanu said: 'Science tells us that beyond temperature increases of 1.5\'b0C the future of our planet stands on increasingly thin ice. It is imperative for communities across the world that countries take seriously their goal to pursue efforts to keep temperatures below 1.5\'b0C. We cannot afford to treat this as an aspirational goal. An upwards spiralling of commitments to cut emissions that is both fair and proportionate to challenge rising before us is vital.' LDCs plan to contribute to these global efforts through the LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative (REEEI) for Sustainable Development, among other ways. Mr Mpanu-Mpanu said: 'the upcoming launch of the LDC REEEI in Marrakech demonstrates the continued commitment of the LDC group to real solutions that benefit real people on the ground. The Initiativewill enable LDCs to leapfrog fossil fuel based energy and generate prosperity by bringing modern, clean, resilient energy systems to millions of energy-starved people.' LDCs are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with hazards including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, increased drought and floods and the spread of tropical diseases threatening health and food security. 'As LDCs, we lack the resources and capacity to adequately protect our communities from the devastating impacts of climate change. In Marrakech we seek greater commitment from developed countries to provide financial support, technology and capacity building to enable LDCs to respond to the climate crisis,' Mr Mpanu-Mpanu said. The Marrakech meeting concludes on November 18th. \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA44","New Fund Aims to Help Build Resilience to Climate Change","November 25, 2016 Friday 7:28 PM GMT","iCrowdNewswire (English)","United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ). The first woman [...] Mary Robinson, the U.N. special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate. Credit: Fabiola Ortiz/IPS By Fab\'edola Ortiz MARRAKECH, Nov 18 2016 (IPS) The world has been too slow in responding to climate events such as El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a, and those who are the least responsible are the ones suffering most , Mary Robinson, the special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, told IPS at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ). The first woman President of Ireland (1990-1997) and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (1997-2002), Robinson was appointed earlier this year by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the new mandate involving climate change and El Ni\'f1o. I ve seen a window into a new normal and it is very serious. Mary Robinson During the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Robinson strongly advocated for engaging community-led solutions and for incorporating gender equality and women s participation in the climate talks. Global warming is accelerating too much and it is being aggravated by El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a. They do not have to become a humanitarian disaster, but people have now been left to cope for themselves I think we were too slow in many instances and this has become a humanitarian disaster for the 60 million people who are food insecure and suffering from droughts, she said. El Ni\'f1o has been directly associated with droughts and floods in many parts of the world that have severely impacted millions of livelihoods. A warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific waters, the phenomenon occurs on average every three to seven years and sea surface temperatures across the Pacific can warm more than 1 degree C. El Ni\'f1o is a natural occurrence, but scientists believe it is becoming more intense as a result of global warming. How El Ni\'f1o interacts with climate change is not 100 percent clear, but many of the countries that are now experiencing El Ni\'f1o are also vulnerable to climate variations. According to Robinson, El Ni\'f1o and its climate-linked emergencies are a threat to human security and, therefore, a threat to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced in September 2015 as the 2030 Agenda replacing the Millennium Development Goals. I have gone to Central America to the dry corridor in Honduras and have seen women crying because there is no water and they feel very neglected. They feel they are left behind and that nobody seems to know about them. I saw in Ethiopia severely malnourished children, it could affect them for life in terms of being stunted. The same thing in southern Africa. I feel I ve seen a window into a new normal and it is very serious. We need to understand the urgency of taking the necessary steps, Robinson said. Drought and flooding associated with El Ni\'f1o created enormous problems across East Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Pacific. Ethiopia, where Robinson has visited earlier this year, is experiencing its worst drought in half a century. One million children in Eastern and Southern Africa alone are acutely malnourished. It is very likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015, according to an assessment released at the COP22 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary data shows that 2016 s global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El Ni\'f1o event. These long-term changes in the climate have exacerbated social, humanitarian and environmental pressures. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees pointed that in 2015, more than 19 million new displacements were associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. We need a much more concerted response and fund preparedness. If we have a very strategic early warning system, we can deal with the problem much more effectively. Building resilience in communities is the absolute key. We need to invest in support for building resilience now rather than having a huge humanitarian disaster, stressed Robinson. On Nov. 17, during the COP22 in Marrakech, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) a coalition led by France, Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada launched at the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015 announced a new goal to mobilise more than 30 million dollars by July 2017 and 100 million by 2020. The international partnership aims to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific. The idea is to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events. There will be a special focus on women, who are particularly vulnerable to climate menaces but are the protagonists in building resilience. Now we ve moved from the Paris negotiations to implementation on the ground. Building resilience is key and it must be done in a way that is gender sensitive with full account of gender equality and also human rights. We must recognize the role of women as agents for change in their communities, Robinson emphasised. The number of climate-related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years, said Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction. Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS, We can see already in Africa the impact of climate change that is undermining our efforts to bring food security for all. Take the example of El Ni\'f1o that has affected all of Africa in the last two years. Countries that had made fantastic progress like Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar are now suffering hunger again. Countries that have eradicated hunger are back to face it again. We need to adapt. Climate change has different impacts on men and women, girls and boys, told IPS Edith Ofwona, the senior program specialist at International Development Research Centre (IDRC).

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA46","F. HOLLANDE: ""COP22 IN MARRAKESH MUST BE THE COP OF SOLUTIONS.""","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Embassy of France in Washington: Speech by the President of the French Republic at the opening of the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Morocco ( COP22 ) Barely a year ago, COP21 was taking place in Paris. I wanted it to be organized in France. I was fully aware of the difficulties we faced. I remembered a number of failures but knew what high hopes there were. However, on 12 December 2015, in exceptional, even appalling circumstances, since terrorist attacks had taken place in Paris, many heads of state and government came, worked, and concluded a historic agreement. The agreement was historic, and what we have to say here is that the agreement is irreversible. It's irreversible legally speaking. It came into force on November 4. More than 100 states, accounting for two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified it. I welcome the efforts led by Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary-General, and Segol ne Royal, COP President, to arrive at that result in record time and at an international agreement of that scope. The agreement is also irreversible in practice, because governmentsthe ones you're representing, businesses, non-governmental organizations and citizens of the world are taking initiatives, launching projects and coming up with concrete solutions enabling us to combine the fight against global warming with development. We're going to move inexorably towards a much lower-carbon model. Already 90% of new electricity is produced by renewable energy sources. More than 70 countries and thousands of businesses have committed themselves to a coalition which has set itself the goal of doubling the share of global emissions covered by a carbon price by 2030. Even the world of finance has committed itself to the process: 80 billion-worth of green bonds has been raised and France itself will set an example by being the first country to issue them, at the start of the year [2017], for investments in the environment and energy transition. That's why the agreement is irreversible legally and practically speaking. Moreover, it is irreversible in people's minds. The climate emergency didn't end in Paris on 12 December 2015. The past few months have been the hottest in modern history and the link has been established between [global] warming caused by manhumansand [natural] disasters. Everyone now knows that if we don't do anything, rising sea levels will flood islands and coasts, including the most populated on our planet. Doing nothing would be catastrophic for the world, terrible for future generations and dangerous for peace. Millions of people would be displaced, [there would be] conflictswe're already experiencing themlinked to access to water and resources, then in Africa, famine linked to drought, which could affect millions of people who, to survive, would be forced to migrate in the hope of finding adequate resources elsewhere to feed themselves. So, taking action for the climate means ensuring the security and stability of the world. I've come here to Marrakesh not to go back over Paris, but to call for coherence and perseverance. The Paris Agreement is the work of everyone. It belongs to everyone, it depends on everyone, it is in the interest of everyone. Barack Obama's role in securing an agreement in Paris was crucial, particularly when it came to decisions taken with China and other countries. The United States, the world's leading economic power and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter, must honor the commitments that were made. It's not only its duty, it's in its interestthat of the American people, who are being hit by climate disruption, because no country is immune. It's also in the interest of American businesses, which have invested in the ecological transition. It's also the desire of cities and federal states, which made active efforts to support us in the climate agreement. FranceI assure you of this herewill hold this dialogue with the United States and its new president, openly, with respect, but with insistence and determination and on behalf of the 100 countries that have already ratified the Paris Agreement. I also want to make an appeal for perseverance. We're all gathered with the aim of limiting temperature rises to below 2C and, if possible, 1.5C. But I assure you, we must move faster. Move faster so that we can implement the Paris Agreement more quickly than plannedeven before 2018. Move faster to implement our national contributions. There too, France wants to set an example and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. Likewise, those same emissions will be cut fourfold by 2050. Moving faster, ever faster. We're also going to close coal-fired power stations by 2023, because we're conscious that time is needed, a transition is needed, but that we must also have this goal. We want to set a carbon price; 22 in 2016, more in 2030. But we must have the determination to be carbon neutral by 2050. I know that not all countries are ready. But France has decided to take the lead in this ""carbon neutral coalition"" by 2050. COP22 in Marrakesh must be the COP of solutions. It must make Africa's future among the top priorities. The world owes the African continent an ecological debt. Of the 50 countries worst afflicted by global warming, 36 are in sub-Saharan Africa. That's why I wanted an Agenda 2020 for Africa to be implemented; the aim is to provide all Africans with access to electricity. An Africa Renewable Energy Initiative was launched in Paris at COP21. 10 billion was promised ; France will provide 2 billion of this over the next five years. But I know this commitment will be exceeded. We now have a road map. The African Development Bank has implemented the procedures; 240 projects have been identified by the COP21 President. We'll make sure to spur the European Union into action, because the destinies of Africa and Europe are linked. Finally, what persuaded many of those who were hesitant to sign the Paris Agreement was the fact that the most developed countries made commitments and above all fulfilled them. The $100 billion by 2020 will be delivered. We must do everything to mobilize it. There too, France will keep its word ; our annual climate finance will be $5 billion a year by 2020, including $1 billion for adaptation. Ladies and gentlemen, I know what this meeting may represent for many people. The idea that the bulk of the work was done in Paris and only the implementation remains to be carried out: nothing could be more wrong. It's now that everything is beginningespecially in the world we know. A world going through terrible ordeals. A world full of uncertainties, with conflicts, threats, terrorism, civilians who are suffering, poverty and massive inequalities. That's why, for those who trade in fear, the world has become an ideal breeding ground. Doubts may sometimes exist as to the international community's ability [to respond]. There may be questions about globalization, which must be brought under control. I'm aware of all the problems that may sometimes prey on our peoples. But there are also reasons for hope, and the Paris Agreement is one. It's proof that the international community can overcome its divisions, take action and protect what we hold most dear. So, Your Majesty, heads of state and government, Secretary-General, delegates, you can't break a promise of hope. You must fulfill it. You must champion it. Here in Marrakesh, we're the guardians of the letter and spirit of the Paris Agreement. We'll keep it alive, because what unites usover and above our differences, our beliefs, religions, situations and modes of developmentis what we share, and that is quite simply our planet. Thank you. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA47","SEEKING TO INFORM INDIA'S CLIMATE POLICY CHOICES TATA CENTER GRADUATE FELLOW ARUN SINGH SHARES ENERGY-ECONOMIC MODELING RESEARCH AT UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE....","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): Emily Dahl The MIT Energy Initiative is sharing reports from the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, where MIT community members are observing the climate negotiations and speaking at auxiliary events. At a side event of COP22 , the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, researchers and nongovernmental leaders from around the world discussed policy research that can support implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise. Among the nine panelists was a sole graduate student: MIT's Arun Singh. On the panel, ""New Directions in Climate Change Research and Implications for Policy,"" Singh and fellow representatives of the COP22 Research and Independent Nongovernmental Organizations (RINGO) constituency gave brief overviews of their research in various areas, from agro-industrial development policies to green social work. Singh shared his research on clean development pathways for India, which applies an energy-economic model he is developing with advisors Valerie Karplus and Niven Winchester. The model simulates policy and technology choices India could make to fulfill its intended, nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement and how each of those choices could impact emissions, energy use, and the country's economy. ""For example,"" says Singh, ""how would India's ambitious solar targets compare with, say, a price on carbon to achieve similar levels of emissions reductions? Who wins and loses under alternate policy choices? Those are the types of questions we're looking to answer."" In the global effort to address climate change, India's role as a major player is indisputable. The country is the third largest emitter of global greenhouse gas emissions, behind China and the U.S., yet nearly 19 percent of India's population, most of which lives in rural areas, still lacks reliable access to electricity and the population is still growing rapidly. ""India is in a situation where it has to balance tradeoffs between increasing energy output and ensuring that additional generation does not add significantly to the country's carbon emissions,"" Singh explains. To make these tradeoffs, policymakers and regulators would benefit from having access to quantitative analysis of policy impacts, which Singh and his team hope to provide. ""Arun's work stands out because it combines modeling of policies at the country level with an assessment of financial and operational barriers to clean energy investment at the micro level,"" says Karplus, an assistant professor of global economics and management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who is also a faculty affiliate of the MIT Energy Initiative and the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. ""We hope to work with policymakers in India to identify strategies that are cost effective and politically workable. To do that, we need to analyze proposals in terms of both the cost and the distribution of impacts."" For Singh, researching solutions to climate and energy issues is personal: Having grown up in Ayodhya, India, he experienced the challenges firsthand. ""Frequent power cuts were a norm while I was growing up. In peak summer months, we would not get power for eight to 10 hours a day. And this was still in a town,"" he says. Following his undergraduate studies at India Institute of Technology Roorkee, Singh became more interested in understanding energy and environmental policymaking, while working at a petroleum refinery. Then, as a research associate at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) South Asia office in Mumbai, he worked on environmental regulation reform projects in India, including a pilot emissions trading scheme for industrial particulate matter emissions, conducted with India's Ministry of Environment and Forests. At J-PAL, he also carried out an impact evaluation of public disclosure of industrial air pollution ratings, for which he analyzed emissions data from more than 5,000 firms and worked closely with his team and with regulators to secure approval for a new disclosure program. As he made field visits to some of the most polluted industrial clusters in India, he learned how nuanced the issues can be. ""In India it is common to hold strong positions favoring or opposing development. But that's not helpful, as it's not an either-or question,"" he says. ""Smart policies can be designed that encourage growth while limiting the impact on natural environment and climate. And India already has several forward-looking policies in place."" His work motivated him to come to MIT, where he arrived with a desire to focus on climate and energy policy research for developing countries, but he was not yet sure exactly where his studies would take him. When Karplus learned of a call for researchers to present at COP22 with the RINGO constituency, she alerted Singh, who applied and was selected to present. In Marrakech, Singh shared preliminary findings from his model, which offer initial insights into how carbon pricing and renewable energy support policies compare in terms of their impact on carbon dioxide emissions, the energy system, and the economy. To finalize his research, he plans to expand the model's specifications to reflect policy priorities and physical constraints, especially on details in technology choices. He is also investigating the political and economic factors that drive these choices, and viable design options for increasing the political feasibility of cost-effective policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. While at COP22 ""I am so pleased and proud that Arun had the opportunity to represent our group in Marrakech. By interacting with diverse stakeholders at the COP, Arun has been able to share his research on India with the world, and compare and contrast its insights with experiences in other countries,"" Karplus says. At MIT, Singh co-leads a student group, Energy for Human Development (e4Dev), with fellow graduate student Turner Cotterman, bringing together members of the MIT community to advance understanding of issues facing the developing world, with guest lectures from notable experts, outreach programs, and educational opportunities. He plans to share his COP22 experience with the group. Singh's first experience with UN climate negotiations has been ""overwhelming,"" he says, from the efforts that go into organizing the COP to how the complex negotiation process functions. ""It's very encouraging to see enthusiastic participation of all countries and the near unanimous recognition of climate change as a problem requiring strong collective efforts,"" he says. ""There's no room for skepticism or delaying action.""

At a side event of COP22 , the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, researchers and nongovernmental leaders from around the world discussed policy research that can support implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise. Among the nine panelists was a sole graduate student: MIT\' s Arun Singh. On the panel,  New Directions in Climate Change Research and Implications for Policy, Singh and fellow representatives of the COP22 Research and Independent Nongovernmental Organizations (RINGO) constituency gave brief overviews of their research in various areas, from agro-industrial development policies to green social work. Singh shared his research on clean development pathways for India, which applies an energy-economic model he is developing with advisors Valerie Karplus and Niven Winchester. The model simulates policy and technology choices India could make to fulfill its intended, nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement  and how each of those choices could impact emissions, energy use, and the country\' s economy.  For example, says Singh,  how would India\' s ambitious solar targets compare with, say, a price on carbon to achieve similar levels of emissions reductions? Who wins and loses under alternate policy choices? Those are the types of questions we\' re looking to answer. In the global effort to address climate change, India\' s role as a major player is indisputable. The country is the third largest emitter of global greenhouse gas emissions, behind China and the U.S., yet nearly 19 percent of India\' s population, most of which lives in rural areas, still lacks reliable access to electricity  and the population is still growing rapidly.  India is in a situation where it has to balance tradeoffs between increasing energy output and ensuring that additional generation does not add significantly to the country\' s carbon emissions, Singh explains. To make these tradeoffs, policymakers and regulators would benefit from having access to quantitative analysis of policy impacts, which Singh and his team hope to provide.  Arun\' s work stands out because it combines modeling of policies at the country level with an assessment of financial and operational barriers to clean energy investment at the micro level, says Karplus, an assistant professor of global economics and management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who is also a faculty affiliate of the MIT Energy Initiative and the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.  We hope to work with policymakers in India to identify strategies that are cost effective and politically workable. To do that, we need to analyze proposals in terms of both the cost and the distribution of impacts. For Singh, researching solutions to climate and energy issues is personal: Having grown up in Ayodhya, India, he experienced the challenges firsthand.  Frequent power cuts were a norm while I was growing up. In peak summer months, we would not get power for eight to 10 hours a day. And this was still in a town, he says. Following his undergraduate studies at India Institute of Technology Roorkee, Singh became more interested in understanding energy and environmental policymaking, while working at a petroleum refinery. Then, as a research associate at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) South Asia office in Mumbai, he worked on environmental regulation reform projects in India, including a pilot emissions trading scheme for industrial particulate matter emissions, conducted with India\' s Ministry of Environment and Forests. At J-PAL, he also carried out an impact evaluation of public disclosure of industrial air pollution ratings, for which he analyzed emissions data from more than 5,000 firms and worked closely with his team and with regulators to secure approval for a new disclosure program. As he made field visits to some of the most polluted industrial clusters in India, he learned how nuanced the issues can be.  In India it is common to hold strong positions favoring or opposing development. But that\' s not helpful, as it\' s not an either-or question, he says.  Smart policies can be designed that encourage growth while limiting the impact on natural environment and climate. And India already has several forward-looking policies in place. His work motivated him to come to MIT, where he arrived with a desire to focus on climate and energy policy research for developing countries, but he was not yet sure exactly where his studies would take him. He started in 2015 as a graduate student in the Technology and Policy Program  which is now part of the Institute for Data Systems and Society  working with Karplus to study policies and regulation in the electricity sector in India, with funding from the MIT Energy Initiative. Then, an opportunity arose to help Karplus and Winchester develop the energy-economic model he now works on as a fellow of the Tata Center for Technology and Design and research assistant in the MIT Joint Program. When Karplus learned of a call for researchers to present at COP22 with the RINGO constituency, she alerted Singh, who applied and was selected to present. In Marrakech, Singh shared preliminary findings from his model, which offer initial insights into how carbon pricing and renewable energy support policies compare in terms of their impact on carbon dioxide emissions, the energy system, and the economy. To finalize his research, he plans to expand the model\' s specifications to reflect policy priorities and physical constraints, especially on details in technology choices. He is also investigating the political and economic factors that drive these choices, and viable design options for increasing the political feasibility of cost-effective policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. While at COP22 , Singh also had the opportunity to interview developers, investors, and aid organizations that are involved in the expansion of renewable energy in Morocco, supporting Karplus as she contributes to an upcoming book on the commercialization of renewable energy in several African countries.  I am so pleased and proud that Arun had the opportunity to represent our group in Marrakech. By interacting with diverse stakeholders at the COP, Arun has been able to share his research on India with the world, and compare and contrast its insights with experiences in other countries, Karplus says. At MIT, Singh co-leads a student group, Energy for Human Development (e4Dev), with fellow graduate student Turner Cotterman, bringing together members of the MIT community to advance understanding of issues facing the developing world, with guest lectures from notable experts, outreach programs, and educational opportunities. He plans to share his COP22 experience with the group. Singh\' s first experience with UN climate negotiations has been  overwhelming, he says, from the efforts that go into organizing the COP to how the complex negotiation process functions.  It\' s very encouraging to see enthusiastic participation of all countries and the near unanimous recognition of climate change as a problem requiring strong collective efforts, he says.  There\' s no room for skepticism or delaying action. Singh looks forward to continuing to play a role in informing energy and climate solutions for India with his research, as part of the MIT community dedicated to making a better world.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA49","Cakarmis '17 goes to COP22","December 2, 2016 Friday","The Scarlet and Black: Grinnell College","Earlier this month, the international community gathered in Marrakesh, Morocco, for COP22 - a climate change conference following up on the agreement reached one year ago at COP21 in Paris. Grinnell's own Tea Cakarmis '17, who previously worked with the UN agency on Education, Science and Culture was invited by UNESCO and the nation of Palau to participate in the conference. This week, The S&B's Michael Cummings sat down with Cakarmis to discuss her experience in Marrakesh and the future of climate change policy. The S&B: What is COP22 and how does it relate to COP21? Tea Cakarmis: COP22 was intended to be an explanation of how the implementation of COP21 will take place. COP21 in a lot of ways is an ideological promise, we've agreed that climate change is human-caused, that it is something where the science is very conclusive and also something that we need to act on. However, the way you go about it has consistently throughout the COPs been where a deal breaks or makes. In Marrakesh they were discussing how to actually put COP21 into action. The S&B: How did you end up going to Marrakesh this year? TC: I was [working] with UNESCO and I was working with the delegation of Palau. Since day one of my internship, the Paris Agreements were just signed. I started working in February, so it was really, really fresh. The agreement is indisputably one of the biggest accomplishments that have been done since the forming of the UN framework on climate change, [but] the small island states still did not feel as if it was reflective of how alarming the situation is. We talk about 2 degrees Celsius and small island states formed their own sort of aspirational alliance for 1.5 degrees because that's really the only thing that they find could even maybe possibly be satisfying. So we started working on how we could represent them, creatively, outside just the actual official delegations in Marrakesh. Then we came up with a project and when my internship ended they were like, ""Oh, how about you join us in Marrakesh?"" I didn't really think that that was even possible, and it was in the middle of my school year and everything, but then it just sort of worked out. It was amazing. Tea Cakarmis '17 represented Palau at COP22 in Marrakesh, Morocco. Photo contributed. The S&B: What were your responsibilities while in Marrakesh? TC: I personally was in charge of decorating the booth that the delegation of Palau had. ... We were trying to bridge the gap of distance, and so before the conference started I concluded a partnership with Disney France. We actually got them to create a clip for the small island nations specifically for COP, where they featured their new cartoons, animated movies, where it's either an endangered species or just generally island people who are featured in it. It's four spin-offs of ""Finding Nemo."" The other part of it is, we wanted to keep it as digital as possible, but we couldn't do that all the way. We had a partnership with Fondation Cousteau - that's Cousteau the oceanographer - their foundation sort of represents data visually really successfully. What we wanted to show is the human consequence on the ocean. We wanted it to be both engaging in terms of the beauty of the ocean, but also the extent of the human impact on the ocean. We had 10 photos that were the size of one and a half by two meters, so the size of me and bigger, that were placed around - we had our own improvised exhibit space. What I did was basically arrange that space, arrange for the materials to be shipped, the logistical part of that. The S&B: How will a Trump presidency affect international climate change policy? TC: The U.S. delegation [at COP22 ] was very firm in saying it is business as usual, meaning business as Obama left it. They were very deliberate in saying that Paris is formed in a way that even if you want to pull out of it, you already made your promises that you're going to have to uphold for at least three years, which is luckily how much [Trump's] mandate takes. So even if Trump wants to pull out of Paris, he won't be seeing the benefits of it, or what he believes the benefits can be, until the end of his mandate. So unless he is reelected, pulling out of Paris will not do anything for him as a president. \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA53","COP22 CONTINUED PROGRESS NEEDS U.S. BUSINESS LEADERSHIP","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF): By: Victoria Mills As world leaders gather in Marrakech for the 22nd annual Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) it's worth celebrating the remarkable progress made recently in the global fight against climate change, and the positive contribution of U.S. businesses in making it happen. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4th, four years ahead of schedule. Its rapid ratification by over 100 countries representing more than half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions demonstrates the commitment of participants to urgent action on climate change. Over 150 U.S. corporations publicly expressed support for the Paris agreement, representing more than $4.2 trillion in annual revenue and with a combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion. Last month, the International Civil Aviation Organization agreed to cap greenhouse gas emissions from international flights at 2020 levels, using market-based mechanisms to offset climate pollution from this rapidly growing sector. U.S. airlines welcomed the agreement as an effective complement to their own efforts to cut emissions through improvements to equipment, fuels and infrastructure, and as a unified global approach to achieving carbon-neutral growth from 2020 on. Also in October, negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed to an amendment to the Montreal Protocol that will phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), gases with 1,000 times the heat-trapping power of CO2. The agreement enjoyed the support of U.S. chemical companies that are developing environmentally preferable alternatives to HFCs, and is good news for companies everywhere that want to cut greenhouse gas emissions from their global supply chains. Business support for smart climate policy is key to the success of # COP22 Click To Tweet Powered By CoSchedule Business support was instrumental in reaching all three agreements, and will be critical to implementing them successfully. The good news is that leading companies are already taking action to help the U.S. meet its climate goals. To build on this great momentum, more companies need to take the next step in corporate climate leadership. Here are three ways business can step up: Setting ambitious GHG reduction goals. PepsiCo recently announced a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions at least 20% by 2025, joining Kellogg's, General Mills and Walmart in setting big goals to cut climate pollution from their supply chains. Almost 200 companies have joined the Science-Based Targets initiative, committing to reduce their GHG emissions in line with climate science. Scaling up renewable energy. Over 80 companies, including Apple, General Motors and Unilever have now joined RE100, an initiative to by committing to use 100% renewable energy sources. And the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance brings together three different initiatives working with break down barriers to large-scale renewable energy deployment. Together, these companies are leading the transition to a clean, low-carbon energy system. Shaping public policy. Leading businesses are looking beyond their fence lines and seeking to transform the systems in which they operate. By supporting climate and energy policies that impact entire sectors of the economy, they're having the biggest impact of all. Earlier this year, eight companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft filed amicus briefs supporting the Clean Power Plan. And private fleet owners, engine manufacturers and technology providers joined together to advocate for the new Clean Truck standards announced in August by the U.S. EPA and DOT. It will take the continued leadership of U.S. businesses to ensure that we stay on track to deliver on the promise of Paris, meeting our 2025 targets and bending the emissions curve even more steeply downward thereafter. Working together, businesses and policymakers can create a world in which a stable climate and thriving economy go hand in hand. \"

Smallholder farmers worldwide are clearly on the frontlines of climate change. But they are far from victims: they are small businesses and excellent clients for climate finance investments that can lead to positive change. By directing climate-sensitive investment towards smallholder farms, we can establish a critical mass of productive and resilient farming systems. When smallholders have better access to weather information, a more diversified asset base, and are better connected with institutional and financial networks, they can help us feed a growing planet.

In addition to her statement at the COP22 facilitative dialogue, the Secretary General also conducted a press conference, participated in the European Parliament COP22 side event, and undertook bilateral meetings with the high-level representatives present from governments and international organizations. \"

Having attended COP 15, 16 and 17, I was delighted to return to the 22nd Conference of the Parties on Climate Change. This year is a pivotal COP, focusing on implementing the historic Paris Agreement from 2015. The COP started with significant shudders as people around the world internalized America's decision to elect Donald Trump as President. Trump, after all, has not been a vocal proponent of the action needed to protect the planet from catastrophic climate change. What I found heartening in this year's COP experience is the continued resilience of climate negotiators, especially those from developing and small island states as well as the ongoing tenacity of NGOs that work valiantly on mitigation and adaptation efforts around the world. Even more so, I was proud of the business engagement. In a mere three days, Ceres, a non-profit organization advocating for sustainability leadership, coordinated an open letter from the business community indicating its support of the Paris Agreement. 365 companies signed on including DuPont, Gap Inc., General Mills, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hilton, HP Inc., Kellogg Company, Levi Strauss ...., L'Oreal USA, Mars Incorporated, Starbucks, VF Corporation, and Unilever. These companies represent over $100 million in annual revenue. Additionally, ten companies: Ben ...rry's, Clif Bar, Danone, Fetzer Vineyards, General Mills, Kellogg Company, Mars Incorporated, New Belgium Brewing Company, Stonyfield, and Unilever from the food ...verage space issued their own statement of support for the effort that is needed to protect us all from the devastating effects of warming in excess of 2 degrees.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA59","Euro-Mediterranean Region on Spotlight at COP22 Marrakech","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 11:45 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Committee of the Regions issued of news release: The Mediterranean is one of the world areas most vulnerable to global warming. As climate talks progress in Marrakech, Euro-Mediterranean local and regional authorities have gathered at COP22 to discuss how stronger cooperation in energy and sustainable economic development can boost growth while building resilience to climate change. The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) and the Euro-Mediterranean Local and Regional Assembly (ARLEM) are promoting the Covenant of Mayors during COP22 negotiations to show its value as a replicable model for the implementation of the Paris agreement and the low-carbon transition of territories. COP22 has hosted the second meeting of the Commission for Sustainable Territorial Development of ARLEM, composed of 80 local and regional representatives from the EU and 15 Mediterranean partners. Contributing to the ongoing climate talks in Marrakech, ARLEM has brought two thematic reports into the discussion table: 'Energy and climate change in the Mediterranean Region' by rapporteur Mohamed Sadiki, Mayor of Rabat and 'Cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean', drawn up by Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia. The meeting was chaired by Karim Bennour, President of the Popular Assembly of the Wilaya of Algiers. 'Cooperation in the energy sector and the transition towards a low-carbon economy can foster growth and stability in the Euro-Mediterranean region. We need to keep developing sustainable climate projects in energy, transport, forests, resilience, biodiversity and water that are viable and bankable', declared Mohamed Sadiki, Mayor of Rabat. 'We believe the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is the best placed institution to set up sustainable energy funds that boost public-private investments. We also call for an integrated and optimised regional energy market for the Euro-Mediterranean region', concluded Mohamed Sadiki. 'Recent political transformations in the Mediterranean are threatening economic development and social cohesion. Enhanced cross-boarder cooperation is key to foster economic dynamism, boost technology transfer and bring innovation forward to create jobs and reduce poverty', said President of Sardinia Francesco Pigliaru during ARLEM's meeting at COP22 .'For that purpose, it is essential to support efficient and effective decentralization processes and reinforce the capacities of local and regional authorities to lead cross-border cooperation programmes' added Francesco Pigliaru. The Region of Sardinia is since 2007 the leader of a 209 million EU programme on cross-boarder cooperation in the Mediterranean sea basin involving over 130 Regions from 13 Mediterranean Pigliaru's report is a concrete input to both COP22 climate discussions and the ongoing reform of the European Neighbourhood Policy. ARLEM is to adopt both reports in Malta in February 2017. The Euro-Mediterranean assembly will be present at the Union for the Mediterranean ministerial meeting on energy to be held 1 December 2016 in Rome. Ministers will discuss energy cooperation in the Mediterranean and the ways to scaling up energy investments in the region. As a replicable model to boost sustainable energy investments and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, the European Committee of the Regions presented the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy yesterday during COP22 . The objective is to stress the added value of the Covenant in the Southern Mediterranean, Sub-Saharan and Western African countries. The event saw a groundbreaking declaration from the Western African Economic and Monetary Union, committed to mobilize its 3300 municipalities to join the Covenant. The CoR will follow up with its partners and the European Commission on this exceptional commitment. A new multi-level governance that monitors the implementation of the Paris agreement and climate finance are the two main issues at stake in Marrakech. The conclusions of the COP22 climate negotiations are to be issued Friday 18 November. Background: EU's Assembly of local and regional representatives ARLEM brings together 80 Members from the EU and its 15 Mediterranean partners who are representatives of regions and local bodies and hold a regional or local authority mandate. ARLEM is chaired by a co-presidency equally representing the Mediterranean partners and the EU. The co-president from the Mediterranean partners' group is confirmed by consensus by that group for a period of two and a half years. The co-president from the EU is the CoR president-in-office. The current co-presidents are Mr. Markku Markkula, President of the Committee of the Regions and Mr. Hani Abdalmasih Al Hayek Mayor of BeitSahour, Palestine.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA60","MOROCCAN AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES COP 22 WITH OPEC SECRETARY GENERAL","August 19, 2016 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC): OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, recently received HE Ali El Mhamdi, Morocco's Ambassador/Permanent Representative in Vienna, Austria, during which the officials discussed the COP 22 climate change talks due to be hosted by the African Kingdom in November. HE El-Mhamdi, who was accompanied at the OPEC Secretariat by Ms. Maryem Haddaoui, Counsellor, began the meeting by congratulating HE Barkindo on his recent appointment as Secretary General. He stated that on behalf of his government and personally he wanted to extend his warmest congratulations and to offer HE Barkindo his best wishes for every success in his new post. ""I feel that OPEC is in the best of hands. We are facing challenging times and we need experience, and we need a high profile, both of which you have,"" he said. HE El-Mhamdi said that apart from wanting to wish HE Barkindo well in his new responsibilities, his visit was also in connection with the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) meeting to be held in Morocco on 7-18 November 2016. ""It is a tremendous event for us and I have been instructed by my government to conduct an outreach campaign for OPEC as I know already that the Organization will again be involved in the talks,"" he affirmed. In thanking the Ambassador for his kind words and support, HE Barkindo pointed out that the climate change meetings were a priority for OPEC since the Organization had been involved in the negotiations since the establishment of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee by the United Nations General Assembly in 1991. It was this Committee that negotiated the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The Treaty entered into force in March 1994 and was presented to the first Conference of the Parties (COP1) meeting in Berlin, in 1995. ""The convention was the bible of our negotiations,"" commented Barkindo, adding that it led to the Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997 and entered into force in February 2005. ""All this was made possible because of the active and constructive participation of all developing countries and OPEC,"" he maintained. Barkindo pointed out that he had been Vice President at COP 1 in Berlin, working alongside former research scientist Angela Merkel, the current German Chancellor. ""I actually attended and negotiated as Vice Present on several occasions from COP 1 in Berlin to COP 15 in Copenhagen. So you can see that these negotiations are very personal to me."" He was obviously delighted that the Paris Agreement, seen as a major breakthrough in the climate change debate, was reached at COP 21 in Paris in 2015. Turning to Morocco and the host of COP 22 , HE Barkindo said he not only considered the Kingdom dear as an African nation, but also as a key developing country that had participated very closely in crafting the convention as well as the Kyoto Treaty in Japan. ""I know the position of Morocco very well and it is similar to most developing countries and OPEC,"" he stated. HE Barkindo reiterated that OPEC had been actively involved in all the COP meetings and the Secretary General regularly participated in the high-level segment of the discussions, held towards the end of each conference. ""We intend to continue with this tradition in Marrakesh. Our experts and officials will have a meeting room there and they will convene meetings for OPEC Member Countries and other developing states. It is very important for the OPEC Secretariat to be in Marrakesh and I personally look forward to attending the high-level segment,"" he stated. He stressed that Morocco was already an important contributor to the climate change negotiations having convened an earlier meeting in Marrakesh, which he attended, and at which the Marrakesh Accord, a very important agreement in the process after Kyoto, was agreed upon. HE Barkindo told his guests that with the likely attendance of some 200 countries, COP22 would be a heavy responsibility. But he was confident that Morocco, with its long and proud history, and Marrakesh, with all its experience of hosting previous high-level international meetings, would prove the ideal setting for the talks. ""All OPEC delegates will be supportive of the efforts of the Moroccan Presidency at COP 22 ,"" he assured. Also addressing the meeting, Ms. Haddaoui observed that in connection with COP 22 the Moroccan Presidency was working very closely with the French Presidency that hosted COP 21 in 2015, in order to maintain the same high standards set by the French authorities. ""It is very important ahead of COP 22 that we know the expectations of OPEC and its Member Countries and to make sure that all countries' views, visions and points of view are considered. We therefore look forward to keeping very close contacts with OPEC to enable us to get a better understanding of what the Organization requires. Hopefully this is just the first in a series of meetings on the subject,"" she said. Ms. Haddaoui presented the Secretary General with up-to-date information from the Moroccan Presidency concerning all aspects of COP 22 , listing its priorities, its vision, its overall aims and objectives, in addition to the organizational aspects and general information. She also pointed to the website of COP 22 which offered valuable information about all the meetings due to be held in the lead up to the main conference. HE Barkindo invited his visitors to attend OPEC's customary pre-COP Coordination Meeting in October, adding that this would be attended by COP negotiators from OPEC Member Countries who would benefit from the views of officials representing the Moroccan Presidency. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA61","COP-22: Developing Nations Seek Acceleration of Climate Action","November 29, 2016 Tuesday 6:25 PM GMT","iCrowdNewswire (English)","Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, Manasvi Srisodapol, Special Representative of the chair of the Group of 77, told the joint closing plenary of the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP-22 ) in Marrakech that the needs of the developing countries should be given the highest priority for two reasons: [...] By an IPS Correspondent UNITED NATIONS, Nov 29 2016 (IPS/G77) Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, Manasvi Srisodapol, Special Representative of the chair of the Group of 77, told the joint closing plenary of the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP-22 ) in Marrakech that the needs of the developing countries should be given the highest priority for two reasons: they bear the brunt of the increasing adverse effects of climate change, and they are also the least equipped to cope with this problem on their own. It is of utmost importance for us to send a clear message to the global community that we must all be part of the global climate solution, he said at the conclusion of the meeting on November 18. We are pleased that the Marrakech Conference was able to achieve some clarity, and good progress has been made. This include the adoption of the Terms of Reference and initial work plan for the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB); the established linkage between technology mechanism and the financial mechanism; the indicative framework for the five-year rolling work plan of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM); and the conclusion of the Third Comprehensive Review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building under the Convention and under the Kyoto Protocol. Nonetheless, he warned, there remain outstanding issues which require further discussion after Marrakech. The Group has placed a priority on scaling up of finance, in particular adaptation finance. There can be no enhanced action without enhanced support. Support enables action and action needs support. Enhanced action needs enhanced support in the provision of scaled-up financial resources, technology and capacity-building. Action must cover both adaptation and mitigation, the Special Representative declared. He reiterated that adaptation is a matter of urgency for developing countries whose capacities to carry out actions to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change are limited. We therefore urge that progress in implementing the Paris Agreement must reflect balance between adaptation and mitigation. He said: We came to Marrakech with a challenging task, the challenge of turning agreements into action. COP22 can indeed be considered a COP for action . The speedy and unprecedented entry into force of the Paris Agreement signals the level of urgency and importance with which our leaders and the international community attach to combating climate change. We are here to accelerate climate actions, and this has been underscored by the Marrakesh Action Proclamation which we endorsed yesterday and the tireless efforts of the High Level Champions over the past year. After nearly four years, only 73 parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance to the Doha Amendment. The Group reiterates that the unfinished business of the pre-2020 actions and ambition, which are long overdue, must be urgently addressed. The Group sees the Kyoto Protocol as a fundamental building block in its post-2020 efforts. We urge all Parties that have not done so to ratify the Doha Amendment expeditiously. Meanwhile, speaking earlier on behalf of Group of 77 and China, Surasak Karnjanarat, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Kingdom of Thailand, declared that countries of the Group of 77 and China have been the most affected by the adverse impacts of climate change. Yet we are taking ambitious measures in line with our capacities. Developed countries must support our endeavors, he said. Reiterating the G77 stand, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. The Climate Change Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November 2016, was years ahead of expectations, Ban said, with 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions having ratified the agreement. The Secretary-General applauded the bold leadership shown by many of the world s most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. Karnjanarat said the Group of 77 would like to highlight the implementation phase of the Paris Agreement, as applicable to Parties that ratify the Agreement: First, the delicate balance achieved in Paris must be preserved. It is crucial to ensure transparency, inclusiveness, Party-driven process, and balance of all issues and across all work plans of subsidiary bodies. We must reaffirm the provisions and principles of the Convention, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as reflected in the Paris Agreement. Second, there is an urgent need to enhance the pre-2020 ambition, including the expeditious ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to provide a strong basis for post-2020 efforts under the Paris Agreement. Third, capacity-building support for climate action is critical for developing countries and should be based on and responsive to national needs, foster country ownership, participatory, and cross-cutting. Fourth, developing countries require additional, adequate, predictable and sustainable climate financing to transform our economies to climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions. The Group noted the efforts by developed countries for the formulation of a roadmap to achieve the floor of $100 billion per year by 2020. We reiterate our call for developed country Parties to enhance ambition on the provision and mobilization of support, and to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation finance, including by setting a target to quadruple resources allocated to adaptation from public and grant-based sources by 2020. Fifth, technology development and transfer is also vital. Technology mechanism needs to be enhanced to support the rapid transfer of technologies from developed countries to developing countries, helping them to innovate and develop their own technologies. Concrete enhanced actions on technology development and transfer and strengthening of the linkages between the technology mechanism and the financial mechanism is required. He also pointed out that direct access of all developing country parties of the convention and Paris Agreement to means of implementation, including finance, technology transfer and capacity building provided by multilateral supporting mechanism, should be simplified and granted. For us, adaptation remains a priority. Developing countries are the least contributors to climate change, however, we are the most affected. In order to increase adaptive capacity and resilience, we require the implementation of guarantees of the Paris Agreement in terms of the means of implementation . He said the Group remains ever committed to addressing climate change and looks forward to a clear and strong outcome of COP22 . At the conclusion at COP-22 , the Secretary-General said decisions adopted in Marrakech powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible. He noted that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General said, pointing out that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA62","COP22 - IT'S NOW TIME TO ACT!","November 16, 2016 Wednesday 5:34 PM  EST","US State News","BRUSSELS, Belgium, Nov. 16 -- The European Union's European Economic and Social Committee issued the following press release: COP22 (Conference of the Parties) is taking place in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7-18 November 2016. The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 December 2015 set out the long-term goal of limiting global warming ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C"". With its recent ratification by several countries and the EU, it officially entered into force on 4 November 2016. The EESC welcomes this historical event and calls on both the Parties to the Paris Agreement as well as the non-state actors to make every effort to turn the Marrakesh session into a true COP of Action. ""The adoption was just the first step... now it has to be urgently implemented. Failure is not an option, for the sake of future generations"", said Isabel Cano Aguilar, member of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) delegation to COP22 . The EESC is participating in the COP22 as an observer in the official EU delegation in order to promote the concept of a new climate governance model with a crucial role played by non-state actors. The EESC is taking part in many discussions on this topic and organising side events with civil society organisations such as the Climate Chance Association, the Economic, Social and Environmental Council of Morocco and Galvanising the Groundswell of Climate Actions. The delegation is also focusing its efforts on inter-institutional dialogue with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Committee of the Regions in order to highlight the importance of adopting a new governance framework, enabling civil society organisations and local communities to engage in climate action, and thus tap into the enormous potential of citizen involvement. To accomplish the goals of the agreement, Michel Dubromel, member of the EESC delegation, emphasised the need to explore the huge potential of organised civil society by minimising the obstacles standing in the way of concrete local climate action. ""We must identify the mechanisms and measures for organised civil society to be truly involved and for climate action to deliver massively, while proposing elements of a new climate governance infrastructure."" That is why the EESC and its partners - the European Committee of the Regions (CoR), the French Committee for Sustainable Development (Committee 21 France - C21F) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) decided to work together to create a new international coalition on climate for multi-level and multi-stakeholder governance. The coalition is looking into the conditions for success of climate actions by non-state actors, possibilities for replicating valuable initiatives as well as the potential hurdles to be overcome. Stefan Back, member of the EESC delegation at COP22 , said: ""The EESC is fighting for a framework - based on the principles of ""bottom-up climate action"" and ""think global, act local"" - that acknowledges the variety of roles played by civil society stakeholders, recognises their different levels of resources, takes factors of success into account and creates positive and real conditions for climate action"".

Nothing except pretend that the issue is being dealt with by someone else, on the ground. Inner City Press asked Ban Ki-moon's deputy spokesman Farhan Haq, again on November 14, transcript here:Inner City Press: I wanted to ask you about COP22 . One, I wanted to ask, you'd said, I think, on Friday that you that that the Secretariat, I guess was in contact with, I don't know if it was UNFCCC or the Moroccan authorities about this accredited attendee Suleima Barouk [Beiruk]. Seems like she's still not arrived, unless you have different information. I wanted to know, what has the UN done given that her accreditation has been published, is, is ,exists, and the only grounds for blocking her was her ac her self-identification as being from Western Sahara?Deputy Spokesman: Well, like I said, we had been told that the issue is, is being worked out on ground, so I believe that that should be, hopefully, resolved there and you can, you can ask the COP22 organizers how that's working.ICP Question: UNFCCC, well, I asked UNFCCC, and Mr. Nuttall had said that, basically, Morocco said because she's self-identified as Western Sahara, she's not coming. So I wanted to know, from your perspective, given that that was the last that it was, I've heard from anyone on Friday, from the perspective of the Secretariat, given that the Secretary-General is there and giving a speech, is it the kind of thing that he expects to raise, if not with the King, to somebody that his stated goal about NGOs is, in fact, not being respected?Deputy Spokesman: Well, we certainly want our stated goals about the representation of NGOs, including all of those who are accredited NGOs, to be respected. That's the point of principle. I do believe the discussions had been continuing on the ground, and, hopefully, they'll be able to resolve it there. Yeah. Yeah.Ban gave in to Morocco's demand to pull out 83 members of its MINURSO mission in Western Sahara and has yet to get most of the returned.Now Ban's UN is proposing to give in further, sources have exclusively told Inner City Press, even as it has been restricted to minders in the UN since\~being ousted[1]\~without due process[2]\~in February by\~Spain's highest UN official, Cristina Gallach.[3]And Morocco's Ambassador\~Omar Hilale[4]\~on November 7 approached Inner City Press and said he understands and agrees with those who ""have a problem"" with Inner City Press, and that the parliamentarian banned from attending COP 22 in Morocco was not accredited by the UN.\~Audio here.[5]But a document Inner City Press has obtained and\~published on Scribd, here,\~[6]shows the individual has been accredited by the UNFCCC. While Ban's spokespeople have told Inner City Press to £sk UNFCCC' and that Ban's Secretariat has been speaking with UNFCCC about Ms Beirouk's situation because Ban believes all accreditees should be able to attend, the UNFCC's timely response to Inner City Press leaves unclear if she will continue to be Banned. Inner City Press asked:'Please state UNFCCC's understanding of the status of Ms. Beirouk, and position on Morocco blocking her attendance. Separately, since UNFCCC's logo is used on COP22 .ma, please state UNFCCC's position and action on the statements on that website about Morocco having a border with Mauritania and a land mass that includes Western Sahara.' UNFCCC's spokesperson Nick Nuttal responded:'Dear Mathew, This is our understanding of the situation. When we (UNFCCC) heard about this situation, we sought clarification from the Moroccan Government. We were advised that the Ms Beirouk was travelling on an African Union passport and specified her nationality as Western Sahara and for Morocco this is not considered a valid travel document. We were also advised that Ms Beirouk has a Spanish passport and has traveled freely in and out of Morocco on that many times. Mathew as for your second questions I don't know the answer right now and need to ask one of our experts. I'll get back as quickly as I can.' It's appreciated. First, the claim that Ms.Beirouk is not accredited appears to be false. Second, if the only Ban is Morocco's position on her passport, then Ban should act on what his spokespeople say his position is. We'll have more on this.

I've been told that you can't get one until you actually get to the grounds. Is the Pan-African Parliamentarian go ahead. Did you look into it?Spokesman Dujarric: I didn't get any details about this particular case, but, clearly, when you attend any conference, whether you're a journalist or whether you are an NGO or delegate, you apply for the accreditation ahead of time, and you usually get a receipt, an email or so on. Obviously, the physical accreditation you pick up online, but again, I will try to get details.

But former star\~Diego Maradona was transported to Western Sahara, see below.[11]And the now map-less site still contains dubious ""information"" about Morocco such as a border with Mauritania,\~see here.[12]And on November 6, Moroccan authorities reported forced the Vice-President of the African Parliament, Suelma Beirouk, to be detained in htne to leave the airport in Marrakech, aboard a plane to Casa Blanca, where they are expected to seek further return to Algiers.The Pan-African Parliament was part of the preparatory committee for COP 21 - now this, from the ""host"" of COP 22 .On November 7 Inner City Press asked Ban Ki-moon's spokesman\~Stephane Dujarric[13]\~about the banning of Suelma Beirouk; he said he had no information, adding generally that people should have a right to attend COP 22 . Video here.\~[14]But four hours later on November 7, Morocco's Ambassador to the UN Omar Hilale called Inner City Press over at the UN Security Council stakeout and said among other things that Keirouk was not accreditted by the UN. Hillale also said to Inner City Press:You are focusing only on Morocco (despite stories on\~Kenya,[15]\~Yemen[16]etc);Have you said anything about the police killing people here? (Well,\~yes[17]);You are not looking to other situations (see Yemen[18], and\~UN nepotism[19]); and""I understand why many people have problems here with you.""\~Audio here,\~[20]just as Inner City Press has previously run audio and photos of Hilale at and around the UN Security Council stakeout. \~ HYPERLINK https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291983667...o;_play=false...e;_related=false...w;_comments=true...w;_user=true...w;_reposts=false...ual;=true https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291983667...o;_play=false...e;_related=false...w;_comments=true...w;_user=true...w;_reposts=false...ual;=true [21]We'll have more on this - and now it relates to ongoing targeted restrictions on Inner City Press in the UN. Play Video[22]So what will be said about this Banning? We'll have more on this.On September 22, when Inner City Press asked Morocco's foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar about MINURSO it was told it is already 'fully functional.""But when Inner City Press asked Ban Ki-moon's deputy spokesman Farhan Haq how many of the 83 expelled staff are back, the answer was only 25. UN transcript below.With Ban headed to Morocco for COP22 -- when Inner City Press asked, his lead spokesman Stephane Dujarric had no substantive comment on the killing of the fish seller Fikri,\~Vine video here[23]\~-- Inner City Press asked Ban's lead spokesman Stephane Dujarric about Morocco's COP22 .ma website, see belowPlay Video[24] This website, replete with UN / UNFCCC logos, until it was changed over the weekend had a map which portrayed Western Sahara as part of Morocco.\~See map [was] here.[25]On November 4, Inner City Press for the third time asked Ban's spokesman Stephane Dujarric,\~video here,[26]\~UN transcript here:\~[27]Inner City Press: I'm going to ask you again about this issue of the, the UNFCCC the COP22 where the Secretary-General was going and this website. You said it was a very legitimate question. What is the answer by OLA [Office of Legal Affairs] whether UNFCCC logo can be used for a map that portrays Western Sahara?[inaudible]Spokesman: I haven't first of all, the website is, the cop22 .ma website is run by the Moroccan presidency of COP [Conference of Parties]. Right? We, obviously, the Moroccans are a partner in organising the COP. UNFCCC has its own website. I haven't seen any maps on the COP22 website but I'm happy to see them. The UN's position on Western Sahara remains unchanged regardless of what is maybe on any website.ICP Question: I guess I'm asking because there have been recent comments by Hans Corell, the former head of OLA, saying that the whole thing is is that these... both the turbines in Western Sahara and their portrayal are legally problematic, so I'm just[inaudible]Spokesman: The UN's position has not changed.But the projects are in violation of international law and UN principles for responsible business according to the former UN Legal Counsel under Kofi Annan, Hans Corell of Sweden, done without properly consulting the people of Western Sahara or ensuring that they are the ones profiting from the wind energy. Corell has added that Morocco's invasion of Western Sahara, and the transfer of own citizens to the territory could be in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.After Inner City Press' noon briefing questions, the redesigned COP22 .ma website dropped the map. But\~here's Maradona[28]\~- we'll have more on this.A report has been issued about the exploitation of Western Sahara by the King and German firm Siemens and Italian firm Enel,\~here.[29]Morocco uses its COP22 website to greenwash projects that are, in fact, in Western Sahara,\~see here.\~[30]On November 2, Inner City Press asked Ban's spokesman Dujarric,\~Video here;[31]\~UN Transcript here:[32]\~Inner City Press: What I wanted to ask you is, as the Secretary-General prepares to go to COP (Conference of Parties) 22 in Morocco, it has emerged that that on the website cop22 .ma, there are a number of projects that are, in fact, in Western Sahara. These are projects carried out by Siemen's and NL [Enel]... they're in a territory that's listed in the Fourth Committee. So I wanted to know, what's the Secretary-General's view of these sustainable energy, quote-unquote, projects done by Morocco in throughout Western Sahara? And should they be on the COP22 website? And should UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] be giving a a CDM certificates for them?Spokesman: Let me take a look at the website. I don't know if it's a website run by the UN or by the Moroccan Presidency. SoICP Question: What about UNFCCC? Should they be giving these CDM certificates for projects that are, in fact, built in contested territory?Spokesman: I have to Let me take a look at it before I say anything. We're waiting.The corporatization of the UN under Ban, whose mentor Han Seung-soo is at once a\~UN official and on the boards of directors of South Korean firm Doosan and Standard Chartered Bank[33], has become a scandal;\~ouster and eviction of the Press by Ban's head of communications Cristina Gallach[34]\~of Spain has sought to hinder such coverage,\~piece in Spanish here.[35]\~What will Ban say about this illegal exploitation of Western Sahara under the fig leaf of renewable energy? Watch this site.On October 25, Inner City Press again asked Ban's spokesman Stephane Dujarric,\~UN transcript here:\~[36]Inner City Press: on Western Sahara, I'd asked you yesterday to respond to reports that there was police brutality in Laayoune before Mr right on the eve of Ladsous' visit. You said you might have a readout. So I heard the readout, and thanks for the readout. But, is there a MINURSO response to published reports that people were swept inside?Spokesman: I don't have anything. But he did say Ladsous is in Paris.On October 24, Inner City Press asked Ban's spokesman Stephane Dujarric,\~UN transcript here:\~[37]Inner City Press: I wanted to ask you on Western Sahara and/or Morocco, since Mr. Ladsous went there. First, there are reports of, quote, police brutality in Laayoune on the eve of Mr. Ladsous' arrival, people protesting being being abused by the police. There was also I saw that, I think, at least one of Mr. Ladsous' announced meetings in Morocco did not, in fact, take place. Do you have a readout of the meeting? And what's the response by MINURSO, which apparently is at least still in Laayoune to these reports of?Spokesman: I don't have an update on his travels, but I do expect one shortly. Five hour later and counting, nothing.On October 18, Inner City Press asked Ban's outgoing lead spokesman Stephane Dujarric,\~UN transcript here:\~[38]Inner City Press: I wanted to ask you first about the Security Council today. It was said that that there's no plan Uruguay helpfully was spoke before and after the meeting. No one else spoke including well, from the Secretariat side. So, I wanted to ask you, one of the things that the Permanent Representative of Uruguay said is that there's no time scheduled for [Christopher] Ross to return to the region. He described the political process as entirely stalemated, but did say that Ban Ki-moon will go to Rabat before he goes to Marrakesh, which I'd asked you about before. So, I wanted to know, from the Secretariat side, given that his envoy, Ross, is apparently blocked from going to the region, what does the Secretary-General seek to accomplish in Rabat during that stop? And can you provide us now a number of how is it still at 25? What is the force level? And can you explain why it is that new staff are being recruited for MINURSO [United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara]? I understand that there's some who have retired, that left, but there seem to be a certain number that neither retired nor were reassigned that are simply being paid to not be back there. And was Morocco allowed to hand-pick which people can return?Spokesman: No, the choice of who works for the United Nations is the choice of the United Nations. The special a trip for Mr. Ross is still under discussion. As soon as we have something to announce, we will do so. The Secretary-General, no surprise, is very likely to attend and will be in Marrakesh for COP-22 . I think that's fairly pretty much an open secret. We'll announce it officially a little closer to the date. And we will be in a position closer to the date to announce any bilateral visit that takes place with Moroccan authorities, but I can't confirm anything at this point.ICP Question: But, again, I guess I wanted to know, I mean, you're saying that the UN makes its own selection, but how can you explain people that were ousted among the 83 still being paid to not return when you're, in fact, recruiting new people?Spokesman: The listen, none of us here have the exact details of people's hiring or all the jobs that are being recruited and so forth. The Mission, as far as I understand, is still not up to full capacity, and we continue to work towards that end. Well, Inner City Press is informed as follows by sources:""17 staff members still remain removed from the Mission of MINURSO following the SG's comments while on a trip to the Tindouf camps in March 2016, the UN chief had described Morocco's presence in Western Sahara as an ""occupation"".Now we see recruitment of new staff members taking place with no movement on returning of the effected staff. There is no understanding why recruitment is taking place at all levels while committed staff are effectively paid to sit at home whilst absolutely wishing to return to work.ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT, FS4, 68069, Deadline: 25/10/2016, Department of Peacekeeping Operations, LAAYOUNE,The staff federations and unions are continuously endeavoring to get the UN to return the staff to Mission so that it returns to full functionality as per the Security Council resolution. It is unclear if this is the United Nations blocking the return of staff or the Moroccan government, no one will answer this question and the staff have no clear picture of their futures as peacekeepers. Staff have families and children who were in school in Morocco, staff abandoned in countries due to not being able to return to go on and belongings, property etc remain in country.""On October 7, Inner City Press asked Haq,\~UN transcript here:\~[39]Inner City Press: this is now the fourth time. I guess it will be the last time. I wanted to know, there was a letter that the Frente Polisario says, and has told all of the 193 members of the Fourth Committee, that it sent to the Secretary-General on 26 September about an election that's now being held today, 7 October, in Morocco, and it's also being held in Western Sahara, including this disputed territory in their parliamentary election or legislative election. I wanted to know just did did was it ever checked? It was said three times that you'd check if the letter was received. Was it received?Deputy Spokesman: I've asked. I don't have any information on this at this point.ICP Question: So they're mis\~Deputy Spokesman: No. I don't have any information. I asked a question. I need an answer.ICP Question: Then I guess my question would be: Given that the UN's historic and mandated role on the question of Western Sahara, does it believe it legitimate for Morocco to conduct a poll for its own legislature in an area that's on the agenda of the Fourth Committee and is viewed as its status as being unresolved?Deputy Spokesman: Well, as I've mentioned, I'm asking, and I'm waiting for a response. I'll have to see what I get.ICP Question: The election is almost done.Deputy Spokesman: I can't speak out before I get an answer.ICP Question: Who are you asking? Are you asking DPA (Department of Political Affairs), the office of [Christopher) Ross; who should I ask?Deputy Spokesman: I've asked a number of offices. I've gotten nothing so far.On September 28, Inner City Press asked the UN's lead spokesman Stephane Dujarric if Christopher Ross will travel tot he region, if Ban will meeting on the topic in the region before the climate change meeting in Morocco, and what's the plan to get the peacekeepers back. He referred vaguely to an ""upward"" direction.The POLISARIO Front has written to Ban to complain that Morocco intends to include Western Sahara in its legislative elections on October 7. Inner City Press\~tweeted the letter, from the 38th floor, here[40]. Ban is asked to ""intervene immediately."" But on September 28 Ban gave a speech apparently not listed on his schedule, on at October 7 he will be traveling.When Inner City Press asked Ban's spokesman Dujarric about the letter on September 29, Dujarric said he hadn't seen it but ""could"" follow up - but didn't, by the end of the day.\~Vine video[41].So Inner City Press had to ask again, on October 3 -- still nothing on the letter, but there are still only 25 of the 83 returned.\~From the October 3 transcript:\~[42]Inner City Press: I asked last week a couple of times about this letter that was distributed in the Fourth Committee from the from the Polisario Front to the Secretary-General, dated 26 September, and I just wanted twice I guess St\'e9phane [Dujarric] said he hadn't seen it, but I just want to make sure, if it's being given out in the Committee, did it, in fact, reach the Secretariat about this upcoming legislative elections on 7 October? And also, I'd asked him and may have asked you before, just to be maybe you'd said 25 is the number. Is it still the number of only 25 of the 83 have been returned?Deputy Spokesman: Yeah, that's where we stand. We continue to discuss, like I said, different ways of making sure that the functions of the mission are restored, but as I pointed out last week, we're not at full functionality.Question: Sure, and what about this letter? Is there some problem with was it not received? Because I asked him twice. It was handed out. It says it asks the Secretary-General to get involved in the inclusion of Western Sahara in the Moroccan legislative elections on 7 October. So since we're now 3 October, I'm just wondering, not if he'll do it, but at least, has he gotten the letter, or will he do something?Deputy Spokesman: I'll check whether we have it and what sort of response there is.\~ Seven hours later -- nothing.UN September 29 transcript:\~[43]Inner City Press: there's a letter from from the Polisario Front to the Secretary-General dated 26 September, and they're saying that the the protesting that that Morocco would include Western Sahara in its legislative elections on 7 October. And they've asked him to get involved. I wanted to know they passed it out at [inaudible] to the Fourth Committee. It seems to beSpokesman: I haven't seen the letter. But I can follow up.Then to the end of the day, nothing. This is typical of Ban's Secretariat, including ""Communications"" chief Cristina Gallach,\~Spanish blog here.[44]Earlier transcript:Inner City Press: last week, I'd asked St\'e9phane [Dujarric] just to provide the number, of the 83 MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) staff who had been ejected or evicted or ousted from Western Sahara, how many have returned. Do you have that number?Deputy Spokesman: Well, in terms of that, I don't have numbers to add to the initial group of the 25 international civilian personnel, who returned by 26 July. However, the UN Secretariat and the Mission continue to expedite the recruitment process of existing vacancies. The mine action component of the mission has also finalized its relocation to Tindouf, in order to resume its operational activities. In terms of routine, the Mission continues to operate under existing arrangements and procedures. Full functionality has not been fully restored.ICP Question: Great. Thanks. I guess I just wanted to understand, is there so you're the the the people that were actually working there at the time that were told to leave, are they going back, or are you just recruiting new people for positions that were already vacated at the time that they were ousted? I just want to understand.Deputy Spokesman: Well, some of the people the lists had a number of discrepancies. Some of the people who they had asked to leave had been gone for some time, had gone on to other jobs or been had gone back to other areas. At this stage, what we're trying to do is do the recruitment to make sure that all of the tasks that are needed to be performed are fulfilled by people.Back on September 22 Ban's lead spokesman Dujarric would not comment on this. From the UN transcript:Inner City Press: On Western Sahara, just now, earlier this morning, the Foreign Minister of Morocco said flatly that full functionality has been restored. And so, I wanted to know, from the Secretariat side, have all 83 been returned? What is the number? Just factually.Spokesman: I have no I mean, I heard what the Foreign Minister said. I'm not going to comment on what he said. I will get you an update of what the staffing level is on MINURSO [United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara] as soon as I can get one.Seven hours later, nothing.

Weisenmiller expressed support for the United States\' long-term vision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent or more by 2050. On November 16, the U.S. submitted the Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Canada, Germany and Mexico are the other countries that have submitted strategies. The U.S. was among the first countries to submit a long-term climate change strategies to the UN as part of the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year. The Paris Agreement calls for limiting the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius or even 1.5 degrees Celsius. Under the Paris agreement, the U.S. pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The long-term strategy, which builds upon the existing pledge, states that the U.S.  can meet the growing demands on its energy system and lands while achieving a low-emissions pathway, maintaining a thriving economy, and ensuring a just transition for Americans whose livelihoods are connected to fossil fuel production and use.  Making that transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy nationally would mean investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and zero-emission vehicles, policies that California has adopted to combat climate change, Weisenmiller said. On the final day of the Marrakesh climate change conference, California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., Oregon Governor Kate Brown, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and British Columbia Premier Christy Clark issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to climate action.  Today, as COP22 comes to a close \- two weeks after the Paris Agreement came into force \- leaders from across the globe have renewed their commitment to climate action. In California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia \- from the Mexican border to the edge of the Yukon Territory \- we stand with the international community. Our success demonstrates that taking action on climate change goes hand-in-hand with robust job creation and a thriving clean energy economy, said part of the November 18 statement. California is a world leader in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants. State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\'f3n (D-Los Angeles) led a delegation of California officials who attended COP22 .  California has ambitious climate goals, but only represent 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emission, so it is imperative that we reach out to partners at the subnational and national levels if we have any chance of slowing climate change, said Weisenmiller. Last year, California and Baden-W\'fcrttemberg, Germany formed the Under2 Coalition \- an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. With 29 new members added at a signing ceremony at Marrakesh, a total of 165 jurisdictions have joined the coalition representing more than a billion people and $25.7 trillion in combined gross domestic product \- more than one-third of the global economy. This year, Brown signed Senate Bill 32, which requires California reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Last October, he signed SB 350 to double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings and generate half of the state\' s electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA66","STATEMENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON COP 22","November 18, 2016 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by United Nations Secretary-General: The Secretary-General welcomes the outcome of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) that concluded today in Marrakech, Morocco. At the Conference, Governments, many represented at the highest level, issued the Marrakech Action Proclamation. This, as well as decisions adopted in Marrakech, powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible. The Secretary-General notes that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In Marrakech, Parties advanced on the rule book for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, years ahead of expectations. As of today, 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions have ratified the agreement. The Secretary-General applauds the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA67","COP22: DEVELOPING NATIONS LEAD WAY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE","November 23, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the BirdLife International: By Alex Dale It's been a little under a month since the Paris Agreement a historic international agreement between countries to battle climate change became legally-binding, three whole years ahead of schedule. But despite the unprecedented speed and urgency with which the Paris Agreement has been ratified (11 more governments, including Australia, Japan and the UK, ratified the agreement over the past two weeks, taking the running total to 112 Parties), the looming threat of climate change should still have the world's governments feeling a little hot under the collar. This is because the planet is giving us all a deadline that can't be pushed back or negotiated. Rising temperatures mean we are already edging perilously close to the 1.5\'cbC global increase on pre-industrial levels. Already we are seeing pervasive impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services and communities worldwide, and it is clear that with the Paris Agreement ratified, the pressure is now on to turn that passion and promise into real action. And real action was the theme at COP 22 (the 22nd Conference of the Parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), the first COP since the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreement. COP22 , which took place in Marrakesh, Morocco between 7-18th November, promised to be a 'COP of action', building on the Paris Agreement's momentum by laying out the rules, guidance and technicalities needed to implement the treaty's ambitious, globe-spanning aims. ""The job here in Marrakesh was to get down to the nitty gritty and develop the rulebook to ensure effective implementation of the agreement"" says Edward Perry, Global Climate Change Policy Coordinator, BirdLife International. ""While there was some good progress in areas, much more work will be needed next year if we are to capitalise on the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement."" One area where further progress will be needed is climate finance: ""Finance continues to be a stumbling block in the negotiations, with some developed countries shirking their responsibilities"", said Pepe Clarke, Head of Policy at BirdLife International. ""For the Paris agreement to work, rich countries will need to give developing countries the money they need to protect their vulnerable communities and ecosystems."" In one of the main positives to come from summit in Marrakesh, 43 of the developing nations most threatened by climate change who together form the Climate Vulnerable Forum committed to transitioning to 100% Renewable Energy. And this despite being among the most vulnerable nations on Earth who have contributed the least to climate change. We need to see more of this strong leadership going forward if we are to protect vulnerable communities and nature from catastrophic climate change. While the world continues to make progress in addressing climate change, current efforts are not sufficient. ""While we welcome the continued progress and constructive spirit of the climate negotiations, it is important to remember that our current trajectory is taking us towards catastrophic climate change"" says Perry. ""To hold global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, governments must do much more to keep fossil fuels in the ground, to protect our forests and oceans and to restore our degraded lands. And they must do it now. Delaying action is not an option."" ""The climate talks in Marrakesh demonstrated that governments are committed to implement the Paris Agreement despite of any political shocks or uncertainties"", says Melanie Heath, Director of Science and Policy at BirdLife International, ""The powerful momentum to implement the Agreement, increase ambition and address climate change cannot be stopped"". \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA68","COP22: Business Leadership Will Be Central in Carrying the Climate Agenda Forward","December 21, 2016 Wednesday 2:44 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Dec 21, 2016( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP22 ) in November celebrated the entry of the Paris Agreement into force, already ratified by 111 countries. CBRE's Anastasiya Kostomarova, a member of the UN\~Sustainable Development Solutions Network - Youth, reflects on her time at the conference. This year's gathering marked the moment when countries reaffirmed their commitment to the deal and agreed that the intricacies of its implementation will be worked out by 2018, instead of 2020.\~With governments coming to terms with the fact that it is now time to roll up the sleeves and put detailed strategies and technological roadmaps for net zero emissions into place, the atmosphere in Marrakech clearly indicated a shift in dialogue towards concrete solutions that deliver drastic carbon emissions reductions, consistent with the 2\'b0C threshold. This was the very focus of the Low-Emissions Solutions Conference (LESC), co-organized by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the Government of Marrakech, and International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), in partnership with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The conference brought together over 700 participants  among them world-leading scientists, engineers and experts, business and industry leaders, and governments  to discuss latest technological innovations and best practices for achieving a low-carbon economy. The conference featured 18 technology sessions; from energy efficiency and sustainable materials, to low-carbon freight and shipping. Each session was ripe with examples that the business community is increasingly invested in both reducing its carbon footprint, and seizing opportunities offered by the transition to the low-carbon economy. As of last month  just two years following its launch  200 companies with a $4.8 trillion in market value have joined the Science Based Targets initiative. At the LESC session on ICT, Frances Way  COO of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)  said that alongside concerns around reputational risk and mandatory compliance, for example in product efficiency regulations, what they observe is a growing recognition of a clear business case for reducing carbon footprint: a 10% increase in electricity costs could add as much as US$4-10 million per annum in operating costs for ICT companies, while energy efficiency and conservation has brought CDP participants over billion of dollars of savings[1][2]. General Motors alone estimates that investment in clean energy and conservation is already saving the company US$5 million annually[2][3]. Eric Rondolat, CEO of Philips Lighting, pointed out that ICT developments are strengthening the appeal of energy efficiency in delivering savings, with technologies such as motion sensors enabling up to half of the 80% potential efficiency savings in lighting systems. Moreover, Frances Way emphasized that companies are now starting to look beyond Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; for instance, eleven ICT companies that have joined the CDP supply chain program have collectively engaged with more than 250 suppliers in Asia[3][4]. In a time of political uncertainty, with the US presidential election sending reverberations throughout negotiation rooms, business needs to step up. In the weeks following the election result, more than 300 private CEOs wrote an open letter[4][5]\~to the President-elect Trump, urging him to reaffirm US commitment to the Paris Agreement. At COP22 , many US-based companies at LESC stressed that the election results will have no impact on their carbon reduction targets. Once again, we heard it loud and clear: business leadership will be central in carrying the climate agenda forward.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA71","COP22 IN MARRAKESH: ""EU WILL DELIVER ON COMMITMENTS WHATEVER HAPPENS""","November 18, 2016 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Parliament: World leaders gathered at the COP22 climate talks in Marrakesh for the last two weeks to negotiate how to implement the priorities of the Paris agreement. Today nearly 200 countries have backed a proclamation declaring implementing them an ""urgent duty"". The European Parliament was present at the conference with a delegation composed of 12 MEPs. We asked delegation head Giovanni La Via, an Italian member of the EPP group, about the next steps and the Parliament's role. How was the COP22 COP21 was about the main objectives: the big principles on how to save the planet. COP22 is about implementing it, turning the climate commitments into action. What were the most important topics discussed in Marrakech? One of the most important topics was climate finance. Developing countries want to be sure - and rightly so - that the money needed for them to adapt to the consequences of climate change will be delivered. However, this cannot be only public money. What was the Parliament delegation pushing for in Marrakech? We were mainly there to ensure that people continued to have trust in the process. This is a trust-building exercise. We are therefore here to reaffirm that the EU will deliver on its commitments whatever happens. What is the main achievement of the COP22 ? I would say the Marrakesh Action Proclamation that reaffirms the willingness of all countries to fight against climate change and to support sustainable development. By 2020 countries should reveal their 2050 long-term commitments to address climate change. What is the Parliament already working on in order to implement the Paris agreement? We will already be delivering concrete policies next month when we vote on the reform of the EU's carbon market. We will soon start work on reducting emissions from individual EU countries. Tthis is the so-called effort sharing legislation and there is also a new legislative proposal on land-use, land-use change and forestry. What has the EU already done? How advanced are we in implementing the Paris agreement? We are on track to implement our initial 2030 commitments. We are also set to surpass our 2020 goal of a 20% cut in emissions and are now aiming even higher. What could be the biggest challenge for the EU during the implementation process of the Paris agreement? That could be consolidating the trust that allowed 197 countries to agree on a common declaration in Marrakesh. This is why it is so important that we reaffirm, in spite of the many political uncertainties we face, that the EU will deliver on its commitments. The target is decarbonisation. The question is only about how much the EU itself wants to lead this revolution and push other global actors to follow this path. \"

I was also fortunate to hear from some of the world's leading innovators in this area. Representatives of the aviation industry, shipping industry, energy sector, agriculture sector, product manufacturing sector, and sustainable cities movement all delivered powerful messages of progress, with a clear call for further action. As a business paradigm, the circular economy represents a maturing of the global business community. Under this philosophy, biological and mineral resources are no longer simply there for the taking, but are precious natural capital to be stewarded. Air, water, and ecosystems are no longer viewed as dumping grounds for wastes, but are community commons that must be protected. And products are not simply trinkets to be used and discarded, but are designed to serve their function, then to be reused, repurposed, or recycled with the least possible waste. In essence, the circular economy seeks to emulate the earth's complex balancing act that sustains life, wasting nothing in the process. Now, in this period of unprecedented climate change, it is essential for companies, governments and institutions to apply the lessons of the circular economy to our greatest challenge - stabilizing the Earth's climate.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA73","COP22 host Morocco's mosques are going green","September 6, 2016 Tuesday 7:38 AM EST","Phys.org - Science and Technology News","Sep 06, 2016( Phys.org - Science and Technology News: HYPERLINK http://phys.org / Delivered by Newstex) The As-Sunna mosque in the Moroccan capital Rabat is one of 64 mosques taking part in a project to reduce energy consumption ahead of COP22 Two months before it hosts the COP22 climate conference, Morocco is preparing to launch an ambitious project to turn its mosques green as a commitment to clean energy. The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs announced a tender in mid-August to modify 64 mosques initially in six of the kingdom's cities to reduce the energy[1] they consume. Its goal is a 40-percent reduction in energy costs[2] at 15,000 mosques around the country that consume an average of 90 kilowatts a day, said the SIE state energy investment company. Studies have shown that energy consumption can be cut by 60 percent, with estimates showing savings of as much as 68 percent at Rabat's majestic As-Sunna mosque. This can be achieved through energy-saving lighting, photovoltaic electricity generation and solar water heating, and without harming the appearance of the mosques. The upgrades will also benefit the faithful, with access to hot water for washing and air conditioning available in prayer rooms, said SIE. Another upshot would be the ""strong social impact"" through the creation of 5,000 jobs and a new growth market, it said. ""The return of the investment made will be based on the energy savings achieved."" German development organisation GIZ, which supports the project, describes it as a ""win-win"" situation that will also raise awareness of renewable and efficient energy in Morocco. ""It is based on the idea that Moroccan companies... involved in these mosques will be repaid through savings made by the building manager,"" says GIZ's Jan-Christoph Kuntze. Morocco is preparing to launch an ambitious project to turn its mosques green as a commitment to clean energy Potential to create jobs All of the technology needed is ""already available on the local market"", he said, adding that this gave the project the potential to create jobs. ""The mosques can play a multiplier role"" of raising awareness about the need to save energy and adapt to cleaner sources. King Mohammed VI has pushed a proactive policy of environmental awareness in the northwest African country of nearly 34 million people, 99 percent of whom are Muslim. Marrakesh will host the next world climate conference[3], COP22 , from November 7 to 18. One of the main challenges for Morocco, which hosted COP7 in 2001, is to ratify the Paris Agreement signed last year by 195 countries to fight global warming. COP22 will ""highlight the country's commitment to work for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and to continue to support developing countries... affected by the impact of climate change"", Mohammed said in a speech in June. The king was behind an ambitious plan launched in 2009 to develop renewables and enable the country bereft of hydrocarbons to support nearly half of its energy needs this way. The ultimate aim is to raise the share of renewable energy to 52 percent of all consumption. Central to this was the opening of Noor I the first stage of what will be the largest solar power plant in the world near Ouarzazate on the edge of the Sahara desert. As Morocco counts down to COP22 , its people are being exposed more and more to events and initiatives showcasing the country's involvement in protecting the planet. Its ""green mosques"" project is expected to take centre stage in the drive for change being highlighted at the conference.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA74","Washington: COP22 in Marrakech: A Time for Global Action","November 19, 2016 Saturday","US Official News","Washington: U.S Department of State official Blog has issued the following news release: This week heads of state and foreign ministers, as well as leaders from the private sector, NGO community, and academia, are gathered in Marrakech for the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP22 . The Paris Agreement, adopted last year at COP21, was a defining moment in international climate negotiations. Now that the Paris Agreement has entered into force, COP22 is a meeting focused on action and implementation. Here in Marrakech we are focused on ways to drive ambitious action by governments, civil society, and the private sector to work in sync towards common goals.I truly believe that Morocco is the perfect host for this year\' s COP. Under the leadership and vision of King Mohammed VI, Morocco has taken bold steps to becoming a leader in clean energy, committing to ensure that 52 percent of its generation capacity is from renewables by 2030. The most visible manifestation of these impressive efforts is the Noor Solar Complex, the first phase of which was inaugurated last February. When complete, Noor will be the world's largest concentrated solar power plant with the potential to produce enough energy to power over one million homes by 2018. Morocco\' s national ban on plastic bags under the  Zero Mika campaign is another example of its bold action to protect the environment. We are proud of our own collaboration with Morocco to protect its environment, particularly its national parks and forests. Through the first US-Morocco Sister Park initiative, we have linked the Great Basin National Park in Nevada with Toubkal National Park, located near Marrakech, to foster collaboration between two parks facing the similar environmental challenges. The U.S. Forest Service and the Moroccan High Commission for Water, Forests, and the Fight Against Desertification have successfully collaborated to protect Morocco\' s rich forests from forest fires. And during COP22 , the Millennium Challenge Corporation\' s Government of Morocco partner, MCA-Morocco will highlight its $127 million dollar investment in sustainable industrial zones, including a discussion on how sustainable industrial zones can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Mission to Morocco is also doing its part to support COP22 \' s goals through our support to local organizations and emerging Moroccan leaders who are putting environmental protection into practice. For example, we are supporting Moroccan NGO Dar Si Hmad, which developed a way for rural women to convert fog to precious drinking water for remote communities in Southern Morocco. This innovative project is being recognized by a UN Climate Change award that highlights the contributions of women for change. We have also worked with social entrepreneur Saad Abid, who represented Morocco at Our Ocean Conference in Washington D.C. this year. Saad has channeled his passion for surfing into an impressive effort to protect Morocco\' s rich coastline through his NGO Association Bahri, which means  My Ocean in Arabic. We are also taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint at our Mission in Morocco. Our new Embassy was built to the US LEED standards, with the latest advances in energy and natural resource conservation. Camil Chaari, a high school student at the Rabat American School, started his own recycling program where he collects used batteries and printer cartridges that are turned into office supplies. This year our Embassy\' s Green Team began recycling our printer carriages with this bright young Moroccan entrepreneur. COP22 is a chance to demonstrate that together we can take action to protect our planet in a way that improves the lives and livelihoods of all citizens. And above all, this is an opportunity for all of us to take concrete steps towards leaving our children a better planet than the one that was left for us. About the Author: Dwight L.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA75","CIEL Issues Statement on Outcome of COP22","November 14, 2016 Monday 6:19 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Center for International Environmental Law issued the following statement: The negotiators meeting in Marrakech for the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) of the UNFCCC had an important mission: keep up momentum generated by the adoption of the Paris Agreement and prove that the international community is serious about implementing the goals and commitments defined in Paris. COP22 demonstrates that countries DO want the Paris Agreement to be successful, and the United States election results did not distract from this mission. Showing real leadership, the 47 countries in the climate vulnerable forum (CVF) announced they will rely on 100% renewable energy by 2030 or 2050 at the latest. Historic polluters must follow their lead and support these countries in meeting this commitment, including by offering the necessary funds. Overall however, the progress made at COP22 was slow. In real terms, this leaves the planet - and all its inhabitants - in the same position as last year, with the scale of ambition and commitments too low to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Unless countries increase the pace of the negotiation over the next two years and deliver strong rules for implementation, people across the globe will experience the increasingly severe impacts of a changing climate and the harmful impacts of poorly implemented climate mitigation projects. Governments must increase ambition and strengthen the rules around public accountability and transparency for climate actions taken by governments and companies. Human rights obligations require governments to make science-based emissions reductions, and they require historic emitters to provide the necessary finance to meet the 1.5 degree goal. We witnessed some progress on the integration of gender equality, the recognition of the value of traditional and indigenous knowledge in designing the methods of implementation of the Paris Agreement, and increasing emphasis on the importance of building the capacity of developing countries to integrate human rights into the core of their climate responses. In 2017, we expect further progress on addressing climate-induced migration, gender equality, and indigenous and traditional knowledge. We urge parties to use the next six months to think critically about the role the public can and should play in developing national climate policies, strengthening transparency and accountability, and in assessing good practices and progress on meeting the 1.5 objective necessary to ensure the survival of people, species, and the planet.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA76","India will bat for developing countries at COP 22 climate meet in Morocco","October 2, 2016 Sunday 5:11 AM EST","International Business Times India","Oct 02, 2016( International Business Times India: HYPERLINK http://ibtimes.co.in Delivered by Newstex) India will bat for developing countries at COP 22 climate meet in Morocco. Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge) Anil Madhav Dave addresses a press conference on 'Ratification of Paris Agreement - the Way Forward', in New Delhi on October 1, 2016.Press Information Bureau India will strongly put forward its case and throw its weight behind the cause of developing nations at the upcoming 12-day 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) at Marrakech in Morocco, which begins on November 7. Interacting with reporters on Satuday, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge) Anil Madhav Dave said India, at the global climate forum, will ""put across its views based on Indian, or Gandhian lifestyle in Morocco."" He added: ""Issues related to raising finance under Green Climate Fund (GCF) and technology transfer will also be raised at COP22 .""India and developing countries are currently fighting developed countries on the terms of the goals they have to share in order to address climate change and combat global warming. The developed nations want to put the burden of it on developing nations like India. The developing nations, however, are looking to their developed counterparts for funds and technological know-how to overcome the challenges posed by climate change and global warming. Interestingly, Dave's comments came a day before India was slated to ratify the Paris agreement on climate change. According to an official statement from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, here are the topics India is expected to raise at COP 22 : Enhancing Ambition and promoting action between 2016 and 2020:\~The Paris Agreement is for post-2020 period. Currently, we are operating under the pre-2020 action framework and must not wait any further to take action. The developed countries should ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. At Morocco, we must agree to set up an action roadmap for 2016-2020 for raising ambition and achieving pre-2020 goals. Mobilising means of implementation i.e finance, technology and capacity-building support before and after 2020:\~$11 billion per year climate finance goal has not been met. At Morocco, India will insist for a concrete roadmap from developed countries. $10.3 billion committed to the Green Climate Fund does not match the enormous finance and technology requirements indicated by developing countries in their INDCs. On the technology and capacity-building front also, not much headway has been made. The new Technology Framework under the Paris Agreement should help to remove barriers to technology access and provide finance for meeting higher technological costs. Furthering the cause of adaption and loss and damage:\~India is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The first review of the loss and damage mechanism at COP 22 is an opportunity for India to ensure that this mechanism provides tangible and concrete solutions. Most important of these would be to ensure that there are tools to address adaptation, financial risk management and finance needs for dealing with extreme and slow onset events. Detailing rule and modalities under Paris agreement:\~Paris Agreement has laid a broad framework, but guidelines and rules need to be detailed for the Agreement to be operational. Pending task such as modalities for market mechanism, transparency arrangements, features of NDCs, facilitative dialogue, must be expedited, starting from Morocco COP. Several new bodies such as the Paris Committee on capacity-building, the Technology Framework etc must also be ready before 2020. Furthering the agenda on sustainable lifestyles and climate justice:\~it is important that apart from emission cuts, we also focus on measures that involve broader participation. People in developed countries live extravagant lifestyles with high carbon footprint. Simple everyday changes in lifestyles, when practised by a large number of people around the globe, collectively will make a huge impact. The power of choices that each one of us makes every day like the food we eat, the way we travel, the things we buy etc are not realised. When choices that 7 billion world citizens make are put together, it impacts our planet in a major way. Therefore, each choice counts. India has made a commitment in its INDC, on sustainable lifestyles and will continue to push this agenda forward in Morocco. India is strongly committed to fight climate change and assures that it will make every possible effort within its capacity to achieve a significant outcome in Marrakech, Morocco. India will set up an exclusive Pavilion at COP 22 , hosting various sessions in the form of panel discussions, presentations and documentaries. These will showcase India's actions on climate change and will be an opportunity for a global audience and invited experts to engage in discussion and generate new solutions.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA77","MARRAKECH: New Fund Aims to Help Build Resilience to Climate Change","November 20, 2016 Sunday 5:00 PM GMT","iCrowdNewswire (English)","New Fund Aims to Help Build Resilience to Climate Change By http://www.ipsnews.net/author/fabiola-ortiz/ Fab\'edola Ortiz Mary Robinson, the U.N. special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate. Credit: Fabiola Ortiz/IPS MARRAKECH, Nov 18 2016 (IPS) The world has been too slow in responding to climate events such as El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a, and those who are the least responsible are the ones suffering most , Mary Robinson, the special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, told IPS at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ). The first woman President of Ireland (1990-1997) and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (1997-2002), Robinson was appointed earlier this year by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the new mandate involving climate change and El Ni\'f1o. I've seen a window into a new normal' and it is very serious. Mary Robinson During the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Robinson strongly advocated for engaging community-led solutions and for incorporating gender equality and women's participation in the climate talks. Global warming is accelerating too much and it is being aggravated by El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a. They do not have to become a humanitarian disaster, but people have now been left to cope for themselves...I think we were too slow in many instances and this has become a humanitarian disaster for the 60 million people who are food insecure and suffering from droughts, she said. El Ni\'f1o has been directly associated with droughts and floods in many parts of the world that have severely impacted millions of livelihoods. A warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific waters, the phenomenon occurs on average every three to seven years and sea surface temperatures across the Pacific can warm more than 1 degree C. El Ni\'f1o is a natural occurrence, but scientists believe it is becoming more intense as a result of global warming. How El Ni\'f1o interacts with climate change is not 100 percent clear, but many of the countries that are now experiencing El Ni\'f1o are also vulnerable to climate variations. According to Robinson, El Ni\'f1o and its climate-linked emergencies are a threat to human security and, therefore, a threat to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced in September 2015 as the 2030 Agenda replacing the Millennium Development Goals. I have gone to Central America to the dry corridor in Honduras and have seen women crying because there is no water and they feel very neglected. They feel they are left behind and that nobody seems to know about them. I saw in Ethiopia severely malnourished children, it could affect them for life in terms of being stunted. The same thing in southern Africa. I feel I've seen a window into a new normal' and it is very serious. We need to understand the urgency of taking the necessary steps, Robinson said. Drought and flooding associated with El Ni\'f1o created enormous problems across East Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Pacific. Ethiopia, where Robinson has visited earlier this year, is experiencing its worst drought in half a century. One million children in Eastern and Southern Africa alone are acutely malnourished. It is very likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015, according to an assessment released at the COP22 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary data shows that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El Ni\'f1o event. These long-term changes in the climate have exacerbated social, humanitarian and environmental pressures. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees pointed that in 2015, more than 19 million new displacements were associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. We need a much more concerted response and fund preparedness. If we have a very strategic early warning system, we can deal with the problem much more effectively. Building resilience in communities is the absolute key. We need to invest in support for building resilience now rather than having a huge humanitarian disaster, stressed Robinson. On Nov. 17, during the COP22 in Marrakech, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) a coalition led by France, Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada launched at the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015 announced a new goal to mobilise more than 30 million dollars by July 2017 and 100 million by 2020. The international partnership aims to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific. The idea is to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events. There will be a special focus on women, who are particularly vulnerable to climate menaces but are the protagonists in building resilience. Now we've moved from the Paris negotiations to implementation on the ground. Building resilience is key and it must be done in a way that is gender sensitive with full account of gender equality and also human rights. We must recognize the role of women as agents for change in their communities, Robinson emphasised. The number of climate-related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years, said Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction. Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS, We can see already in Africa the impact of climate change that is undermining our efforts to bring food security for all. Take the example of El Ni\'f1o that has affected all of Africa in the last two years. Countries that had made fantastic progress like Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar are now suffering hunger again. Countries that have eradicated hunger are back to face it again. We need to adapt. Climate change has different impacts on men and women, girls and boys, told IPS Edith Ofwona, the senior program specialist at International Development Research Centre (IDRC).

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA78","Crib notes: As COP22 opens, Paris deal passes 100 nation mark","November 7, 2016 Monday 11:04 AM EST","Climate Home","Nov 07, 2016( Climate Home: HYPERLINK http://www.climatehome.org http://www.climatehome.org COP22 summit in Marrakech to join. On Sunday afternoon UNFCCC executive secretary Patricia Espinosa laid out plans for this year's negotiations and beyond. 'The ambitions set out in Paris cannot be scaled down, so from now on countries can only increase their commitment,' she said. Preview:\~US election result to dominate COP22 UN climate summit[2] There is much on the plate, from the need for better adaptation worldwide, and increased support for developing countries, to enabling a push towards cleaning up the global economy and embrace renewables. 'Investors are seeing a lot of opportunities in Africa' she said. But the elephant in the room of this year's COP are the coming US presidential elections. When asked whether she was concerned about their outcome, Espinosa tried to reassure the audience - highlighting the binding nature of the Paris Agreement, which entered into force last week. But while the US would have a hard time formally pulling out of the agreement, it's clear a climate change denier in charge of one of the world's major emitters would be a serious and unpredictable threat to the global climate response. WRI's Eliza Northrop: 'Recognizing the urgency of setting their sights higher, countries agreed at COP21 to come back in 2018 to take stock of initial progress and most importantly to use 2018 as a springboard for countries to enhance their national climate plans in 2020. To put us on track for 2018 to become that springboard moment, at COP22 negotiators need to indicate they will decide on rule and processes for the Paris Agreement by that year.' Locals say Marrakech has received a facelift to honour the thousands of delegates, with Moroccan flags and COP22 stickers everywhere to be seen: even on knackered Mercedes taxis belching black smoke. To make the launch Mustapha Bakkoury, chairman of Masen (Moroccan Agency of Sustainable Energy S.A.)[3] has announced a 1 billion dirham (USD 272 million) climate bond, a first for Africa. Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow: 'The Paris Agreement demanded a rapid decarbonisation of the global energy system so it's fitting that in the sun-drenched nation of Morocco we should see this shift really start to shine. The costs of solar and wind energy continue to fall and as the market volatility of polluting fossil fuels causes havoc for investors now is the time to see governments really giving renewables clear political backing.' Finance review Prepare your inboxes and twitter feeds for a tsunami of studies - but if you just have time for one make it this: Today UN will launch an important report offering an overview of climate finance flows.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA79","COP22: Education is the fuel of the future","November 21, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Washington DC: Education International has issued the following news release: The crucial role of educators indelivering education for sustainable development and climate change education was reaffirmed at the  Sustainability starts with educators roundtable at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.As a world federation of unions representing organisations of teachers and other education professionals across the globe, Education International (EI) calls upon the United Nations (UN) and all governments to address the climate change emergency, said EI representative Dennis Sinyolo at the roundtable co-organised by EI, UNESCO, and the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection, in the framework of the 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, on 14 November in Marrakech, Morocco. EI: education a key tool  Teachers of the world, united under the EI banner, believe that education and teachers are the most powerful agents you can trust in the fight against climate change, stressed Sinyolo. He acknowledged that adequate training, tools, resources, and support from governments and society are necessary for teachers to successfully deliver effective education for sustainable development (ESD) and climate change education (CCE). New measures should be taken to adopt a model of sustainable development that meets the current needs of society without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, Sinyolo added. Implications of new economy EI believes that  education is the fuel of the future and a key tool to achieve sustainable development and to raise global awareness on climate change, he added. Indeed, the education sector has a crucial role to play in the transition to a low carbon global economy, and a new type of economy has massive implications for workers and the education and training that will be needed to prepare young people for life and for work. Teachers and educators are crucial in the delivery of quality ESD and CCE, he said. Good practices on climate change education do exist, he emphasised, i.e. education institutions and teachers have made tremendous efforts in protecting the environment and fighting against climate change through greening schools, recycling programmes, or community awareness-raising campaigns. EI has been working with its affiliates to develop teacher competence profiles or guidelines on professional teaching standards, incorporating ESD and CCE. EI support At the COP21 held in Paris, France, in December 2015, which put climate change education at the centre of efforts to combat climate change, EI endorsed the demands of the international trade union movement for a just transition for workers confronted by significant economic changes that are already underway. EI also supports the recommendations submitted by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) to COP22 . EI Recommendations to COP22 Sinyolo highlighted EI\' s four main demands to the UN and governments at the COP22 conference: \'b7 Place education at the centre of national, regional and global efforts to combat climate change \'b7 Adopt measures to strengthen initial teacher education and continuous professional development programmes to equip teachers and other education professionals with the competences needed to teach Education for ESD and CCE and support students to acquire knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to protect the planet \'b7 Consolidate the Paris Agreement by introducing or restoring references to adequate and predictable financial support for CCE, training and research with an application across all parties, both developing and developed countries \'b7 Make sure that international climate governance enforces the UN sustainable development goals and the UNESCO Global Action Programme on ESD to provide a robust international framework to curb climate change In case of any query regarding this article or other content please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \"

Parliament is represented at the talks by a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via. At the COP21 climate talks last December, 195 countries adopted the Paris agreement on climate change. The world's first universally binding climate deal, it sets out a global plan on how to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels. The deal entered into force earlier this month after the European Parliament gave its consent[1] to the EU's ratification.This week a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Giovanni La Via, chair of Parliament's environment committee, takes part in the COP22 conference in Marrakesh. Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, the European commissioner responsible for climate action, will brief the delegation on a daily basis. MEPs will also engage in talks with NGOs, industry and delegations from various countries. COP22 : 'COP of action'The focus of this week's round of talks will be on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Delegates will work on making national climate plans as clear and transparent as possible, and on ensuring that the actions taken are traceable and that standardized reporting methods are used. There will also be discussions on enhanced action prior to 2020. As part of the Paris agreement developed countries promised to mobilize at least $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Aiming to deliver on the commitments made, the negotiations in Marrakesh will revolve around who should pay into these funds and how they should be used. There will also be discussions on the need for further support for developing countries in terms of technology and capacity-building.More informationMore on the role of Parliament in the fight against climate change[2] Paris Agreement parties need to pledge more emission cuts, say MEPs[3] UN climate change conference in Marrakesh: questions and answers[4] Commission website on COP22 [5] COP22 website[6] [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930STO44532/photos-climate-deal-approved-and-signed-by-parliament http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930STO44532/photos-climate-deal-approved-and-signed-by-parliament HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/top-stories/20141118TST79414/climate-change http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/top-stories/20141118TST79414/climate-change [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930IPR44569/climate-paris-agreement-parties-need-to-pledge-more-emission-cuts-say-meps http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160930IPR44569/climate-paris-agreement-parties-need-to-pledge-more-emission-cuts-say-meps [ 4]: \~ http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3590_en.htm http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3590_en.htm [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0112_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/articles/0112_en.htm [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/en http:// cop22 HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/en .ma/en / \"

CARICOM representatives are hoping to build on the gains from the Paris campaign, where they argued that the impact of climate change was an existential issue for the Region and was already having an impact. The campaign, built around the ""1.5 to Stay Alive"" mantra helped to influence the language in the final agreement to take account of the Region's preference for a long term temperature goal of below 1.50C above pre-industrial levels, with emission reduction commitments and pathways that are consistent with that goal. With the Paris Agreement coming into force on the eve of this week's start of the Morocco meeting, attention is expected to be focused on action to increase both immediate and future emission cuts. The Meeting is also expected to discuss a clear and credible way forward on Loss and Damage arising from the slow onset of climate impacts. Attention will also be focused on the delivery of promised finance and capacity building initiatives for implementation activities in Small Island and low-lying Developing States (SID)s including those in the Caribbean Community.

Following the momentous Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, progress towards ratification ofthe Paris Agreement has been far swifter than those gathered this time last year in France had envisaged. The timeframe agreed in Paris mapped a pathway to ratifi cation and entry-into-force in 2020. Given that international treaties have historically taken a long time to ratify (the Kyoto Protocol was agreed in 1997 and came into effect in 2005) and the UN climate talks have been largely unsuccessful for the past decade, the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreement is almost unprecedented.

With a final rulebook in hand, the 2018 climate summit will set the stage for countries to put forward their enhanced national climate plans in 2020. ""Notably, the first substantive decision under the Paris Agreement was that it should be served by the Adaptation Fund, to which Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Sweden together pledged $81 million in new contributions. Negotiators in Marrakech also emphasized the importance of expanding support for developing countries to address climate change, particularly for adaptation. In order to maintain trust, developed countries must continue to scale-up funding in line with their $100 billion commitment by 2020. ""There is no ignoring that the election of Donald Trump sent reverberations through the negotiation halls, but delegates carried on with a strong spirit of determination. No country stepped back from its commitment to climate action. On the contrary, in the few days since the election, Australia, Botswana, Japan, Pakistan, Italy and others have joined the Paris Agreement. Support for climate action remains unshakeable. ""Outside the negotiations, climate progress is also moving forward. The launch of the NDC Partnership brought together 33 countries and 9 international institutions to accelerate climate action on the ground and advance sustainable development. Morocco, which is the co-chair of the NDC Partnership and served as the COP22 president, deserves particular recognition for their steadfast and effective leadership. In addition, four countries - the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Germany -- put forward serious strategies for deep emissions reductions by mid-century. ""National governments were not the only ones taking the long view at Marrakech. As of this week, 200 companies, representing $4.8 trillion in market value, have put forward emissions targets in line with science, among them Wal-Mart, Mars Inc., and Sony. ""Climate change has clearly shifted from a siloed issue to being at the center of international relations. Last year, 195 countries adopted the Paris Agreement, one of the brightest spots of global cooperation in recent memory. With climate risks mounting and opportunities for sustainable development expanding, the global community remains fully committed to its success.

The challenges of climate change have reached the level where we cannot brand ourselves as different religions, and faith communities need to work together, said Rev. Henrik Grape, coordinator of the WCC Working Group on Climate Change. ""We, people of faith, have something important to contribute. Climate change is more than politics, technical solutions or a question of environment. It is about a moral duty to act and about our understanding of what it means to be a human on this earth."" We need the innovations and political decisions, but we also need a vision and long-term aspirations, said Grape. Faith should play a central part to bring the people of the earth together for a common vision that will last and help to bring transformation that the earth so desperately needs. Justice and equity are part of the spiritual vision the faith communities can bring. ""And faith communities also can bring hope. Hope is something more than just prognosis. The origin of hope is transcendent - people of the faith are people of hope. And hope is the first step in the path of transformation"", said Grape. Grape quoted St Augustine, saying that hope has two beautiful daughters: their names are Anger and Courage. Anger at the way things are, and Courage to see that they do not remain as they are. ""Faith can be the carrier of hope and its beautiful daughters. Anger, on inequalities and on the greed that destroys the earth, and possibilities of future generations. And courage to start the transformation needed for a more just and equitable world"". Lindsey Fielder Cook, climate change representative of Quaker United Nations office, reminded participants that the root cause of the anthropogenic climate change is human behaviour: ""We are the problem, but we are also the solution. We cannot and should not think that this solely can be done through technical fixes. We need a transformation of the human behaviours which are the root causes"". When policies and regulations made by governments are rights-based, they are more supported by their citizens. ""For this reason, holistic inclusion of human rights in the implementation of the Paris agreement is critical to reaching sufficient, fair, effective and therefore ambitious mitigation and adaptation to protect all species - including us"", said Fielder Cook. The public discussion, formally titled ""Trust and peacebuilding approaches for ambitious climate action"" was a side-event at UN climate change conference COP22 in Marrakech, and it was organized by the World Council of Churches in cooperation with Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University, Quaker Earthcare Witness and the Quaker United Nations Office.

BusinessEurope Director General Markus J. Beyrer commented: ""It will be tough work for governments negotiating in Marrakech to agree on all details needed to make the Paris agreement a success. But we urgently need these details and clarity on the global rules for our business community to step up actions to avoid climate change. Negotiators should work closely together with our business community and other stakeholders to develop the rules and procedures that underpin the actions to be taken. This will reinforce the signal that the world is moving towards a low-carbon future and encourage increased investment from the business community."" The Paris Agreement was the culmination of many years of work to prepare a treaty that could be signed by all nations. Countries committed to setting plans and undertaking actions to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Now, at the Marrakech conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) many of the detailed rules and procedures that are needed to implement the Paris Agreement will be discussed and should be adopted. Transparency is urgently needed as well as progress towards developing common rules to measure, report and verify commitments. Furthermore, we need improvements in the design and development of market and non-market mechanisms to help achieve and potentially increase emissions reductions, whilst preserving a global level-playing field and maintaining open trade. Business has relevant expertise to contribute to these actions and other topics under the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which would not have been brokered without the role of business.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA89","AROUND THE PIER: UC SAN DIEGO DELEGATION HEADS TO MOROCCO FOR COP22","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Scripps Oceanography and UC San Diego delegates bring scientific expertise on oceans and climate to international talks Theyve conducted the research, packed their bags, and now some of the brightest minds in earth and ocean science are headed to Morocco! The largest-ever delegation of students and researchers from the University of California San Diego and Scripps Institution of Oceanography is headed to Marrakech for the upcoming 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ), where they will inform international policy negotiations with climate science findings. (View Scripps at COP22 video here.) An estimated 20,000 people from 196 participating countries will flock to the North African city from November 7-18 to participate in the annual global climate change policy conference, led by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and held each year at a different location around the world. This 2016 University of California contingent of 23 researchers, students, and staff is part of the UC Revelle Program for Climate Science and Policy, a non-governmental organization that represents the UC system at the annual COP summit. As a leader in understanding and protecting our planet, Scripps Oceanography comprises 17 of the total UC delegates, which includes an unprecedented 10 Scripps graduate students, five faculty members, one postdoctoral researcher, and one staff member. Two graduate students from UC San Diegos School of Global Policy and Strategy will also participate in the conference, providing cross-campus collaboration and expertise in the field of public policy. ""Scripps Oceanography has been at the forefront of climate change research for more than half a century, and Im very pleased that our world-class delegation of faculty and students will again be presenting the latest scientific research at COP22 , said Scripps Director Margaret Leinen. ""Understanding the science behind global climate change and the role of the ocean in this change is critical for world leaders to make informed decisions about the future of our planet."" Throughout the two-week conference, Scripps Oceanography will have an increased presence from that of previous years by hosting its first-ever solo exhibit, titled, Observations: From the Deep Sea to the Sky. The boothwhich will be paper-free in keeping with increased sustainability effortswill highlight the critical programs and new observational technologies used by Scripps and the climate science community that help national and regional governments understand the hydrological cycle. Scripps will showcase how these advanced instruments allow scientists to monitor and understand the effects of climate change on the environment, revealing a clear picture of potential instability affecting everything from deep-ocean ecosystems to the phenomena governing monsoons, atmospheric rivers, and other vital sources of water for society. Members of the UC delegation, including graduate students, will also participate in a record number of press conferences and panel discussions that showcase Scripps science and demonstrate the importance the ocean plays in regulating climate across the globe. The broad scope of COP22 -related activities will give Scripps graduate students the opportunity to share and communicate important research with people ranging from policymakers to the public. I am absolutely honored to represent Scripps science at COP22 , said Charlotte Beall, a third-year Scripps PhD student studying climate science and first-time COP attendee. Beall and Scripps Professor Amato Evan will participate in a press conference on Nov. 16 where they will discuss how a more arid environment increases dust emissions and erosion, and how dust emissions, through long-range transport, can significantly influence precipitation in locations thousands of miles away from the source. By attending COP22 , I am hoping to engage diverse groups of climate and water resource stakeholders in research on aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions, and to facilitate connections between climate and aerosol scientists in the U.S. and climate scientists in critical regions of the world, said Beall. Third-year Scripps graduate student Rishi Sugla will also be attending the conference for the first time, and said hes thrilled to have the opportunity to serve as an ocean ambassador in a setting where he can learn about science policy firsthand. There is a lot of wonderful science done at Scripps that has potential to not only influence policy, but also have real positive impacts on the day-to-day life of people around the world. However, there is often a disconnect between those who work on the ground and policymakers with the ongoing scientific research, said Sugla, a geoscience student. Its clear that Scripps is trying to bridge this gap, and while at COP22 I hope to understand how an international climate agreement is developed and constructed, as well as the role of scienceor lack thereofin the process. The outcome of COP21, last years conference held in Paris, was a landmark agreement to fight climate change signed by 195 countries, as well as inclusion of ocean science in final COP agreements text for the first time. The delegation at COP22 will build upon the successes of COP21 and carry forth the message of the oceans crucial role in absorbing the impacts of climate change. This year, Scripps Oceanography is collaborating with the government of Chile toward the broad goal of including the oceans in nationally determined contributions to a greater extent. A press conference on Nov. 8 will showcase this international research partnership and its studies on marine ecosystems. Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a distinguished Scripps professor of climate and atmospheric sciences, will hold a high-level press conference on Nov. 14, where he will be discussing countries prospects for holding global warming to 1.5 above pre-industrial levels. Distinguished Scripps Professor Lisa Levin, Scripps graduate students Natalya Gallo and Kirk Sato, and international colleagues will hold a press conference on Nov. 10 that focuses on the role of the deep sea in climate mitigation, impacts of rising CO2 on deep-sea ecosystems and their services, law and policy gaps for climate and the high seas/deep sea, and deep-ocean research and observation in a climate context. Other Scripps-led press events include a Nov. 9 discussion on the global warming hiatus, presented by Distinguished UC San Diego Professor and former Scripps Director Charles Kennel and graduate student Dillon Amaya; a Nov. 11 presentation about monitoring the global carbon cycle and heat budget through observing systems, presented by Scripps Associate Professor Todd Martz and graduate student Yassir Eddebbar; and a Nov. 15 discussion on the fate of marine protected areas in future oceans, led by Scripps postdoctoral scholar Maya deVries and graduate students Travis Schramek and Sato. Scripps students will also participate in Oceans Action Day on Nov. 12, a day of ocean-themed science discussions and events organized as part of the UNFCCC Global Climate Action Agenda. This event will further highlight and build upon a strategic five-year action plan on oceans and climate that was first showcased during Oceans Day at COP21. Its a wonderful opportunity to be participating in COP22 since the Paris Agreement from last years meeting will come into force at the onset of this meeting, said Sugla, reflecting the enthusiasm expressed by nearly the entire UC delegation. After wanting to attend the last two meetings, Im psyched to finally have a shot to go. Longtime Scripps supporters Ellen Lehman, David and Peg Engel, Gail Fliesbach, investment fund Global Good, and others provided funding to send the student delegates to COP22 . \"

Thank you for your presence in Marrakech and for your commitment to climate action. Reaching zero hunger by 2030 is crucial for achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. People who are well nourished live, learn and work longer, and contribute to economic growth and human development. Despite great progress in the fight against hunger, nearly 800 million people are undernourished today. Climate change threatens to aggravate matters even further. Erratic weather patterns and an increase in the outbreaks of pests and diseases are affecting our ability to produce the food we need. We have seen such impacts in recent months as El Ni\'f1o hit Africa, Asia, Central America and other parts of the world. The Paris Agreement recognizes the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change. Countries are already making progress by including agriculture and food systems in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Agricultural sectors are leading elements in 90 per cent of the national climate pledges for developing countries. Our challenge now is to scale-up investments in rural development and support climate adaptation. Decisions at COP22 hold immense potential to accelerate and amplify global action towards a world free of hunger and malnutrition. Climate change, extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition must be addressed together, and sustainable, resilient and inclusive agriculture and food systems that deliver for people and planet are key to doing so. Agriculture and food systems that are people-centred, sustainable and resilient are central to achieving the transformations envisioned in the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. I urge all Governments and partners to deliver on our promise to be the Zero Hunger Generation.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA96","Big business in Marrakech: fertiliser industry and finance dominate COP22","November 8, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Paris: Grain has issued the following news release: Africa will be centre-stage at this year\' s Conference of Parties on climate change ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech. According to the Moroccan steering committee, this is the  African COP . The event will feature an  Africa Pavilion , with activities supported by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the New Partnership for Africa\' s Development (NEPAD) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) institutions that work to create favourable conditions for corporate investments in Africa. Thus, in Africa (and globally), the debate on climate change is captured by banks and corporations the very institutions that, through their relentless pursuit of profit above all else, are the main drivers of global climate change. The themes they have chosen to highlight in this space are telling: climate financing, technology transfer, agricultural industrialisation and adaptation. Make no mistake, alternative strategies that can significantly lower our greenhouse gas emissions ways of living and producing that fall outside these business-oriented parameters will not be discussed. Quite the contrary: on display will be the abysmal gap between the reality of peasant communities in Africa and around the world on one hand, and the blindness of our policymakers to this reality on the other. The latter continue to focus almost exclusively on  technology as the solution, even when many of the technologies they promote have been shown to actually worsen climate change and destroy the planet. The AfDB in particular, while supporting this  African COP , is quite far from understanding the climate emergency facing African farmers. Its agricultural development strategy focuses on promoting the use of fertilisers,[1] which pollute the soil, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and increase global energy use. The president of the AfDB has declared himself to be in line with the CEO of OCP (Office Ch\'e9rifien des Phosphates), a key player in the global fertiliser trade that mines Morocco\' s phosphate reserves the largest in the world. OCP, which uses methods developed by Monsanto and aims to  advance a real green revolution on the continent [2] recently established a new factory, the  Africa Fertilizer Complex to supply the African market. Meanwhile, the European Union has moved to block imports of Moroccan fertiliser due to unacceptably high levels of cadmium.[3] The multinationals of the fertiliser sector which worsen the climate and reap enormous profits from global food crises are now promoting their interests in the climate negotiations. They are positioning themselves as a solution to the climate crisis using a number of mechanisms including  climate smart agriculture , the REDD+ programme and the Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA) initiative. The AAA was created to access resources from the UNFCCC\' s Green Climate Fund, which aims to support climate change adaptation in African agriculture using private funds. This initiative, however, which 27 African countries have signed on to, will not serve the interests of African peasants.[4] Rather, it will undermine peasant agriculture and food sovereignty on the continent. This despite the fact that industrial agriculture is responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions while peasant agriculture and local markets cool the planet.[5] COP22 , like the previous meeting in Paris, is setting the stage for the private sector to benefit from so-called  green finance . This will be the focus of a  Climate Finance Day to be held in Casablanca. G\'e9rard Mestrallet, head of the French energy multinational ENGIE stated that 70 per cent of the investments needed to curb climate change would have to come from private sources. Indeed, the energy sector (both in renewables and fossil fuels) is a strong draw for private investors. And Morocco is no exception. Mestrallet called on foreign investors to fund his new solar mega-project as well as new coal and gas projects (while not ruling out the possibility of adding nuclear power to the mix). He is positioning himself to conquer new markets in Africa, in part through an agreement between the Moroccan company Nareva (a subsidiary of SNI) and the French company ENGIE, which will target Egypt, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon. The company plans to establish coal plants in Ivory Coast, where it has encountered strong resistance, including an online petition.[6] Unfortunately, Marrakech will be nothing more than a celebration of these false solutions. Banks such as Soci\'e9t\'e9 G\'e9n\'e9rale which long ago began sponsoring climate meetings, especially among corporations in the industrial agriculture and energy sectors are already on the scene. It\' s the poor, however, who are on the front lines of climate change and feel its impacts on their daily lives. African peasants are forced to migrate when their lands are devastated by climate catastrophes. They are also targeted by the false solutions promoted by corporations and governments at these international climate meetings. This debate belongs to the people, not the corporations! The people hold the real solutions!

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA99","Canada's Environment Minister Leads Canada's Delegation to COP22","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Terrebonne: Electric Energy Quebec has issued the following release news: One year ago in Paris, close to 200 world leaders came together to tackle climate change through the historic Paris Agreement. Working with business leaders, governments at all levels and civil society are developing solutions to climate change, which will not only ensure a sustainable planet but also grow a clean economy. This transition driven by market forces is unstoppable, and Canada intends to be at the forefront. The Paris Agreement was the first step on the road to a cleaner, more prosperous future for families and businesses around the world. The next steps are just as important, as Canada takes bold action to meet our 2030 emission-reduction target, to build a clean economy, and to create more opportunities for middle-class Canadians. Today (Novmber 13), Minister McKenna heads to Marrakech, Morocco, to lead Canada's delegation at the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. She will be joined by provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous leaders, Opposition Members of Parliament, businesses, youth, and civil society. At this year's climate-change conference, Minister McKenna will continue to provide the leadership Canada has shown internationally on climate change. Canada will build on the momentum of this year, including the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in refrigerants and air conditioners, and the International Civil Aviation Organization's historic agreement to mitigate emissions from airplanes. COP22 will put the Paris Agreement into action, with a focus on swift implementation. Canada will highlight the role of businesses; provincial, territorial, and municipal governments; and Indigenous groups as key to address climate change. As the countries that contribute the least to the causes of climate change are often the most affected by it, COP22 will also facilitate continued collaboration between developed and developing countries to address climate change. Addressing climate change is not only vital for communities around the world but also vital to the global economy. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord committed the developed world to mobilize $100 billion per year to support green growth and climate resilience in developing countries. This commitment will create tremendous opportunities for business growth and innovation as companies invest in and market clean technology. Minister McKenna will work with the Canadian business delegation and with her international counterparts to connect our innovators with those who need them. Minister McKenna will deliver Canada's national statement, and she will participate in several high-level meetings on issues including carbon pricing, clean-technology growth, support for developing countries, short-lived climate pollutants, gender and climate policy, as well as health and the role of Indigenous communities in climate solutions. Quote ""To address the global challenge of climate change effectively, all countries need to work together now to put the Paris Agreement into action. As we build on the momentum of the past year, Canada is proud to play a leadership role, once again, in international efforts to address climate change, which will ensure a more sustainable and prosperous future for our children and grandchildren."" - Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Canada ratified the Paris Agreement on October 5th, following a vote in Parliament. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4th. Canada's delegation to COP22 will include Indigenous leaders; representatives from the provinces, territories and municipalities; youth; business leaders; opposition members; and Government of Canada negotiators and experts. According to the World Bank, the Paris Agreement will help open up nearly $23 trillion in new opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets, between now and 2030.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA100","COP 22: THREE NEW WAYS TO HELP CITIES REACH THEIR CLIMATE GOALS","November 28, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the World Bank: With the Paris climate agreement in full force, countries around the world must now get down to the serious business of addressing climate change. Cities responsible for two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and 70 percent of energy consumption are on the front lines. At COP 22 , the Bank highlighted three of its newest tools to help cities meet climate challenges. ""We saw city leaders take center stage at both COP21 and COP22 ,"" said Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, senior director for the World Bank's Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice. ""In Marrakech, the focus was on how to implement the Paris agreement, and bring national and local governments together to tackle what is likely the most enormous challenge in our lifetime."" and creating a transparent system to monitor how well each country is performing. ""No country will be able to reach its climate goals without significant help from its cities,"" said Steve Hammer, climate specialist for the World Bank. ""Cities are the most important factor in the climate equation, and need additional tools and support to put them on a sustainable, resilient, low-carbon path."" At COP 22 Identifying obstacles and encouraging investment Unless there is significant investment to make cities more resilient, natural disasters may cost cities worldwide $314 billion a year and climate change may push up to 77 million more urban residents into poverty. In a new report, Investing in Urban Resilience , the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) note that more than 60 percent of areas expected to be urban have yet to be built. The report points to a number of major hurdles facing municipal governments and recommends steps to increase investment in resilience, such as implementing and enforcing modern building codes and creating a pipeline of investor-ready projects. It also lays out action the World Bank is taking to help cities promote urban resilience investment: Pre-development grant financing and technical assistance for project preparation; Advisory services to conceptualize, structure and finance investor-ready projects; Analysis to include hazard and risk considerations in project design and delivery; and, Technical Assistance to improve cities' investment climate, regulatory environment, and city creditworthiness. City specific, data-driven planning During Climate Week and at COP 22 , the World Bank demonstrated a new tool designed to help cities estimate the cost, feasibility, and impact of a wide range of climate actions under different scenarios. Developed by the Bank along with C40 Cities and the Compact of Mayors, and other partners, CURB: Climate Action Tool for Urban Sustainability, gives cities the information necessary to make climate-smart investments, relying on city-specific data. Using CURB, city officials can: Explore an array of climate-smart options, from more efficient transport systems to retrofitted buildings; Define what goals are realistic; Simulate technology and policy changes to assess the best course of action; and Analyze project financials to determine cost savings and returns on investment. In Buenos Aries, CURB helped advance the city's climate action plan with high-quality data and scenario simulations. ""CURB's user-friendly graphics, financial projections, and other features can help city planners enhance communication and improve coordination within city government,"" said Ines Lockhart, sustainability advisor to the city government. ""The tool is perfect in helping the city analyze new potential actions in a more time-efficient way."" If a city is missing data or other information, CURB can use data from similar cities or countries to plan targeted approaches. As a result, all cities can access CURB's capabilities, regardless of size or income level. Cities depend on a complex network of infrastructure, institutions and information; systems which need to work together to improve resilience to natural and socio-economic shocks and stresses which are exacerbated by climate change. With this in mind, the Bank's CityStrength diagnostic tool evaluates the resilience of a city holistically, identifying the main risks across priority sectors such as urban development, infrastructure, disaster risk management, and social protection. Developed by the World Bank and GFDRR, the CityStrength Diagnostic helps cities: Identify and prioritize investment and actions for increased resilience Engage with multiple stakeholders, including local and national government officials, civil society and the private sector, leading to awareness raising and increased coordination on urban resilience. Encourage learning and provide access to best practices The tool has been implemented in Can Tho, Vietnam; in Addis Ababa and ten regional capitals in Ethiopia; and across 16 municipalities in the Greater Accra Area in Ghana. As a result, a World Bank project is implementing the recommendations in Can Tho, the government of Addis is incorporating resilience-building components in an urban transport project, and a new urban resilience project is under preparation in Accra; helping these cities reach the goals set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA101","Advocates Urge Transition to Low-Carbon Economy, Clean Energy","November 9, 2016 Wednesday 12:04 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: Delegations from the ACT Alliance, Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and World Council of Churches (WCC) at the United Nations climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco, 7-18 November, are jointly demanding a more rapid transition to a low-carbon economy based on clean energy in order to stem rising global temperatures. The faith-based organizations are represented at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Morocco as part of their continuing advocacy and action on climate change. On the opening day of the conference, the ACT Alliance expressed hope that the 2016 meeting should be an ""action COP"" in which ""the targets set out in the Paris agreement must now be fleshed out to ensure that the headlines are followed by ambitious rules."" ""Governments have shown their commitment to tackling climate change and the agreements made at the Paris summit can now be fulfilled. However, an agreement with only headlines will not make any difference, therefore the agenda at COP 22 is very important to ensure that now the implementation must begin"", said Dinesh Vyas, leader of the ACT Alliance climate change working group. The LWF, which in 2015 made a policy decision to not invest in fossil fuels, is represented at the UN climate conferences by its all-youth delegation, with members from the African region participating in Marrakech. At the climate negotiations, LWF is advocating for intergenerational justice and solidarity with those who are most vulnerable to the impact of extreme weather events. LWF general secretary Rev. Dr Martin Junge said: ""In the joint Catholic-Lutheran commemoration of the Reformation, we stated that our joint service in this world must extend to God's creation, which suffers exploitation and the specific effects of insatiable greed. We must work toward a change in hearts and minds that leads to responsible care for God's creation."" In recent years, ecumenical groups have been deeply involved in advocacy and action on climate change and have taken part in every conference of parties. The WCC and related groups have taken strong moral positions on the fossil fuel industry that generates emissions that cause climate change. Putting their money where their mouth is, they have divested from fossil fuels, withdrawing a pool of significant investments from the industry. People of faith should come together and work together on climate justice, and it is needed now more than ever, stated WCC general secretary Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit. ""I have met climate refugees during my recent visit to New Zealand and Australia - we are not talking about tomorrow, this is the current situation, and it's time to take action now. Climate change and its adverse effects on the whole creation, especially on vulnerable, poor and indigenous communities is an urgent concern for all people of faith around the world. In the current increased risk of social and political tensions, fear, conflict and displacement in a climate-constrained world, our task is to bring justice and peace for the social and ecological wellbeing and sustainable development for all"", said Tveit. In the run-up to Marrakech, the three general secretaries signed the COP22 Interfaith Climate Statement alongside 220 other faith leaders.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA102","Why Women Matter For Effective Climate Change Solutions - Analysis","November 20, 2016 Sunday","Eurasia Review","By Fab\'edola Ortiz Establishing a clear path forward and including women and girls in global efforts on climate change were some of the biggest challenges the delegations and non-state actors faced at the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech. Formally known as the Twenty-Second Conference of Parties ( COP22 ), the conference had a special day (November 14) for discussing exclusively gender issues within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""Study after study has shown that women are the most vulnerable to climate change and that's why there is a need for strong leadership on this issue,"" said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. ""We need to prioritise women's demands and offer the proper responses to climate change,"" Mariam Diallo-Dram\'e9, President of the Association of Women Leaders and Sustainable Development (AFLED) told IDN. AFLED is based in Bamako, Mali, and works to empower girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 35. Diallo-Dram\'e9 explained that because adaptation to climate change is inextricably related to access to education, climate adaptation must therefore also envision a holistic solution of educating women and sending girls to school. ""We work to empower girls' citizenship and to involve them in decision-making, we encourage them to be part of political scenario in Mali,"" she said. Women in the Sahel region are responsible for the well-being of the family, often having to walk long distances to fetch water and food on unsafe roads, she noted, adding that ""resources are rare in the Sahara region, and most of the time men leave women to farm. They have their own traditional methods for adaptation, but it is not enough, they need help."" As an African voice advocating for gender issues to be included in the climate talks in Marrakech, Diallo-Dram\'e9 regretted that this issue was not being properly addressed in the negotiations. ""I have the feeling that in those high-level meetings we, African women from the Sahel, are going to stay behind because we are not there at the table. We are not able to address the gender issue in our countries, governments don't understand, all legislation regarding gender and human rights is just on paper and is not being implemented. When you talk about climate justice it is going to be for the West and not for us,"" she said. For the last two weeks at COP22 (November 7-18, 2016), country delegations negotiated implementation of the new global agreement to tackle climate change adopted in Paris in 2015. The Paris Agreement embraces a language sensitive to gender equality and recognises Parties' responsibility to respect and promote human rights obligations through climate change action calling for ""gender-responsive adaptation measures and capacity-building activities"". In Marrakech, Parties were expected to carry on with the Lima Work Programme on Gender \- which is a two-year work programme on gender launched at COP20 in 2014. Civil society groups had strongly advocated a clear plan of action on gender within the UNFCCC and financial support for the activities under the Lima Work Programme. ""We start from the point that we are not victims, we are advancing now on the discourse of empowerment,"" Mait\'e9 Rodr\'edguez Bland\'f3n, coordinator for the Guatemala Foundation in the Central American country, told IDN. ""Climate resilience will come from empowering women in their communities. Women are very well organised at the local level and they know their role. We focus on changing the perception from being a victim to becoming a key actor and protagonist for change."" Bland\'f3n leads the Women and Peace Network in Central America with grassroots women's organisations from Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras. Her work has focused on grassroots women's movements struggling for land rights, women's rights and safer cities for women over the past decade.She said that there was too much dialogue and not enough action at COP22 . Engaging indigenous women's voices has also been a concern for Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. ""Indigenous women have a very important role because they are the ones who are really involved in subsistence low-carbon food production. They are the ones who take care of the environment within their territories. Their role is to really ensure that the biodiversity is sustained,"" she told IDN. Tauli-Corpuz believes that COP22 did have a strong gender focus.""Women are here to make sure that their rights will also be addressed in the decisions being reached. Indigenous women are the strong allies for climate change solutions, they should be at the core of the discussions,"" she said. Civil society organisations and non-state actors had a crucial role in COP22 , Driss El Yazami, Head of the Civil Society Team at the conference and President of the National Human Rights Council of Morocco, told IDN. ""Women's groups from several countries gathered here to lay the first foundations of an African Network of Women for Climate Justice. Reaching the Paris Agreement was itself influenced by civil society and non-state actors. The Paris Agreement recognises the important engagement of the various actors, including non-governmental organisations,"" she added. Around 1,500 local and regional leaders representing more than 780 local and regional governments from 114 countries gathered in Marrakech and launched a roadmap for action to start a global campaign to localise climate finance in 2017 and implement a 'Global Action Framework for Localising Climate Finance' by 2020. \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA106","WWF STATEMENT ON CLOSE OF COP22","November 18, 2016 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by World Wildlife Fund (WWF): In response to the close of COP22 , Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, leader of WWF Internationals Climate and Energy Practice, issued the following statement: The UN climate talks continue to be filled with twists and turns, but they have delivered what they needed to this week putting substance behind the promise of the Paris Agreement so it can be fully implemented. The Marrakech work has not been the most glamorous, but its a key step in the chain reaction needed to roll out the agreement. Countries commitment to the Paris Agreement also passed its first stress test this week with the US election results. Unequivocally, they restated that they are in this for the long haul. The reality is that the world is moving ahead on this issue. This irreversible momentum will only build as market signals and commitments across all sectors of society continue pouring in. Already, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement underscoring its historic importance. Nations also began submitting their long-term roadmaps for decarbonisation. But theres still work to do. The emissions gap continues to grow between what science tells us is needed to protect the planet from the worst impacts of climate change and the goals governments set in Paris. Urgently reducing emissions and preparing for the climate change impacts that are already affecting us is essential for the worlds future prosperity, safety and security. In Marrakech, countries agreed to take stock of progress in two years and make every effort to come back with more ambitious targets and plans before 2020 to ensure we work quickly to close the widening emissions gap. This is a critical outcome this week that further solidified progress on the Paris Agreement. While parties work to finalize the Paris Agreement fine print by the next major political moment in 2018, more needs to be done in the next few years to clarify consistency of national targets. In addition, there are still gaps in finance and adaptation, despite some announcements here on financing for adaptation and capacity building. We expect to see developed countries up their game significantly on finance and other support beyond current projections, and are very encouraged to see China and other countries stepping up their south-south cooperation. This work was bolstered by the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of around 50 countries that committed to reviewing and improving their current emissions-cutting goals in 2018 and shifting to 100% renewable energy by 2050 or before. Here in Marrakech the negotiations kick-started a critical discussion about the rules for implementing the agreement and accelerating climate action. It set the path for the next set of negotiations to complete those rules and raise ambition, paving the way to tighten national commitments, improve preparedness at home and provide financial support in line with science and equity. Over the coming years, we expect to see the trends of falling costs for renewables and scaled action by all actors private sector, cities, investors, and by governments all over the world continue to accelerate the inevitable shift to low carbon, climate-resilient development. ### \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA107","AT COP22, UN WOMEN TO SPOTLIGHT CENTRAL ROLE OF WOMEN IN CLIMATE RESPONSE","November 8, 2016 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM): Events and activists to amplify co-benefits between gender equality and climate action for sustainable development Media Contacts: Maria Sanchez, Ph: +1 646 781-4507; Email: maria.sanchez [at] unwomen.org Houda Areski, Ph: +212 (0)6 70105995; Email: houda.areski[at]unwomen.org Oisika Chakrabarti, Ph: +1 646 781-4522; Email: oisika.chakrabarti[at]unwomen.org (New York, 7 November) Following the historic Paris Agreement, as the first Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) convenes in Marrakech from 7-18 November, the meeting provides a unique opportunity to ensure policy direction towards implementation of gender-responsive climate actions at all levels. The Paris Agreement, signed by 197 Parties (ratified by 94 to date) commits to promote gender equality obligations when addressing climate change. The impacts of climate change are not gender neutral. In the past 10 years 87 percent of disasters have been climate related. While disasters impact all segments of the population, evidence shows there are differences in how men and women are affected by, cope with and respond to such disasters. Climate change impacts women differently and disproportionately more than men. For example, women accounted for 67 per cent of the fatalities of the Indian Ocean Tsunami. Post-disaster assessment in Myanmar in 2015 showed that women and girls had lower recovery capacity due to lower incomes and fewer productive assets, and higher food insecurity and malnutrition. This differentiated impact is due to the structural barriers women face, from discriminatory laws, to social norms, and the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work. This is played out during disasters with women often being the last to escape as the ensure the safety of family members before ensuring their own and women and girls being vulnerable to sexual violence as they become food and water collectors post-disaster. Additionally, in the aftermath of disasters, discriminatory social norms such as food hierarchies and limited mobility, can also exclude women from life-saving services and decision making processes. Similarly, in agriculture, where women comprise 43 percent of the agricultural workforce, climate change exacerbates the existing barriers faced by women farmers, who have less resources, technology and land security due to discriminatory policy framework or harmful social norms. While the differential impact of climate change on women is increasingly understood, the critical role women and girls can play as leaders and agents of change in climate action and management of natural resources is often overlooked in climate negotiations, investments and policies. In most developing countries, for example, women are the primary household energy managers and key actors in the food system, and can be powerful actors in the transition to sustainable energy and climate resilient agriculture At COP22 UN Women events at COP22 UN Women events will showcase best practices, initiatives and voices of women and girls at the forefront of climate response. UN Womens recently launched climate action related flagship programme initiatives will also be spotlighted at COP22 .

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA108","Climate simulator plays role in COP15","February 2, 2017 Thursday","The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College","A climate simulator developed by a team of Dartmouth alumni played a key role in negotiations at the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Copenhagen last month. The Climate Rapid Overview and Decision-support Simulator, known as C-ROADS, provided real-time analysis used to inform negotiators during the talks. The Dartmouth alumni involved in the development of C-ROADS include Beth Sawin '88 and Drew Jones '90 of the Sustainability Institute, Tom Fiddaman '87 of Ventana Systems and John Sterman '77, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology System Dynamics Group and a management professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern '73 attended the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. C-ROADS is a ""decision-maker-oriented"" simulation that provides information on how greenhouse gas emission reductions will affect the global climate climate, according to the C-ROADS web site. The model allows users to calculate potential climate changes, including variations in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, global surface temperature and sea levels. Although climate models have been available for some time, C-ROADS changed the nature of negotiations at COP15, because C-ROADS made it possible to perform climate analyses quickly enough to provide immediate feedback to negotiators, according to Sterman. ""C-ROADS is closing a big feedback loop between people's actions and their consequences,"" Jones said in an interview with The Dartmouth. According to Sterman, the advantage of C-ROADS lies in both its scientific reliability and its simple user interface. ""C-ROADS is both grounded in and consistent with the best available climate science, as well as transparent, fast and easy to use,"" he added. Seven members of the C-ROADS team attended COP15. Jones and Sawin were present for the entire duration of the talks, according to Sawin. C-ROADS was more successful in Copenhagen than the team had anticipated, Sawin said. The group's web site, ClimateInteractive.org, received approximately 300,000 hits during the conference. The team's data was also published in major media outlets including the International Herald Tribune. Prominent political leaders, including U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern '73 and Sen. John Kerry D-Mass., have also recognized the advantages of using C-ROADS, according to Sterman. ""[Kerry] has taken a keen interest in C-ROADS and is a very strong advocate of its use,"" Sterman said. Currently, only the United States and China are officially using C-ROADS, but other countries have approached the developers and are considering the possibility of using the simulator, according to Jones. ""C-ROADS is a tool for supporting joint conversation,"" Sawin said. ""We can see the possibility of greater cooperation."" The developers are now adapting the program to provide decision makers with more information about climate impact, including its effects on biodiversity, soil respiration, permafrost exposure and agricultural conditions. Jones and Sawin are meeting with top climate advisors from China's National Development and Reform Commission this week to develop a version of C-ROADS for the Chinese. ""We want to empower not just the U.S. State Department, but other equivalents of the State Department around the world to do this kind of analysis themselves,"" Sawin said. C-ROADS was originally based on Fiddaman's doctoral dissertation at MIT. Later, in collaboration with the Sustainability Institute, the model gained momentum as developers realized there was an ""appetite"" for the technology, Fiddaman said in an interview with The Dartmouth. All the alumni involved in C-ROADS trace their initial interest in sustainability to the influence of late environmental studies professor Donella Meadows. ""Dana Meadows taught us to make simulations relevant to decision making,"" Jones said. Although simulations provide political leaders with valuable information, they still have to gain public support to make progress in combating climate change, Fiddaman said. ""President Obama wasn't able to promise more than he thinks the Senate can deliver, and the Senate can't go further than what they think the voters will support,"" Sawin said. The C-ROADS team has created several versions of the program to increase its usage. C-ROADS ""Common Platform,"" a version that can run on a laptop, was designed for use by climate analysts during COP15 negotiations, Sawin said. Additionally, C-LEARN simplified version of the program is available to the public online through ClimateInteractive.org. Sawin added that the team aims to expand access to the simulation model to members of civil society, not just political leaders. ""The real challenge is getting these concepts understood by members of the business community, educational world and the public at large,"" Sterman said. \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA110","Latin America Green News Special Report: COP22 | Marrakesh","November 19, 2016 Saturday","US Official News","Albany: Natural Resources Defense Council has issued the following news release: COP22 The 22nd Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) which began in Marrakesh, Morocco last Monday will come to a conclusion today. The convention, which hosted over sixty heads of state, focused on taking concrete action in order to achieve the priorities laid out by the Paris Agreement, especially those related to adaptation, transparency, technology transfer, mitigation, capacity building and loss and damages. Despite the results of the US election, global leaders took the COP as an opportunity to reiterate their commitment to ensuring climate action moves forward. Salaheddine Mezouar, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs who chairs the conference on climate change, began the event by assuring the world that there is  no going a back on this fight Latin American countries in particular showed solidarity and reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the global efforts against climate change. Two main issues stood at the forefront of the agenda for countries in the region: the reporting and administrative structure of the agreement and financing schemes to support their efforts. The Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, representing eight countries in the region, publicly announced their commitment to ratify the Paris Agreement, pressed for greater clarity and transparency on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and emphasized the need for greater financing for developing countries. What Latin America brought to the table While much took place during the last two weeks, here is a recap of select actions from Latin American countries in Marrakesh: Chile, with President Michelle Bachelet in attendance, reiterated their commitment to climate action presenting their 3rd national Communication with updated national emissions inventory numbers. Chile also recently presented its new National Strategy on Climate Change and Vegetation Resources and created a Climate Change Agency. President Bachelet expressed the responsibility that Chile holds to work expeditiously on the implementation of the Agreement and the importance of a transparent global collective and collaborative effort to succeed in its implementation. Mexico presented their Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy listing priorities for action in the coming decades to reduce emissions 50 percent by 2050 and move towards a low carbon economy. (To read more about Mexico\' s progress toward its climate pledge read NRDCs issue brief here.) Mexico\' s delegation also highlighted the country\' s progress implementing their emission reduction goals through incremental renewable energy and emissions reductions targets. Highlighting progress at the national level through the passage of the General Climate Change and Energy Transition laws, Senator Silvia Garza Galv\'e1n commended the joint work of the executive and legislative branches to fulfill their climate commitments. Meanwhile, Governor of Jalisco, Aristoteles Sandoval Diaz, called on local action to support and push national efforts forward and urged world leaders to refrain from politicizing the issue of climate change. In a sign of the importance of cross-border collaboration, Mexico and Chile agreed to a US $14 million partnership with Canada to finance the adoption of clean technologies and waste management policies in order to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. Costa Rica and the Ivory Coast have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop greater collaboration between the two nations on issues of climate change and forestry with a focus on reducing deforestation. Colombia announced a plan to link forest protections to its peace process. The announcement included a plan to recognize indigenous claims to huge areas of rainforest. Recognition of native land tenure protects forests from illegal loggers and gives huge boosts to carbon storage. Brazil launched the BioFuturo Platform, a coalition of 20 countries that want to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels and biomaterials as an alternative to fossil fuels. (To read more about Brazil\' s progress toward its climate pledge read NRDCs issue brief here.) Meanwhile, Argentina\' s Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Sergio Bergman, announced he will focus on achieving zero deforestation and bringing a profound change in the country\' s energy matrix. During his speech, he said ""Climate challenge is not a technical one but an ethical one.

Outline Taking advantage of the COP22 of the UNFCCC held in Marrakech, Morocco, on November 17, 2016, the government of Japan held a COP22 The side event was held in response to the First Strategic Dialogue of the Carbon Market Platform held in Tokyo on June 16 and 17, 2016, co-chaired by Germany and Japan, and participants introduced the summary of the First Strategic Dialogue and discussed the future directions of the Carbon Market Platform and other issues. The Second Strategic Dialogue of the Carbon Market Platform will be held in Italy in 2017, co-chaired by Italy and Germany. Outline of the side event: Date: November 17 (Thur.), 2016, from 10:30 to 11:30 (local time) Venue: Japan Pavilion built at the venue of the COP22 (Marrakech, Morocco) Organizers: Japanese side: The Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs German side: The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) 2. Background to the side event The G7 Leaders Declaration issued at the G7 Elmau Summit meeting in June 2015 stated as follows on the establishment of a platform for the strategic dialogue: We commit to applying effective policies and actions throughout the global economy, including carbon market-based and regulatory instruments. The establishment of such platform for the strategic dialogue is also referred to in the G7 Ise-Shima Leaders Declaration. In response, on June 16 and 17, 2016, the First Strategic Dialogue of the Carbon Market Platform was held in Tokyo, co-chaired by Japan, a chair of the G7 Ise-Shima Summit meeting in 2016, and by Germany. Japan held the side event to introduce the summary of the First Strategic Dialogue and also to discuss the future directions of the Carbon Market Platform as well as its expected role. 3. Summary of the outcomes Participants shared the same recognition that the Platform is a bridge between a political will concerning carbon markets and technical knowledge. They recognized anew that continuous dialogue among policymakers is essential to keep providing political impetus. They confirmed that member countries should strengthen collaboration to further utilize future carbon markets and other opportunities at the Second Strategic Dialogue of the Carbon Market Platform to be held in Italy in 2017, co-chaired by Italy and Germany. References 1: G7 Leaders Declaration issued at the G7 Elmau Summit (excerpts) In order to incentivize investments towards low-carbon growth opportunities we commit to the long-term objective of applying effective policies and actions throughout the global economy, including carbon market-based and regulatory instruments and call on other countries to join us. We are committed to establishing a platform for a strategic dialogue on these issues based on voluntary participation and in cooperation with relevant partners, including the World Bank. 2: G7 Leaders Declaration issued at the G7 Ise-Shima Summit (excerpts) We recognize the important role of providing incentives for emission reduction activities, including tools such as domestic policies and carbon pricing. We welcome the establishment of the Carbon Market Platform and its first strategic dialogue to be held in Tokyo. 3: Overviews of the outcomes of the First Strategic Dialogue From 16 to 17 June 2016, representatives from Australia, Canada, Chile, European Union, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Senegal, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam as well as from the international organizations International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP), OECD, the UNFCCC secretariat and the World Bank met in Tokyo, Japan for the first Strategic Dialogue of the Carbon Market Platform, which was established based on Leaders Declaration of the G7 Summit at Schloss Elmau in Germany in June 2015. In the Declaration, the heads of states emphasised that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required with a decarbonisation of the global economy over the course of this century. In order to facilitate a worldwide low-carbon development path, they committed to the long-term objective of applying effective policies and actions throughout the global economy, including carbon market-based and regulatory instruments, and decided to establish a political platform for a strategic dialogue on these issues. The aim of the Platform is to facilitate an informed and open strategic dialogue between countries on climate change policies, and the Platform will provide a forum to identify political and institutional gaps at the national and international levels and allow for new cooperative and coordinated approaches to be developed. The Dialogue was co-chaired by Mr. Shigemoto Kajihara, Vice-Minister for Global Environmental Affairs, Ministry of the Environment of Japan, and Mr. Karsten Sach, Director General, Climate Policy, European and International Policy, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) of Germany. In the Dialogue, participants have presented their experiences with carbon markets, carbon pricing and regulatory instruments in the context of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and discussed with the aim to foster understanding of the various domestic approaches, uncover their drivers and barriers, identify best practices, and discover new options for policy coordination that can enhance environmental integrity, leverage gains in efficiency, and reduce competitiveness concerns. Participants also discussed Article 6 of the Paris Agreement which provides countries with opportunities to use internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) and UN-backed credits to achieve their NDCs, and how the Platform should support and complement activities to the UNFCCC process in the development of guidelines, rules, modalities, procedures and best practices, which are necessary to support environmentally sound and cost-effective mitigation outcomes while using carbon markets. During the course of discussions, it was highlighted that the Platform can provide political impetus and ultimately support fostering a robust and sustainable development of carbon markets globally, while taking into account national preferences and circumstances. It was also highlighted that continuous dialogue that will engage policymakers at the Director-General level are essential in order to keep providing political impetus and that such dialogue should be supported by preparatory work at the expert level. In this regard, the Second Strategic Dialogue will be held in Italy in 2017, co-chaired by Italy and Germany, with a view to accommodate the diversity of approaches in its members climate policy strategies and to ensure a balanced participation. The outline of this Dialogue will be presented at a side event during COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco. \"

The Renault eDams followed up victory at the opening race on the streets of Hong Kong with another dominant drive at the Circuit Automobile Moulay El Hassan. Buemi started down in seventh after he was handed a five-place grid penalty for running with an underweight fire extinguisher during qualifying, but ultimately it was no setback for the reigning world champion. By the halfway point -- where drivers pit to switch to another fully charged car -- the Swiss was up to third with just Techeetah's Jean Eric Vergne and race leader Felix Rosenqvist ahead of him. And with Vergne picking up a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane during the race, Buemi was soon left with just Rosenqvist to chase down. Read: Buemi wins in Hong Kong The Swede, who replaced Bruno Senna at Mahindra Racing in the summer, had taken pole earlier in the day in only his second ePrix but was powerless as Buemi bared down on him in the latter stages of the race. With six laps to go, Buemi's superior Renault eDams power train prevailed as he reeled in the rookie driver before taking the checkered flag with room to spare. Rosenqvist would also be passed by Virgin Racing's Sam Bird before the finish, but the Swede was delighted with third place -- Mahindra's second podium of the season following Nick Heidfeld's third place finish in Hong Kong. ""A podium is more than I could expect,"" Rosenqvist said. ""I think we are right up there. We are really much better than the team was last year and it's really cool to be part of it."" Buemi's teammate Nico Prost ended up finishing fourth ahead of ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport's Lucas di Grassi, the runner up in last season's drivers' championship. Vergne's time penalty helped relegate the Frenchman to eighth behind Di Grassi's teammate Daniel Abt and NextEV's Oliver Turvey who placed six and seventh respectively. Buemi's win sees him extend his lead at the top of the standings. The Swiss now has 50 points with Di Grassi trailing by 22 points in second and Prost a further four points back.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA116","WHO OWNS THIS LAND? A QUESTION THAT MATTERS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND COP22","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the International Food Policy Research Institute: By Amy Lieberman A woman tills the soil on a small farm in Tanzania. Photo by: Mitchell Maher / International Food Policy Institute / CC BY-NC-ND More than 1 billion people on the planet lack secure rights to the land they rely on for their livelihood, a problem that has long been recognized as an obstacle to economic development in the poorest parts of the world. Now, experts say, it's also proving to be an obstacle to solving climate change, with at least one-fourth of the world's forest carbon stored on communal land. The issue will get some attention at the upcoming COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco. But it stands as one of many side panel discussions on agriculture, implementation of the landmark Paris climate agreement and climate-related displacement, to name a few. ""It [the connection] is not understood or appreciated,"" explained Chris Jochnick, president and CEO of Landesa, a nonprofit that works to secure land rights for the world's poorest people. Jochnick spoke with Devex at the 11th annual Columbia International Investment Conference in New York this week, focused on climate change and sustainable investment in natural resources. He explained how land insecure farmers typically operate with ""short-term horizons,"" thinking mostly about basic productivity. They likely do not have the time or money to consider all of the climate-friendly practices and tools they should be implementing. ""When we recognize something like one-fourth of global emissions is attributed to agriculture, and most agriculture is done by smallholder farmers, if they are not practicing climate-smart techniques that is a huge loss in terms of what we could be doing. This undercuts everything we're trying to do on climate change,"" Jochnick said. Present NASA projections of global sea level rise by year 2100 range from 0.2 to 2.0 meters. The Paris climate change agreement, agreed upon in December 2015, commits governments to reduce emissions to help limit rising global temperatures to under 2 degrees Celsius. The deal went into effect Friday, just in time for COP22 , the United Nations annual climate change conference.Land rights are included as part of the Sustainable Development Goals an evolution from their exclusion from the Millennium Development Goals. This has not translated into language in the Paris agreement, however, and in most national climate action plans. Or, for that matter, in a funding boost, Jochnick told Devex. Though he said he has witnessed a growth in partnerships with the development of the 2030 development agenda. Women, meanwhile, are generally more likely to not have land in their names. ""The minority of countries are looking at it, but it's the minority. Women and land rights in particular are virtually absent and that is just so shortsighted, because ... land is at the center of so many issues, so if you can't get that right, you are really building on a house of sand,"" Jochnick said. The Ford Foundation, though, is paying attention to new youth-focused funding opportunities in this area, and how the narrative can be reshaped to focus on people who are advocating for their land, not just those who are painted as victims, said Penny Davies, a program officer of the Ford Foundation's Equitable Development team.""There's a lot of talk about vulnerable communities and a significant number of people are actually protecting their forests and not being recognized for that work,"" she said. ""We're relying on young people to have a relationship with those forests and land. ... I'm keen on promoting youth engagement and positive things, people who are proud of their territory."" Discussion at the two-day Columbia conference, which included remarks by economist Jeffrey Sachs, veered from the ongoing North Dakota pipeline protests and the upcoming presidential election in the U.S., to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and COP22 . Exclusions from the Paris climate change deal are inevitable, noted Timothy Groser, New Zealand's ambassador to the United States, be it agriculture or land rights, as Jochnick and others commented. He stressed the importance of ""forward thinking"" and accepting incremental progress.""That is how agreements get done,"" he said. Tearing everything down, on the other hand, is a ""recipe for agreeing on nothing, ever.""Devex Senior Correspondent Michael Igoe is reporting live from COP22 in Morocco this week.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA117","Indigenous Knowledge offers innovative solutions to address climate change","November 7, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Paris: UNESCO has issued the following news release: The UNESCO Pavilion at the 2016 UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP22 ) opened its doors today with a series of discussions on the solutions that indigenous knowledge can offer to tackle climate change, and how to best support particularly vulnerable local and indigenous communities. Over 400 million of the world\' s indigenous peoples live in territories that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Indigenous peoples of northern Europe, Siberia and Alaska, pastoralist communities in the Sahel, or island communities in the Pacific Ocean, to name but a few, are already experiencing adverse effects very keenly. Yet they are using their highly detailed knowledge, produced through direct experience over generations, to observe and respond actively to changing climatic conditions. Indigenous representatives presented the main conclusions of the international conference organized by UNESCO and CNRS in support of international efforts to implement the Paris Climate Agreement. Held on 2 and 3 November 2016, it focused on the role that indigenous and local knowledge can play, alongside science, in observing and responding to the impacts of a changing climate. UNESCO has long recognized that we need to bring together understandings, values and solutions from many horizons in order to tackle global challenges.  Indigenous peoples respond, innovate and adapt to this context of change, and their resilience is rooted in their ways of life and their social solidarity , stressed Flavia Schlegel, UNESCO\' s Assistant Director-General for the Natural Sciences.  They will find a path, whatever the hardships, thanks to their trust in their deeply rooted cultures, and the strength of their observations and knowledge, which are both ancestral and innovative . Collaboration between indigenous knowledge holders and mainstream scientific research can generate new co-produced knowledge that will enable effective action to cope with climate change. The similarities and differences between different knowledge systems must be better understood, in order to facilitate this collaboration. For example, extreme events are measured by Sami herders in terms of consequence, while climatologist will consider intensity. A series of low-intensity warm and cold spells, resulting in the formation of an ice crust on the snow that prevents reindeer for accessing their food, will be recorded as an extreme event by the Sami but not by climatologists. Indigenous observations and knowledge factor in elements that are often overlooked by scientific experts. In Ethiopia, Afar pastoralists traditionally predict weather and climate through the observation of stars, winds, livestock, insects, birds, trees and other wildlife. The information is collected, shared and analyzed through traditional institutions, who triangulate various sources of information. Over generations, indigenous peoples have modified and maintained most of the world\' s \' wilderness\' areas. Fire management, community forestry and indigenous soil enhancement practices have shaped landscapes across the globe. These traditional practices have the potential to enhance carbon sinks and provide benefits back to the communities; they provide tools for the sustainable management of nature. However, defining appropriate ways to engage indigenous knowledge at the intergovernmental level remains challenging, although international recognition of indigenous knowledge of the environment has accelerated, coupled with an increased awareness of the need to safeguard rights of indigenous peoples. A series of thematic days will be ogranized during COP22 at the UNESCO Pavilion in the Civil Society Area of the COP22 conference, to assist Member States through UNESCO's uniquely multidisciplinary expertise and outreach in climate change education, science, culture and communication, mobilizing efforts for enhanced climate change awareness and action.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA118","Spotlight on indigenous rights at COP22 climate talks","November 17, 2016 Thursday","US Official News","Geneva: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has issued the following news release  When I was seven years old, an oil company came to my village, says Nina Gualinga, 23, recalling how her indigenous Kichwa community was offered $10,000 to allow oil operations in the 136,000 hectares of pristine rainforest that make up the Kichwa territory in the Ecuadorian Amazon. [Indigenous rights activists Nina Gualinga stands before the Ecuadorian flag during COP21.\£9 2015 Caroline Bennett/Amazon Watch]  Our territory is a place where we live in harmony with nature, said Gualinga who has spent most of her life engaged in her community\' s fight to save their land from oil exploitation. For the people of Sarayaku, protecting their forests is about keeping oil in the ground and preventing deforestation in order to defend their lands and way of life. Without receiving the community's permission, the oil companies arrived in helicopters in the early 2000s. When the Kichwa people resisted, State military forces arrived to beat the men, bury dynamite under indigenous land and cut down the forest. The Kichwa took their case to the Inter-American Court on Human Rights in San Jose, where in 2012 the people of Sarayaku achieved a major victory when the court ruled that the government must consult indigenous communities before licensing oil companies to do business on indigenous territory. Although the Kichwa won their court case, their land remains under threat, and Gualinga continues to fight for her land and her people's rights. She wants to protect forest resources for future generations and to secure the rights of indigenous peoples. At the COP22 climate talks in Marrakech, Gualinga highlighted the impacts of climate change on the Kichwa people. Working with a network of indigenous activists, Gualinga is urging governments to prioritize climate justice for indigenous communities in climate actions aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Like other indigenous communities, Gualinga\' s people have contributed the least to climate change but are bearing the brunt of its impacts. Speaking on a panel about community adaptation to reduce disaster risk and build resiliency against climate change, Gualinga described the impacts of climate change her village has already begun to see. She noted that floods that used to come every 15 to 20 years, now occur two or three times in a single year.  We see these changes because we live so close to nature, she says.  Our entire livelihood depends on a healthy environment. On the entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement on 4 November, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\' ad Al Hussein called on States to prioritize the protection of the rights of people disproportionately affected by climate change.  I urge all the parties that will be at the COP22 in Marrakech to ensure that the meeting is about States taking action in accordance with their international human right obligations, Zeid said. Climate change affects a wide array of human rights, including the rights to life, water and sanitation, food, health, housing, self-determination, culture and development. In the face of these threats, Gualinga and other indigenous activists are demanding that climate action uphold human rights agreements and norms, especially for indigenous peoples. Thursday 17 November marks the first Climate Justice Day, taking place during the Convention of the Parties (COP) climate change conference in Marrakech. The day focuses on importance of embedding human rights into climate action.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA120","Report from COP22: Focus shifts to implementing the Paris agreement","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Washington: Green Building Council has issued the following news release: At COP22 in Marrakech, participants focused on what will be needed to implement last year's historic Paris climate agreement. With unprecedented speed, the historic Paris Agreement has entered into force less than one year after representatives of more than 190 countries came together for the climate negotiations. The signing of the agreement paved the way for this year\' s Conference of Parties, ( COP22 ), in Marrakech, Morocco, to focus on implementation. Doubling down on climate commitment At the outset of COP22 , climate news was both sobering and motivating. The UN released its annual Emissions Gap Report documenting in detail what we already knew that even the current Paris Agreement pledges (known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs) are insufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees, and UNEP calls for the world to cut an additional 25 percent from predicted 2030 emissions. Scientists also warn we need to limit warming to 1.5 degrees to avoid the worst consequences. The magnitude of scale-up required is staggering. The IEA estimates that investment of $1 trillion annually in low carbon energy by 2030 is needed. U.S. Special Envoy Jonathan Pershing emphasized how important it is to make sure the Paris Agreement is successful in these early years, saying that positive reinforcement will build momentum and motivate further ambition. In Marrakech, national delegates got to work, developing the  rule book for how to implement several key sections of the Paris Agreement. For example, working groups and subsidiary bodies were considering technology investment pathways; carbon accounting rules to promote environmental integrity and support transfers; and the data sources to be used in the global  stocktake, which will be conducted in 2018 and every five years thereafter to assess the collective progress toward the agreement\' s goals. When the unexpected U.S. election results came in midweek, the international community had questions, but remained focused on strengthening its commitment to the task at hand. International market transformation The overarching theme at this year\' s COP was the inevitability of massive market transformation, which is already under way, particularly in regard to renewable energy. Host country Morocco is a case in point. After phasing out its subsidy of fossil fuels over the past decade, the nation shifted to wind and solar and recently received the lowest-ever wind energy cost of $30/MWh for its tender. Moreover, China\' s recent shift in policy away from coal motivated in part to address health concerns related to air pollution along with the drop in natural gas prices have already flattened coal consumption globally. In addition, the IEA issued its World Energy Outlook 2016, finding that the combination of cost reductions across the energy sector and government policies will enable a doubling of both renewables and improvements in energy efficiency over the next 25 years. Economic benefits to climate action Along with the market signals, the economic opportunity presented by climate action was on full display at the conference, prominent in the speeches and pavilions of national governments from around the globe. Jill Duggan of We Mean Business and the Prince of Wales Corporate Leadership Group called the Paris Agreement  a fantastic business opportunity and described the private sector as a crucial partner in securing a prosperous and sustainable low-carbon economy for all. Duggan was joined by many governments and thought leaders alike in recognizing a strong business voice as essential to successful implementation of the agreement. USGBC was pleased to participate in a UNFCCC panel, along with the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE), Philips Lighting, the Alliance to Save Energy (ASE), Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, that focused on how businesses are supporting action while growing the economy. Data from Bloomberg Finance, in partnership with BSCE, illustrated the decoupling of energy consumption and GDP growth in the U.S.: as our GDP expanded 83 percent over the last 25 years, energy consumption only ticked up 17 percent. USGBC presented tools like the recently launched arc platform and carbon metric tracking. Examples of new business models to deliver clean energy and energy efficiency were discussed and the panel focused on solutions that are supporting Paris Agreement goals.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA121","Beyond Paris: COP22, a critical nuts-and-bolts carbon-cutting summit","November 3, 2016 Thursday 7:03 PM EST","Mongabay News","Nov 03, 2016( Mongabay News: HYPERLINK http://news.mongabay.com http://news.mongabay.com COP22 isn't getting near the media attention Paris did in 2015, it is crucial for putting nuts-and-bolts mechanisms in place to keep global temperatures from rising much higher. One meeting focus will be on global forest initiatives meant to store carbon, such as REDD+. Negotiators will look at ways in which to effectively engage tropical countries such as Indonesia, which continues clear-cutting its rainforests and replacing them with vast tracts of oil palm plantations. Another discussion will focus on 'loss and damage,' and seek pragmatic ways in which the world's nations can financially support countries suffering from major disruptive climate change disasters. The insurance industry questions whether projected gigantic climate change losses can be insured against. A major concern is that fossil fuel companies and transnational corporate lobbies, which wield tremendous influence at UN climate conferences, will be able to dull the teeth of any climate change-curbing mechanisms put in place. Environmental NGOs will be on hand to guard against such efforts. An open-air market in Marrakesh, Morocco. The city is hosting November's COP22 Climate Conference and decisions made there could shape its future. If the rising heat brought by global warming isn't abated, then parts of North Africa could become inhabitable by mid-century, according to a 2016 study. Feliciano Guimara es licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic licenseThe first question I ask officials heading to Marrakesh, Morocco for this November's United Nations Climate Summit known as COP22 : How do you top Paris? 'There is a lot of political momentum coming from Paris,' answers Dan Bodansky, a climate adviser to the White House and a law professor at Arizona State University. 'But will it actually lead to a dynamic where there are changes on the ground in terms of what countries are actually doing?' That is exactly the sort of nuts-and-bolts pragmatic role negotiators hope COP22 will play apr\'e8s Paris. The Paris Agreement is without question an historic achievement. World leaders authored the first-ever blueprint to broadly tackle climate change. The agreement was ratified globally with unprecedented haste and achieves the force of law this week, on November 4th, four years earlier than anticipated. Meanwhile, more than 100 countries, including the U.S., China and India, agreed last month to dramatically limit the future use of hydroflourocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners. Another climate victory was hailed. But those headed to COP22 [1] will emphatically tell anyone listening: Folks, we're not there yet. We're not even close. So COP22 , the Conference of the Parties  running from November 7-18  will need to top Paris in many very practical ways.The global media spotlighted COP21, where the Paris Agreement was finalized in December 2015. But it is at COP22 this November  an event not likely to be well covered by journalists  that the world's nations must begin hammering out the nuts-and-bolts mechanisms needed to cut carbon emissions and reduce planetary average temperatures. Photo courtesy of NASACreating an operations manual for curbing climate change Marrakesh negotiators must get nuts-and-bolts meticulous about exactly how the world's nations will reduce carbon emissions; how we will adapt to more extreme weather events; where we will reduce deforestation and promote reforestation; how we will inspire innovative clean-energy solutions; and, maybe most importantly, how we will raise the trillions necessary to make the singularly vital planet-saving goal of Paris happen  keeping global temperatures from rising another 0.5 degree C by 2100. 'We need an operational manual for the Paris Agreement,' Nick Nuttal, spokesman for the UN Climate Conference says from Bonn, Germany. 'This is where Marrakesh needs to make a lot of progress. How will developed and developing countries report what they are doing? Transparency is key. We need to trust that your NDCs [nationally determined contributions] are being achieved.' If these initial voluntary carbon emission cuts  pledged in Paris  are not achieved, and then quickly toughened, particularly by developed nations, then the world faces the growing wrath of a destabilized climate system. Faster sea-level rise. More drought. More ferocious hurricanes and typhoons. And more climate-change refugees[2] fleeing uninhabitable tropical regions, coasts and low-lying island nations. Climate scientists agree that this is the price of waiting two decades to marshal the political will to approve the Paris Agreement, which commits 195 nations to a vastly reduced carbon future. As a range of officials make clear, the pathway to that future remains undefined and unbuilt, thus raising the stakes in Marrakesh.Logging in Malaysia. REDD+ is a mechanism for curbing the wholesale destruction of tropical forests, vital to carbon storage. Photo by Stephen Codrington licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic licenseThe role of forests Nancy Harris is the research manager for the World Resources Institute's Global Forest Watch. In Paris, forests and their preservation through carbon offset programs like REDD+[3] (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) were recognized as crucial in absorbing and storing CO2 emissions in order to buy time while the world moves rapidly from burning fossil fuels to alternative energy sources. 'It's really nice to be working in global forests right now,' WRI's Harris says from Washington, D.C. 'The recognition of forests as a climate-change mitigation strategy  reducing emissions and increasing carbon sinks  is more visible. But right now it's all talk, and progress is being made too slowly.' Indonesia, for example, whose vast rainforests have been decimated for oil palm plantations over the past two decades, is waking up to the realization that its remaining forests can be worth a lot if left standing through forest-protection incentives like REDD+. 'Indonesia is in line to get a lot of money,' says WRI colleague Fred Stolle, 'but it has to get its act together. A billion dollars is sitting there for them. But the country doesn't have the political will [at present] to tackle deforestation. The hope is that the next generation in Indonesia will have the willpower to do something.' At the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, CEO Phil Duffy leads a group of scientists committed to forest preservation. They've developed advanced techniques for measuring the amount of carbon stored in a particular forest to establish its value to qualify for REDD+ funding. The system works like this: a developed country such as Norway pays a developing country like Brazil or Peru to protect a swath of rainforest otherwise slated for clear-cutting for ranching, soy plantations or maybe mining. Early demonstrations with REDD+ have shown promise in Brazil  but scientific techniques for the precise measuring of forest carbon stores, like those being developed at Woods Hole, are vital to REDD+ success.The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Human carbon emissions have triggered higher temperatures in the Arctic, resulting in a thawing of tundra and the release of methane, a greenhouse gas more than 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide. If permafrost melt accelerates, methane releases could lead to uncontrollable global warming, but scientists are uncertain as to how quickly this might happen. Photo courtesy of the USFWSThe threat of thawing permafrost Duffy says his organization will be pressing two pragmatic goals in Marrakesh: identifying denuded or degraded tropical lands for reforestation, and promoting agricultural techniques such as no-till farming to retain and increase the carbon content of croplands. He admits that this push by Woods Hole for more natural carbon sinks is extremely ambitious, especially in light of previous failed efforts. The recent Bonn Initiative and the New York Declaration on Forests pledged to regrow hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests globally, Duffy recalls: 'Big deal. Everyone signed, high-fived and went home. Little has happened. Meanwhile, we are on target, yet again, for the hottest year on record[4].' What worries a scientist like Duffy more than anything is thawing permafrost in the Arctic[5]. Human carbon emissions have now warmed the earth to the point that we have begun triggering the melting of permafrost  which contains vast sums of methane, a greenhouse gas more than 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide. If this thawing is not reversed, those soils will release tons upon tons of once-locked carbon into the atmosphere, acting as if scores of coal-fired power plants were operating in the Arctic. 'The climate experts on the National Security Council wanted a briefing on the Arctic,' Duffy says. 'I told them about the permafrost. I walked away feeling very discouraged. Not because they didn't believe me. They did. It's just that the policy responses were nowhere near adequate to the scale of the problem. We really need to build more public interest on this issue in terms of what needs to be done.'Syrian refugees arriving in Budapest, Hungary. Recent studies have shown that climate change, in the form of extreme drought leading to crop failures, helped precipitate the Syrian civil war. Climate refugee numbers worldwide are expected to swell quickly in the years ahead. Photo by Mstyslav Chernov licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International licenseMoney, influence and accountability Beyond the COP buzz words of 'mitigation' and £daptation' lies a relatively new one: 'loss and damage', a reference to on-going and future climate change harm in countries with virtually no carbon footprint  damage that cannot be dodged or adapted to. Think Typhoon Haiyan[6] in the Philippines (one of the most intense on record), Hurricane Matthew[7] in Haiti, and the ongoing drought in Malawi[8]. 'The area of 'loss and damage[9]' was a huge breakthrough in Paris,' Julie-Anne Richards with Climate Change Advocacy tells me from London. 'Many [developed countries] wanted to push it into [the] adaptation [category] so they didn't need to pay for it. That failed. It's part of the [final Paris] Agreement, but only on paper. Now we have to make the breakthrough real.' Richards says there needs to be a new and separate fund, stuffed with billions of dollars, to assist countries suffering climate change related loss and damage. The Green Climate Fund, for example, which aims to raise $100 billion by 2020, is reserved only for mitigation and adaptation efforts. 'We are looking at insurance opportunities,' Richards says. 'When a hurricane hits the Caribbean and winds go over a certain speed, a country will automatically be able to make an insurance claim. Haiti will get a pay-out from the (5-year-old) Caribbean Risk Insurance Facility because of Hurricane Matthew. But this whole area is brand new, and insurance companies are already saying things like sea-level rise are uninsurable.' At Marrakesh, Richards insists, funding for loss and damage must be a high priority. One way to help assure that governmental promises get converted into real action, is for NGOs to closely monitor the negotiating process. With the urgency for progress so high, and with little time to waste, such monitoring at COP22 could be intense. Corporate Accountability International is an NGO with newly official observer status, and will be on the scene in Marrakesh as a watchdog. It will be ready to pounce on entities it believes have undermined progress in UN climate summits for more than 20 years  the fossil fuel industry and business lobbyists with close ties to transnational corporations. 'Groups like the Business Roundtable and World Coal Association, the very industries the UN has tried to rein in, are now seeking to undermine the Paris Agreement,' Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, an attorney with Corporate Accountability International[10], tells me from Boston. 'They will have direct access to negotiators in Marrakesh. As accredited business-interest NGOs, they will have legitimacy and access. 'This is a direct threat to the very spirit and mission of the Paris Agreement. Their only role should be to provide transparent information so that they can be properly regulated,' he says. Some fear that the fossil fuel lobby will act aggressively to weaken the negotiated results at COP22 , especially because the summit will lack the media spotlight that shone so brightly on Paris. Lawrence-Samuel's group will be doing its own lobbying in Marrakesh. Corporate Accountability will push for a conflict of interest policy that she hopes will blunt the influence of any groups that have a financial stake in the Paris Agreement being weakened, not strengthened. No such guiding mechanism now exists within the Paris Agreement.Hope for the future, maybe. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, with his two-year-old granddaughter Isabelle Dobbs-Higginson on his lap, signs the COP21 Paris Climate Change Agreement at UN headquarters in New York on Earth Day, April 22, 2016. UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon looks on. Photo courtesy of US State DepartmentNick Nuttall, the UN spokesman in Bonn, is neutral on the lobbying question, and hopeful: 'The secretary of OPEC came to us a few weeks ago for an honest discussion about the future,' he tells me. 'OPEC consists of parties of the UN [Climate Conference] whose countries have ratified the Paris Agreement. Oil producing countries are looking at a future that is low carbon. There will be a transition.' Certainly forward-thinking OPEC nations  especially those in North Africa and the Middle East  have much to gain from an effective Paris Agreement; if the rising heat brought by climate change isn't abated, then their home regions could become inhabitable by mid-century, according to a 2016 study[11]. 'The oil industry has a lot of engineering know-how that could be really useful in a carbon-reduced economy, like wave power and other wonderful inventions for the clean-energy sector,' Nuttal concludes. 'To leave them out of the discussion is not very positive. We need all sectors of the economy on board in developing a low-carbon pathway to the future.'Justin Catanoso, a professor of journalism at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, will be covering COP22 , his third UN climate summit.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA123","FCM Comments on COP22 Climate Change Meeting","November 21, 2016 Monday 12:55 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Federation of Canadian Municipalities issued the following statement by Mayor of Edmonton Don Iveson, chair of the Big City Mayors' Caucus, on the conclusion of the 22nd Conference of the Parties on climate change held Nov. 7-18 in Marrakesh, Morocco: ""It was an eye-opening honour to represent Canada's municipal sector last week at the COP22 climate summit. Day after day in Marrakech, I was struck by two things. First, the world increasingly gets it: cities need to be at the heart of this fight for our planet. Second, we're on the cusp of tremendous economic opportunities here as well. ""As the COP process has evolved, so too has the municipal presence. We have grown from observer status, to staging side events, to taking our full place on official national delegations. In Marrakech, cities were the focus of some of the highest-profile discussions. On Tuesday, I spoke at an event highlighting the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, a new initiative convening 7,100 cities to coordinate local climate action. ""Here in Canada, municipalities influence half of our country's GHG emissions. And we were able to tell the world how we are responding with some of Canada's most innovative low-carbon practices. Since 1994, the 300 member municipalities of FCM's Partners for Climate Protection program have cut 1.8 million tonnes from Canada's carbon footprint - through building retrofits, district heating, low-GHG waste systems and more. FCM's Green Municipal Fund is seeding deep local innovation that has already cut nearly half a million tonnes of GHGs. ""Some of the richest potential to reduce Canada's GHG emissions lies in scaling up this local innovation. This is why the new federal commitment to invest in green infrastructure can be the heart of Canada's climate strategy - if it puts local solutions first. And I do want to commend federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna for her leadership here. As a down payment on the progress we need, her government recently funded FCM's Municipalities for Climate Innovation Program. This will give local governments new tools to make smart infrastructure decisions that support GHG reductions and climate resiliency. ""In Marrakech, Minister McKenna championed the message that confronting climate change presents great economic opportunities as well. FCM strongly agrees. We believe Canada has the talent and culture of innovation to help lead a global shift toward clean technology and deep conservation. And by scaling up local solutions, we will be generating sustainable growth, new sectors of green jobs, cleaner water for our children, and yes, faster commute times as well. Canada's cities and communities are ready. FCM will continue working with all our partners -- federal, provincial, Indigenous, international -- to meet Canada's climate challenge, while improving our quality of life from coast to coast to coast.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA124","WATER AT THE HEART OF COP22 AND ACTIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE","November 24, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group: An historic first for the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Agreement on Climate Change (COP), a Water Action Day was the highlight of the third day of COP22 in Marrakech, with November 9, 2016 dedicated to water. Several events were held throughout this Water Action Day, including a high level panel organized by the host country of this global summit on climate change in the United Nations blue zone. The African Development Bank (AfDB) was represented by its Director for Water Supply and Sanitation, Mohamed El Azizi in the discussions panel. The Moroccan Junior Minister for Water, Charafat Afilal; Water Ministers Barmou Salifou, Niouga Ambroise Ouedraogo and Sidick Abdelkerim Haggar from Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, respectively, as well as the Director of the Moroccan Office of Electricity and Potable Water (ONEE), Ali Fassi El Fihri, took part in this roundtable's lively discussions. Water mentioned in 85% of INDCs Water is at the heart of many challenges posed by climate change, and calls for as many solutions. Even a slight increase in the earth's temperature will have serious consequences: climate variability is increasing and its impacts are more numerous, more serious and longer lasting, particularly extreme climate events (floods and droughts, for example). Such phenomena lead to increased water pollution, higher incidence of malnutrition, more migration and more significant losses, particularly in infrastructure and agricultural production. More than 85% of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) presented by countries participating in the Paris Agreement cite water as a key adaptation issue, the UNFCCC noted during COP22 . ""Water insecurity leads to heightened conflicts, tension among populations, and causes migrations that threaten global stability,"" stated Minister Charafat Afilal. ""Africa is the continent that is most vulnerable to climate change,"" said Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the AfDB's Water Supply and Sanitation Department. He added, ""It's about providing justice, in the context of climate financing, to this continent, which has suffered the consequences of climate change without having been responsible for it. African countries are concerned with the complex and difficult access to climate financing, particularly for fragile countries."" Large water adaptation projects financed by AfDB in Morocco The Bank has financed large projects for climate change adaptation in Morocco. Among these are the water transfer project between the Rabat and Casablanca watersheds that impacts the daily lives of 5 million people, the Marrakech region water supply project, benefitting 2 million people, and the Tetouan region potable water supply security project via the transfer of water from the Tangier Med port facilities to the Moulay El Hassan Bel Mehdi dam. ""I would like to congratulate the Bank for its ability to react, responding quickly to our financing needs for this project,"" stated ONEE Director Ali Fassi Fihri. ""[It] has ensured service continuity for potable water in the area, because without supplementary service prior to the end of 2016, the entire Tetouan area would be confronted with a catastrophic water shortage."" On the Water Action Day, Morocco used the opportunity to officially launch a new initiative, ""Water for Africa "". This initiative began prior to COP22 , in July 2016 in Rabat, during the International Conference on Water and Climate, organized by the country in partnership with the World Water Council. The goal is to mobilise the international community to develop an emergency action plan on water to confront climate change in Africa and thereby mobilise the necessary financial resources. The Blue Book on Water and Climate was also released today, the result of reports and recommendations formulated during the conference held in Rabat last July. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA125","Agriculture and food security at heart of climate change action","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","US Official News","Rome: Food and Agricalture Organization has issued the following news release: The world must rapidly move to scale up actions and ambitions on climate change FAO Director-General Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva told delegates at the United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP22 ) in Morocco today. Speaking at the high-level action day on agriculture and food security, Graziano da Silva noted that climate change impacts on agriculture - including crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, land and water - are already undermining global efforts to assure food security and nutrition. And the rural poor are the most affected. With over 90 percent of countries referring to the important role of agriculture in their national plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change, Graziano da Silva stressed that ""it is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution."" Last year's conference in Paris led to the world's first legally binding global climate deal. The current summit in Marrakech, Morocco is geared to implementation of the pledges all signatory countries made. Echoing the prevalent spirit at the COP, the Paris Agreement is irreversible and inaction would be a disaster for the world. Transforming agriculture - maximizing benefits Although agriculture contributes to nearly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fundamental part of the solution to boost resilience and combat climate change impacts - especially in developing countries where agriculture is often the backbone of the economy. Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people. Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services; and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. ""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" FAO's Director-General said. ""Countries are recognizing this potential with unprecedented commitments."" Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added. A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, today's special event co-organized by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Hait\'e9 (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals. In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, today FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative."" At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particure, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he said. Cost of inaction far outweighs action The world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change. ""For millions of people, our actions can make a difference between poverty and prosperity, and between hunger and food security,"" FAO's Director-General said.

A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, today's special event co-organized by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Haite (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals. In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, today FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative."" At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particure, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he said. Cost of inaction far outweighs action The world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA127","CLIMATE CHANGE - ETUC'S POSITION WITH A VIEW TO COP 22","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC): Climate change: ETUC's position with a view to COP 22 Position adopted at the Executive Committee on the 26-27 October 2016 Nearly a year after COP 21 and the adoption of the Paris Agreement, news concerning the climate is particularly alarming. Temperature readings are breaking record after record, confirming that the world is day by day drawing dangerously closer to the threshold beyond which climate disruptions will no longer be manageable. Extreme meteorological phenomena fires, droughts, torrential rains, extended heat waves are following each other at an alarming rate as well, exposing millions of men and women to material and psychological disarray. In the face of such a situation, a wait and see attitude simply will not do. It is now more urgent than ever to amplify and step up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to generalise the implementation of policies commensurate with the transformations in progress and to come. Also, in the days before the COP 22 held in Marrakech, the ETUC has identified five priority demands, which largely mirror those of the international trade union movement as formulated by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). The Paris Agreement must be implemented now! ETUC demands that no effort be spared to have the Paris Agreement implemented rapidly, as it lays the foundations for action against climate change that will be global for the first time. The ETUC welcomes the ratification of the agreement by the EU and call Member states to confirm their commitment through a rapid ratification of the text. The ETUC hopes that the early entry into force of the agreement will open the way to the application of its main provisions without delay. It is vital in fact to analyse national contributions and improve them where warranted as promptly as possible. Investment mainly public investment, just transition and the creation of quality jobs should be at the heart of national contributions, which must be developed with the participation of social partners. No devil in the details! To accelerate the implementation of the agreement, ETUC also calls on the successful completion at the COP22 in Marrakech of negotiations on elements of the Agreement on which a decision is still pending, and the ""Transparency Framework,"" the ""Global Stocktake,"" ""Guidelines for the elaboration of national contributions"", the differentiation procedures, and the ""mechanism to facilitate implementation of and promote compliance with the provisions of the agreement."" The implementation procedures must guarantee the transparency and integrity of the system put in place. The decisions taken in Marrakech and subsequently must not weaken commitments or create loopholes. These decisions must also maintain the requirements of just transition and decent work at the heart of measures against climate change, through the guidelines for the development of national contributions. Finally, the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015 as part of Agenda 2030 must ensure the coherence of international climate action with other policy areas. Individual commitments in line with collective ambition for the planet and for jobs! ETUC reiterates its deep concern about the gap between the collective ambition to limit warming beyond 2C compared to pre-industrial values (and to continue the efforts to limit it to 1.5C), and the modest national contributions which will not attain this objective as such. ETUC moreover calls on the European Commission and the Member States to review the EU objectives for 2030 upwards and to intensify their efforts, particularly in sectors where the environmental ambition is synonymous with investments and thus job creation, such as the renovation of buildings, public transport, circular economy or renewable energies. In this regard, ETUC is urging the Commission to specify how it plans to implement the provision of the Paris Agreement aimed at making financial flows compatible with development with low greenhouse gas emissions and resilient to climate change. In ETUC's view, this commitment entails that resources allocated from the EU budget must support exclusively projects that are compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. ETUC moreover underscores that the reform of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) currently under discussion must direct investments in the sectors concerned towards low carbon technologies, without however penalising European industries that are in active in highly competitive world markets and whose emissions correspond to the benchmark of the best performing installations. In the absence of an ambitious reform, the added value of the EU ETS will become highly uncertain and alternative policy instruments might have to be considered. Just transition: Concrete action needed! By integrating the imperatives of just transition and decent work in the preamble of the Paris Agreement, Parties endorsed a major political commitment. Politically, it obliges governments to implement a just transition for workers and to promote decent work in their policies to combat climate change. The COP 22 The adoption in 2015 of the ""Principles for a just transition to environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all"" by the International Labour Organization provides an internationally recognized reference for governments and social partners willing to make just transition a reality in their country. The ETUC urges the Commission and the EU Member States to learn from this document so that adequate social measures can accompany the policies against climate change. The ETUC demands that the ILO's future work further strengthens the commitment of governments and social partners to put into practice just transition. ETUC points out that a just transition presupposes active support for workers in sectors that will suffer from the transition to a low carbon economy. ETUC reiterates its call to set up a fund for the just transition fed in the first place by revenues from auctioning a part of the EU ETS emission quotas. ETUC underscores that the participation of the social partners in developing and implementing low carbon strategies is a necessary precondition to their success. ETUC stresses the role of public services in the proper implementation of a just transition for workers. Finally, ETUC considers that the just transition requires another Europe, for the planet and for people, one that offers prosperity for all. Financing and climate refugees The ETUC calls on the EU to contribute to the mobilisation of at least 100 billion US dollars annually by 2020 to support the fight against climate change in developing countries pursuant to the commitments made by developed countries in 2010. The EU must also develop a plan to sustain and amplify its financial support to these countries beyond 2020 in accordance with Decision accompanying the Paris Agreement. Climate change will increase migration during this century. The EU should contribute to building a comprehensive policy response to this question, including working with the recognition of the status of ""climate refugees"" by the United Nations. \"

This year's climate negotiations followed a year of historic progress: more than 175 nations signing the Paris Agreement on Earth Day 2016, the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, the Paris Agreement's entry into force on November 4 -- which was years ahead of schedule -- the U.S. electric sector already meeting the Clean Power Plan's 2024 goal for reducing carbon emissions and 2030 target for reducing coal use, and 47 countries from the Climate Vulnerable Forum announcing their commitment to 100 percent clean energy between 2030 and 2050. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: ""The world came together in Paris to take unprecedented action to tackle the climate crisis, and in Marrakech, we came together to affirm that no individual country or leader has the power to derail that momentum. The Sierra Club is heartened by the committed resolve and continued dedication leaders around the world have shown to meaningful and lasting climate action. Climate leaders, activists, businesses, labor leaders, faith groups, environmental justice advocates, and youth leaders from across the globe convened in Marrakech with the goal of working to avert the worst effects of the climate crisis. In fact, nations are reaffirming their commitments, nearly 50 nations committed to going to 100 percent clean energy, and new research shows the U.S. is already on the path to meet key carbon reduction goals before they are even implemented. It is clear that this progress will not be stopped, even in the face of threats by President-elect Trump. ""If history has taught us anything, it is that it is the people who have the power to make change possible. We know that it was the power of grassroots activists and everyday citizens that brought us the historic Paris Agreement last December and it is that same power that will move the world forward toward a just and equitable clean energy economy. ""The Sierra Club and our 2.4 million members and supporters are proud to be a part of that movement, and we're as committed as ever to continuing to work with our friends and allies to ensure a safe and stable climate for our communities, our families, and our planet."" ### About the Sierra Club The Sierra Club is America's largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 2.4 million members and supporters.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA132","IMPERIAL URGES CLIMATE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER HOW TO FUND LOW-EMISSION TECHNOLOGY","November 7, 2016 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Imperial College London: Representatives from Imperial are travelling to Morocco to attend the United Nations climate change conference ( COP22 ), which starts today. For two weeks in the country's capital, Marrakech, staff, students and climate communicators will engage with international policymakers, learn about the negotiation process and talk about how research, innovation and finance can provide solutions to the climate change problem. The Grantham Institute, together with Imperial College Business School, are also organising anofficial side-eventat the conference, to encourage discussion about how investment banks that target companies developing low-emission technologies, and other funding schemes will be needed to tackle climate change. THE STORY SO FAR The Paris Agreement was drawn up at the COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, where 197 nations agreed to limit global warming to 'well below two degrees' above pre-industrial temperatures, and to aim for a more ambitious limit of one and a half degrees. Throughout the year, governments have confirmed their commitment to the treaty, and reducing their emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane from sources such as industrial processes, fossil fuel power plants, combustion engines and agriculture. By 5 October more than 55 countries, representing more than 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and including the largest emitters (the European Union, China, India and the United States), had accepted the Agreement's terms enough for the UN to confirm it would come into effect this month. Grantham Institute Co-Director, Professor Joanna Haigh, said: ""It was remarkable that 195 countries unanimously reached an agreement in Paris. Even more amazing was that the primary stated objective, of keeping the average global warming below one and a half degrees, was not even on the table before that meeting. A further achievement is that the treaty has legally entered into force within less than 12 months. All that is hugely important."" The previous climate change agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, took five years to come into effect. ""Now, of course, the harder work begins in finding routes to achieve the stated objectives,"" said Professor Haigh. DEVIL IN THE DETAILS As next steps, delegates at the COP22 conference will flesh out details of the concepts and principles agreed in Paris. Amongst these are provisions for adapting to climate change, financial contributions from industrialised nations to those at risk from the effects, rules about tracking progress of mitigation, and the potential to use trading or market mechanisms to deliver its goals. The devil is usually in the detail of such an agreement so getting these right in Marrakech really matters Ms Alyssa Gilbert Head of Policy and Translation, Grantham Institute ""The devil is usually in the detail of such an agreement so getting these right in Marrakech really matters,"" said Alyssa Gilbert, Grantham Institute Head of Policy and Translation. Grantham Institute Senior Policy Research Fellow, Ajay Gambhir, said: ""On the positive side, countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, with a transparency and accountability framework that is likely to encourage countries to step up their action. ""Low-emission technologies are also becoming increasingly cost-effective, making it more viable to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases nations produce. As countries discover what works, their experience should create further momentum towards an emission-free global energy system."" INTERNATIONAL ACCORD ""Right now there are no legally binding targets on individual countries and regions, and the current voluntary pledges are inadequate in putting us on a path towards the Agreements goal of keeping global warming 'well below two degrees',"" explains Gambhir. International efforts will be needed to increase governments' ambitions for the Nationally Determined Contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and to reach some agreement on methods for their monitoring and verification. Gilbert is particularly interested in the plans to keep track of progress starting with a so-called 'global stocktake' in 2023. ""There is an ongoing debate on the appropriate levels of transparency and reporting on countries' progress. The delegates in Marrakech will be thrashing out some of the details of what these protocols will look like,"" she said. BREAKTHROUGH COALITION National delegates to the climate summit will add details to the Agreement and demonstrate their home countries are willing to progress from setting an ambitious goal to actually working towards achieving it. Professor Haigh said: ""The immediate next steps should be for governments to implement the easy-to-achieve energy saving measures such as improving efficiency and reducing waste. They must act fast on reducing urban pollution, facilitating low-emission transport and reducing meat consumption; all of which would deliver benefits, and future cost-savings, for public health and sustainable development"". Gambhir added: ""The flow of finance from industrialised countries to help poorer countries tackle climate change remains a sticking point. At this stage, very little money has been committed compared to whats been estimated to be needed and the Agreement makes no legal requirement for specific funds to flow. ""However, developing countries are unlikely to withdraw from the process, given that climate change is an existential issue for many of them, threatening rising sea levels and a range of other harmful impacts."" Speaking to national journalists at aScience Media Centre press conferencelast Tuesday, Professor Haigh said: ""Research and development funds for innovation in clean technology were promised in Paris by governments and the private sector, and these should be mobilised without delay."" Research and development funds for innovation in clean technology were promised in Paris by governments and the private sector, and these should be mobilised without delay Professor Joanna Haigh CBE She added today: ""The business and finance communities need to be fully involved as partners in achieving the necessary progress, and efforts should be made to expand the emissions trading markets already operating very successfully in a few parts of the world."" At the COP22 The event, ""Investing in the planet: Green banks and other financial tools to scale up mitigation technologies"" will take place at the COP22 Conference centre on 14 November 2016, and is open to all official conference delegates. It will also belive streamed. \"

She said that the New Urban Agenda adopted at Habitat III, the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, in Quito, in October 2016, very clearly encapsulates that. Habitat III was just one month ago and clearly the transformation that is needed in the urban sector, that is needed in our cities, can be driven by transport, Ms. Caballero added. It is about ensuring that there is infrastructure for cycling and much better public sector transportation. Transport counts for 24 percent of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Without disruptive action, transport emissions can be expected to grow from 7.7 Gt to around 15 Gt by 2050. For 45 percent of countries, transport is the largest source of energy related emissions. The transport sector is very uniquely positioned to deliver both on decarbonisation as well as on human well-being At Marrakech Climate Conference, transport experts and leaders took stock of progress made on transport initiatives since the previous UN Climate Conference in Paris (COP 21) last year. Over the last 12 months, the MobiliseYourCity initiative secured 35 million euros in funding and announced the start of developing Sustainable Urban Mobility plans in Morocco and Cameroon. The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) is supporting an additional 40 countries to realize the financial, and CO2 benefits of improved vehicle fuel economy. And Airport Carbon Accreditation Scheme now has 173 certified airports worldwide, including 26 carbon neutral airports. The Partnership for Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) launched a global roadmap for decarbonisation of the transport sector at COP 22 . SLoCaT is a partnership between international organizations, business sector and NGOs, seeking to promote sustainable transport and focusing on land transport in developing countries. We are fully on board as the transport sector. We think we are increasingly well organized, we think we have increasing political support and that we have the right ideas, said the Secretary General of SLoCaT, Cornie Huizenga, at the press conference. The Morrocan Minister in charge of Environment and 'Climate Champion', Hakima El Haite, expressed her optimism for the future. Transport can be revolutionary tomorrow. We will have solar roads and maybe we will have solar vehicles, she said at the press conference. The transport initiatives, by creating a new reality on the ground, increase popular understanding and support for climate action which, in turn, drives up Governments ambition to tackle climate change, she added. \"

Finland and the Netherlands were welcomed as the most recent members to join this global effort to double clean energy RandD. In addition, a number of innovation challenges were launched to target development of energy technologies that will accelerate the clean energy transition. Finland and the Netherlands joined Mission Innovation, increasing the total member country count to 23, including the European Union. The member governments represent more than 80 percent of global clean energy investment, and have pledged to double their clean energy research and development funding over five years to around $30 billion (USD) per year in 2021. This commitment to clean energy RandD will help drive steep cost reductions in clean energy, expand job creation for member countries, and deliver breakthrough technologies that will allow for increased global ambition to reduce carbon emissions that keep temperature rise below the dangerous level of 2 degrees Celsius. ""Mission Innovation participants are signaling their understanding that our global energy economy is going to be a low-carbon energy economy,"" said U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. ""Commitment to Mission Innovation means that these countries want to create jobs for their people, and also build more low-cost, broadly deployable clean energy options.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA136","MARRAKECH: Efforts to revolutionize transport gaining momentum, UN climate conference told","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","New York: United Nations has issued the following news release Efforts to revolutionize transport around the world are gaining momentum with more Governments and businesses exploring possibilities for electric vehicles and low-carbon emissions transport systems, said transport experts attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP 22 ).  The transport sector is very uniquely positioned to deliver both on decarbonisation as well as on human well-being. ( ) Countries are stepping out to it , underscored Paula Caballero, Global Director, Climate Program of the World Resources Institute, at a press conference on Saturday. She said that the New Urban Agenda adopted at Habitat III, the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, in Quito, in October 2016,  very clearly encapsulates that .  Habitat III was just one month ago and clearly the transformation that is needed in the urban sector, that is needed in our cities, can be driven by transport , Ms. Caballero added.  It is about ensuring that there is infrastructure for cycling and much better public sector transportation . Transport counts for 24 percent of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Without disruptive action, transport emissions can be expected to grow from 7.7 gigatonnes to around 15 gigatonnes by 2050. For 45 percent of countries, transport is the largest source of energy related emissions. At Marrakech Climate Conference, transport experts and leaders took stock of progress made on transport initiatives since the previous UN Climate Conference in Paris (COP 21) last year. Over the last 12 months, the MobiliseYourCity initiative secured 35 million euros in funding and announced the start of developing Sustainable Urban Mobility plans in Morocco and Cameroon. The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) is supporting an additional 40 countries to realize the financial, and CO2 benefits of improved vehicle fuel economy. And Airport Carbon Accreditation Scheme now has 173 certified airports worldwide, including 26 carbon neutral airports. The Partnership for Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) launched a global roadmap for decarbonisation of the transport sector at COP 22 . SLoCaT is a partnership between international organizations, business sector and NGOs, seeking to promote sustainable transport and focusing on land transport in developing countries.  We are fully on board as the transport sector. We think we are increasingly well organized, we think we have increasing political support and that we have the right ideas , said the Secretary General of SLoCaT, Cornie Huizenga, at the press conference. The Morrocan Minister in charge of Environment and 'Climate Champion', Hakima El Hait\'e9, expressed her optimism for the future.  Transport can be revolutionary tomorrow. We will have solar roads and maybe we will have solar vehicles , she said at the press conference.  The transport initiatives, by creating a new reality on the ground, increase popular understanding and support for climate action which, in turn, drives up Governments ambition to tackle climate change , she added.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA138","WWF Issues Statement on Secretary Kerry's Remarks at COP22","November 16, 2016 Wednesday 12:05 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","World Wildlife Fund issued the following statement by Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, senior director of international climate cooperation and head of the delegation at COP22 , on the release of the U.S.'s mid-century plan and Secretary of State Kerry's remarks: ""In a time of uncertainty, actionable plans to avoid runaway climate change matter more than ever - and that's what we got today. With its midcentury plan, the US is putting substance behind the promises of the Paris Agreement, and this comes at a crucial juncture in the UN climate talks. ""Importantly, the plan outlines several ways for US carbon-cutting efforts to come within reach of the goals set by the Paris Agreement. This takes our long-term pledges and translates them into a roadmap for action. We will now need to chart the quickest possible path using the suite of options it provides - one that allows us to accelerate action over time with environmental integrity."" ""As Secretary Kerry reminded us today, science is telling us we are running out of time to address climate change. We need urgent and bold action to exponentially cut emissions and protect vulnerable communities to ensure the long-term prosperity and safety of all of the world's citizens - including Americans. ""Secretary Kerry's speech rightly reaffirmed that we are on the road to a clean energy economy - despite the uncertainties of a new U.S. administration. He injected some much-needed optimism into the talks, reminding us that the US is still in this fight because there is too much momentum from the marketplace and support from the American public to avoid the worst effects of climate change. ""This roadmap is a powerful tool to help us visualize not just what a clean energy-powered future could look like by mid-century, but also the best and quickest routes to get there. As the basis for long-term planning, this strategy can unleash the innovation and investments not just of national governments, but also of the private sector, state and local governments and local communities. Such innovation will be critical if we are to go beyond what the plan describes as quickly as possible and achieve what the science requires. While this roadmap shows us how to get most of the way there, the last leg of the journey to a zero carbon economy will only become clear once we start moving with determination towards that destination. ""US policymakers will now need to take the opportunities this plan provides and turn those into concrete policies to achieve the emissions reductions it describes. ""By releasing its plan early and in such detail, the US is helping to accelerate the implementation of pledges made in Paris and hopefully encourages other countries to create their own midcentury decarbonization strategies, as required under the Agreement.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA140","Chemical Engineers Focus on Investing in Planet at COP22","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 12:17 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Institution of Chemical Engineers issued the following news: More must be done to incentivise and prioritise low-carbon technologies, concluded chemical engineers at yesterday's side event during the UNFCCC 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. The side event, Investing in the Planet: Green banks and other financial tools to scale-up mitigation technologies, was hosted by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE), Imperial College London, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The event looked examined practical solutions to implement the Paris Agreement, with the help of chemical engineers and financial institutions. Dr Rachael Hall, from IChemE's Energy Centre Board gave the first presentation, an overview of deployment technologies available to mitigate climate change. Outlining the various pathways to a zero-carbon economy, as demonstrated in IChemE's technical policy document Chemical Engineering Matters, Dr Hall said: ""Our reliance on fossil fuels will not stop overnight, but IChemE's energy vista shows how chemical engineering can support a variety of solutions. We need to make better use of waste streams, we need to integrate our processes and ensure each and every Joule of energy is efficiently used."" Her presentation discussed the benefits of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Hall acknowledged that the most efficient use of CCS is as a bridging technology during the transition from oil and gas, and highlighted the various benefits including that it still remains the lowest cost storage solution. Concluding her presentation with her own knowledge of smart networks, Hall spoke about the right investment needed to maximise the potential and accessibility of technologies. She made clear that a low-carbon world would still need to provide the resilience and capacity the world's growing population had become accustomed to. Hall said: ""We need to invest in the future, build a strong research base and collaborate with an open-minded network of experts and enthusiasts."" Mark Apsey, also a Board member of IChemE's Energy Centre, gave his presentation on the pathways for organisations to deliver energy efficiency projects. Outlining various 'road blocks' to implementing greener energy solutions, he made clear that more needed to be done to incentivise delivery. Apsey said: ""There is an inherent short-termism in organisations, and no pressure to look at energy efficiency as a priority area. We need direct intervention from government to help tackle this - either by implementing a climate change tax, or by offering rewards to those who comply. There also needs to be a way to enforce efficiency technologies - taking inspiration from UK Health and Safety legislation, companies must be pressured to report their annual emissions."" Apsey concluded that there were three areas that needed to be tackled if the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement were to be reached - energy security, energy affordability and low carbon energy efficiency. Providing clarity in terms of how climate change initiatives could be financed, Imperial Business School's Dr Charles Donovan gave his take on innovative finance - and encouraged a different approach by government to reconnect mainstream investors with green technologies. He said: ""Innovative finance through green banks can reduce interest rate risks and generate scale. If the capital costs are covered by governments, the opportunity for growth by investors is increased. More public funds are needed to reduce capital costs for private sector investors."" NRDC's Douglas Sims echoed similar sentiments, highlighting that in order to reach climate change goals the world cannot rely on public funding alone. Sims cited that China requires 80% of the finance needed to mitigate climate change from the private sector. Focusing on the Green Investment Bank model and how it has already helped to deliver low-carbon projects, Sims said: ""Green Investment Banks have the in-house financial and technical capability to understand real risks to commercialising projects. They can deploy public purpose capital efficiency to maximise capital investment, working with risk-adverse advisors, and they can use market knowledge to implement lower prices and spark demand."" The event was chaired by Dr Robert Gross, Director of Imperial's Centre for Energy Policy and Technology, and streamed live on YouTube as part of the COP22 proceedings. The full version is still available to watch online. IChemE's Energy Centre will be actively engaging in the COP22 program until the conference concludes on Friday 18 November.

Thank you for covering this very important meeting on climate change. Mesdames et Messieurs, Nous avons parcouru un long chemin au cours de la d\'e9cennie pass\'e9e. Chaque pays a conscience que le changement climatique est une r\'e9alit\'e9. Les enjeux sont plus grands que jamais. Le moment est venu d\' agir ensemble pour prot\'e9ger notre plan\'e8te avec une d\'e9termination plus grande encore. Les \'e9missions continuent de s\' accro\'eetre. Les effets du changement climatique vont en s\' intensifiant. Le temps joue contre nous. Les cinq derni\'e8res ann\'e9es \'e9coul\'e9es ont \'e9t\'e9 les plus chaudes jamais enregistr\'e9es \- et l\' ann\'e9e 2016 sera presque certainement plus chaude encore. Ladies and gentlemen, No country, however resourceful or powerful, is immune from the impacts of climate change. That is why we have seen overwhelming support for the Paris Agreement. It entered into force with breath-taking speed, Countries realize it is in their own national interest to take action now. Now 109 countries have joined, as of today. It is increasing day by day. Maybe hour by hour. I urge all the rest to ratify as soon as possible. We have much to gain by acting now. I strongly urge all countries to increase the level of ambition in their national climate plans over the next two years. I also call on other sectors of society to accelerate their climate efforts. Cities, citizens and CEOs were crucial to mobilizing political support for the Paris Agreement. They are also among the most visionary and ambitious actors building low-carbon, resilient economies that will prosper in a climate-changed world Businesses can do more to seize the many potential opportunities. There has been tremendous progress. In the growth of renewables. In green innovations. In thriving public-private partnerships working to transform key sectors of our economy from land use and agriculture to sustainable transport. And in mobilizing voices of every age, from every nation, in support of a safer, clean energy future. I call on civil society organizations to continue to keep governments accountable to their promises. Ladies and gentlemen, I have made climate action a priority since my first day in office. Addressing climate change is critical to protecting our planet, safeguarding the most vulnerable and advancing shared prosperity. It was truly a privilege to make this journey with so many partners from around the world who are committed to leaving a healthier planet to future generations. I am confident that my successor, Secretary-General Designate Antonio Guterres, and the United Nations will continue to advance this cause with energy and resolve for the sake of our planet and all people. I am also very glad to be here with Executive Secretary of UNFCCC [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change], Ms. Patricia Espinosa who has just taken up her new job of this very important organization. Former Foreign Minister of Mexico, I count on your leadership. And I hope you will give her good support. We also have a new Executive Director of UNEP. He is also very experienced person. So we have a very good team. As you may know, this is my last COP. I have one and half months to go as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I will never cease, even after my retirement, to work with the United Nations and my colleagues, and world leaders to make sure that this climate change agreement is in full implementation and to make this world and people safer and healthier and more prosperous.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA142","How Do We Fill the Gap?","November 14, 2016 Monday 4:41 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Nov 14, 2016( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP22 [3], this is a question on the minds of many. On the heels of the\~Paris Agreement coming into force[4]\~just over a week ago, there is a palpable sense of enthusiasm in the air at COP22 . Indeed, this year for the first time ever we gather with a global agreement in place to act and adapt. Governments from across the globe created and now fully support the Agreement because they recognise that climate change is a very real threat to their present and future prosperity and well-being. But there is also a strong sense of determination in Marrakech by business and investors alike to move forward with fulfilling the commitments made. The question is not 'will we enact change,'\~but how do we move forward\~with efficiency and speed. More specifically, how do we fill the gap between what we have committed to in the Paris Agreement and what has been put forward by individual countries in the INDCs? Many actions have already been taken, and the cogs are already in motion, but how do we speed them up to accomplish the well-below 2-degree climate target, and meet the deadline of the\~Sustainable Development Goals\~[5](SDGs) by 2030? COP22 is the moment in history where we must, and we will, decide:\~What happens next?\~At the UN Global Compact, we've been defining and driving the 'what happens next' for over a decade - but we have not done so alone. By mobilizing over 460 companies from 65 countries to champion climate action through the\~Caring for Climate initiative[6]\~and by raising ambition such\~as our call on companies to set a $100 minimum internal price on carbon[7], we've gained a deep appreciation for and understanding of the critical role that businesses play in making the global climate agenda a local reality. As we think about how to close the gap, businesses have an important role to play, to help shift, shape and transform our economies to meet the well below 2 degrees Celsius trajectory. And once again, partnership is key. For instance, the UN Global Compact stands ready to work with business through our new leadership platform\~Pathways to Low-Carbon Development. The platform will define how business can invest in and support country-level climate policies to meet the priorities of the Paris Agreement. It will set a new global standard of business leadership on climate, igniting action that deeply integrates development priorities at its core. Importantly, Pathways to Low-Carbon Development will provide a safe space for companies to review, re-align and recalibrate their corporate climate goals - while providing them with opportunities to contribute to country-level climate policies. Built on a decade of successfully engaging business on the international climate agenda, and inspired by our new campaign to\~Make Global Goals Local Business[8], this new platform will chart the next decade of our climate work. The Paris Agreement tells us what must be done. But the time is now to decide\~how\~it will be done. How will we make the world safer, greener and more sustainable? And\~how\~do we fill that gap? The answer: together. Together the United Nations, Governments, the private sector and civil society will bring our global climate agreement to life. And with business assuming a leadership role, we will preserve and protect our planet for generations to come.\~Tweet me: Contact Info: Margaret Fenwick UN Global Compact +1 (646) 884-7531 HYPERLINK mailto:mfenwick@unglobalcompact.org[9] mfenwick@unglobalcompact.org[9] HYPERLINK http://www.facebook.com/unglobalcompact www.facebook.com/unglobalcompact HYPERLINK https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact;; https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact;; KEYWORDS: Environment ...imate Change, Business ...ade, climate change, cop22 , COP 22 , UN Global Compact, INDC, Paris Agreement [ 1]: \~ HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/United-Nations-Global-Compact http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/United-Nations-Global-Compact [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/about/governance/executive-director https://www.unglobalcompact.org/about/governance/executive-director [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/891-cop-22-cmp-12-high-level-meeting-on-climate-change https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/891- HYPERLINK cop-22 -cmp-12-high-level-meeting-on-climate-change [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/3801-11-04-2016 https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/3801-11-04-2016 [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/climate https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/climate [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/3381-04-22-2016 https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/3381-04-22-2016 [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs HYPERLINK mailto:mfenwick@unglobalcompact.org mfenwick@unglobalcompact.org \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA143","MARRAKECH: \\x91The eyes of the world are upon us,' chair of UN conference says as new round of climate talks opens","November 7, 2016 Monday","US Official News","New York: United Nations has issued the following news release The United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as \' COP 22 ,\' opened today in Marrakech, Morocco, just days after the entry into force of the landmark Paris Agreement which has now been ratified by 100 countries.  This conference comes within a climate of hope and of legitimate aspirations for all of humanity, said the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, Salaheddine Mezouar, who was elected today by acclamation as President of COP 22 , formally the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  The unprecedented mobilization of the international community and its political will, expressed at the highest levels, have been crowned by the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement. This is unrivaled progress [ ] and now we must build on this momentum, give tangible meaning to this major step forward through decisions geared towards implementation, he stated. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on 15 November. Before the meeting wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. In his remarks today, Mr. Mezouar urged participants  to be more ambitious, and stressed that  the eyes of the world are on us [ ]  We have a huge responsibility before humanity and we must join forces in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations. We must provide them with the resources to adapt to the disastrous consequences of climate change. Meanwhile, in her remarks, Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, told the opening of the Conference that the rapid entry into force of the Paris accord  is a clear cause for celebration, but it is also a timely reminder of the high expectations that are now placed upon us all  Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given , she continued, underscoring that:  Marrakech is our moment to take forward climate action at the international and national levels as a central pillar of the successful realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is our opportunity to take the next steps towards an inclusive, sustainable path for every man, woman and child. Ms. Espinosa underlined key areas in which work needs to be taken forward. She stressed that finance is flowing, but it is not enough. Moreover, nationally determined contributions now need to be integrated into national policies and investment plans. She said support for adaptation needs to be given higher priority, and progress on the loss and damage mechanism has to be ensured to safeguard development gains in the most vulnerable communities. The President of COP 21, which agreed the Paris accord last year, S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, French Minister of Environment, Energy and the Sea, who has passed the baton to Mr. Mezouar, welcomed the ratification of the Paris Agreement by 100 countries as of this past Sunday.  It's an historic event, she said at a press conference just before the official opening of the COP 22 , where she urged all countries that have not ratified the Paris Agreement to do so, if possible, during the Marrakech Conference  and beyond that, by the end of this year. Ms. Royal said that the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in December 1997 and aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, took seven years to enter into force.  [The clock is ticking] because the year that just ended was the warmest, because the melting of glaciers is accelerating, because desertification is devastating, because the massive urban concentrations call for a new model urban development, she continued. Ms. Royal stressed the importance of climate justice, particularly for Africa.  Africa is the great challenge of [this Conference]. COP 22 is an African COP, and that is where the priority and hope are, she said.  In Africa, climate change is cruel and unfair. The continent suffers the most through no fault of its own.

Similar pacts were also signed with other renewable companies. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA145","WWF STATEMENT ON SECRETARY KERRY'S REMARKS AT COP22","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by World Wildlife Fund (WWF): Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, World Wildlife Funds senior director of international climate cooperation and head of WWFs delegation at COP22 , issued the following statement today about the release of the US mid-century plan and Secretary of State Kerrys remarks: In a time of uncertainty, actionable plans to avoid runaway climate change matter more than ever and thats what we got today. With its midcentury plan, the US is putting substance behind the promises of the Paris Agreement, and this comes at a crucial juncture in the UN climate talks. Importantly, the plan outlines several ways for US carbon-cutting efforts to come within reach of the goals set by the Paris Agreement. This takes our long-term pledges and translates them into a roadmap for action. We will now need to chart the quickest possible path using the suite of options it provides - one that allows us to accelerate action over time with environmental integrity. As Secretary Kerry reminded us today, science is telling us we are running out of time to address climate change. We need urgent and bold action to exponentially cut emissions and protect vulnerable communities to ensure the long-term prosperity and safety of all of the worlds citizens - including Americans. Secretary Kerrys speech rightly reaffirmed that we are on the road to a clean energy economy despite the uncertainties of a new U.S. administration. He injected some much-needed optimism into the talks, reminding us that the US is still in this fight because there is too much momentum from the marketplace and support from the American public to avoid the worst effects of climate change. This roadmap is a powerful tool to help us visualize not just what a clean energy-powered future could look like by mid-century, but also the best and quickest routes to get there. As the basis for long-term planning, this strategy can unleash the innovation and investments not just of national governments, but also of the private sector, state and local governments and local communities. Such innovation will be critical if we are to go beyond what the plan describes as quickly as possible and achieve what the science requires. While this roadmap shows us how to get most of the way there, the last leg of the journey to a zero carbon economy will only become clear once we start moving with determination towards that destination. US policymakers will now need to take the opportunities this plan provides and turn those into concrete policies to achieve the emissions reductions it describes. By releasing its plan early and in such detail, the US is helping to accelerate the implementation of pledges made in Paris and hopefully encourages other countries to create their own midcentury decarbonization strategies, as required under the Agreement. \"

In the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development,"" State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), affirmed their ""commitment"" to the ""full implementation"" of the Paris Agreement. They welcomed the ""extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide."" As of Friday 18 November, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. ""This momentum is irreversible it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels,"" adds the Proclamation. ""Our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."" President of COP 22 Salaheddine Mezouar. Photo: UNFCCC Negotiations between State-Parties were continuing on Friday afternoon on aspects of the implementation of the Agreement. ""We continue to negotiate on a number of things"", said the President of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, at a press conference. Welcoming the outcome of the Conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, he noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In a statement issued by his spokesperson in New York, Mr. Ban applauded the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. ""As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" said the statement, adding that the UN chief also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. The Marrakech Proclamation calls for ""the highest political commitment to combat climate change"" and calls for ""strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,"" underscoring the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability. State-Parties also call ""for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement"" and ""for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries."" In the Marrakech Proclamation, developed country reaffirmed their $100 billion mobilization goal per year by 2020 to support climate action by developing countries. All countries also called on all non-state actors to join them ""for immediate and ambitious action and mobilization, building on their important achievements."" Alongside the negotiations, the two-week Marrakech Conference focused on various actions and initiatives taken by Governments and non-state actors to address climate change. On Thursday, the Conference launched the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action Agenda to further scale up cooperative efforts in which businesses, sub-national and local governments and civil society team up with national governments to promote low-emission and resilient development.

During the event, representatives from the three organizations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and UNFCCC negotiators discussed how countries can better use trade as a means to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among the measures agreed upon at last years meeting in Paris was the need to address the socio-economic impact of climate change, taking into account the special needs of developing countries. In response to this, the three agencies highlighted the tool box of trade measures that can enable the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. These include: reducing costs and deploying key climate technologies quickly to where they will have the biggest impact stimulating investment in energy, infrastructure, transport, information technology and other key sectors of the new climate economy fostering the competitive markets that encourage individuals, enterprises and entire industries to learn from past experience, innovate and do better. Participants agreed to continue working together to help countries explore the role of trade in delivering Nationally Determined Contributions, which countries had submitted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The participants also resolved to explore the complementary benefits of trade and climate policies, for example in lowering air pollution. Bonapas Onguglo, Head of the Trade Analysis Branch in the Division of International Trade in Goods, Services and Commodities, said: Trade can help meet the shared challenge of economic diversification. Trade provides the most direct route for transferring innovations from market to market and especially into the developing world. Trade can help generate employment, which is an important policy goal for many developing countries. Aik Hoe Lim, Director of the WTOs Trade and Environment Division, said: Trade is a powerful tool to lower the cost of key green technologies, and to help their quick and large scale deployment to where they are needed. Over 40 WTO members are currently negotiating an Environmental Goods Agreement that seeks to eliminate tariffs on a broad range of environmental goods, while creating opportunities for new jobs and economic diversification. This is just one example of how the WTO supports sustainable development in its day-to-day work. Anders Aeroe, Director of Markets and Institutions at ITC, said: Trade has an important role to play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and helping developing countries and their small, medium sized enterprises (SMEs) address the impact of climate change. Trade enables low-cost deployment of climate-friendly and sustainable technology and builds economic diversification. Through climate-proofed Aid for Trade, ITC will continue to support inclusive and environmentally sustainable trade for developing countries and their SMEs. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA150","Climate Change Policymakers Can Be Swayed","April 14, 2017 Friday","US Official News","New York: Fordham University has issued the following news release: Photo Policymakers are reluctant to change their minds when it comes to complex subjects like climate change, even when they\' re presented with data that contradicts their preconceived notions. But new research shows that in some cases, it\' s possible to sway them with just the right presentation of that data. In a recent study co-authored by David Budescu, Ph.D., Fordham\' s Anne Anastasi Professor of Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology, 217 policymakers who attended the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris were asked to predict how much global temperatures will increase by the year 2100. In a control study, a group of MBA students were recruited and asked to predict the same question. The question was put to both groups before seeing three different graphical depictions of predicted temperature increases from data gathered from 30 climate models, and again after they viewed each graph. Budescu said the idea was to see if policymakers and climate negotiators who tend to use scientific information in a very conservative way and rarely allow it to influence their beliefs might reconsider their perspective if the same information were presented to them in different formats. One graph was a boxplot that covered 90 percent of the predicted temperatures from the 5th to 95th percentile of the data; The second graph was the same boxplot but also showed the extreme data points outside the 90 percent range of predicted temperatures; The Third graph contained the same boxplot but also included all 30 data points (inside and outside of the box). The original judgments of the two groups were highly similar, but the MBA students, who had no preconceived notions about the subject, updated their beliefs about future temperature increases after seeing each of the model predictions. But policymakers were largely unconvinced. It was only the last format, with more detail, that convinced some policymakers to alter their predictions of future temperature increases, even though all three graph presentations illustrated the temperature increases.

At their meeting, State Secretary Flasbarth and Secretary Rodriquez discussed the need for decisive climate action now to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on the environment, as well as on people's health and livelihood. They also discussed how solutions to climate change, like investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate smart technology, will help grow our economies and create jobs. State Secretary Flasbarth said: ""Ambitious climate action needs the involvement of all actors - business, science and citizens - and of all levels of government."" He went on to underline that the cooperation between the national, federal and local level within countries and between countries can be of great benefit. Additionally, Secretary Rodriquez and State Secretary Flasbarth committed to continue working with other national and subnational actors on climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as environmental issues like clean air. ""Our partnership with Germany and its regions has grown into a global coalition that sets an example and encourages action by other state and national governments,"" said Secretary Rodriquez. ""We look forward to strengthening our collaboration to confront climate change and lead the transition to a clean energy economy."" They agreed to support the work of the Under2 Coalition on Subnational Global Climate Leadership, a growing pact of 165 cities, states and countries committed to limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius. With the addition of 29 new members this week, the coalition has grown to represent more than 1.08 billion people and $25.7 trillion in GDP, equivalent to more than a third of the global economy. Secretary Rodriquez and State Secretary Flasbarth highlighted the Under2 Coalition as an excellent example for close cooperation on ambitious climate action between different nations, provinces, federal states and cities from different continents. The Coalition was formed in 2015 by California and the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg to mobilize - and galvanize - bold climate action from likeminded governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050. Under Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., California has taken bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. In September, Governor Brown also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs that benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The German cabinet adopted on Monday the Climate Action Plan 2050 following a proposal by Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks. It is the first government document that maps the way toward near greenhouse gas neutrality in Germany by 2050. The plan sets out climate quantitative targets for individual economic sectors in 2030 and provides guidance for strategic decisions over the coming years.

'In a first phase,' reports[5] GIZ, £t least 600 mosques across Morocco will be equipped with LED lighting, photovoltaic systems, and solar water heaters.' Offering expert support to government partners, GIZ is assisting in all phases of design and implementation of project activities to be launched in all of Morocco's mosques.Morocco Boasts one of the World's Largest MosquesAfter 32 years in the planning, Morocco's Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca finally opened its doors to worshippers and tourists in 1993. Now an iconic national landmark, the Hassan II Mosque was built in part as a mausoleum to honor King Hassan II's father, Mohammed V, who passed away in 1961. Plans to build the mausoleum had not progressed by 1980, and so, during a celebration to honor King Hassan II's 60th birthday celebration, Hassan II directly requested a new building for Casablanca. 'I wish Casablanca to be endowed with a large, fine building of which it can be proud until the end of time,' stated[6] King Hassan II. 'I want to build this mosque on the water,' he added, referring to a verse in the Qur£n, 'because God's throne is on the water. Therefore, the faithful who go there to pray, to praise the creator on firm soil, can contemplate God's sky and ocean.' And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six days and His Throne was on the water [Qur£n 11:7] King Hassan II Mosque, Casablanca, Morocco. Credit: EnglishtoIslam.netThe Hassan II Mosque offers a beautiful realization of the king's wishes. It is one of the largest mosques in the world, with a capacity for over 100,000 worshippers. Designed by French Architect Michel Pinseau, the iconic mosque is also one of the top tourist attractions in Morocco.Promoting Morocco's EconomyWith the passing of Hassan II in 1999, the monarchy of Morocco passed to his son, King Mohammed VI. Working tirelessly to promote the economic welfare of his realm, Mohammed VI is beloved in his nation and around the world for his visionary efforts. Especially in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, Morocco is making far better progress than any other nation on the African continent. With a total of 2 gigawatts (GW) in capacity, Morocco's Noor concentrating solar plant[7] (CSP) is the largest in all of Africa and the Middle East.

As Morocco's renewable energy and environmental ministers are also noting, mosques disseminate information at the grass-roots level. Regarding the kingdom's new 'Green Mosques' plan, Morocco's partners at GIZ point out, 'The idea is to use mosques as a starting point.' GIZ adds, 'Sermons play an important part in raising awareness of the need to conserve natural resources.' In this way, the kingdom hopes to create £ market for private services in the field of energy efficiency.' After the green mosque[9] stage, the plan is to enlarge the program 'towards other public buildings in sectors such as education or health. \~ HYPERLINK http://edenkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-Isofoton_Marruecos.jpgExpanding http://edenkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-Isofoton_Marruecos.jpgExpanding Renewable Energy Training ProgramsDeveloping an energy efficiency market will also help launch the government of Morocco's plan to boost green job[10] creation. Although demand for such services are low right now, with the introduction of solar energy[11] systems in mosques, interest is expected to grow. To nurture this interest, the government is rolling out training programs at all commercial levels, from corporate decision makers to company employees. Starting with Morocco's Imams, or worship leaders, and teachers in mosques, the government is focusing on training related to the mosque upgrades, such as LED lighting, solar thermal[12] water heaters, and rooftop solar PV systems. TV and radio programs are also ready for distribution through the Ministry of Habous and Islamic Affairs. These broadcasts are aimed at promoting 'long-term consumer demand for new technologies and generating further business opportunities for energy service providers.'

Credit: GIZ Prepping for the COP22 SummitMuch of this effort on Morocco's renewable energy front stems from a national goal to meet 42 percent (or around 6 GW) of the kingdom's energy demand with renewables by 2020. Approximately 14 percent (or 2 GW) is planned to be met by solar PV and solar thermal plants. The approach of the 22nd United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) being held November 7-18 in Marrakech is spurring progress, but there is lots of room for improvement. As of yet, Morocco has not developed any remuneration policy framework encouraging investors, be they residential homeowners, business owners, or even utility-scale plant developers. However, as pv magazine[13] noted recently, 'the Moroccan government is finally moving to clear the regulatory hurdles in the way of PV development. This could include introducing provisions under which households and building owners can receive feed in payments for electricity produced by rooftop PV systems.' It took 32 years and one big birthday bash to build the celebrated Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca. Perhaps the COP22 in Marrakech is just what Morocco needs to successfully launch itself into the Renewable Energy Age. Stay tuned, we'll be covering the action!

They also welcomed the extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide, as of Friday 18 November, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement. Last December at the previous Conference, known as HYPERLINK COP 21 , 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital \~ HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52802 where it was approved It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Water scarcity already a major global issue will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth, FAO This momentum is irreversible it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels, adds the Marrakech Proclamation. Our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the HYPERLINK https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals ( \~ HYPERLINK https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs SDGs ). Negotiations between State-Parties concluded on Nov. 18 night. Governments set a rapid deadline of 2018 to complete the rulebook for operationalizing the Paris Agreement to ensure confidence, cooperation and its success over the years and decades to come. In the Marrakech Proclamation, developed country reaffirmed their 100 billion dollars mobilisation goal per year by 2020 to support climate action by developing countries. All countries also called on all non-state actors to join them for immediate and ambitious action and mobilisation, building on their important achievements. On Nov.17, the Conference launched the Marrakech Partnership for HYPERLINK http://newsroom.unfccc.int/climate-action/global-climate-action-agenda/ Global Climate Action Agenda Scale up Action, Rapidly The world must rapidly move to scale up actions and ambitions on climate change, HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/453416/icode/ said for his part Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) during the Marrakech summit. Southern Madagascar has been hit by consecutive droughts. Credit: FAO Speaking on Nov. 16 at a high-level action day on agriculture and food security, he noted that climate change impacts on agriculture including crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, land and water are already undermining global efforts to assure food security and nutrition. And the rural poor are the most affected. With over 90 per cent of countries referring to the important role of agriculture in their national plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change, Graziano da Silva stressed, it is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution. Although agriculture contributes to nearly 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fundamental part of the solution to boost resilience and combat climate change impacts especially in developing countries where agriculture is often the backbone of the economy. Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people. Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services; and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change, Graziano da Silva said. Countries are recognizing this potential with unprecedented commitments. Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added. Water Scarcity, the Big Challenge In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, FAO on Nov. 18 launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. HYPERLINK http://www.fao.org/nr/water/topics_scarcity_framework.html Water scarcity already a major global issue will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people almost two-thirds of the global population live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture, Graziano da Silva said. At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/en/initiative-favor-adaptation-african-agriculture-%E2%80%93-aaa Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture , which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particular, Graziano da Silva added, noting that currently only two per cent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. That is extremely low, and quite below our needs, he said.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA154","Morocco Hosts World's Largest Solar Plant - Analysis","December 3, 2016 Saturday","Eurasia Review","By Fab\'edola Ortiz The ambitious Moroccan plan for harnessing heat coming from the sun in the Sahara desert and turning it into electricity has drawn international attention, also during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ), held in Marrakesh, between November 7-18. Two hundred kilometres Northeast drive from the COP22 venue lies the 450 hectares Noor solar complex. When it starts fully operating in 2018, it will power over one million households and curb 760,000 tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions. The whole Moroccan capital city Rabat fits in this power station said to be the world's largest solar plant compared to the size of the European city of Barcelona. Noor is located at the desert town of Ouarzazate surrounded by the Atlas mountain range and its Berber villages. Named as the gate to the desert, Ouarzazate has also become the gate to tapping the solar energy. ""Since the world became aware in the Earth Summit Rio 92 (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) of the urgent need to address climate change, the Kingdom of Morocco has resolutely sought to ensure that its proactive policy of sustainable development and environmental protection is in line with the international community's global effort,"" said the Moroccan King Mohammed VI, at the COP21 in Paris when the world leaders agreed on a deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the planet's warming by the end of the century. Morocco receives about 3,000 hours of sunlight per year, being the Sahara desert a perfect place to harness the sun's rays. This North African country enjoys no fossil fuel reserves and it relies almost exclusively on imports to meet its domestic requirements. In line with the Twenty-Second Conference of Parties in Marrakech and as part of the responsibility of proving its green credentials with climate commitments, the Noor complex is part of Morocco's strategy to produce 42% of its power mix generated from renewable sources by 2020 \- a goal that has been applauded by the UN. Morocco publicized a series of constitutional, legislative and regulatory reforms. Energy transition has apparently become a top priority. The country announced a US$13 billion plan for expanding wind, solar and hydroelectric power generation to increase its share of renewables in less than a decade to come. Currently, the $9 billion Noor facilities generate 160 megawatts (MW). When the next two phases are completed and the solar turbines start running to its full potential, it is expected that Noor will generate more than 500MW. The next phases \- Noor 2 and Noor 3 \- are expected to begin their operations in 2017 and 2018,. To finance the mega structure, Morocco has secured loans of US$519 million from the World Bank, 654 million euros from German bank KFW and partly from the African Development Bank, the European Commission and European Investment Bank. The project is being developed by a consortium of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN) together with ACWA Power \- a developer, investor and operator owned by eight Saudi conglomerates and head-quartered in Saudi Arabia. The company is currently operating in 11 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Southern Africa and South East Asia. The MASEN sells the electricity generated in Noor to the National Office for Electricity and Water. ""Morocco is making the best out of the resource it has, it has got sun and capability to develop industrial capacity. At the end of the day, we want to deliver stable and reliable electricity with a fix price and continuous supply for the next 25 years. It is fundamental for ground development and social wellbeing,"" said Paddy Padmanathan, Chief Executive Officer of ACWA Power. The power mega complex uses a technology called Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). Its costs are higher because of the use of lenses and mirrors rather than the broadly known photovoltaic panels that have usually lower installation costs. On the other hand, the CSP technology allows to store around eight hours of energy. That means saving energy to use at nights and in cloudy days. ""We take the heat of the sun and run the steam turbine. We don't need to use the electricity immediately because we are able to store it efficiently. That is the big advantage of the CSP system, it is much more versatile,"" explained the civil engineer who has been the ACWA's CEO since 2006. Padmanathan is of the view that setting up renewable plants in remote areas where there are usually places that tend to have the poorer standards of living conditions is a way of ""revitalizing remote regions on the back of investments like this"". ""Morocco has demonstrated that you can deploy this type of project with scale. It is replicable if you use a transparent procurement process"", he told IDN. Asked if it can inspire other developing countries, Padmanathan said countries like Jordan, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia have shown interest in the Noor plant. ""We also received visits from Peru and Chile"", he recalled. Those two countries share the Atacama desert in South America with huge potential of harnessing the sunlight for power generation. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA155","Washington: Meet the fossil fuel lobbyists and climate science deniers at the Marrakech COP22 talks","November 17, 2016 Thursday","US Official News","Washington: Corporate Accountability International has issued the following news release: It\' s no secret fossil fuel companies will have to fundamentally change their business models if countries are serious about tackling climate change. With so much skin in the game, it\' s no surprise they find ways to try and influence climate policy at the highest level. The international climate talks in Marrakech this week has provided the perfect opportunity for corporate lobbyists and climate science deniers to push their high carbon agendas. Who\' s who Prior to the COP22 negotiations currently underway in Marrakech, Corporate Accountability International released a mapshowing how fossil fuel representatives can get access at the highest level. Many of the groups they identify do indeed have a presence in the inner \' blue zone\' of the talks, where negotiators meet to hammer out the details of global climate policy. Most non-state actors and companies are officially consigned to the \' green zone\' in a separate section of the venue). Here\' s a rundown of the climate science deniers and fossil fuel representatives to keep an eye out for, taken from the conference\' s official participant list: Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI): The CEI is a neoconservative think tank that  questions global warming alarmism, makes the case for access to affordable energy, and opposes energy-rationing policies . Their crew listed as  participants at COP22 includes some familiar climate science deniers, including: Myron Ebell, the man tapped to lead the EPA\' s transition for Donald Trump and head of the CEI\' s Center for Energy and Environment. He hasn\' t been spotted at the conference yet. Harlan Watson, who was head of the delegation to the UNFCCC when the US refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol, is also here as an \' adjunct scholar\' of the Centre for Energy and Environment. Marc Morano, the Communications Director at CFACT, a conservative think-tank in Washington D.C. that has received funding from ExxonMobil and Chevron, is here. So is Craig Rucker, CFACT\' s Executive Director, and Michael Goetz, past Vice President and Counsel for CFACT Europe. Rupert Darwall, an  expert at the UK\' s Centre for Policy Studies, who promotes climate science denial, is also here on a CEI badge. International Emissions Trading Association (IETA): The CEI\' s delegation pales in comparison to IETA\' s 80-strong list. IETA is a business organisation that aims  to build international policy and market frameworks for reducing greenhouse gases at lowest cost . IETA\' s members include fossil fuel companies BP, Chevron, Shell, Rio Tinto, Statoil and Total. It has a \' business hub\' tent hidden away inside the blue zone at the Marrakech conference, and has been running lots of corporate sponsored events during the conference. IETA has provided badges for plenty of fossil fuel representatives including Christine Faure Fedigan, French energy company Engie\' s head of corporate strategy; Arthur Lee, Chevron\' s principal advisor on environment and climate change; and Charlotte Wolff-Bye, Statoil\' s vice president of sustainability. World Coal Association: The World Coal Association does pretty much what you\' d expect; lobby on behalf of the world\' s dirtiest fossil fuel companies. It lists climate deniers Peabody among its many paying members. There have already been a number of actions at the conference highlighting that coal has no place in a climate constrained world. The association\' s CEO, Benjamin Sporton, policy director, Milagros Miranda Rojas, and policy advisor Liam McHugh, all have badges at COP22 . Shell and BP: There are other fossil fuel personnel here under other non-state actor badges. Marianne Funk, Shell\' s senior advisor, is here with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Tanya Morrison, Shell\' s International Government Relations Manager, is here with the International Chamber of Commerce. Andrea Abrahams, a global director for BP, is here with World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Corporate influence The Paris Agreement, signed last year to much fanfare, opened the door for the increased involvement of corporate lobbyists. Paragraph 134 of the Paris Agreement,  welcomes the efforts of all non-Party stakeholders to address and respond to climate change, including those of civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities . Paragraph 135  invites the non-Party stakeholders referred to in paragraph 134 above to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions and/or to build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change . While these clauses were partially aimed at increasing the role of NGOs and indigenous communities in the climate negotiation process, it also opened the door for more corporate lobbying. On the second Tuesday at the talks, Corporate Accountability International and representatives from Latin America and Asia delivered a petition to the US government asking it to act to end corporate conflicts of interest in the UNFCCC process. It wants policies similar to those of the Global Tobacco Treaty. Article 5.3 of that treaty bars partnerships, financial relationships, revolving door cases and industry participation in the policymaking process. When asked what could happen if the UNFCCC don\' t implement new rules about corporate influence, Maya Golder Kraser from the US-based Centre for Biological Diversity told DeSmogUK:  The science is very clear that to get to 1.5 degrees we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, which is obviously directly in conflict with the interests of the fossil fuel industry. So what's at stake is that we just don't meet our commitments at all. In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA156","COP 22: Now begins the fun","October 11, 2016 Tuesday 11:04 PM EST","The Hindu Business Line","Oct 11, 2016( The Hindu Business Line: HYPERLINK http://www.thehindubusinessline.com Prof James E Hansen of Columbia University, a former NASA scientist, has described it as 'worthless words'. Because, if a country does not do what it said it would, there is no provision to enforce due performance, except shaming it in public. But even that is not possible, because many countries have allowed themselves sufficient wriggle room in their INDC promises. India, for example, has said that its aim to have 40 per cent of installed power capacity based on non-fossil fuels would take place 'with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance.'Furthermore, even assuming all countries do everything they promised, Earth's temperature will still rise 2.7 degrees  a significant deviation from the target. The food on the table is not enough to satisfy the hunger. Baby steps Anyway, the Paris Agreement was like the birth of a baby, and now, a year down the line, the baby has to begin to walk. The first baby-steps are expected to be taken at COP-22 , which will be held in November in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. And that's where the real fight begins. The Marrakech meeting will be more important than Paris. Here is where 'modalities, procedures, guidelines' - MPG - will be evolved for countries to meet their 'nationally determined contributions' (the word 'intended' has been dropped after the agreement at Paris.) Discussions will revolve around mobilising finance, technology transfers, developing carbon markets, global stock-take (of a five-yearly review of progress) and so on, each of which is contentious. Jo Tyndall of New Zealand, who co-chairs the Ad-hoc working group on Paris Agreement (APA), cautions that 'while political heat has been turned down, the fault lines that existed before Paris have not gone away.' Since Marrakech conference is about 'getting down to business', these fault lines will be starkly visible. 'The hardest work is ahead to turn the transformational promise of the Paris Agreement into reality,' say experts at the World Resources Institute, in a recent article.Funds is the keyFor COP-22 to take matters anywhere near reality, it should discuss finance. How to make funds available for green projects in developing countries. While Article 9 of the Paris Agreement says that developed countries 'shall provide' financial resources to assist developing countries, there is no mention of how, how much and what counts as financial resources. These will be discussed at COP-22 , and one might expect considerable heat when that happens.The Paris Agreement (Article 15) speaks of a 'facilitative' compliance mechanism. ('We don't know what that means,' says Jo Tyndall.) The mechanism shall also be 'non-adversarial and non-punitive'. At the heart of 'compliance' is a system that measures, verifies and reports whether each country has been as good as its word. COP-22 will begin the process of evolution of such a mechanism - not an easy task, because countries (including India) baulk at outsiders checking out on them.The COP-22 will also discuss trade issues - such as what to do when there is a clash between climate agreements and, say, WTO. For instance, if an Indian company exports its product cheaper because it has received a subsidy for using green technology, will that subsidy be WTO-compliant?India flexing its musclesIndia, for one, has made it clear that it is not in a mood to take things lying down at Marrakech. In a statement issued on October 1, a day before it would ratify the Paris Agreement, the Indian government forthrightly expressed its disappointment over the flow of climate funds. The statement notes that the $10.3 billion committed to the Green Climate Fund cumulatively in the last six years, (in contrast with the aim of reaching annual commitments of $100 billion by 2020,) 'does not match the enormous finance and technology requirements indicated by developed countries in their INDCs.'The statement further stressed the need to remove barriers to access green technology and provision of finance to meet the costs of cutting-edge technology. The message is simple. If, for example, India wants access to a technology of a superconducting wind turbine generator, which GE has developed, to help it ramp up its renewable energy roll-out, GE should give the technology, and the developed countries should pay for it. Regardless of whether India is justified or not, only a simpleton would expect developed countries to play ball.India is bent on holding developed countries to account, at COP-22 . 'People in developed countries live extravagant lifestyles with high carbon footprint,' the statement says - something that is likely to resonate with the thinking in many other developing countries.Thus, some tough negotiations are ahead at the African city. Don't forget that any country can still walk out of the Agreement after three years. So, if 'President Donald Trump' dislikes the deal, he only needs to wait out the period. Delivering the Paris baby might have been without much labour pain. But raising it to adulthood is not likely to be easy. \"

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, has concluded Canadas participation at COP22 , in Marrakech, Morocco, demonstrating the countrys strong support for international action on clean growth and climate change. Minister McKennas focus at the international climate-change conference COP22 was the swift implementation of the Paris Agreement, the development of a global low-carbon economy, and the competitive advantages for business and industry in low-carbon solutions. Minister McKenna also highlighted throughout the week the key role played by all levels of government, as well as businesses, Indigenous peoples, civil society, and youth in addressing climate change. Canada believes that the private sector will play an important role in bringing about the transition to a stronger, more sustainable economy and creating a better tomorrow for future generations. Canadian businesses are well-positioned to succeed in a global low-carbon economy, creating more well-paying jobs for Canadas middle class while contributing to our progress in addressing climate change. While in Marrakech, Minister McKenna delivered Canadas national statement, and she participated in several high-level discussions on issues including carbon pricing, clean-technology growth and innovation, gender and climate policy, and health. Canada also submitted its mid-century strategy to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, making it one of the first countries to do so. The strategy looks beyond 2030 to start a conversation on the ways we can further reduce emissions for a cleaner, more sustainable future by 2050. Several investments were also announced in support of climate efforts and clean-technology deployment in developing countries, as part of the historic $2.65-billion commitment the Government made in Budget 2016. Quote The Government of Canada is committed to finding ambitious solutions to climate change and to create a better future for our children and grandchildren. The global economy has shifted towards cleaner, more sustainable growth, and the momentum is irreversible. Working together, we are setting ourselves on a sustainable and prosperous path for the future. Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Of the 195 countries that signed the Agreement, 109 have already ratified it, bringing it into force years earlier than expected. At COP22 , Canada announced progress on the delivery of its pledge to provide $2.65 billion over five year, including $1.8 billion in funding for a range of climate-change mitigation and adaptation initiatives to support developing countries transition to low-carbon, sustainable economies, $14 million to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, like methane, through partnerships with Mexico and Chile; $3M contribution and joined the World Banks Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, which aims to find new ways for developing countries to reduce their emissions and collaborate with partners on clean energy projects like geothermal, solar and wind power, as well as pricing carbon pollution; $2.5 million to the Climate Technology Centre and Network to help developing countries access technologies in sectors such as energy, water, forestry, and agriculture; and $2 million to the National Adaptation Plans Global Network, which helps weave climate change adaptation considerations into developing countries policy, planning and decision-making. Globally, clean-energy investment rose to their highest levels, at $329 billion in 2015. The mid-century strategy is a living document and focuses on longer-term mitigation pathways to 2050, starting with a pathway consistent with net emissions falling by at least 80% in 2050 from 2005 level&#8206;s. - 30 - \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA159","POPE'S MESSAGE FOR THE 22ND MEETING OF THE CONFERENCE OF PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE (COP22)","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Vatican Information Service (VIS): Pope Francis has sent a message to the Moroccan minister for foreign affairs, Salaheddine Mezouar, who will chair the 22nd meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change ( COP22 ), taking place in Marrakech, Morocco from 7 to 18 November. In the text, the Holy Father recalls that the Paris Agreement has set out a clear path requiring the collaboration of all the international community, and he quotes extensively from his encyclical Laudato si', exhorting the promotion of a culture of care for the environment, and reiterating that the fight against climate change is closely linked to the war on poverty. The following is the full text of the message: ""The current situation of environmental degradation, closely connected to the human, ethical and social degradation that unfortunately we experience every day, calls upon all of us, each with his or her own role and competences, and leads us to meet here with a renewed sense of awareness and responsibility. The Kingdom of Morocco hosts the COP22 a few days after the entry in force of the Paris Agreement, adopted less than a year ago. Its adoption represents the important awareness that, faced with issues as complex as climate change, individual and / or national action is not enough; instead it is necessary to implement a responsible collective response truly intended to 'work together in building our common home'. On the other hand, the rapid entry into force of the Agreement strengthens the conviction that we can and we must employ our intelligence to guide technology, as well as to cultivate and also to limit our power, and to 'put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral', able to put the economy at the service of the human person, to build peace and justice and to safeguard the environment. The Paris Agreement has traced a clear path on which the entire international community is called to engage; the COP22 represents a central stage in this journey. It affects all humanity, especially the poorest and the future generations, who represent the most vulnerable component of the troubling impact of climate change, and call us to the grave ethical and moral responsibility to act without delay, in a manner as free as possible from political and economic pressures, setting aside particular interests and behaviour. In this regard I convey my greetings to you, Mr. President, and to all the participants in this Conference, along with my strong encouragement that your work in these days be inspired by the same collaborative and constructive spirit expressed during COP21. After this latter there began the phase of implementing the Paris Agreement: a delicate moment of exchange, entering in a more concrete way into the formulation of rules, institutional mechanisms and the elements necessary for correct and effective implementation. These are complex aspects that cannot be delegated solely to technical expertise but which require continual political support and encouragement, based on the recognition that we are 'we are one single human family. There are no frontiers or barriers, political or social, behind which we can hide, still less is there room for the globalisation of indifference'. One of the main contributions of this Agreement is that of stimulating the promotion of strategies for national and international development based on an environmental quality that we could define as fraternal; indeed, it encourages solidarity in relation to the most vulnerable and builds on the strong links between the battle against climate change and that of poverty. Although there are many elements of a technical nature involved in this field, we are also aware that it cannot all be limited solely to the economic and technological dimension: technical solutions are necessary but they are not enough; it is essential and proper to take into careful consideration also the ethical and social aspects of the new paradigm of development and progress. Here we enter into the fundamental fields of education and the promotion of lifestyles that favour sustainable models of production and consumption; and we are reminded of the need to promote the growth of a responsible awareness of our common home. In this task, all the States Parties are called to give their contribution, along with the non-party stakeholders: civil society, the private sector, the scientific world, financial institutions, sub-national authorities, local communities, indigenous populations. In conclusion, Mr. President and all participants in the COP22 , I convey my best wishes that the works of the Marrakech Conference be guided by that awareness of our responsibility that must drive each one of us to promote seriously a 'culture of care which permeates all society', care in relation to creation, but also for our neighbour, near or far in space and time. The lifestyle based on the throwaway culture is unsustainable and must have no place in our models of development and education. This is an educational and cultural challenge which must respond also to the process of implementing the Paris Agreement if it is to be truly effective. While I pray for the successful and fruitful work of the Conference, I invoke upon you and all the participants the Blessing of the Almighty, which I ask you to convey to all the citizens of the countries you represent"". \"

""This transfer of $500 million to the fund demonstrates our country's ongoing compassion and commitment to the poor around the world,"" said Bill O'Keefe, CRS Vice President for Government Relations and Advocacy. ""The Green Climate Fund is an important resource that helps communities in developing countries prepare for the ill effects of climate change, like increasing droughts that undermine the livelihoods of small farmers."" &#8234;The Green Climate Fund was established in 2010 during the United Nations Climate Change Conference , and is now an independent organization underwriting major renewable energy projects that support climate mitigation and helping the world's most vulnerable adapt to the inescapable impacts of climate change. CRS has programs across the globe to help poor communities, many of whom are being disproportionately affected by climate change. CRS helps these communities adapt through climate-smart agriculture, by diversifying their incomes, and restoring critical watersheds, for example. The Green Climate Fund supports these kinds of adaptation measures. ""At CRS we see the effects of climate change first-hand on the ground every day, and we also know there are ways to help people with the new challenges they face,"" O'Keefe said. The Catholic Church has been a leading voice in calling leaders and people of goodwill to rise above politics in order to respond to climate change. In 2001 the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) noted that ""global climate change is not about economic theory or political platforms, nor about partisan advantage or interest group pressures. It is about the future of God's creation and the one human family."" In 2009 Pope Benedict lamented ""how can one remain indifferent in the face of problems such as climate change, desertification, the degradation and loss of productivity in vast agricultural areas"" that was leading to what he termed ""environmental refugees."" And in his 2015 encyclical, Laudato Si', Pope Francis implored politicians to be ""courageous"" and ""to take up"" the responsibility and costs associated with responding to climate change. ""It is more important than ever for the United States to lead the international community in helping to address the impacts of climate change on the poor,"" O'Keefe said. ""We look forward to working with the new Administration and Congress, and the broader development and international community, to continue to provide support to those affected by changes in their environment.""

International climate groups also fully participated in the march as environmentalists and social justice groups that comprise the movement to decrease dependency on fossil fuels. ""Those were the people bringing the messages of other people from all over the world to join the procession. For me it was almost liturgical - honouring the culture, traditions and the spirit of the people whose desire is for peace and freedom, dignity, sustainability and justice. The message I saw throughout the whole parade over and over was about climate justice - it was very clear"", said Kennedy. The March drew together different generations of people - there were families and children, old people and young people. ""And you could feel the energy of the young people - in their faces, movement, expression. For us, churches, that gave a huge feeling of encouragement - that there is a future we are fighting for, worth struggling and hoping and praying for. We are in the kingdom of Morocco - but we are experiencing the glimpses of what the Kingdom on earth is like."" African young leaders of their churches in the ACT group were participating in creative, competent, yet youthful ways, causing people to smile everywhere they walked. ""At first they chanted in English, then in French - it was moderate. But then they were taught to chant ""climate justice now"" in Arabic and they turned that into singing - people all around in the streets were smiling, laughing and applauding - there was instant resonance"", said Kennedy. ""It was like a move of the spirit - it was just incredible. And it gives me hope that the young generations get it and they will make it happen. "" As a churches and faith communities, we know that we need to be in negotiating rooms and strategizing rooms - but we also need to be in the streets, said Kennedy, adding that the voice of the participating faith groups was heard well in the streets of Marrakech, as they were singing at the top of their lungs at the end of the procession. ""In some ways it is the role of people of faith to come along and clean up the mess left behind. When they were singing 'We are marching in the light of God,' everyone could relate to that"", said Kennedy, describing the experience as a marvellous and genuine witness. ""It came out of the depth of their souls - you could not help to start singing along with them. That's real liturgical leadership, where you are just drawn to sing along.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA163","New York: Faiths applaud ""unprecedented global consensus"" on climate change action at COP22","November 23, 2016 Wednesday","US Official News","Albany: Anglican Communion has issued the following news release: \~ \~Last year\' s Paris agreement on climate change is  irreversible and unstoppable , the world\' s political leaders said as they met in Marrakech for this year\' s climate change conference ( COP22 ). As they gathered, a significant number of Anglican leaders signed a joint inter-faith statement describing the agreement as an  unprecedented global consensus.  The landmark Paris Agreement set the course and the destination for global climate action, the UN\' s Patricia Espinosa, executive Secretary of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, said.  Here in Marrakesh, governments underlined that this shift is now urgent. Amongst the agreements reached in Morocco, 47 of some of the world\' s poorest states that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the Climate Vulnerable Forum, pledged to switch to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. The governments at the COP22 talks agreed to bring forward the writing of the  rule book which would put the Paris agreement into action; and also  a significant boost of transparency of action, including for measuring and accounting emissions reductions, the provision of climate finance, and technology development and transfer. The inter-faith statement, signed by around 298 faith leaders from 50 countries, called on nations to justly manage the transition to a low carbon economy and urged a significant shift of investment from fossil fuels into renewable energy sources. In it, the faith leaders ask states to uphold the obligations in the preamble of the Paris Agreement. In particular, they say:  we appeal to states to uphold their obligations on human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples, gender equality, a just transition, food security and intergenerational equity.  We stress that the full and equal participation of women, indigenous societies and youth in addressing climate change will accelerate efforts towards a low carbon economy and significantly contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, that aims to end energy poverty by 2030. And they call on organisations, including from faith communities,  for more commitments to divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy and targeted engagement with companies on climate change.  We need to ground this work in pursuing a just transition to renewable energy. The letter was signed by a number of Anglican leaders, including Nicholas Drayson, the bishop of Northern Argentina in the Province of South America; Dr Lyn Arnold, chair of the Church of Australia\' s Public Affairs Commission; Mark MacDonald, the bishop for indigenous peoples for the Church of Canada; Thomas Oommen, the Bishop of Madhya Kerala in the united Church of South India; Dr Agnes Aboum, moderator of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches and a member of the Church of Kenya; and Archbishop Thabo Makgoba, primate of the Church of Southern Africa and the chair of the Anglican Communion Environmental Network (ACEN).  There is urgent need to scale up action on climate change as it is very negatively impacting on the very poor, the Bishop of Bunyoro-Kitara, Nathan Kyamanywa, from the Church of Uganda, said.  Right now, many people in Uganda are dying of famine, drought, floods and storms. The seasons are erratic and unreliable. The Bishop of California in the US-based Episcopal Church, Marc Andrus, said that  all those who live on the Earth at this moment in time have been given the greatest possibility of being agents of transformation for future generations.  To live into this possibility we must act on three levels: at the level of nations; at sub-national levels (cities, regions, religious bodies); and as individuals.  At all three levels of action we must see the historic Paris Agreement of 2015 as a starting point, not as a static goal, and we must aspire to deeper, broader, more creative efforts. He continued:  the foundation of all our work in engaging climate change is spiritual \- let the religious and spiritual traditions of the Earth bring our greatest spiritual values to bear in this crucial effort. The Bishop of Kingston in the Church of England\' s diocese of Southwark, Dr Richard Cheetham, said that  care for the environment is one of the biggest moral and existential issues of our time. Combined and determined action for good stewardship of our planet earth is a central tenet of Christian faith. And the inaugural convenor of the Anglican Communion Environmental Network (ACEN), Bishop George Browning from the Church of Australia, commented:  We live in a relational world. Humans must learn to live within their limits, as well as their aspirations.  Not to understand our limits is to court disaster. Being environmentally responsible is core business to people of faith and is ethically non-negotiable. Out of the 198 states that were party to the Paris Agreement, 112 have ratified it. The agreement passed its ratification threshold on 5 October this year and it came into legal force on 4 November. Next year\' s Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP23) will be hosted by Fiji, but held in Bonn, Germany. \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA167","Climate Change Workshop Tackles Solutions to a Global Problem","February 7, 2017 Tuesday","US Official News","Harrisburg: Drexel University has issued the following news release: There may be more hurdles to environmental progress in the United States today than in the immediate past, but the Drexel students and faculty involved in the climate action movement expect the global fight to carry on apace. The cohort who attended November\' s climate change conference in Morocco, sponsored by the Office of International Programs and the Institute for Energy and the Environment, presented their findings Jan. 30 in the Paul Peck Alumni Center and led a discussion about how the Drexel community can take action to support the environment on an individual and institutional basis. The 22nd Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP22 , which five students and five faculty members attended, focused on implementation of the landmark Paris agreement reached the year before to curtail the damage humans are doing to the environment. Franco Montalto, PhD, the director of the North American Hub of the Urban Climate Change Research Network at Drexel and an associate professor in the College of Engineering, gave a brief overview of the extent of that damage to set the stage for the afternoon\' s presentations. In a series of startling charts and graphs showing the stark changes in greenhouse gas emissions and global warming in recent years, he set up a simple question.  What now? Montalto asked.  What can different nations do? There are no silver bullets, according to Carol Collier, director of Drexel\' s Environmental Studies and Sustainability Program, but there is reason for optimism. She told the audience, which included a few dozen students, that the push toward action in Morocco left her hopeful. Despite the steep hill to climb to limit global warming, efforts in the areas of reforestation, climate-smart soils and water resources all offer paths to progress. Much of the change in America is likely to come from cities, Hugh Johnson, a senior associate in the Institute for Energy and the Environment, said. About 70 percent of American emissions come from cities, leaving plenty of opportunity for focused efforts to make incremental progress, he said. For those fearing that the new administration\' s apparent distrust of climate science will set the country back, he suggested Canada\' s recent experience as a point of comparison. Hundreds of government scientists were fired under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and government discussion of climate change was banned; cities nonetheless continued to move forward to find new solutions on their own. Johnson also said the business case for environmental progress is clear. Companies including Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Apple are leading the march toward renewable energy, he said. Like Collier, he was optimistic about what he saw at COP22 .  It was right after the election and there was no backing down, said Johnson. Eugenia Victoria Ellis, PhD, director of the dLUX light lab and an associate professor in the College of Engineering and the Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, focused her portion of the presentation on the role of the built environment  everything humans have created, invented and constructed to facilitate living on Earth  in climate change. Nearly half of the energy consumption in the United States comes from buildings, including three-quarters of the electricity used. In terms of per capita emissions, the United States is twice as harmful to the environment as China and three times as harmful as any other country.  We\' re the worst offenders worldwide, she said. The built environment, though, presents many opportunities for change in an effort to meet the goal of limiting global warming to 2\'b0C in the coming decades.  If we look at buildings as a whole and we want to reduce their energy consumption to meet 2\'b0C goals, this can be done by using low-energy lighting and designing the building envelope to reduce heating and cooling needs, said Ellis. Following the presentations, the students who attended COP22 split the crowd into four groups to discuss plans for action. The conversations focused on how Drexel can divest from fossil fuels, opportunities for local activism, ways to encourage state representatives to take action and how to become more climate-friendly on a personal level. Those in attendance walked away with new ideas and a mind for action, much like the students and faculty at the conference in Morocco.  It was an extremely valuable addition to our development, not only as students but as citizens of the United States, said Dalton George, a COP22 attendee and a graduate student in the Center of Science, Technology and Society.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA168","Fletcher delegates represent Tufts at COP 22 in Morocco - The Tufts Daily","December 7, 2016 Wednesday","Tufts Daily: Tufts University","Delegates from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy represented Tufts at the\~22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP 22 ) in\~Marrakech, Morocco from November 7 to 18. The conference included delegates and organizations from all over the world\~coming\~together to undertake efforts to check climate change and preserve the environment for future generations. Fatima Quraishi,\~Fletcher student and COP 22 delegate, said\~some of the topics discussed at the event included climate financing, renewable energy sources and a smooth shift in industrialization\~policy for transitioning and developing economies. Kelly Sims\~Gallagher, director of the Center\~for International Environment and Resource Policy at Fletcher, was one of the professors involved in sending delegates to the conference. According to Gallagher, the observer status granted to Tufts in United Nations\~climate change negotiations allowed the delegates, all of whom were involved in the Tufts Institute of the Environment , to be directly in touch\~with international environmental policy trends. ""Participation of the [TIE]\~in events such as COP 22 fosters the creation of new partnerships and collaborations with academic, governmental and non-governmental parties, thus bringing opportunities back to Tufts' faculty and students on campus,"" Gallagher told the Daily in an email. Vasundhara Jolly, another Fletcher student and delegate at the conference, said all resolutions at a COP session require unanimous support in order to pass. Quraishi explained that\~COP 21, which took place last year,\~brought nations together to take steps to combat climate change by signing the Paris Agreement, the world's first comprehensive agreement aimed at combating climate change. ""The COP 22 Quraishi\~explained that the conference\~was divided into two zones for different participants - the blue zone and green zone. ""The blue zone is for official negotiations, while the green zone is open to all participants, such as NGOs, attending the conference,"" she said. Quraishi said that, as someone interested in international environmental policy and climate change, the conference provided a positive learning experience for students in the Tufts delegation. The standpoint of the United States on climate policy was one that drew attention, Jolly\~said. ""It was interesting to see the stance of the United States at the conference, given the recent elections and change in approach regarding climate change,"" she said. Jolly\~added that Tufts' booth at the conference facilitated interaction and exchange of ideas and information with delegates from other nations as well as experts and leaders in the field of climate policy. Aside from learning about policy, Fletcher students also took the chance to network, according to Gallagher. ""Building such connections paves the way for professional as well as academic opportunities, such as internships and jobs with top environmental agencies,"" she said. Quraishi\~said that while\~ COP 22 saw nations come together to cooperate and combine efforts to battle climate change, negotiations did not end with the conference. Rather, the battle against climate change will be a continued effort over the coming years, she said. \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA171","GOVERNOR BROWN TO CLIMATE SCIENTISTS: ""WE WILL PERSEVERE""","December 14, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the office of the Governor of California: Rallying thousands of scientists at one of the largest international gatherings of its kind, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today called on the scientific community - the ""truth-tellers"" and ""truth seekers"" - to mobilize for the climate fight. ""The time has never been more urgent or your work never more important. The climate is changing, temperatures are rising, oceans are becoming more acidified, habitats are under stress - the world is facing tremendous danger,"" said Governor Brown at the American Geophysical Union's annual fall meeting in San Francisco. ""It'll be up to you as truth-tellers, truth seekers to mobilize all your efforts to fight back. We've got a lot of firepower. We've got the scientists, we've got the universities, we have the national labs and we have the political clout and sophistication for the battle - and we will persevere. Have no doubt about that."" ""We will pursue a path of collaboration and bold political advancement - whatever they do in Washington - and eventually the truth will prevail,"" Governor Brown continued. ""This is not a battle of one day or one election. This is a long-term slog into the future and you are there, the foot soldiers of change and understanding and scientific collaboration."" Governor Brown's remarks follow yesterday's action to prevent further coastal oil and gas drilling, reduce ocean acidity and boost renewable energy development in California. In recent weeks, Governor Brown issued a joint release with the governors of Oregon and Washington and the premier of British Columbia reaffirming their commitment to climate action at the close of COP22 . The Governor also announced 29 new members to the Under2 Coalition, an international climate pact formed by California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. A total of 165 jurisdictions have now joined the coalition representing more than a billion people and $25.7 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy. California's Leadership on Climate Change California is playing a world-leading role in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants. In September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. Over the past year and a half, the Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations. Photo Captions 1.)

The global community is more united than ever not just in accepting the [climate change] challenge, but in confronting it with real action, in making a difference. [State Department photo]Secretary Kerry reiterated the importance of the international community moving 'expeditiously' to put the Paris agreement permanently into force, crossing the thresholds of 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions. 'In a powerful statement of the whole world's broad commitment to this agreement, in less than a year, 109 countries representing nearly 75 percent of the world's emissions have now formally committed to bold, decisive action - and we are determined to affirm that action and to stick with it out of Marrakech,' he said. Secretary Kerry touted the significance of the framework of the Paris Agreement, which embraces an 'essence of common but differentiated responsibilities' where each country does what it can to address climate change. Through the agreement, the international community has pulled together an array of tools to help developing nations invest in infrastructure, technology, and the science as well as adapt to the climate impacts that many countries are already confronting.As Secretary Kerry noted, the agreement 'leaves no country to weather the storm of climate change alone.' We have to continue to defy expectations. We have to continue to accelerate the global transition to a clean energy economy. And we have to continue to hold one another accountable for the choices that our nations makes. [State Department photo]Secretary Kerry also highlighted important progress that the international community has made on climate change since adopting the Paris Agreement last December, including a sector-wide aviation agreement on carbon-neutral growth and the Kigali agreement--an international agreement to phase down the global use and production of hydrofluorocarbons. According to Secretary Kerry, these advancements demonstrate how the the United States and its partners are moving the needle in the right direction as 'global leaders have woken up to the enormity of this challenge, the world is now beginning to move forward together towards a clean energy future.' In addition to the efforts of governments, Secretary Kerry made a point to emphasize to the role of the private sector and the market in advancing global efforts to combat climate change. Over the past decade, the global renewable energy market has expanded more than six-fold and last year alone, investment in renewable energy was at an all-time high at nearly $350 billion. While our emissions are being driven down by market-based forces clean energy is expected to be a multi-trillion dollar market in the future and it benefits all countries to have businesses involved in the expansion of clean energy economy. As Secretary Kerry said, ""The energy curve is bending towards sustainability.The market is clearly headed towards clean energy, and that trend will only become more pronounced.""Climate change directly impacts everyone across all seven continents. We all must do our part to #ActOnClimate[1]. pic.twitter.com/7IvF6SwWDV[2] John Kerry (@JohnKerry) November 11, 2016[3]Following his recent trip last week to Antarctica, Secretary Kerry shared how the visit was a clear and urgent reminder of the danger facing our planet if we do not act swiftly, doing all we can to reverse climate change. Given the real threat of melting ice sheets and rising sea waters, Secretary Kerry warned, 'We can't wait too long to translate the science that we have today into the policies that are necessary to address this challenge.' Secretary Kerry closed his remarks by requesting of the audience and larger international community to always remember the stakes. He concluded, 'Let us stand firm in support of the goals that we set in Paris and recommit ourselves to double our efforts to meet them. Let us say that when it comes to climate change, we will commit not just to doing our best, but as Winston Churchill admonished, we will do what is required.'

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA175","Protests Over Fishmonger's Death Test Moroccan Monarchy's Nerves","Voice of America","Newstex Blogs","Nov 03, 2016( Voice of America: HYPERLINK http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex) Grainy video images and the screams of a young fishmonger who was crushed to death in a garbage truck while trying to stop police destroying his stock have shocked Moroccans and brought thousands on to the streets to protest. Five years after pro-democracy protests shook Morocco, this week's unrest is a reminder of pent-up frustrations the monarchy has managed to tame in the past with limited constitutional reforms, heavy welfare spending and tough security. With a rallying cry against the Makhzen - a term used to describe the royal establishment - protesters have vowed to stage more demonstrations over Mouhcine Fikri's death in the northern city of Al-Hoceima, which was captured on video by witnesses and widely shared on social media. They say he is a symbol of abuses against Moroccans and has revived the spirit of the February 20 movement which led the pro-democracy demonstrations that swept the country. The political and social stability of Morocco is closely watched by Western governments as it is the only country in North Africa where jihadist groups have failed to gain a foothold, and is an important partner against Islamist militancy in terms of intelligence-sharing. The public anger over the death has echoes of how Tunisia's own 2011 uprising began, when a young street vendor set himself on fire after police confiscated his fruit and vegetables. That uprising swept Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali from power and triggered ""Arab Spring"" revolts across the region. But there are fundamental differences with Morocco, where now and even five years ago calls for greater freedoms and reform have not been directed at toppling the king. Morocco has a deeply rooted monarchy - the Muslim world's longest-serving dynasty - while Tunisia's autocracy was based around Ben Ali, who came to power in 1987, and his family. Preventing a repeat of 2011 The political protests - rare in Morocco - will nevertheless test the nerves of a kingdom that presents itself as a model for economic stability and gradual change and a haven for foreign investment in a region torn by violence and political upheaval. The monarchy wants to prevent the unrest from escalating to the level of the 2011 protests, which lasted about a year and forced King Mohamed to cede some of his absolute powers to the elected government. Protest organizers say the anger at Fikri's death, which shocked even staunch royalists, has rekindled the broader resentment at the establishment over joblessness and the big gap between rich and poor that drove those pro-democracy protests. ""People learned from February 20 movement to not let themselves to be fooled, so we will fight with all our strength for the dignity that Fikri died for,"" said Nasser Zafzafi, one of the organizers. ""We do not want scapegoats, but for the truly responsible to be punished, including high officials."" Most of the kingdom's 34 million people follow a moderate form of Islam and the country has long acted as a bridge for Westerners to Islamic and African culture. The king holds executive powers but also claims religious legitimacy as the commander of the faithful. Royal condolences In an attempt to calm tensions, King Mohamed, currently touring Africa, ordered the interior minister to visit the victim's family and present royal condolences - a rare gesture of conciliation by the monarchy at a time of public protests. The minister said Fikri did not deserve what happened to him and promised the investigation would punish those responsible. Just like other governments in North Africa, Moroccan authorities often heavily police protests, nervous over popular unrest since 2011. Tunisia has seen rioting twice this year in its south over jobs and unions are warning over austerity plans. But the security forces appear to have taken a more low-key, hands-off approach this week, waiting in side streets and staying away from where demonstrations rallied. The authorities' more conciliatory approach this week, compared with in 2011 and during other more minor unrest since, could be partly down to the timing, according to political analysts. The protests erupted at a sensitive moment as the kingdom prepares to host the 2016 United Nations climate change conference in November ( COP22 ) and the prime minister begins to form a coalition government after elections last month. ""The Moroccan regime knows how to buy peace, especially now that the country is hosting COP22 ,"" said Mohammed Larbi Ben Othmane, a political scientist in Rabat university. ""They know how to adapt, you would even see members of the royal cabinet protesting with people if they need to do so, but they will never show weakness."" Ultimate authority Fikri's death last week prompted thousands of people to take to the streets for four days of protests in Al-Hoceima and major cities across the country including the capital Rabat and Marrakesh, among the biggest rallies Morocco has seen since 2011. Moroccan authorities have charged 11 people, jailing eight of them, over the death of Fikri who was crushed in a trash truck while trying to stop police from destroying 500 kilograms of swordfish they say he purchased illegally. The general prosecutor said on Tuesday those charged on involuntary manslaughter were two interior ministry officials, two local fisheries officials and a veterinary chief. Activists accused police officers at the scene of ordering garbage men to ""grind"" Fikri but the police denied those accusations. The involvement of local officials has fueled anger at the establishment and a frenzy of postings on social media blaming the Makhzen, reminding many of the February 20 movement calls to curb the monarchy's absolute powers. When protests erupted in 2011, the king called a referendum which backed constitutional reforms that saw him cede some of his powers to the government and guarantee more rights, including freedom of speech. He remains the ultimate authority in Morocco, however. Many February 20 activists were disappointed by the reforms, which they believe did not go far enough to bring democracy, and any suggestion of a resurgence of the movement is sensitive for a monarchic political system that critics describe as a medieval and archaic. ""What happened shows that all the people who thought the February 20 movement was dead were wrong,"" said Ben Othmane. ""Moroccans did not lose that capacity to resist."" \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA176","Paris Climate Treaty Goes into Force, COP-22 Starts in Marrakesh","November 7, 2016 Monday","US Official News","Washington: Competitive Enterprise Institute has issued the following news release: The Paris Climate Treaty went into force, or as the Associated Press story put it  became international law, on 4th November. Ninety-seven countries accounting for approximately two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions have now ratified the treaty. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told a press conference,  We remain in a race against time. But with the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world has the plans we need to make the shift to a low-emission, climate-resilient path. The treaty\' s entry into force is well-timed to provide a boost to the Twenty-Second Conference of the Parties ( COP-22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will begin meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco on 7th November. On the other hand, the U. S. presidential election on 8th November could dampen spirits at COP-22 if Donald Trump wins. Trump has promised in several speeches that as president he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Treaty and stop funding for the UNFCCC, including its Green Climate Fund. This would put President Trump at odds with the leaders of every country in the world, which is apparently something that doesn\' t bother him. China\' s  climate chief, Xie Zhenhua, took a pre-emptive swipe at Trump on 1st November. According to a Reuters story, Xie warned,  I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends. If they resist this trend, I don't think they'll win the support of their people, and their country's economic and social progress will also be affected. China clearly wants the United States to abide by the treaty and fulfill its Nationally Determined Contribution, which requires the U. S. to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. China\' s NDC pledges that its emissions will peak no later than 2030.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA177","Morocco invites Seychelles to UN's Cop 22 Conference on Climate Change","July 15, 2016 Friday","Eturbo News","U.S., July 15 -- Morocco's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Salaheddine Mezouar, on Wednesday presented an invitation to the Seychelles President James Michel at State House. Seychelles has been invited to participate in the UN's 22nd Conference on Climate Change ( Cop 22 ) in November in Marrakech, Morocco, reported the Seychelles News Agency (SNA). Mezouar told journalists that Morocco believes that Seychelles played an important role to ensure the successful outcome of the UN's 21st Conference on Climate Change held in Paris last December. During the Cop 21 meeting in France's capital city, Paris, last December, the 195 participating countries adopted the first global agreement on climate change - a binding treaty that aims to limit global warming to below 2 deg C. Among other things, the November meeting in Marrakech aims to commit parties for the entry into force of the Paris agreement. ""We have spent a lot of years to negotiate, to speak out, and it's now time for action,"" said Mezouar. Seychelles is considered to be among the world's leaders in taking action to protect the environment. This is mainly due to the fact that the effects of climate change, especially rising sea levels, could have serious impacts on the island nation. The Seychelles Foreign Affairs Minister, Joel Morgan, who was present at the State House meeting, told journalists that Morocco also wants Seychelles, a 115-island archipelago in the western Indian Ocean, to take a lead role in ensuring that small island states come up with common projects in order to secure funding. Morgan said that Seychelles has agreed to lead such an initiative and is currently planning where it will host a meeting of small island nations so that such a common endeavor could be properly defined. Aside of the upcoming climate change meeting, Minister Mezouar also discussed other issues with President Michel. This included a visa waiver for Seychelles nationals who visit Morocco - a decision he says will take effect during the Cop 22 meeting.Seychelles has been invited to participate in the UN's 22nd Conference on Climate Change ( Cop 22 ) in November in Marrakech, Morocco, reported the Seychelles News Agency (SNA).

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA179","CLIMATE RISK AND EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS INITIATIVE PRIORITISES THE MOST VULNERABLE","November 17, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by International Strategy for Disaster Reduction: African Least Developed Countries and Pacific Islands will be the first to benefit from upgraded early warning systems against weather and climate-related shocks under an action plan outlined at the United Nations climate change conference . Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Small Island Developing States in the Pacific will be supported to improve their early warning systems and forecast services with an initial US$12 million in funding allocated by the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) initiative. Additional projects are under development. Launched last year at the Paris climate change negotiations, CREWS aims to mobilize more than US$30 million by July 2017 and US$100 million by 2020. The international partnership seeks to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries, and to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events. ""This is a pragmatic, tangible and targeted initiative to protect the most vulnerable. It is realistic and it is feasible,"" said Ms. Anne-Marie Descotes, Director-General for Global Affairs at the French Foreign Ministry, who represented Ms. Segol ne Royal, French Minister for the Environment, Energy and Sea, at a special event on 16 November at COP22 . The CREWS coalition is led by France, with support from Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada. It is being implemented by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). ""The increase in global temperatures is being accompanied by more extreme weather events. In addition to the need for climate change mitigation, there is a very strong need for climate change adaptation. Early warning systems are a very powerful way to adapt to climate change. The CREWS initiative will lead to concrete action which mitigates economic losses and saves lives,"" WMO Secretary-General Mr. Petteri Taalas told the event. According to WMO, over 80 percent of the world's 48 Least Developed Countries and many Small Island Developing States have only a basic early warning system. Weather observations networks, the foundation of early warning systems, are inadequate in many African countries. ""CREWS can help us reinforce a simple but critical message that people-centered, multi-hazard, early warning systems save lives. By building capacity across stakeholder groups, supporting interagency coordination and leveraging significant resources from development partners, this initiative provides an effective way to reduce risk and build climate resilience,"" said Ms. Laura Tuck, Vice President of Sustainable Development, World Bank Group. ""The number of weather and climate related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years and this initiative will help reduced the impact of these events on low and middle-income countries which suffer the most,"" Mr. Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, said in a statement. Thanks to the CREWS initiative, Burkina Faso, Mali and Democratic Republic of Congo will be able to upgrade their national meteorological and hydrological service forecast capacities. Two additional projects are under development for Niger and Papua New Guinea. Additional funding from Canada will support work in Small Island Developing States and Southeast Asia. A new project for the Caribbean may be added to the CREWS investment plan in 2017. Professor Kabasele Yenga-Yenga, member of the spatial observatory on natural resources and climate in Democratic Republic of Congo, said his vast country lacked even basic meteorological and ocean data and observations. Coastal erosion and sea level rise at one of DRC's maritime ports has eaten away both shoreline and port facilities and caused the connecting railway line to collapse. He said CREWS financing would enable development of alert systems for farmers and fishermen. Like other Pacific nations, Tonga is vulnerable to hazards such as tropical cyclones and drought. Its 170 islands mean that early warning systems are particularly challenging, said Paula Ma'u, of the Ministry of Meteorology, Hydrology, Information, Disaster Management, Climate Change and Communication. ""Early warning systems technology, be it radars or radios, are not cheap. But they are a priority for the government because when disaster strikes communications are the first things to go down. It is challenging to access the financing for this equipment. We therefore really welcome this CREWS initiative,"" said Mr. Ma'u. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA180","EGYPT STEPS UP TRAVEL BANS ON RIGHTS DEFENDERS WITH ""CHILLING EFFECT"", UN EXPERT WARNS","November 24, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: A United Nations rights expert has criticised Egypt's increasing use of travel bans on human rights defenders, warning that the measures are hindering their legitimate work and infringing their fundamental rights. ""Restrictions imposed on defenders' freedom of movement have regrettably become routine in what is seen as a broader crackdown against Egyptian civil society that has continued unabated since 2011,"" said the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Michel Forst. Mr. Forst has received the cases of more than 15 Egyptian human rights defenders, who were prevented from travelling abroad in 2016 for regional and international events. The restrictions are often based on investigations relating to a controversial foreign funding case, also known as Case No. 173, which reportedly led to the leaders and staff of at least 37 Egyptian rights organisations being charged with receiving 'illegal foreign funding' and 'working without permission'. ""It is seriously concerning to observe that travel bans, along with other restrictions on fundamental freedoms to free speech, association and assembly, seem to have become politically motivated means to stifle civil society movement in the country, and to choke legitimate and democratic debate, both within and outside Egypt,"" said the UN expert. ""The growing use of travel bans as a method of preventing the legitimate exercise of rights has a chilling effect on human rights defenders and general society."" Mr. Forst also warned that stopping people participating in rights activities abroad could violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and breach the spirit of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which gives people the right to promote human rights ""at the national and international levels"". Despite reassurances by the Government that the travel bans are in line with the principle of criminal justice, Mr. Forst highlighted a series of procedural concerns. For example, he said, the activists were not being notified of the bans before they attempted to travel, and were often not told the legal basis or how to appeal, resulting in their inability to challenge the decision. ""I strongly advise the Egyptian State to repeal the existing travel bans and refrain from imposing further restrictions against human rights defenders, to ensure that it does not contravene international human rights norms and standards,"" said Mr. Forst. ""The Government should consider dedicating its legal, administrative and financial resources to empowering civil society, rather than obstructing its activities and undermining fundamental freedoms, which the State is charged to respect and protect."" Recent cases have included Mozn Hassan, a prominent women rights defender and executive director of Nazra for Feminist Studies, whose travel has been repeatedly hindered, including a planned visit to Sweden earlier on 25 November to receive a human rights award. Another defender, Azza Soliman, was prevented from travelling to a training event on women's rights in Jordan on 19 November. Four days before that, Ahmed Ragheb, founder of the National Community for Human Rights and Law, was not permitted to fly to Morocco for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ). ENDS Mr. Michel Forst (France) was appointed by the Human Rights Council as the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders in 2014. Michel Forst has extensive experience on human rights issues and particularly on the situation of human rights defenders. In particular, he was the Director General of Amnesty International (France) and Secretary General of the first World Summit on Human Rights Defenders in 1998.

The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the\~21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC[23]\~in\~Paris[24]\~and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015.\~It was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day[25]) at a ceremony in New York.\~As of April 2017, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the treaty, 144 of which have ratified it.\~After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force.\~The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016. The head of the\~Paris Conference[26], France's foreign minister\~Laurent Fabius[27], said this ""ambitious and balanced"" plan is a ""historic turning point"" in the goal of reducing\~global warming[28]. One year on, the ratification of the Paris Agreement was celebrated by the Mayor of Paris\~Anne Hidalgo[29]\~by illuminating the\~Eiffel Tower[30]\~and the\~Arc de Triomphe[31], Paris' most iconic monuments, in green. (Via Wikipedia[32])  Clean Power Plan[33]\~ The\~Clean Power Plan\~is an\~Obama administration[34]\~policy aimed at combating\~anthropogenic climate change[35]\~(global warming) that was first proposed by the\~Environmental Protection Agency[36]\~in June 2014.\~It is widely expected to be eliminated under President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order on March 28, 2017 mandating the EPA to review the plan. Proposed actions under President Trump President\~Donald Trump[37]'s proposed\~2018 United States federal budget[38]\~defunded the Clean Power Plan.\~On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an\~executive order[39]\~directing EPA Administrator\~Scott Pruitt[40]\~to review the Clean Power Plan.\~EPA will need to go through the formal rulemaking process to change the existing rule,\~and in 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case\~Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency[41]\~that EPA regulation of carbon dioxide is actually required by the\~Clean Air Act[42], which is still in effect. Trump explained this decision calling the Clean Power Plan a ""job-killing regulation"" which some see as false, saying ""the potential for job growth in the clean energy sector dwarfs any potential job growth in the fossil fuel economy"". Opposition argues that with the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, the United States will not be able to meet the greenhouse gas emission standards agreed to under the\~Paris Agreement[43], and in turn, will have to withdraw from the agreement. Without it, the United States is projected to fall over 20% short of its pledge.\~Because the Clean Power Plan was a significant part of how the United States intended to meet the emission targets it set for the Paris Agreement, this action may discourage other countries from upholding their own commitments.\~Janet McCabe[44], an Obama Administration EPA department head, stated that the decision completely disregards the impacts of climate and the cost and benefits associated with the started programs. According to her it will lead to several more years of uncertainty and potentially lost opportunity as well as a worsening public image of the United States internationally. However she is hopeful that the decision's impact on the industry's direction toward a cleaner energy system won't be severe as several states already meet the 2022 target carbon dioxide emissions established in the Clean Power Plan.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA182","Commission Welcomes Entry into Force of Paris Agreement Ahead of UN Climate Conference in Marrakech","November 4, 2016 Friday 2:57 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Commission issued the following news release: The Paris Agreement legally enters into force today; 30 days after the EU's ratification pushed it past the threshold to take effect. The historic event comes less than a year after the landmark agreement was adopted and just days ahead of the UN climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco. The Vice-President in charge of the Energy Union, Maros Sefcovic said: ""Today's entry into force of the Paris Agreement, less than a year after its adoption, shows one thing: that the entire world shares a pressing sense of urgency when it comes to fighting climate change. Inaction is not an option; slowing down is not our course of action. We are ready to seize this momentum to speed up work on the clean energy transition, in our Union and globally. We are ready to work at all levels, including the local level, to bring the benefits of this transition to our citizens."" Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: ""This is a great day for Europe and for the planet. I am delighted that the EU's ratification has enabled the Paris Agreement to enter into force in time for our meeting in Marrakech. We must maintain this extraordinary momentum by encouraging countries to continue ratifying the deal, and by moving full steam ahead with our preparations to put it into action across the world. Marrakech will be about action and implementation. It's time for results."" The annual United Nations climate change conference will take place from 7 to 18 November 2016 in Bab Ighli, Marrakech. Following the rapid entry into force of the global climate deal, the first meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1) will also open during the conference. The Marrakech conference aims to demonstrate that the shift to a global low-carbon economy is underway, and act as a catalyst for further action. As the global climate agreement has entered into force much earlier than expected, the EU is keen to move rapidly on the international framework to help countries put in place the policies and measures to deliver on their Paris pledges. This means that the work programme established in Paris, and started in Bonn earlier this year, must advance as swiftly as possible, while keeping participation open to all countries regardless of whether they are still ratifying the Agreement. The EU expects to see tangible progress on key elements of the Paris package, including on access to finance for developing countries and on developing and strengthening the skills and processes needed in developing countries to implement their domestic climate plans. The EU and its Member States are the biggest contributors of public climate finance to developing countries. Together they provide around a third of public funding available for action to tackle climate change and account for almost half of the pledges in the Green Climate Fund. COP 22 will have a strong focus on strengthening climate action before 2020, when most of the national climate action plans put forward by countries in the run up to Paris start. The high-level event on global climate action on 17 November and the thematic action days being held throughout the conference offer an opportunity to reflect on progress made on existing initiatives as well as for announcements of new initiatives. The EU will be represented in Marrakech by Laszlo Solymos, Minister of Environment for Slovakia, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, and Miguel Arias Canete, EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy. Events during COP 22 The EU strongly supports the Global Climate Action Agenda aimed at catalysing multi-stakeholder action. A series of events has been organised around themes, for example, the role of forests, transport, buildings and renewable energy in the fight against climate change. The EU will host more than 100 events at the EU Pavilion (see link below). These events, organised by a wide variety of organisations from Europe and the rest of the world, will address a broad range of climate-related issues from the energy transition and long term strategies to deforestation and innovative climate finance.

In the last two weeks, hundreds of organizations banded together to stand up to all new fossil fuel development, and dozens of climate vulnerable countries committed to 100% renewable energy futures. Climate science, the Paris Agreement, and millions of people around the world demand an end to new fossil fuel development and a just transition to renewables."" Stephen Kretzmann, Executive Director, Oil Change International ""While the U.S. election could have derailed the negotiations, what's happened in Marrakech has given hope that global action on climate change will not be deterred by isolated politicians. These negotiations' outcome once again failed to meet the urgency of the climate crisis, but countries and social movements came together to keep pushing forward at a time when resolve is essential. The lessons of Marrakech are clear: Don't look to bureaucrats or climate-denying Presidents to take the lead on global climate action. Look to the people in the streets and in communities around the world. These are the people-powered movements resisting fossil fuels and building a renewable energy future, and this is the path to victory."" David Turnbull, Campaigns Director, Oil Change International ""People power led the way in Marrakech at COP 22 , with over 400 organizations from more than 40 countries around the world signing a letter calling on leaders to stop all new fossil fuel development, and for rich countries to start a managed decline of current production and a just transition to renewables. Climate science demands it, and the world can't wait. Implementing the Paris Agreement means no new fossil fuel development. Period."" Matt Maiorana, Senior Digital Campaigner, Oil Change International ""Much of the finance discussion at COP 22 focused on adaptation finance, with many richer countries claiming their cupboards are bare and they simply can't afford to support those countries already feeling the devastating impacts of climate change. This doesn't ring true. Some of the world's wealthiest countries the G7 plus Australia continue to fund fossil fuel exploration and production at a rate more than 20 times higher than their contributions to help developing countries adapt to climate change.

But before he entered the political arena, Trump was quite clear about his stance. On Dec. 6, 2009, just before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Trump and three of his children signed a proclamation recognizing the significance of climate change that was reproduced as a full-page ad in The New York Times. The proclamation, signed by nearly 100 business leaders, suggested that significant business opportunities exist in adapting and exporting technology associated with mitigating the effects of climate change. It further stated that, ""We have the ability and the know-how to lead the world in clean energy technology to thrive in a global market and economy."" We can only hope that, as president, Trump will act on his past wisdom and advocate for a renewable energy policy that will stimulate the economy, create jobs and increase the quality of life for all citizens by reducing air and water pollution. As Utahns, let's consider supporting a sustainable path to the future through all levels of government, grassroots groups (such as the nonpartisan Citizens Climate Lobby) and the private sector.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA185","AT THE NEXUS OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE","September 3, 2016 Saturday","IPS - Inter Press Service","With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it's clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal. Here at World Water Week, which concluded on Friday, Susanne Skyllerstedt, programme officer for Water, Climate Change and Development at the Global Water Partnership (GWP), says her organisation is working with Sub-Saharan African governments to incorporate adaptation strategies into the partnership's climate change programme. ""For us, resolutions of COP21 are part and parcel of what we are implementing and those of COP22 (in Marrakech) will be embedded in our long-term agenda of ensuring water security in Africa and rest of the developing world in a bid to attain water-related sustainable development goals,"" she told IPS. GWP is a Stockholm-based organisation that has been involved in fostering integrated water resource management around the world for the last 20 years. GPS has four regional offices in Africa covering Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa. As an inter-governmental entity, GWP works with organisations involved in water resources management. These range from national government's institutions, United Nations agencies to funding bodies. Other stakeholders include professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector. GWP has a water and climate change programme to support governments on water security and climate change resilience. Already, said Skyllerstedt, GWP has a programme that was started in Africa through the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) together with the African Union Commission and other development partners. The programme has been a key platform for supporting African governments. These include support on national climate change adaptation programmes more so in the sphere of policy formulation. For Sub-Saharan Africa countries noted for vulnerability to impacts of global climate change, the programme is key in supporting climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Through monitoring and evaluation programmes conducted in the recent past, GWP has learned vital lessons and is cognisant of areas that need more resources to achieve the desired goals. Already, she said, GWP is running a three-year programme on climate change aimed at achieving sustainable development goals linked to water, energy and food through climate resilience. She said they are implementing initiatives aimed at enabling countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to acquire highly relevant technologies on sustainable water management. ""We have demo programmes on new technologies being implemented by our partners in Africa but they need to be scaled up to have a major impact,"" she said. GWP is also addressing the challenge of water pollution, to ensure availability of cleaner water for human consumption and other uses. It is collaborating with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to promote water security and hygiene. ""The aim is to incorporate water, sanitation and hygiene component in climate resilience,"" Skyllerstedt explained. GWP is also developing tools for better planning on water, sanitation and hygiene to help communities during calamities such as floods. ""We have an urban planning project focusing on urban water systems and infrastructure we work with national government and other partners on issues planning putting into consideration matters of access to water and sanitation facilities as well as water related calamities. At the same time GWP collaborates with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on drought and flood monitoring. ""We work with experts and stakeholders to ensure national plans take into account climate change-related hazards,"" Skyllerstedt said. ""Many African countries face challenges in fighting impacts of extreme weather such as floods and droughts, and here is where the adaption programme is relevant."" For the next three years GWP intends to widen its support to encompass not only national climate change adaptation programmes but also Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that countries published prior to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. ""National Adaptation Programmes (NAPs) and NDCs should be merged to avoid duplications,"" she observed. The biggest challenge to implementation of GWP programmes by its partners in Africa and elsewhere remains access to financial resources. ""During the COP21 in Paris last year, there were lots of pledges on financing initiatives for enhancing water security and its access by the poor. Unfortunately, our partners are not able to access the money due technical bottlenecks,"" she said. The situation has compelled GWP to embark on enhancing the capacity of their partners in Africa in the spheres of \~project design as well as making of investment plans and strategies. Skyllerstedt spoke to IPS during the World Water Week held in Stockholm, Sweden from 28 Aug. 28 to Sep. 2 and organised by the Stockholm International Water Institute. \"

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA187","State Department Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing holds an on-camera, on-the-record daily press briefing on the opening of the COP 22 Climate ....","November 7, 2016 Monday","Federal News Service","Subject: Foreign Affairs Location: The State Department, 2201 C Street NW, Press Briefing Room 2209, Washington, D.C. Time: 14:00:00 Date: 2016-11-07 TONER: Hey, folks. Happy Monday. This is a precursor, or at the top of the briefing, we thought it would be useful since today marks the start of COP22 in Marrakech, Morrocco. If we had our special envoy for climate change come and brief you on some of the expectations for that conference. Jonathan Pershing is with us today and will be able to give you, as I said, an overview of the conference, and then answer a couple of questions. Okay, Jonathan? PERSHING: Thanks. Thanks very much, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks, everyone. PERSHING: So 2016 is really an historic year on the climate change issue, on the climate change front. Over the past few months alone, we've seen a number of major events that have occurred. First and foremost, the Paris agreement itself entered into force. The technical date of entry into force was on Friday, this past Friday. That was 30 days after 55 countries, and at least -- representing at least 55 percent of global emissions had signed onto the deal, had joined the agreement. By the way, since the 55 threshold was met, we're now just over 100 countries, so it's really continuing to grow quite rapidly. But at the same time, over the course of the year, we've had a number of other major agreements. We agreed in Montreal on the agreement on civil aviation for the first time in history, capturing some of the emissions from international civil aviation, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. And the second is an agreement that was reached in Kigali in Rwanda, also in October, in which we've agreed to phase down substances called hydrofluorocarbons, which also are major greenhouse gasses, and look for substitutes that replace those. So the meeting starts today. It's actually just begin in Marrakesh, Morocco, so we're seeing significant movement on that front, and it's much smaller than Paris, about 15,000 representatives will be in attendance, compared to almost 50,000 in Paris. But it's got a couple of large scale activities that are going to be undertaken. The first bucket is actually taking cognizance of and moving forward politically based on these political agreements. The entry into force in Morocco, the Kigali agreement on Montreal protocol gasses, and ikeo (ph), there's a huge political momentum. Entry into force now really shapes the agreement and the structure. The second is the movement and aggressive acceleration of the timetable on the detailed development of rules and regulations and guidance that come out of the Paris agreement. We'd originally thought those would really be postponed for some time, there's going to be a five or a six year process. The very rapid entry into force has changed the dynamic, and we now anticipate we'll have those concluded by 2018. So a very rapid acceleration of the work of the technical guidance in detail. And the third is, this is a conference of the parties around implementation. We finished the big framing of the negotiation in Paris. Now it's implementation agenda. And we'll have experts, including our Secretary of Energy who will be there, but experts from across multiple sectors, agriculture, forestry, people who deal with water, the impacts of climate change as well as ways to reduce emissions that cause climate change. And that elevation will be a chance for CEOs, for ministers, for academics to all elevate and frame what we can do and to move from this negotiating phase into an operational phase. And that's going to occupy us for some time, and we should be very clear the risks and damages of climate have become more apparent in the last year as well, and this is going to be a race as we try to work on the problem and solve the problem before those damages become so significant that we can't do so so easily anymore. So this is a major shift in where we've been moving from these negotiating rounds into an implementation round. So with that, I'm happy to take questions that people might have around what's going to happen and where we stand. QUESTION: (inaudible) background call with some officials last week about COP22 and there was some discussion I think about zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2050 as a goal. I'm just wondering where that comes from. Is this something the United States is looking to do multilaterally, or take the lead on that particular issue? PERSHING: Thanks very much. No, there is no formal goal for 2050. What there is, though, is an agreement that's contained in the Paris -- the Paris Agreement itself that calls for countries to develop what are called mid-century strategies. The United States is working on ours. We are hoping to conclude it and complete it before the end of the year. And in that, we will be looking at a variety of scenarios where we can do significant global and U.S. reductions in emissions. It's not around a particular target number, it's around trajectories. How can you do these radical reductions. The president has indicated that we would at least be working to an 80 percent reduction by the year 2015. QUESTION: Where does zero carbon... (CROSSTALK) PERSHING: That's not us. QUESTION Okay. TONER: Any more questions. PERSHING: Thanks. TONER: Thanks so much, Jonathan. We appreciate it. Take care. END \"

The United Nations warns that huge emissions cuts are now needed to meet the global goals.United Nations climate chiefs said humanity would look back on Friday as the day the world ""shut the door on inevitable climate disaster and set off with determination towards a sustainable future.""In a joint statement released on Friday, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and Salaheddine Mezouar, president of the upcoming COP 22 climate talks in Morocco, said the Paris agreement would help to ""overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change.""""Its early entry into force is a clear political signal that all the nations of the world are devoted to decisive global action on climate change,"" they said.Fifteen years to actEspinosa, along with Mezouar - who is also Morocco's foreign minister - warned that the world community would need to come together within the next 15 years to ensure ""unprecedented reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and unequalled efforts to build societies that can resist rising climate impacts.""They warned that emissions are not yet falling, with carbon dioxide (CO2) levels breaking new records in 2016. Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere passed a critical and symbolic threshold of 400 parts per million last year, the UN said.By 2030, emissions are expected to reach 54-56 billion tones of carbon dioxide equivalent, far above the level of 42 billion tones needed to have a chance of meet one of the key components of the Paris accord - limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.Will targets be met? Even if all pledges linked to the Paris accord to cut emissions are kept, the planet will heat up some 3.0 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by century's end, a recipe for climate devastation, according to a UN Environment Program report released on Thursday.But environment chiefs have welcomed the news that the roll-out of renewable energy has surged faster than most predictions a decade ago, now accounting for 23 percent of energy production.Renewable technologies have become cheaper than previously estimated, attracting $300 billion (260 billion euros) in investment in 2015.More than 190 states signed the landmark deal, agreed in the French capital last December. To date, 94 nations have either ratified or acceded to the agreement.New climate talksNext week, diplomats from 196 nations will gather in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh for the COP22 climate talks to draw up a ""rule book"" on how to proceed next.Among the questions will be how to best disburse $100 billion (90 billion euros) a year to poor, climate-vulnerable nations.While the conference takes place, American voters will decide their next president, with many of the 15,000 COP22 attendees watching intently to see if Republican nominee Donald Trump - who has publicly denied climate change is taking place - makes it to the White House.mm/kl (AFP, Reuters) \"

The Africa Action Summit brought together 50 Heads of State and Government, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as well as representatives of international organizations. Addressing the Summit, Adesina specifically called on global finance mechanisms to pay for the premiums of African countries to the African Risk Capacity, the mechanism developed by African countries to help them cope with extreme weather events, through insurance for catastrophic events. He observed that ""the insurance premiums are not cheap and this has continued to discourage African countries from insuring themselves against the rising catastrophic risks.""

The decline in commodity prices is already taking a toll on several countries, constricting their fiscal space. Economic growth is projected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2016 from 3.6 percent in 2015. ""Africa has a very limited scope to adjust to and cope with more exogenous shocks,"" he said. The recent effects of climate change are further worsening the fiscal environment for African countries. Unless urgent action is taken, governments run the risk of diverting more of the resources needed to boost growth to deal with climate risks. Africa receives only 4% of all global finance funds. Only about 14% of global climate finance goes into adaptation. Looking ahead, Adesina said that Africa must ""power up"" itself to ""add value to what it produces, speed up industrialization and move to the top of global value chains."" He observed that this must start with unlocking the huge amounts of energy potential on the continent. ""Potential is important, yes, but potential alone cannot light up homes or power industries,"" he told the Opening Panel of Africa Day. ""We must ensure that Africa develops a balanced energy mix that will allow it to industrialize. Grid, mini-grid and off-grid systems will play a major role,"" Adesina reiterated. The event was attended by several African leaders, including Alpha Conde, President of Guinea and African Union Coordinator for Renewable Energy; Faure Gnassingbe, President of Togo; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia; and Seretse Khama Ian Khama, President of Botswana. The African Development Bank has committed itself to invest US $12 billion in support of accelerating electricity supply in Africa to fast-track universal access to electricity in the next 10 years. The Bank's investment is expected to leverage between US $45-50 billion from the private sector. Fulfilling Paris pledges Meanwhile, the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, set up by the African Union, is moving forward. The Independent Delivery Unit - hosted within the Bank - is fully operational. French President Francois Hollande welcomed the work of the Bank and announced that France will provide Euros2 billion over the next five years. France has already paid Euros6 million to support the Independent Delivery Unit. Germany has also committed to providing Euros2 million. The European Union has also pledged its support for the initiative. To maintain the momentum, Adesina also called for fulfillment of the full pledge of the G7 to provide US $10 billion to the initiative. ""The sooner this is made available, the faster we will all make progress in achieving the goal of universal access to electricity and acceleration of the growth of renewables in Africa's energy mix,"" he said. The Marrakech Conference ended with a call for ""a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development."" The Marrakech Proclamation adopted on November 17, 2016 stresses the need for the highest political commitment in the fight against climate change. ""We call for strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and underscore the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability,"" the document reads.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA191","Calif. Governor Brown Welcomes Australian and Mexican States to Under2 Climate Coalition","February 3, 2017 Friday","CaliforniaNewswire","SACRAMENTO, Calif. /California Newswire/ - This past week, Calif. Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. welcomed the states of Aguascalientes, Mexico and Victoria, Australia to the Under2 Coalition - the global pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. ""California will continue to join with leaders across the globe - including our partners in Mexico - to stop climate pollution,"" said Governor Brown. With the addition of today's signatories, the Under2 Coalition has now grown to 167 jurisdictions representing more than one billion people and $25.9 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy. Victoria is Australia's second most populous state, includes the city of Melbourne and covers nearly 90,000 square miles. Aguascalientes is located in north-central Mexico and is home to more than 1 million people. Aguascalientes Governor Martin Orozco Sandoval signed the pact during a meeting today with Governor Brown. The Under2 Coalition, the collective of governments who have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Later today, the state of Aguascalientes will also sign an agreement with the California Energy Commission to cooperate on clean energy programs and policies, including energy efficiency, renewable energy development and grid integration, low and zero-emission vehicles and clean energy technology. California's Leadership on Climate Change In September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations.

The first entry into force threshold of at least 55 parties officially joining the agreement was met in September. The second entry into force threshold of parties totaling at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions was met today after the E.U. and seven Member States submitted their instruments for ratification at the United Nations: ""Climate change represents a grave existential threat to life as we know it on Earth and we are seeing the effects of global climate change today. As those changes become more apparent each year and threaten more lives and communities around the world, it has become increasingly obvious that we cannot waste any more time. We need solutions. I am proud that the United States along with 63 other parties, including China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and now the European Union, have acted swiftly to bring the historic Paris Agreement, the world's most significant global cooperative effort to combat climate change, into force in less than a year's time from when the deal was reached last December at COP21. I will do all I can to ensure the United States fulfills its obligations and serves as an example to every nation of what is possible when we put our science, leadership, and ingenuity to work on behalf of humanity. When I was in Paris last year, the sense of urgency and optimism among the gathered stakeholders was incredible. Im therefore not surprised that the strong commitment to action in Paris has been sustained and acted upon. Leaders and citizens alike know how much is at stake, and I am hopeful even more countries will soon formally enter into the agreement. Now the hard work of implementing the Paris Agreement must begin in earnest, and COP22 in Marrakech signifies the first great opportunity for implementing the roadmap towards achieving its important goals. I am firmly committed to realizing the United States' commitment to the Paris Agreement, to advancing our cooperation with our global partners, and achieving a bright, safe, healthy, and clean energy future for Maryland, the United States, and the world over."" \"

Isabel Kreisler, Oxfam International\' s climate change policy expert said:  We\' re pleased to congratulate 72 countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement and brought it into force.  The Paris Agreement\' s credibility test starts today. Each and every country has pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, but our world is still on track to warm up to 3\'b0 Celsius more, much higher than the Agreement\' s stated goal of 1.5\'b0. Countries will need quickly and aggressively cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions further.  Oxfam estimates that only a fraction of the money that rich countries are spending on climate change is reaching the most vulnerable communities that desperately need it most. Figuring out how to close this gap and strengthen the resilience of these communities should be high on the list of priorities ahead of November\' s United Nations climate change conference in Morocco.

The initiative will also identify policies that provide win-win solutions for health and climate.The initiative was announced on Monday at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP22 ) taking place in Marrakech, Morocco.Researchers Dr Kris Murray at the Grantham Institute and Professor Paolo Vineis at Imperial's School of Public Health are contributing to the development of the Lancet Countdown.Dr Murray is working on developing indicators to track climate change impacts on health from infectious diseases, such as the changing distributions of mosquitos that carry dangerous infectious diseases like dengue. Professor Vineis is working to determine the effect of policies that aim to cut emissions and improve health, such as promoting healthy, sustainable diets, such as reducing high meat consumption in the developed world.With the aim of ensuring the case for action on health and climate change is more widely evidenced and understood, the Lancet Countdown is designed to inform decision-making and drive an accelerated policy response to climate change. It will complement other initiatives, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its achievements for climate science.linking Climate and healthProfessor Sir Brian Hoskins, an eminent expert in meteorology and climate change and chair of the Grantham Institute Climate Change and the Environment, at Imperial College London, said:""We know climate change will lead to a rise in average global temperatures over the twenty-first century.

The World Meteorological Organization released its analysis of the current global climate as a United Nations climate change conference opened in Marrakesh, Morocco on Tuesday. The report says global temperatures over the past five years were an average of 0.57 degrees Celsius higher than temperatures measured during the second half of the last century. It says 2015 was the hottest single year on record, with 2014 coming in second. The report says global sea surface temperatures also hit a new peak in 2015, and that Arctic sea ice, the ice sheet on Greenland and northern hemisphere snow cover are all in decline. One exception to the trend is sea ice around Antarctica, which was above average for much of the five-year period. The WMO says the warming trend is the result of man-made greenhouse gases, and has made extreme weather events more likely. Examples highlighted in the report include the 2010 to 2012 East African drought, which killed more than 250,000 people, 2015 heat waves in India and Pakistan that killed more than 4,000, and Typhoon Haiyan, which killed 7,800 people in the Philippines in 2013. \"

Organisations including CAFOD, the Overseas Development Institute, WWF and Christian Aid have said that as the number one source of fossil fuel emissions, more coal burning will only fuel poverty around the world. Instead, the group has said if nations are serious about alleviating poverty and improving the prosperity of the world's poor then expanding renewable energy is vital. Dr Alison Doig, Christian Aid's Principal Climate Advisor, said: ""The coal industry likes to claim it is 'God's gift' to the poor, when actually the opposite is true. Extreme poverty will only be eradicated if we effectively address climate change, the two are inseparable. But thankfully their solutions also converge. ""Expanding clean, home grown renewable energy to the world's poorest and most remote people will have a transformative effect and deliver sustainable poverty eradication - something coal cannot do."" The statement, based on findings set out in a report Beyond coal: scaling up clean energy to fight global poverty, will be discussed at a side event at the COP 22 climate summit in Marrakesh today (4.45pm, Pacific room in the observer area).

'No one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the United States who know climate change is happening, and who are determined to keep our commitments that were made in Paris,' Kerry said. Trump's Nov. 8 victory landed smack dab in the middle of the COP-22 summit, where government officials, business leaders, and experts from across the world held follow-on negotiations to the Paris deal. On the campaign trail, Trump openly called to cancel the climate change agreement, which would unravel one of the Obama administration  and Kerry's  most high-profile legacies. Though the deal boasts nearly 200 signatories, its future without U.S. leadership is in question[2]. Yet Trump has already rolled back other pledges he made as a candidate, conceding his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border could just be a 'partial fence[3]' and saying he would keep parts of Obamacare[4]. This trend could bode well for proponents of the climate change deal, who are worried Trump will stick to his campaign promise of abandoning the agreement. Had Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, a staunch supporter of the Paris agreement, beat Trump, Kerry's speech would have been more of a victory lap than a grave attempt to reassure nervous negotiators. But she did not. And so Kerry's ultimate message in Marrakech seemed to be directed at Trump. 'While I can't stand here and speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue,' Kerry said, ostensibly to those in Marrakech, and perhaps to one soon to be very powerful man back in New York, 'I will tell you this: In the time that I have spent in public life, one of the things I have learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you're actually in office compared to when you're on the campaign trail.' 'Make no mistake, government leadership is absolutely essential,' he said. 'We don't get a second chance. The consequences of failure would in most cases be irreversible,' Kerry added.

UNICEF says it will ask the countries attending the climate change conference to take ""four urgent steps"" to protect children from air pollution: Those steps are: 1. adopt measures to reduce pollution; 2. increase children's access to healthcare; 3. minimize children's exposure to pollution; and 4. establish better monitoring of air pollution. Lake said ""We protect our children when we protect the quality of our air. Both are central to our future."" \"

With over 12,000 participants, 200 kiosks, and 200 conferences, the conference hall was packed. The participants and speakers represented 36 countries including Morocco, China, and France. First launched in 1995, the annual event was organized by R\'e9seau Environment. ""This edition was a great success, with an increase in participation, but above all, an increased diversity of participants, through the integration of events parallel to the programming of AMERICANA,"" Jean Lacroix, CEO of R\'e9seau Environment, explained. ""The diversity of the protagonists and sectors represented a decompartmentalization and convergence of interests for joint action in favor of the environment."" The conference was predominantly francophone, though many of the conferences featured real-time English translation headsets. Each day there were three presentations of each topic. The first two days brought leaders of green municipalities and innovators into discussion with other municipality leaders who would like to make their cities more efficient and environmentally sustainable. One lecture, titled ""Circular economy, regional economic development and clean energy transition,"" featured Jacky Aignel, the mayor of Le Men\'e9, France. Le Men\'e9 is a 100 per cent RES (Renewable Energy Sources) city focused on implementing an exclusively renewable energy strategy. He explained how his city transitioned to green power. Le Men\'e9 isn't the only green-minded city in France. Jacques Saint-Marc, the former secretary general of the Interministerial group for mobility and electric vehicles in France, explained in his talk, ""Innovating - easier than it looks: solutions for creative cities and businesses,"" how France is mitigating the effects of climate change through their implementation of rentable electric vehicles (EVs). The EVs are designed to complement the transportation system of trains and bikes that were already in place. The government of France has offered subsidies to companies willing to install this technology. One firm-the Bollor\'e9 Group-has taken advantage of the offer and plans to install 16,000 charging stations across the country. One of the participants of the conference, Jonathan Arnold, representing Canada's Ecofiscal Commission, explained that he enjoyed the conference, but found it difficult to network effectively due to its size. The Ecofiscal Commission is a think-tank that creates policy reports and advises politicians on how their plans could be implemented. His interests lie specifically in water and waste management. Arnold came prepared and had already emailed groups and individuals in his field to let them know that he was coming so that they could meet. The most interesting, if not terrifying, fact he learned at the conference was that if there was an oil spill tomorrow in Montr\'e9al, there would only be enough water reserves for up to 16 hours. The last panel was titled, ""From COP22 to driving forces: the role of the young generation in sustainable development implementation."" Its speakers included Nicolas Eyssallenne, representing the Canadian delegation of young business professionals at the COP22 conference in Marrakech: Cap DD, and Marie-Chantal Vincent representing \'c9cosyst\'e9mie. The lecture highlighted their experiences in Marrakech, the opportunity for young professionals to join them next year, the new technologies being developed by youth, and the other opportunities for youth to get involved in the green revolution. \"

Aware of their vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change, countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have begun taking action to confront the phenomenon and today, several highlighted their initiatives at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/2860.php UNFCCC ) in Marrakech, Morocco, known as \~ HYPERLINK http://newsroom.unfccc.int/cop22marrakechinformationhub/ COP 22 . Agriculture in the HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/mena MENA region is especially vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation. As global temperatures rise, they will rise even faster in MENA, causing more frequent and severe droughts. The 2015 drought in Morocco destroyed more than half the wheat harvest and led to a 1.5 per cent drop in the country s Gross Domestic Output.

He added that his country is focusing especially on water management, making sure we are using water in a sustainable manner, and on the protection of coastal zones. Tunisia has announced a 41 per cent emission reduction by 2030. Most importantly, 13 per cent will be based on national efforts, while the rest will come from support provided by the international community. Country Flags outside the UN COP22 venue in Marrakech, Morocco. Photo: UNFCCC A week after COP 22 concludes, Tunisia will host an international investment conference (29-30 November) to mobilize 2.4 billion dollars, 40 per cent of which will be allocated to projects pertaining to the green economy, with a focus on renewable energy. In Morocco, to meet the country s commitments on climate action, the Bank Al Maghrib (Central Bank of Morocco) recently unveiled the road map of the Moroccan financial sector in climate financing. The country has also taken steps to adapt its agriculture, with better water management and more climate-resistant crops, while also lowering its emissions by eliminating most energy subsidies and with the construction of the large solar plant in Ouarzazate, World Bank senior official Hafez Ghanem noted. This is the kind of comprehensive climate action we will support across the region, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, he added. The World Bank Group announced on November 15 a HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/11/15/a-new-plan-to-support-action-on-climate-change-in-the-arab-world new plan to ramp up support for countries in the MENA region by nearly doubling the portion of Bank financing dedicated to climate action, taking it to around 1.5 billion dollars per year by 2020. The plan focuses on four priorities: food and water security; sustainable cities adapted to new climate conditions; the transition to low-carbon energy; and the protection of the poorest that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA204","Intersolar Europe 2017: New Technologies and Efficiency Concepts in PV Production Technologies","February 14, 2017 Tuesday 4:34 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Intersolar Europe issued the following news release: The investment trend in the photovoltaics industry (PV industry) is carrying through into 2017: Numerous PV manufacturers are set to build new production facilities or retrofit existing capacity this year. Innovative technologies are increasing the efficiency of solar cells, and at the same time, reducing manufacturing costs. Intersolar Europe, the world's leading exhibition for the solar industry and its partners, will focus on the latest developments in PV production technologies from May 31 until June 2, 2017 in Munich. Alongside the exhibition, the Intersolar Europe Conference and accompanying workshops, which are taking place in parallel, will be discussing the innovations and new concepts in the industry. The photovoltaics industry looks set for dynamic development in 2017. Production technology companies are responding by investing heavily in new facilities for cell and module production or upgrades to existing manufacturing lines. According to the industry information service PV-Tech, companies in China and India alone have announced plans to expand production by 17 gigawatts (GW) each in 2017. The USA, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Iran are also building new production facilities, and the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) reports that the order books of German manufacturers of facilities, components and machines are as full as ever. The main focus is on technologies for more efficient solar cells, such as PERC cells (passivated emitter rear contact) and PERT cells (passivated emitter, rear totally diffused), as well as heterojunction technology. Furthermore, new manufacturing and automation systems are expected to reduce operating and material costs and ensure an increase in productivity, and thereby more competitive prices. New technologies for greater efficiency Innovative processes for manufacturing highly-efficient cells hold considerable promise: Both PERC cells, which increase the passivation on the rear side of solar cells, and PERT cells increase efficiency, thereby reducing the module costs per KW of output. As a result, manufacturing facilities for such efficient modules are in demand and offer a significant competitive advantage - not only for plant constructors, but also for PV manufacturers who, on these grounds, are retrofitting existing manufacturing lines with new technologies in addition to constructing new facilities. Heterojunction technology is also expected to set new records for efficiency. This cell concept combines crystalline and amorphous solar technology to achieve extremely high efficiency levels. Suppliers of production facilities for double-sided (bifacial) solar cells and modules anticipate a 30% higher yield compared with the yields achieved by the cells available up till now. The industry expects to see progress not only from new cell concepts, optimized contacts and improved module concepts, but also from higher quality silicon wafers. Intersolar Europe Conference: the future of crystalline silicon technology Falling module prices put pressure on plant constructors to boost efficiency in manufacturing as well. Here, the industry is searching for approaches which save costs and materials, and uncovering new potential for savings, for example by automating processes. Experts will be discussing the availability of options in this area, as well as locating further potential opportunities for growth and scope for greater efficiency at the Intersolar Europe Conference, which takes place in parallel to the exhibition. More than 30 sessions will address the future of the photovoltaics industry: Attendees can find out more about technical achievements and new challenges for module production, receive new impetus for investment and gain insights into the global PV markets, bring themselves up to speed on solar cell manufacturing with crystalline silicon, or discuss the implementation of the climate targets set at the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21). The VDMA will be presenting the results of the 8th International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics at Intersolar Europe. Interested attendees can find out more about the technological trends in crystalline silicon photovoltaics, and have the opportunity to discuss potential improvements and standards with research institutes, suppliers and users at the event.

Download the iRain app to find out","January 13, 2017 Friday","US Official News","Berkeley: University of California has issued the following news release: Climate researchers and weather forecasters get their rain data from a network of precipitation-sensing satellites that orbit Earth. iRain, a new mobile phone app developed by engineers at the University of California, Irvine puts the same precision rainfall information into the pockets of the public. The free app, available for iPhone and Android devices, provides timely satellite rain data via UC Irvine's globally recognized weather tracking and analysis system. iRain also allows users to enter their own rain or snowfall observations \- heavy, moderate, light, none \- to join a globe-spanning cadre of citizen hydrologists.  The beauty of iRain is that it\' s an access point for an entire system that detects, tracks, and studies precipitation on our planet, says lead developer Phu Nguyen, assistant adjunct professor of civil & environmental engineering.  We process the data from satellites and offer it to the end user, free of charge. As far as I know, we\' re the only institution offering such a device.  The beauty of iRain is that it\' s an access point for an entire system that detects, tracks, and studies precipitation on our planet, says lead developer Phu Nguyen, assistant adjunct professor of civil & environmental engineering. Credit: Brian Bell/UC Irvine Features of the mobile app include a tool that displays the top 50 current extreme weather events around the world, animations that show varying levels of rainfall intensity and movement, a function to choose different time spans, and a tool to zoom in to a local area. Many of the functions of the app are also available through a website, which is useful for researchers who often need to generate and download reports. UC Irvine uses data from U.S., European, and Japanese satellites in collaboration with agencies such as NASA and NOAA to produce rainfall information now being accessed by people in more than 180 countries.  The power of iRain is that it brings state-of-the-art rainfall estimation based on actual observations to anyone, anyplace in the world at any time, says Robert Pietrowsky, director of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Institute for Water Resources, who helped launch the app at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November. iRain is part of UC Irvine\' s PERSIANN project, the culmination of decades of research and development by scientists and engineers in Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing. Nearly 20 years ago, Kuo-lin Hsu, professor of civil and environmental engineering, created an algorithm for the retrieval of rainfall data from satellite images. His algorithm is based on technologies that enable rainfall estimations to grow in precision and reliability over time based on the accumulation of data. Hsu says one of the key challenges for his developers over the years has been to reduce the wait time between retrieval of data, processing, and distribution through government servers. With the launch of iRain, UC Irvine demonstrates that it\' s possible to compress that down to about an hour.  The meteorological agency in the African nation of Namibia is using our data, and we\' re seeing it used in China, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian nations that have a serious stake in flood monitoring, says Hsu.  Support from UNESCO has enabled us to dramatically expand the number of users for the data around the world. Now people don\' t need resources to launch their own weather satellite, they just need an Internet connection to receive real-time data.  We had a vision on how we could use satellites to come up with estimates of rainfall that would have applications for flood forecasting and other purposes, says CHRS director Soroosh Sorooshian, Distinguished Professor of civil and environmental engineering.  At a meeting in Italy years ago, I presented the concept of introducing machine learning tools such as artificial neural networks to address the problem. There were many skeptics in that audience, but here we are today; people around the world are benefiting from our efforts.

But they tried to remain positive. 'It's clear that Donald Trump[3] is about to be one of the most powerful people in the world, but even he does not have the power to amend and change the laws of physics, to stop the impacts of climate change,' said\~Alden Meyer[4], director of strategy and policy at the Union for Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in the U.S., at a press conference held shortly after the election was called[5]\~early Wednesday. 'He has to acknowledge the reality of climate change, he has a responsibility as president-elect now.' The U.S. presidential election results came as a surprise to many who on Tuesday thought Hillary Clinton[6]\~would be elected and plans to continue the Obama administration's work on climate change would make press conferences a relative non-event. But Trump's name is on everyone's lips as many wonder where America will stand in future negotiations. Some groups have not been as diplomatic. 'The election of Trump is a disaster for our continent,' Geoffrey Kamese, a senior program officer for the group Friends of the Earth Africa, said in a statement. 'The United States, if it follows through on its new president's rash words about withdrawing from the international climate regime, will become a pariah state in global efforts for climate action.' The U.S. delegation had previously planned to cut greenhouse gas emissions[7] from the amount released in 2005, by between 26 and 28 percent by 2025. The prospect of a presidency helmed by Trump, who has said that\~climate change is a hoax[8] perpetrated by the Chinese, throws that into question. He has threatened to ignore those pledges and leave the Paris deal[9], end all funding[10] on the issue, appoint climate deniers to lead major government agencies and roll back President Barack Obama's sweeping environmental legacy.\~His election won't help the fight[11] against climate change. The previous climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, failed to meaningfully address climate change because the United States backed out, a move that set back climate change progress two decades. But climate advocates tried to spin the fallout from Trump's election positively, arguing that other nations aren't likely to wait for the U.S.  the world's second largest polluter  to take action. 'Other major countries in this process will continue to go ahead with the climate commitments that they have made under Paris, not because they're trying to please the United States, but because it's in their own self interest to protect their people from the impacts of climate change,' Meyer said. However, he continued to note inaction on behalf of America could certainly impact other international negotiations. Katherine Egland, chairman of environmental and climate justice for the NAACP, stressed that for the Paris Agreement to succeed, 'no one country can be perceived as not doing its fair share.' 'We remain a nation of honor  our word is our bond,' she said. 'We have signed a binding agreement along with scores of other countries and we will demand that agreement be honored.' Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, senior director of international climate cooperation for the World Wildlife Fund, said despite the outcome, 'the momentum for climate action has never been greater.' 'At this point, given the progress that we have seen, we are confident that the nations of the world will keep focusing on the work that needs to go ahead,' she said at a press conference. 'With the momentum that we have behind us we need to remain confident that the arc of climate justice will bend towards solutions.'This article originally appeared on The Huffington Post HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change_us_58230c75e4b0aac6248872c3 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change_us_58230c75e4b0aac6248872c3 [ 1]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wins_us_5822958ee4b0e80b02cdcbda?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wins_us_5822958ee4b0e80b02cdcbda?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cop22-climate-change-morocco_us_581f0a8fe4b0e80b02ca9a32?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ HYPERLINK cop22 -climate-change-morocco_us_581f0a8fe4b0e80b02ca9a32?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/alden-meyer.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/alden-meyer.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/results/president?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/results/president?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/12/11/what-is-the-u-s-commitment-in-paris/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/12/11/what-is-the-u-s-commitment-in-paris/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/09/trump-global-warming-hoax?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 9]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change-paris_us_573ca22ee4b0ef86171ce812?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change-paris_us_573ca22ee4b0ef86171ce812?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 10]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change-policy_us_581f57bde4b0e80b02caa351?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change-policy_us_581f57bde4b0e80b02caa351?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 11]: \~ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change_us_5822b97fe4b0aac624883f9d?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-climate-change_us_5822b97fe4b0aac624883f9d?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA211","FICCI Discusses Scope of India-Africa Cooperation to Achieve Energy & Climate Goals at COP 22","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 11:52 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry issued the following news release: FICCI in collaboration with TERI organized a Side Event on ""Scope of India-Africa Cooperation to Achieve Energy & Climate Goals"" at the COP 22 Africa Pavilion on 14 November. The side event explored synergies between India and Africa on decentralized renewable energy solutions and discussed how Indian and African private sector could collaborate to propel Africa's climate smart growth. Both India and Africa face the daunting task of defining right to power and ensuring energy access. India and Africa have huge potential of collaboration to address the challenge of economic and energy poverty through decentralized and off-grid energy clean energy solutions. It was highlighted how adoption of clean energy in Africa is hampered not by the absence of right policies but by the dearth of innovation systems. Both India and Africa need market driven distributed architecture for clean energy production and consumption. It is important to make off-grid renewable energy solutions more affordable through economies of scale - as has been shown by the Indian example of massive uptake of LEDs and low-cost solar power from solar parks. There is huge scope for innovative business models in agro-forestry, waste management, solar pumps in the region. It is important to learn from successful models of financial inclusion such as m-pesa and m-kopa. The FICCI Side Event, most importantly, highlighted that India-Africa partnership must be based on domestication of technology. India and Africa can explore collaborative partnerships in three areas for upscaling off-grid clean energy - first, in development and adoption of standard for off-grid products/systems; second, in skilling; and third, in building innovation, both in terms of technology and business models.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA213","Magdy Mart\\xEDnez-Solim\\xE1n: Remarks at the COP22 event on Gender Equality in tracking progress of the Paris Agreement and SDG on Climate Action","November 19, 2016 Saturday","US Official News","New York City: United Nations Development Programme has issued the following news release Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here at COP22 , and to participate in this discussion on the importance of gender equality in tracking progress of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goal on climate action. I believe we are all in agreement that gender equality is central to successful climate action and gender inequality an obstacle to successful and sustainable development. While the impacts of climate change threaten everyone, we know that climate change is not gender neutral. Gender differences determine both the scale and severity of its impacts. While it threatens livelihoods and security across the board, women and girls commonly face higher risks and greater burdens, particularly when they are living in poverty. The unequal participation of women in decision-making and access to resources and information compound inequalities and often prevent them from fully contributing to climate-related planning, policy-making and implementation. Yet, the evidence is clear that their participation in community representation is central to delivering both successful climate action and sustainable development. This is why a critical aspect of UNDP\' s efforts to address climate change is to ensure that policies and programmes at all levels promote the participation of women and guarantee that benefits are equally distributed across society. UNDP is supporting the integration of gender issues into the National Communications and Biennial Update Reports, in which countries provide regular information and status updates on their progress towards implementation of the UNFCCC. Not only does the Convention encourage countries to integrate gender considerations into specific areas of work, including in these National Communications; but incorporating gender aspects into national systems for monitoring and reporting also contributes to increased transparency, improved planning, enhanced effectiveness and better results. In this regard, UNDP has developed a gender-responsive tracking tool for national climate action and sustainable development, which helps national governments integrate gender into their climate action planning and policy-making and ensures the participation of women at all levels. This Gender-Responsive National Communications Tool Kit provides step-by-step guidance on how to integrate gender into the development of National Communications \- from the preparation stage to stocktaking and analysing national circumstances, workshops to initiate communication processes, and reporting on constraints, gaps and needs that ought to be addressed in future planning. UNDP launched the toolkit in English last year. This year, to expand its use worldwide, the toolkit was translated into French and Spanish, with the support of the Governments of Belgium and Uruguay. The toolkit is already contributing to the integration of gender into planning on climate change. The Government of Albania, for example, used it to develop guidelines for mainstreaming gender into climate change adaptation and mitigation programmes and plans. The guidelines, which will support future planning and programming, have already been cited in the country\' s Third National Communication as a good practice to be applied. Gender is also included in India\' s second National Communication, which highlights that gender equality organizations were among the stakeholders that were included in the more than 30 consultations, meetings and trainings conducted during the development of its second National Communication. Taking stock of men\' s and women\' s different knowledge, skills and needs in tracking progress on national climate action illuminates the situations of men and women in key climate sectors --how men and women are involved in managing their environment, including what they know and how they participate in decision-making. This information helps to clarify the overall picture of the effects of climate change on different countries and groups of citizens. For instance, for its second National Communication, Malawi comprehensively assessed gender issues and roles related to climate change. Throughout Malawi\' s National Communication, there are references to men and women\' s activities, needs and potential to contribute information to government. For example, emphasizing the disproportional effects of climate change on women, the report includes information on how women are more vulnerable during drought periods as the primary collectors of water for household use.The report also notes the involvement of the Ministry responsible for gender and children and highlights the contributions of key social and environmental NGOs. Ladies and gentlemen, the National Communications and Biennial Update Reports will become the backbone of national and international climate strategies. Gender-responsive considerations make sustainable development and climate policies simply better for all, for those more often left behind. Thank you.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA214","QANDA WITH KATHARINE MACH: HOW CAN THE WORLD MANAGE A HISTORIC CLIMATE AGREEMENT?","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by Stanford University: By Rob Jordan Last week, the Paris Agreement, a global climate pact 23 years in the making, officially put into force unprecedented requirements for reducing emissions that fuel global climate change. Stanford climate scientist Katharine Mach, who was involved with the Paris Agreement, describes the challenges facing the signatory nations now meeting in Morocco. (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) Now, representatives of 196 countries are in Marrakesh, Morocco, through Nov. 18 to hash out details of managing the pact and ensuring all signatories meet the goals they committed to, not only cutting carbon output but also financing adaptation in developing countries and other objectives (Paris Agreement highlights). Stanford climate scientist Katharine Mach, who helped inform some of the decisions that went into the Paris Agreement, talked with Stanford Report about opportunities and obstacles for the Marrakesh meeting, formally known as the 22nd gathering of the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. She joins Chris Field, the Perry L. McCarty Director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, as one of Stanford's two official delegates to COP22 . They and other Stanford experts have pioneered research needed to recognize and meet the challenge of climate change since the issue came to light more than 20 years ago. Some of the topics that country representatives will discuss at COP22 were previewed recently by Laurence Tubiana, the chief architect of the Paris talks (video) at the first of a series of science and policy conversations hosted by the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. Tubiana outlined some of the goals for the Marrakesh meeting: setting requirements for independent data evaluation, making financial institutions accountable for green energy investment strategies and clarifying how to deal with climate change-related loss and damages. How can countries most effectively turn from negotiating a climate agreement to managing one and ensuring everyone honors their commitments? The timeline for the Paris Agreement has been remarkable. It went into force with lightning speed. As a result, COP22 is even more about real action. The talks and the next few years need to build from country pledges currently on the table. Countries can focus on making climate responses a major societal and business opportunity, aligning climate with other priorities. What are the biggest opportunities and risks or obstacles to making progress on the Paris Agreement? How will they be addressed at COP22 ? In terms of country pledges, the Paris Agreement is a floor, not a ceiling. Current country plans are not ambitious enough to rein in the worst climate risks. At COP22 and in the next few years to come, the core opportunity is finding ways to accelerate action and intensify ambition. The Paris Agreement provides a new foundation for efforts and leadership that span global and local scales, governments, businesses and communities. That's because, for the first time ever, we have a universal climate treaty, and it embraces action by national governments and beyond. The Paris Agreement may not be enough to avoid a dangerous threshold an increase of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. What will be on the table in Morocco for making up the difference? The current country pledges were in many cases conservative by design. The real questions moving forward are: How fast can we transform what's possible? How fast can we envision ways to align climate responses with development priorities? How fast can we enable markets to unleash new approaches to energy? Why is it important to get developing countries on the path to clean technology and climate change adaptation? What will COP22 do to advance that goal? For countries facing imperatives around development, energy access and poverty eradication, the core questions are about fitting climate responses into the bigger picture of national priorities. Preparing for climate risks can tap synergies in improving human health and well-being, food and water security, and resilient infrastructure. For example, climate shocks affecting crop yields and livelihoods can trap people in poverty. Building resilience to these shocks helps societies now and into the future. In some cases, expanding energy access can happen more easily through new energy paradigms, for instance where renewables outcompete fossil fuels in bringing electricity to rural areas. COP22 will involve many discussions around fairness and finance, for example managing the consequences for nations that contributed little to the climate problem but bear its impacts. Overall, the goal is ensuring all countries can move towards the sustainable futures they desire. Beyond COP22 The global community, including business enterprises and governments across scales, has compelling opportunities for gearing investments towards the energy systems of the 21st century, rather than clinging to technologies of the past. Leadership in diverse forms will be essential. Similarly important is recognizing that climate change responses can be a way to build a better world, bolstering economies and communities while protecting people and the planet. Mach is a senior research scientist in the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences; a visiting investigator at the Carnegie Institution for Science; and director of the Stanford Environment Assessment Facility at the Stanford Woods Institute. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA215","Time to Deliver: Paris Climate Deal Offers Hope but New Governance is Needed to Make it Work","October 14, 2016 Friday 4:31 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Committee of the Regions issued of news release: Following EU-bloc ratification, the Paris agreement is to enter into force a few weeks ahead of the COP22 in Marrakesh. It is now time for action, say European cities and regions. The COP22 At the Marrakech Climate Change Conference (7-18 November 2016), the international community has to make a new multi-level governance operational, setting up target assessment mechanisms and developing tailored climate finance services to move action. CoP22 will focus on enhancing ambition and promoting implementation. Marrakech also marks a turning point because the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the conference, setting out a global action plan to keep the temperature rise well below 2degreeC compared to 1990 levels. ""The Paris Agreement is a considerable achievement. However, current pledges will not be sufficient to reach the agreed overall goals. We now need to implement the agreement within our respective constituencies. Further assessment and support mechanisms are to be developed to make sure all countries abide by the commitments they made in Paris. The COP22 will have to make these newly created mechanisms operational. To reach the Paris objectives we also reiterate our call for EU greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 50% by 2030 "" said Francesco Pigliaru (IT/PES), President of Sardinia and rapporteur of the opinion "" Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakesh "". Francesco Pigliaru, chair of the Commission for the Environment, Climate Change and Energy of the CoR added "" In coordination with the European Parliament, we are the voice of European citizens at COP22 . Citizens expect a strong European leadership in tackling global warming and we should all make sure not to disappoint them"". Markku Markkula , President of the CoR declared: "" A new climate governance that ensures a permanent dialogue between cities and regions, national governments and UN bodies is necessary if we are to succeed in reversing global warming trends. Access to information, training and support is also essential to enable local and regional authorities to fully exploit the public and private financial opportunities available in the transition towards a low-carbon, sustainable world "" The European Committee of the Regions and ARLEM - the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly - will have a solid presence at the COP22 , organising a series of events to ensure cities and regions pledges are heard. Background: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entered into force in 1994, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The Conference of the Parties (COP) was designated as the supreme governing body of the Convention. To date, 195 countries have submitted their instruments of ratification. These countries meet once a year, during two weeks, in order to evaluate the application of the Convention and develop the negotiation process between the Parties in front of new commitments.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA216","Lebanon's Many Environmental Issues Are Back in the Spotlight With Greenpeace Visit","September 1, 2016 Thursday 1:13 PM EST","Global Voices","Sep 01, 2016( Global Voices: HYPERLINK http://globalvoicesonline.org http://globalvoicesonline.org Lebanon has faced an energy crisis[4]\~since the end of the civil war in 1990. To this day, Lebanon is plagued with daily power outages that can last up to 18 hours depending on the region, forcing most\~Lebanese to make use of private diesel-powered generators. Successive governments have so far been\~unable to bridge the gap between the 1,800 MW produced and the 3,000 MW consumed[5] at peak times, with current power plants obsolete, polluting and in dire need of refurbishing. 'The latest power plants in Lebanon were built in 1996 in Deir Ammar and Zahrani, each with a 450 MW capacity', far below the energy requirements, the Lebanese newspaper The Daily Star reported[6]. As one former senior official of the state-owned Electricite du Liban told[7]\~The Daily Star: If we don't build more power plants then we will continue to live under harsh cuts every day. The solution is not in our hands but in the hands of the government. Furthermore, the prospect of offshore oil and gas drilling[8]  currently being discussed as\~a potential solution to\~the country's\~current\~energy crisis  sheds light on another issue. Although enticing, oil and gas extraction cannot, by definition,\~provide a sustainable solution on any level. And with Lebanon's notorious levels of corruption[9], these energy resources may well\~end-up being a curse for local communities. In the words[10] of Peter Willcox, captain of the Rainbow Warrior III: It is time for people here to embrace what shines in the sky 300 days a year, not what's tapped from the ground. It is not just about building a sustainable renewable energy future for the region, it's about tipping the balance away from fossil fuels for the health of the planet while self-empowering local communities. Of course, the Rainbow Warrior III could not but remind the country as well of its ongoing year-old waste management crisis, largely credited for launching the 'You Stink' movement[11] in the summer of 2015, which saw tens of thousands marching in the streets against the government.\~The crew of the\~ship sorts\~their\~waste, placing every different waste category in its proper bin, and the idea is to\~recycle it in the country where it is docked. Notably, Greenpeace opted against recycling any of the waste it produced while in Beirut, instead deciding to keep the waste on board and recycle it at the boat's next destination, Turkey. The Lebanese government has so far been incapable of finding a sustainable solution to\~this issue as well, with even temporary propositions[12]  landfills in the Bourj Hammoud and Costa Brava areas  facing obstacles[13] in implementation by locals, while civil society's proposed integrated waste management plans were shunned and put aside. With waste\~back on the streets[14]\~in the past few days and the political deadlock currently on hand, Lebanon seems to be nowhere near a solution for the crisis. Greenpeace is also supporting\~a\~women-run 'cooperative for agricultural production and manufacturing' located in southern Lebanon. The organization\~trained 12 young men, Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians, to build solar panels in order to meet the energy demands in regions that can sometimes have up to 22 hours of electricity shortages. One member of the cooperative, Daad, explained the importance of solar panels for her region: We are forced to work manually while our electrical machines are not being used. If we had electricity round the clock, we would have a greater production. Our work would greatly benefit the women working here as well as the growth of the cooperative.Play Video[15] The cooperative\~launched an online fundraiser[16] with the hope of raising $8,000 in the next two months. They explain on the site how the money will be used: The solarization of the women cooperative center will start with an energy audit that will identify its energy consumption. Then, a set of energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption such as lighting retrofit and piping insulation will be implemented. Finally, a solar energy system will be installed on the roof of the Cooperative. The Rainbow Warrior III[17] is the first ship of Greenpeace's fleet specifically built for the organization. It started operating in October 2011 after the second Rainbow Warrior retired. The latter in turn replaced the original Rainbow Warrior after it was bombed in 1985[18]\~by French agents off the coast of New Zealand. The ship is scheduled to end up in Morocco in time for the UN's COP 22 [19]\~on November 14-15, 2016.\~Unlike previous UN\~Conferences of Parties, the COP 22 will be\~the first COP[20] since the 'legally binding global climate target was agreed [at COP 21] by all 196 member parties with the aim of capping climate change well below two degrees of warming'.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA217","The Essential Business of Climate Change","February 14, 2017 Tuesday 1:49 PM EST","3BL Blogs","Feb 14, 2017( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com Sustainability is increasingly important for multinational corporations with both investors and customers demanding greater transparency, action and accountability. As the dust from the U.S. election settles and our nation's position as a leader on energy and climate change reform becomes uncertain, it's imperative that businesses take the lead. For one, we have a commitment to other nations as part of a multilateral framework to reduce emissions and increase responsibility. That much was agreed upon in last year's Paris Climate Change Conference negotiations. It was further cemented during last month's continued discussions in\~Marrakech at COP22 [2], where the governing body of the Paris Climate Agreement met for the first time and actively began the process of implementing policy change ahead of the 2020 timeline. There is clear momentum suggesting climate change is a global challenge that will impact business, and therefore must become integral to all future business considerations. Swimming with this current of change makes good sense as stakeholders worldwide are advancing toward the goals set in the\~Paris Climate Agreement[3], irrespective of how new U.S. leadership sets policy on climate. The prevailing opinion indicates much of the progress made will be relaxed. If our businesses follow suit, however, and are no longer consistent with robust international environmental requirements, they risk being passed over by companies that will look to non-U.S. suppliers for their climate leadership. At HPE, we have a host of global customers requiring high environmental standards of their suppliers, and it is essential to our relationships that we remain aligned with their priorities. We know what is right for people and the planet is also right for business, and will continue to maintain our leadership position in the business community to drive efforts in support of a low-carbon economy. A large portion of this approach includes our move toward renewables. By 2025, we pledge to operate under a 100 percent renewable energy strategy, with 50 percent of our energy coming from renewable sources. It's not only a smart business decision, but also a commitment to set a course for a better collective future.\~ When I began my work at HPE as Chief Sustainability Officer, I knew there would be challenges to advancing a sustainability agenda in the U.S. This has never been more apparent, though I do see it as an opportunity for HPE to become an even greater industry leader. I urge other businesses to join the conversation and send a clear message to state and federal officials. Support the hundreds of businesses that have pledged their commitment to\~Low-Carbon USA[4], and seize the occasion to leverage resource constraints as a driver of reinvigorated economic progress, job creation and renewed infrastructure models in the U.S. The progress shown by leaders around the world is encouraging, and the demand the market is placing on companies to implement sustainable business practices signals a step in the right direction. The time is now for U.S. businesses to step up or be passed over we must rally industry leaders around the world. As we head into the New Year, responsive and responsible leadership is crucial. I am heartened this is the theme of the World Economic Forum's\~Annual Meeting in Davos[5]\~in January; 2017 must catalyze global action around this common challenge. Let us take the prompt of our changing landscape to reboot collective actions that shape a better future for all.Tweet me: #38; KEYWORDS: Environment ...imate Change, Business ...ade, Lara Birkes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise-HPE http://3blmedia.com/Profiles/Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise-HPE [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/fr http:// cop22 HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/fr .ma/fr / [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.lowcarbonusa.org http://www.lowcarbonusa.org HYPERLINK http://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017 http://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2017 \"

The King noted that Morocco's commitment began in 1992 -- when, as Crown Prince, he headed his country's delegation to the Rio Earth Summit -- and continues today: ""Morocco, which was among the first countries to announce their intended Nationally Determined Contributions, has pledged recently to reduce the rate of emissions. In addition, it has taken concrete steps to ensure that 52% of the national energy supply comes from clean sources by the year 2030. By the same token, we have proposed a set of initiatives as part of implementing the Paris Agreement, especially with respect to adaptation and financing. These include the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture."" ""Holding this conference in Africa,"" he said, ""is an incentive for us to give priority to tackling the adverse repercussions of climate change, which are growing worse and worse in the countries of the South and in insular states whose very existence is in jeopardy."" ""The environmental issue is a critical problem which must be tackled in the most serious and responsible way,"" he told the assembled world leaders. He continued, ""What is at stake is the very existence of man. It is therefore our joint duty to work hand in hand to protect him. Accordingly, countries must not be pressed from the start into accepting decisions they will be unable to comply with. This is not to say that they reject them. It only means that they do not have the necessary means to implement them."" The King urged ""all parties to work on translating our commitment to the values of justice and solidarity into actions, by: -- Providing the countries of the South, especially the least developed, as as will enhance their capacities and enable them to adapt to climate change; -- Advanced countries honoring their commitments and mobilizing 100 billion -- All the parties being involved in facilitating the transfer of technology, and working for the development of research and innovation -- Non-Governmental players, including companies, local communities, NGOs from civil society, giving strong impetus to the Global Climate Action Agenda."" ""The time has come to redress the situation,"" the King concluded. ""We have no alternative but to work to make up for lost time, through continued, comprehensive mobilization and positive harmonization, so that the coming generations may lead an enjoyable and dignified life together."" At a press conference earlier this week, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed his gratitude to King Mohammed VI for convening the Marrakesh conference -- and for Morocco's ongoing leadership. ""I am grateful for His Majesty convening this very important COP meeting, immediately after the Paris Agreement,"" he said. "". . . Morocco is a very important country, Member State of the United Nations, not only on the African continent or in the Middle East but as a whole, providing many young men and women to keep peace and security around the world. And Morocco has been showing a great example based on democratic institutions, making sustainable development and championing climate change actions. Now I sincerely hope that here in Marrakech, we will set another very important commitment, a passionate commitment, to make this world better for all -- and I count on His Majesty's continuing leadership and guidance on this matter.""

Trump made the comment during an interview on Fox News Sunday during which he was asked where he stood on the environment. ""I'm still open-minded. Nobody really knows. Look, I'm somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. It's not something that's so hard and fast,"" Trump said. In the past, Trump has said be believes climate change is a ""hoax"" created by China to undermine U.S. business interests. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,"" Trump tweeted in 2012. The majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is a real problem and that humans are contributing to global warming. Trump said he is ""studying"" the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference Paris agreement to determine whether the United States should withdraw from the accord. ""Now, Paris, I'm studying. I do say this. I don't want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries,"" Trump said. ""And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I don't want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us."" Last week, Trump named Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as his choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency during his administration. Pruitt has denied the existence of climate change and is currently suing the EPA. Trump said Pruitt will help loosen regulations to encourage businesses to invest in the United States. The president-elect has also met with former Vice President to discuss climate change. Gore said he found the meeting with Trump to be productive and interesting. \"

The European Committee of the Regions and ARLEM - the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly - will have a solid presence at the COP22 , organising a series of events to ensure cities and regions' pledges are heeded during the 22nd Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). COP22 will take place in Marrakesh 7-18 November 2016. The CoR delegation in Marrakesh will be led by its President Markku Markkula and Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia, Chair of CoR's Commission for the Environment, Climate Change and Energy (ENVE) and rapporteur of the draft opinion ""Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakesh"" to be adopted Wednesday 12 October. The European Committee of the Regions is part of the EU Delegation. The CoR is partnering with the European Commission, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Global Fund for Cities Development (FMDV) and ICLEI, the international network of Local Governments for Sustainability. ARLEM will hold its 2nd commission meeting for Sustainable Territorial Development to discuss a report on energy and climate in the Mediterranean region by Mohamed Sadiki, Mayor of Rabat. ARLEM is co-chaired by Markku Markkula and Hani Abdelmasih Al Hayek, Mayor of Beit Sahour in Palestine. This is the list of events co-organised by the CoR in Marrakesh: Monday 14 November 2016 | Palais des Congrcs, Marrakesh - Summit of Local and Regional Leaders for Climate (09:00 - 20:00) - Side-event of the Summit: Conference: The Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy: the global network (14:30 - 17:00) - Tuesday 15 November 2016 | COP22 , Bab Ighli, Marrakesh - 2nd meeting of the Commission for Sustainable Territorial Development of the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly (ARLEM) ( COP22 Civil society pavilion, 09:00 - 11:30) - Conference: Partnership for sustainable energy and climate change policy in the Euro-Mediterranean area ( COP22 Civil society pavilion, 12:00 - 13:30) - Side event: The contribution of cities and regions to COP22 negotiations - for an inclusive climate governance (Blue zone, European Pavilion, 16:00 - 17:30) After Paris, much is at stake: the ratification of the actual agreement - starting with the EU and its Member States, the persistent gap between objectives and commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the setting of a new multi-level climate global governance which fully integrates cities and regions, the inclusion of their cuts in greenhouse gas emissions into National Determined Contributions (NDC) and the development of financial means to allow the Paris agreement to be more than just words. Only four EU member states have ratified the Paris agreement so far: France, Hungary, Austria and Slovakia, which ratified the deal last 21 September. A fast-track procedure is on the pipeline to ensure Europe's ratification is completed before Marrakesh. Concerted action of municipalities and regions working together is key to implementing the goals set in Paris. The Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy has become the largest coalition of cities addressing climate and energy challenges at local level. Through its members, the CoR - the only EU institution representing local and regional authorities - is contributing to this success by promoting the Covenant via its networks and partners and by mobilizing mayors on both shores of the Mediterranean. The Summit of Local and Regional Leaders for Climate will provide an ideal backdrop for CoR's large-scale pro-Covenant campaign.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA222","Economics, climate or families?","February 1, 2017 Wednesday","Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)","Recently, as some of the world's movers and shakers gathered in a major economic summit and others prepared for a global climate change summit, we were involved in a much less publicized and much more obscure summit focused on what may actually be on the most important topic of all. It was called the Global Summit on Family Trends, and it was chaired by a film producer who is producing a documentary film loosely based on our book ""The Turning: Why the State of the Family Matters and What the World can do About It."" We had the opportunity to attend and to make an opening statement to the participants in the opening session last week. We thought our family-focused readers at the Deseret News might enjoy reading that statement. ""As we begin today, another summit is underway just down the road. The World Economic Forum is contemplating world economic trends - something they will not fully understand until they grasp the pending demographic crisis which will be caused by the family trends we are here to discuss at this summit. ""So, if you are most interested in results and effects, you should be in Davos. But if you are more interested in causes, you are in the right summit. For the economic 'ends,' go there; for the familial 'means,' come here. ""Later this year, just over the mountains in Bonn, Germany, the United Nations Climate Change Conference will convene. Its leaders will face the two-pronged challenge of: First, convincing a sometimes doubting public that global warming and climate crisis is real, and second, convincing that same public that the crisis is caused by human-responsible carbon emissions. ""We face a similar two-pronged task: First, convince a sometimes doubting public that large portions of the population face a crisis of economic insufficiency and rampant social problems, and second, convince that same world that both are caused by a breakdown of the structure and priority of family. ""So, if you believe that climate change is the most consequential challenge facing the world, you should be in Bonn. But if you think the dramatic decline in marriage, parenting and extended family priorities poses the larger threat, you are at the right summit."" As the summit unfolded, various family trend experts, mostly Ph.D. professors at leading educational institutions and representing industrialized countries in Europe, Asia and America, made their observations about marriage trends, birth rates, aging and other family and relationship topics. There were a lot of different takes on various subjects, but there seemed to be general agreement on how profoundly the trends within our most basic institution affect the well-being of all of our larger institutions, from business to government. And, interestingly, not all of the trends or observations were gloomy and pessimistic. Many marriage trends are positive, including more equal task-sharing and child-rearing partnerships and growing birthrates among college-educated sectors of the population. But of course, there was concern about declining birthrates and population in more than half of the world's countries and about increasing cohabitation and decreasing marriage in most of the developed world. And much of the summit centered on defining family by the indispensable societal functions that it performs: procreation, modeling of commitment, nurturing, providing an identity larger than self, instilling basic values, offering unconditional love, the earning and consuming function that family has for the economy, and caring for elderly parents. The question of whether any or all of these functions can be performed by an institution other than family led to some frightening discussions about larger and larger government and various kinds of new wave technology and robotics that would perform these very personal functions in a very impersonal way. There was also much discussion about cause and effect and conclusions focusing on family trends that influence economic trends rather than vice versa. We were proud to be from Utah where many family-decline trends are less severe and many stronger family trends are more prevalent. For those of our readers who also live in Utah, let's continue to make Utah's families even stronger as an example and a beacon to the rest of the world. As N.Y.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA223","Time to Deliver: Paris Climate Deal Offers Hope But New Governance is Needed to Make It Work","October 12, 2016 Wednesday 3:51 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Committee of the Regions issued of news release: The COP22 world climate summit in Marrakesh is to set the Paris Agreement into motion. The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) calls for an operational multi-level climate governance that fully integrates the efforts of cities and regions. Local leaders warn: the aggregation of national government's commitments would currently lead to more than 3C temperature rise while Paris agreed to limit global warming to 'well below 2C'. Cities and regions are key to bridge the persistent gap between climate commitments and objectives. At the Marrakech Climate Change Conference (7-18 November 2016), the international community has to make a new multi-level governance operational, setting up target assessment mechanisms and developing tailored climate finance services to move action. CoP22 will focus on enhancing ambition and promoting implementation. Marrakech also marks a turning point because the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the conference, setting out a global action plan to keep the temperature rise well below 2C compared to 1990 levels. ""The Paris Agreement is a considerable achievement. However, current pledges will not be sufficient to reach the agreed overall goals. We now need to implement the agreement within our respective constituencies. Further assessment and support mechanisms are to be developed to make sure all countries abide by the commitments they made in Paris. The COP22 will have to make these newly created mechanisms operational. To reach the Paris objectives we also reiterate our call for EU greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 50% by 2030 "" said Francesco Pigliaru (IT/PES), President of Sardinia and rapporteur of the opinion ""Delivering the global climate agreement - a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakesh"". Francesco Pigliaru, chair of the Commission for the Environment, Climate Change and Energy of the CoR added ""In coordination with the European Parliament, we are the voice of European citizens at COP22 . Citizens expect a strong European leadership in tackling global warming and we should all make sure not to disappoint them"". Markku Markkula, President of the CoR declared: ""A new climate governance that ensures a permanent dialogue between cities and regions, national governments and UN bodies is necessary if we are to succeed in reversing global warming trends. Access to information, training and support is also essential to enable local and regional authorities to fully exploit the public and private financial opportunities available in the transition towards a low-carbon, sustainable world"" The European Committee of the Regions and ARLEM - the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local Assembly - will have a solid presence at the COP22 , organising a series of events to ensure cities and regions pledges are heard. Background: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entered into force in 1994, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The Conference of the Parties (COP) was designated as the supreme governing body of the Convention. To date, 195 countries have submitted their instruments of ratification. These countries meet once a year, during two weeks, in order to evaluate the application of the Convention and develop the negotiation process between the Parties in front of new commitments.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA224","Education is key for green future says UNESCO Director-General at COP22","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Paris: UNESCO has issued the following news release:  There is definitely growing realization that education is not an \' add on\' but an integral part of any strategy to combat climate change and the key to a green future, she said.  For the first time ever, we have a single internationally-agreed goal that makes specific reference to Education for Sustainable Development in target 4.7 This goal does not only focus on getting all children to school, but on what they learn - on skills, on competencies for global citizenship and sustainable development. Among the panellists of the side-event entitled  Education - A key driver to scale-up climate action were Ms Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), HRH Princess Lalla Hasnaa of Morocco and the Minister of Education and Vocational Training of Morocco, Mr Rachid Benmokhtar Benabdellah. They discussed how education can enhance the implementation of the climate agenda. Ms Bokova emphasized that the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Change Agreement must be seen together as a single blueprint for humanity and planet, with education at the nexus.  We will not succeed in implementing the Paris Climate Agreement without awareness-raising, without changing behaviours and mentalities, without a mobilisation of governments, civil society and the private sector, without elevating the status of teachers. This starts with education. The green economy will not work without a green society and citizens who are aware of the stakes of climate change. HRH Princess Lalla Hasnaa, President of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection, said:  It is our duty to work together with UNESCO and UNFCCC to develop and improve environmental education, particularly with regard to climate"". She explained that the Foundation is working on several fronts to raise environmental awareness among young generations through the education system as well as among adults, and partnering with businesses to install renewable energy in rural schools. Ms Espinosa affirmed that it was time to implement the  monumental Paris Agreement which requires  trained and empowered people and education . Together with Ms Espinosa, Ms Bokova launched a new guidance document for policy makers, developed by UNESCO and UNFCCC,  Action for Climate Empowerment: Guidelines for accelerating solutions through education, training and public awareness .  These guidelines strike at the heart of our joint role in setting normative standards, in providing guidance to our Member States, said Ms Bokova.  Every single one \- from vulnerable small island developing states to advanced industrial nations \- has to step up action. The guidelines propose a clear 10-step plan for empowering stakeholders to find and implement solutions for climate change through a strategic, comprehensive and results-based approach. UNESCO also launched a new publication of its Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report,  PLANET: Education for environmental sustainability and green growth which looks at how education enables individuals to better cope with, and reduce their vulnerability to, the dangers associated with climate change. Manos Antoninis, Senior Policy Analyst of the GEM, said:  PLANET emphasizes the need for schools and teachers to look at more than just a transfer of knowledge. We need our schools and lifelong learning programmes to focus on economic, environmental and social perspectives that help nurture empowered, critical, and competent citizens. November 14 was designated as a thematic day for Education, and numerous events supported by UNESCO took place all day. The climate summit provides the opportunity to ensure that the Paris Agreement, including its article 12 on Education for Sustainable Development, is put into practice.

Credit: Bigstock STOCKHOLM, Sep 3 2016 (IPS) With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it's clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal. Here at HYPERLINK http://www.worldwaterweek.org/ World Water Week, which concluded on Friday, Susanne Skyllerstedt, programme officer for Water, Climate Change and Development at the \~ HYPERLINK http://www.gwp.org/ Global Water Partnership For us, resolutions of COP21 are part and parcel of what we are implementing and those of COP22 (in Marrakech) will be embedded in our long-term agenda of ensuring water security in Africa and rest of the developing world in a bid to attain water-related sustainable development goals, she told IPS. GWP is a Stockholm-based organisation that has been involved in fostering integrated water resource management around the world for the last 20 years. GPS has four regional offices in Africa covering Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa. As an inter-governmental entity, GWP works with organisations involved in water resources management. These range from national government's institutions, United Nations agencies to funding bodies. Other stakeholders include professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector. GWP has a water and climate change programme to support governments on water security and climate change resilience. Already, said Skyllerstedt, GWP has a programme that was started in Africa through the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) together with the African Union Commission and other development partners. The programme has been a key platform for supporting African governments. These include support on national climate change adaptation programmes more so in the sphere of policy formulation. For Sub-Saharan Africa countries noted for vulnerability to impacts of global climate change, the programme is key in supporting climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Through monitoring and evaluation programmes conducted in the recent past, GWP has learned vital lessons and is cognisant of areas that need more resources to achieve the desired goals. Already, she said, GWP is running a three-year programme on climate change aimed at achieving sustainable development goals linked to water, energy and food through climate resilience. She said they are implementing initiatives aimed at enabling countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to acquire highly relevant technologies on sustainable water management. We have demo programmes on new technologies being implemented by our partners in Africa but they need to be scaled up to have a major impact, she said. GWP is also addressing the challenge of water pollution, to ensure availability of cleaner water for human consumption and other uses. It is collaborating with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to promote water security and hygiene. The aim is to incorporate water, sanitation and hygiene component in climate resilience, Skyllerstedt explained. GWP is also developing tools for better planning on water, sanitation and hygiene to help communities during calamities such as floods. We have an urban planning project focusing on urban water systems and infrastructure we work with national government and other partners on issues planning putting into consideration matters of access to water and sanitation facilities as well as water related calamities. At the same time GWP collaborates with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on drought and flood monitoring. We work with experts and stakeholders to ensure national plans take into account climate change-related hazards, Skyllerstedt said. Many African countries face challenges in fighting impacts of extreme weather such as floods and droughts, and here is where the adaption programme is relevant. For the next three years GWP intends to widen its support to encompass not only national climate change adaptation programmes but also Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that countries published prior to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. National Adaptation Programmes (NAPs) and NDCs should be merged to avoid duplications, she observed. The biggest challenge to implementation of GWP programmes by its partners in Africa and elsewhere remains access to financial resources. During the COP21 in Paris last year, there were lots of pledges on financing initiatives for enhancing water security and its access by the poor. Unfortunately, our partners are not able to access the money due technical bottlenecks, she said. The situation has compelled GWP to embark on enhancing the capacity of their partners in Africa in the spheres of project design as well as making of investment plans and strategies.

""It is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. You are on your own,'"" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org. The use of the term ""Parexit"" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, commonly called the ""Brexit."" They continued, ""The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the United States."" The letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including Hawking and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, who served as Secretary of Energy under President Barack Obama. CNN reached out to the Trump campaign for a response to the letter, but did not immediately receive a response. The Paris Agreement was reached by 195 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, aimed at coordinating global efforts to combat climate change. Obama was a main proponent of the agreement, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supports its ongoing implementation. The group slammed politicians who deny the existence of man-made climate change. ""During the presidential primary campaign, claims were made that the Earth is not warming, or that warming is due to purely natural causes outside human control.

But the wide gaps between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left it uncertain if or when the meeting will take place, and raised doubts about whether they would make any progress if they do get together. In another twist, an Israeli TV station reported that a document discovered by two Israeli researchers indicated that Mr. Abbas had worked for the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, while living in Syria in the early 1980s. The professors said they were coming forward with the information to discredit Moscow as an honest broker in peace talks. After years of taking a back seat to the U.S. in Mideast diplomacy, Russia has increasingly sought to take a leadership role in the region. In Washington, a spokesman said the U.S. State Department is following the Russian efforts closely and would ""be supportive"" of any kind of effort to bring the parties together. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Supreme Court indefinitely postponed municipal elections scheduled for Oct. 8, a surprise move that reflects infighting in Mr. Abbas' Fatah party, tension between Fatah and Islamic militants from Hamas and rising instability in Palestinian cities. \"

It features a number of its new partner organizations from around the world, including the World Council of Churches (WCC). Those partners joined Green Cross in showcasing solutions for a sustainable future, to put forward how a green and inclusive economy improves food and energy security, creates jobs and reduces inequality. Among the photographs at the exhibition at the United Nations Office in Geneva (UNOG) was a picture by Norwegian photographer Havard Bjelland taken for the ACT Alliance and NCA and submitted by the WCC. Alexander Likhotal, president and CEO of Green Cross International singled out the WCC as one its partners at the exhibition opening which was attended by the permanent representatives of France and Morocco to the United Nations in Geneva. Likhotal singled out the WCC for its cooperation with Green Cross and met with Dinesh Suna, coordinator of the WCC's Ecumenical Water Network (EWN), who represented the council at the launch of the exhibition at UNOG on 13 October. ""This exhibition shows how WCC programmes interact with civil society and international organizations. The WCC was probably the only or one of very few faith-based organizations who have contributed to this exhibition to show a commitment to eco-justice,"" said Suna. ""This is also an excellent opportunity to underline the nexus between water, food and climate change before the COP22 in Marrakesh."" The images will be displayed at the United Nations in Geneva from 10-31 October, before being brought to Marrakech for COP22 in November. The exhibition is shown in a special display organized in partnership with the Mission of Morocco to the United Nations in Geneva. At the opening event on 13 October, the UN Ambassadors of Morocco, Mohamed Aujjar and Elisabeth Laurin of France spoke about moving forward from the Paris Agreement reached at COP21 to moulding a genuine action plan at COP22 .

The free, all-night festival ? which began in 2011 ? is an annual assemblage of art, music and food. More than 70 artists and artists' collectives will have their work on display at Saturday's festival, and most of the pieces reflect on the festival's general theme, ""Climate Chaos / Climate Rising."" Nathan Young, curatorial assistant for the event, said the theme was influenced by the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. This year, the festival will act as a platform for artists to explore the impact and intricacies of climate change through interactive installations and performances. One such attraction, Making the Best of It: Dandelion, is an art project that will begin its 12-month long installation on Saturday at Northern Sparks, Young said. The project is a pop-up food refuge and community dinner, where participants can discuss how climate change affects their food consumption habits and diet. Backyard Phenology, another installation on display during the festival, is an art piece that encourages people to gather and discuss their perception and observations of climate change, Young said. Co-sponsored by the Walker Art Center and North Lights and Sundance Institute, participants of Virtual Reality: A New Frontier, can view a collection of virtual reality works created by local and international artists. Throughout the night, festival-goers can watch a choreographed dance ? entitled Census ? that includes over 100 performers. The dance will occur once every hour throughout the night, Young said.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA233","ADAPTATION FUNDING A MUST FOR AFRICA","November 13, 2016 Sunday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The Paris Agreement hammered out at the summit on climate change in the French capital last year committed all parties to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. The big question at the follow-up meeting here in Marrakech is how that deal will be implemented, especially for the developing nations of Africa. ""We have three major objectives at this COP: [the first is] to set a foundation for a strong technical and legal framework of the Paris Agreement,"" said Seni Nafo, chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN). Dubbed the 'COP of Implementation,' the summit dubbed COP 22 is seen by the African group as an opportunity to refine some of Paris's unfinished business. Despite adoption last year, a number of key decisions in the PA such as modalities for achieving the 2 degree C. threshold, mechanisms to enforce compliance and achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation, among others, were deferred to COP 22 . With the deal based on Nationally Determined Contributions, it is feared the challenge of access to climate finance for Africa might get further complicated as it has been discovered that most countries' NDCs are vague, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). ""ACPC is ready to support African countries in the revision of their Nationally Determined Contributions, most of which have been found to be defective,"" James Murombedzi, Officer in Charge at ACPC told IPS, adding that his organisation wants to see an inclusive implementation of the PA. Murombedzi said this would, however, not be possible if COP 22 does not lay a strong foundation. The talk over the years has been capacity building to achieve the required levels of preparing bankable proposals in most African countries. Nevertheless, experts have urged caution even as the continent pushes for this need. According to Balgis Osman Elasha, Principal Climate Change officer at the African Development Bank, Africa should avoid the 'Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) trap' by perpetually pushing capacity building and miss out on serious climate funding opportunities. Elasha says ""Africa could not benefit from the CDM because it was caught up in the capacity building mode while others were taking action."" CDM of the Kyoto Protocol provided for emissions reduction projects aimed at assisting parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments. As highlighted, a balance between adaptation and mitigation features prominently in the negotiations. And for African economies, adaptation is not a question of the future but now. Available data shows that most countries are already facing economic challenges which are likely to be worsened by climate change effects. For example, cereal production is expected to decrease by up to 49 percent in Africa by 2050 due to the impacts of climate change, exacerbating food insecurity. And Zambia's Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Lloyd Mulenga Kaziya underscored the need for urgent action especially the improvement of hydromet services. ""Zambia is deeply affected. In the past five years, our rivers have been drying up while the frequency of droughts has increased affecting our smallholder farmers in terms of production, and to make matters worse, information flow to the affected communities is not readily available,"" said Kaziya, adding that the southern African country requires urgent support to upgrade hydromet systems and integrate them in all key sectors such as Mining, Energy and Agriculture With these critical needs identified, the AGN is determined to ensure that Africa's voice is heard at the negotiating table -- especially now as the rules and modalities for implementation are being discussed. But on its part, the continent is not seating idle. At COP 21, the Africa Renewable Initiative (AREI) was launched to pave the way for Africa's transition to inclusive green growth. AREI already has resulted in significant financial commitment of over 10 billion dollars for renewable energy projects in Africa, according to the African Development Bank, one of the partners of the initiative. The tone for Africa's demands at this year's COP was clear on day one of the event as Salahedinne Mezouar, the COP 22 President, said: ""Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change,"" underscored Mezouar, implicitly referring to Africa-the most exposed region whose contribution to global carbon emissions is just about 5 percent. As negotiations enter the second week, the African group remains optimistic that most outstanding issues, especially means of implementation, would be resolved for smooth implementation of the Paris Agreement. \"

The EU needs to up its game at COP22 , recognise the need to raise ambition and build a new EU-Sino relationship to save the planet. Christian Aid's International Climate Lead, Mohamed Adow, said the EU should replace the US as the world's chief climate diplomat. ""Donald Trump's election will likely alter America's diplomatic bandwidth on climate,"" he said. ""This opens up space for the EU to forge a new relationship with China and build on the global political momentum of the Paris Agreement. But it needs to lead from the front. ""For many years the EU was the world's primary environmental champion. It singularly drove the Kyoto Protocol after the US walked away in 2001 and has been at the forefront of renewable energy deployment.

If we are going to lose American climate leadership over the next four years then the EU must now work with other champion countries, such as China, the High Ambition Coalition and the world's vulnerable countries, to secure not just the Paris Agreement, but a sustainable future for the whole planet.

Credit: OCHA/Pierre Peron MARRAKECH, Morocco, Nov 17 2016 (IPS) Climate change will make a difficult situation much worse, and will affect millions of people in the Middle East and North Africa region, World Bank MENA Vice-President Hafez Ghanem stated at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakech, Morocco on 7-18 November. Aware of their vulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change, countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have begun taking action to confront the phenomenon and today, several highlighted their initiatives at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/2860.php UNFCCC ) in Marrakech, Morocco, known as \~ HYPERLINK http://newsroom.unfccc.int/cop22marrakechinformationhub/ COP 22 . Agriculture in the HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/mena MENA region is especially vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation. As global temperatures rise, they will rise even faster in MENA, causing more frequent and severe droughts. The 2015 drought in Morocco destroyed more than half the wheat harvest and led to a 1.5 per cent drop in the country's Gross Domestic Output. During a panel discussion on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's HYPERLINK http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/09/un-secretary-generals-climate-resilience-initiative-set-to-mobilize-and-accelerate-climate-action-for-sustainable-development/ Initiative on Climate Resilience COP 22 Abuleif stressed that as Saudi Arabia is diversifying its economy, any new sector will be put under regulations that will address sustainability and climate resilience. He added that his country is focusing especially on water management, making sure we are using water in a sustainable manner, and on the protection of coastal zones. Tunisia has announced a 41 per cent emission reduction by 2030. Most importantly, 13 per cent will be based on national efforts, while the rest will come from support provided by the international community. Country Flags outside the UN COP22 venue in Marrakech, Morocco. Photo: UNFCCC A week after COP 22 concludes, Tunisia will host an international investment conference (29-30 November) to mobilize 2.4 billion dollars, 40 per cent of which will be allocated to projects pertaining to the green economy,' with a focus on renewable energy. In Morocco, to meet the country's commitments on climate action, the Bank Al Maghrib (Central Bank of Morocco) recently unveiled the road map of the Moroccan financial sector in climate financing. The country has also taken steps to adapt its agriculture, with better water management and more climate-resistant crops, while also lowering its emissions by eliminating most energy subsidies and with the construction of the large solar plant in Ouarzazate, World Bank senior official Hafez Ghanem noted. This is the kind of comprehensive climate action we will support across the region, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, he added. The World Bank Group announced on November 15 a HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/11/15/a-new-plan-to-support-action-on-climate-change-in-the-arab-world new plan to ramp up support for countries in the MENA region by nearly doubling the portion of Bank financing dedicated to climate action, taking it to around 1.5 billion dollars per year by 2020. The plan focuses on four priorities: food and water security; sustainable cities adapted to new climate conditions; the transition to low-carbon energy; and the protection of the poorest that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change.

The President of the Republic of Seychelles, Mr. Danny Faure, joined other world Leaders in Marrakech, Morocco, on November 14, 2016, for the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is President Faure's first participation in a major international event since his assumption of office as the President of Seychelles. Critical decisions to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and setting in place those mechanisms and modalities to help the agreement to become operational are the major endeavors of COP22 . In his address during the High-level Segment of the conference held yesterday, President Faure called on the international community to formally re-embrace and commit to the outcome of the Paris Agreement with special attention given to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), like Seychelles, faced with the unique ravages of climate change. ""Like the many other Small Island Developing States which are represented at this most important conference, the Republic of Seychelles views climate change as an existential threat. ""For the very first time in history, a new global climate change deal, giving renewed hope to the world has been reached; we find ourselves at a crossroads and cannot afford to renege on our collective commitment to travel the moral path for the sake of humanity,"" President Faure said.

Among other things, President Faure laid emphasis on the urgent and imperative need for means of implementation, in particular, access to finance, capacity building, and technology, as well as public and private investment, to be made available to SIDS. This is indispensable so as to be able to advance their chances of mitigation and adaptation, to facilitate the promotion of renewable energy, to strengthen disaster risk management, and to leverage the use of the oceans to combat climate change, thereby building resilience in all sectors of their development. ""I launch an appeal to the international community to make available funds for climate financing with increased accessibility for vulnerable Small Island States like Seychelles. This will allow for continued development of SIDS and the ability to aggressively transition to sustainable economies,"" said President Faure.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA237","CLIMATE RISK AND EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE","November 17, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO): African least developed countries and Pacific Islands will be the first to benefit from upgraded early warning systems against weather and climate-related shocks under an action plan outlined at the United Nations climate change conference . Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific will be supported to improve their early warning systems and forecast services with an initial US$ 12 million in funding allocated by the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) initiative. Additional projects are under development. Launched last year at the Paris climate change negotiations, CREWS aims to mobilize more than US$30 million by July 2017 and US$100 million by 2020. The international partnership seeks to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries, and to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events. ""This is a pragmatic, tangible and targeted initiative to protect the most vulnerable. It is realistic and it is feasible,"" said Anne-Marie Descotes, Director-General for Global Affairs at the French Foreign Ministry, who represented Segol ne Royal, French Minister for the Environment, Energy and Sea, at a special event on 16 November at COP22 . The CREWS coalition is led by France, with support from Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada. It is being implemented by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), the World Bank, and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). ""The increase in global temperatures is being accompanied by more extreme weather events. In addition to the need for climate change mitigation, there is a very strong need for climate change adaptation. Early warning systems are a very powerful way to adapt to climate change. The CREWS initiative will lead to concrete action which mitigates economic losses and saves lives,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told the event. According to WMO, over 80 percent of the world's 48 least developed countries and many small island developing states have only a basic early warning system. Weather observations networks, the foundation of early warning systems, are inadequate in many African countries. ""CREWS can help us reinforce a simple but critical message that people-centered, multi-hazard, early warning systems save lives. By building capacity across stakeholder groups, supporting interagency coordination and leveraging significant resources from development partners, this initiative provides an effective way to reduce risk and build climate resilience,"" said Laura Tuck, Vice President of Sustainable Development, World Bank Group. ""The number of weather and climate related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years and this initiative will help reduced the impact of these events on low and middle-income countries which suffer the most,"" Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, said in a statement. Thanks to the CREWS initiative, Burkina Faso, Mali and Democratic Republic of Congo will be able to upgrade their national meteorological and hydrological service forecast capacities. Two additional projects are under development for Niger and Papua New Guinea. Additional funding from Canada will support work in small island developing states and Southeast Asia. A new project for the Caribbean may be added to the CREWS investment plan in 2017. Prof. Kabasele Yenga-Yenga, member of the spatial observatory on natural resources and climate in Democratic Republic of Congo, said his vast country lacked even basic meteorological and ocean data and observations. Coastal erosion and sea level rise at one of DRC's maritime ports has eaten away both shoreline and port facilities and caused the connecting railway line to collapse. He said CREWS financing would enable development of alert systems for farmers and fishermen. Like other Pacific nations, Tonga is vulnerable to hazards such as tropical cyclones and drought. Its 170 islands mean that early warning systems are particularly challenging, said Paula Ma'u, of the Ministry of Meteorology, Hydrology, Information, Disaster Management, Climate Change and Communication. ""Early warning systems technology, be it radars or radios, are not cheap. But they are a priority for the government because when disaster strikes communications are the first things to go down. It is challenging to access the financing for this equipment. We therefore really welcome this CREWS initiative,"" said Mr Ma'u.

Meetings and roundtable discussions with Moroccan officials and members of the COP 22 commission and steering committee, who are responsible for planning and hosting the event, prioritized the ""rapid entry-into-force of the Paris Agreement, implementation of countries' Nationally Determined Contributions, mobilizing private sector finance for low-carbon climate resilient solutions and clean energy, and climate adaptation and resilience,"" according to a State Department release. In statements to the press following meetings with Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Salaheddine Mezouar, Moroccan Minister of Agriculture and Marine Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, and other dignitaries, Mr. Pershing praised the ""effective"" partnership between the two countries in planning the November conference, and stated, ""Morocco is a world leader in clean energy and many countries are looking to be inspired, especially in the implementation of renewable energy projects on a large scale, like the NOOR project.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA239","PARIS AGREEMENT: White House postpones meeting; lobbying ramps up","April 18, 2017 Tuesday","Greenwire","The White House this morning delayed a discussion that had been set for today on the fate of U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, even as fossil fuel industry executives made their final pitches to the Trump administration on the issue. The White House confirmed that scheduling conflicts caused postponement of the early afternoon meeting, as Bloomberg News first reported this morning. ""It's rescheduled. It's because some of the principals decided to travel last minute today,"" an aide told E&E News. The change comes as the business community weighs in on the climate change pact that has caused a monthslong conflict within the administration (Climatewire, April 18). Cheniere Energy Inc.'s executive vice president, Anatol Feygin, yesterday said the company, which oversees multiple liquefied natural gas operations, believes the 2015 agreement can foster demand for domestic energy resources and support continued growth of American industry. Feygin made the comments in a letter to George David Banks, a special assistant to the president for international energy and environment. ""After more than a year of selling U.S. manufactured LNG to more than 19 countries across the world, Cheniere firmly believes that domestic energy companies are better positioned to compete globally if the United States remains a party to the Paris Agreement,"" Feygin wrote. Exxon Mobil Corp., BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have also welcomed the Paris Agreement to varying degrees, along with executives from Cloud Peak Energy Inc., Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. Critics of the deal launched an effort to hold President Trump to his campaign promise to ""cancel"" the deal. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is circulating a petition and video urging Trump to withdraw. Kevin Book, an analyst at Washington-based ClearView Energy Partners LLC, in a note to clients yesterday said he thought the White House has already resolved to stay in the Paris Agreement. He speculated that the news the White House was holding a meeting about Paris leaked because that decision had already been reached, and opponents wanted to have more input. In an email today, Book said: ""It still looks to us like somebody on the inside wanted to draw engagement from the outside. That happened, so the gambit worked."" He also said today's delay doesn't have an impact because there's no deadline to act. ""No decision deadline existed. May 26 isn't a deadline, either. Neither is November 6,"" Book said, referring to the date of the Group of Seven leader-level meeting and the opening of the next United Nations climate change conference , respectively. Book added, ""Even the stock-take won't be a deadline."" Company efforts Direct engagement with the White House has varied from company to company. Cheniere also talked about the global demand potential created by the Paris Agreement in its 2015 annual report. But a spokesman acknowledged the timing of yesterday's letter as pegged to the Trump team's meeting. Exxon's environmental policy manager made the case four weeks ago in a letter to Banks that the U.S. would be well-positioned to compete within the framework of Paris' carbon-cutting pledge (Greenwire, March 28). BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said the company continues to support the Paris deal, adding that the company's position on climate change has been consistent for two decades. ""More broadly, we believe it's possible to provide the energy the world needs while also addressing the climate challenge. With that in mind, we look forward to working with the Trump administration on flexible and market-based policies that encourage energy investment and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Morrell said in a statement. Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said the company remains ""strongly in favor of the agreement in Paris to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less."" But Smith added that Shell is not in communication with the administration on the topic. Cloud Peak also wrote the White House, offering an approach that would support funding coal-fired power projects and ensure global institutions adopt policies and tools that include cutting-edge coal technologies (E&E News PM, April 6). CEI senior fellow Marlo Lewis Jr. yesterday urged Trump to pull out of the underlying treaty, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a process that analysts warn could result in a complicated legal battle (Greenwire, Feb. 13). ""That would get us out of the Paris pressure box within one year instead of four. Better still, withdrawing from the UNFCCC would require 'two thirds of the Senators present' to approve the Paris Agreement before a future progressive president could rejoin it,"" Lewis wrote. Lewis and Chris Horner, another CEI senior fellow, will further outline their case against U.S. involvement in the treaty in a forthcoming policy paper, the think tank announced.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA240","UK RATIFIES THE PARIS AGREEMENT","November 18, 2016 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: From: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Against the backdrop of international climate negotiations in Marrakesh, the Paris Agreement has been ratified by the UK. Nick Hurd speaking at COP22 The UK Government played a major role when the world came together last year in Paris to reach the ambitious deal to reduce global CO2 emissions. Less than a year later, the landmark Agreement has entered into force and has been ratified by the UK as a sign of the continued commitment to climate action across the world. Welcoming the completion of the domestic Parliamentary process that facilitated ratification, Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: The Paris Agreement sends a clear signal that cutting emissions globally will not only help countries respond to the impact of climate change, but it is also compatible with economic growth. As we ratify this landmark agreement, we look ahead to continuing our leadership on climate action and ensuring that British business continues to play a key role in this new global low carbon economy. It will benefit the UK while we implement our industrial strategy to deliver the economy that works for all. Nick Hurd MP, Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry, who has been negotiating for the UK and promoting British business at the 22nd UN climate change Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh said: The UK is ratifying the historic Paris Agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all. COP22 in Marrakesh is an important milestone which marks the shift from aspiration to implementation. We are going to use this positive momentum to grow the UK low-carbon sector, which is already worth over 46 billion, as we continue to provide secure, affordable and clean energy to our families and businesses. The Paris Agreement provides a framework for governments as well as business and investors to keep global warming well below 2C, pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. Paris negotiations have set us on an irreversible route towards low-carbon growth. The Marrakesh talks, which conclude today, focused on bringing the Paris Agreement into reality. They provided the opportunity for countries to develop detailed plans of action as the world aims to achieve carbon neutrality in the second half of the century. During COP22 \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA241","Students active at Copenhagen","January 31, 2017 Tuesday","The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College","Inspired by the involvement of two Dartmouth delegations in the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Copenhagen in December, students and professors at Dartmouth have become focused and motivated to pursue creative solutions to climate change. Alumni at the conference included U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern '73, the lead negotiator for the United States, and members of the team that developed the Climate Rapid Overview and Decision-support Simulator, known as C-ROADS, a model that determines the long-term impacts greenhouse-gas emission reductions will have on a country's climate. A delegation from the Tuck School of Business traveled to Copenhagen for December's climate-change conference. Prior to COP15, students in biology professor David Peart's ""Science for Sustainable Systems"" class were already navigating the complex issues facing international delegates at the conference, according to Peart. Classes like this encourage Dartmouth students to ""think creatively about complex issues,"" Peart said, fostering an educational climate that may account for the involvement of members of the Dartmouth community at COP15. ""I'd like to think that our approach to liberal arts encourages students to think creatively about complex global problems,"" Peart said. Interactions at the conference led student delegations to realize that they must take an active part in the climate change discussion, instead of merely leaving political leaders to sort out the problem, according to several participants. The group from Tuck the only business school formally represented at the conference focused on the implications of climate-change decisions on business and society. ""Unlike other issues of global significance, climate change is an issue where businesses happen to be front and center in terms of cause-and-effect relationships,"" Tuck professor Anant Sundaram, the leader of the Tuck delegation, said in an interview. Sundaram, who teaches a class on business and climate change, said he believes companies will play a significant role in the future of sustainable development, as they are responsible for large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. They need to come up with technologies to solve the issue, he said. Sundaram called COP15 a ""massive turning point"" in the global approach to climate change. Although attending the Copenhagen conference did not significantly change his views, Sundaram said his own opinions and those of others were reinforced by the conference's findings. ""COP15 was a huge change from six months ago when some countries weren't as eager to work on this issue,"" he said. ""Now one can confidently say that everyone is on board, and we can get to some serious negotiation."" ""Academic institutions play a key role because they can propagate to the masses much faster,"" he said. ""Who knows? The next leaders that come out of Dartmouth could have a big impact on future policy."" The Climate Justice Research Project, lead by environmental professor Michael Dorsey, conducted research at COP15 by surveying attendees. The project is aimed at promoting climate-change decisions and economic development while maintaining social justice. Dorsey credited environmental studies professors Andrew Friedland and Ross Virginia and geography professors Chris Sneddon and Susanne Freidberg with cultivating students' interest in the relationship between the environment, energy and political economy. ""Their foundation has helped inspire and enthuse a generation of Dartmouth students and [alumni] to not just want to participate but have the requisite skills to do so,"" Dorsey said. In his ""Science for Sustainable Systems"" class last Fall, Peart said he divided students into groups representing affluent nations, rapidly-developing nations and less-developed nations as part of a mock COP15 conference using C-ROADS technology. ""For me, the most exciting thing was to have students feel the immediacy of this issue and to understand what the international community is grappling with,"" Peart said. At COP15, C-ROADS was used by delegates to provide real-time climate models based on the provisions of negotiated agreements, according to Peart. Peart said that students quickly adopted the concerns of the countries they represented as their own and were disappointed with the results of the mock negotiations. Despite their investment in the simulation, they were unable to limit the extent of climate change to the proposed target level. ""They were representing so intensely the interests of their groups and they negotiated hard but didn't quite get to their goal,"" he said. Peart said simulations and mock negotiations educate students in ways that traditional lectures cannot because they mirror how policy makers form decisions. ""Leaders approach every big issue strategically and in systems terms,"" Peart said. ""Educators should be thinking the same way.""

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA243","CHINA MAKES PROGRESS, U.S., OTHER COUNTRIES FAIL TO DISCOURAGE FOSSIL FUELS","January 9, 2017 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Georgetown University: The average tax on gasoline throughout the world is declining, meaning that governments are collectively failing to discourage fossil fuel consumption, according to a paper published today in Nature Energy by a Georgetown professor and his colleagues at UCLA. Paasha Mahdavi, an assistant professor at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy, worked with Michael L. Ross and Chad Hazlett of UCLA to conduct a four-year study of fossil fuel policies from 2003 to 2015 in 157 countries. The research focused on a key question whether governments are taxing or subsidizing the price of gasoline. ""Our data provides the most comprehensive and accurate account of how consumer taxes and subsidies on gasoline are changing in each country, and for the first time we can really see who is moving in which direction and where reforms are 'sticking,' so to speak,"" says Mahdavi, who is writing a book on the relationship between petroleum and governance as mediated by oil-related institutions. ""We see this a critical step toward holding governments accountable for their actions."" Surprising and Worrisome Mahdavi says the study has ""surprising and worrisome implications"" for efforts to deal with global climate change. The study comes about a month after the one-year anniversary of the Paris 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP 21. ""Governments often claim to be taking action on climate change and at the Paris conference, they made ambitious pledges but no one has previously been able to measure their policies with much precision,"" Mahdavi says. ""Until now, we haven't known whether governments are taking meaningful actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because they often publicize their positive actions and hide their negative ones."" Regional Surprises The professor says that one of the big surprises of the research is that China has made what he calls ""remarkable"" reforms. ""We see an increase in 43 cents in real U.S. dollars per liter on the net implicit tax of gasoline in China from 2003-2015,"" he says. Another surprise was that Sub-Saharan Africa turns out to have the second highest net gasoline taxes over the study period. He says some of lowest income countries have some of the highest taxes on gasoline, and many governments use price-smoothing formulas that can weather shocks in global oil prices. In contrast, the United States, which doesn't assign such formulas, has failed to raise taxes on gasoline since 1993, with the current tax at roughly 5 cents a liter. ""The fact that the federal gasoline tax has stayed constant for 23 years is really quite egregious, at least compared to the other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries,"" Mahdavi says. Fossil Fuel Price Reform The professor says the high-frequency data developed for the Nature Energy article provide the ""most and accurate and comprehensive study of consumer gasoline taxes and subsidies to date,"" with prices recorded at monthly intervals during the study period for nearly every country with a population greater than 1 million. The data is also the first, he says, to develop a measure of the global mean tax and price fixity, which is the degree to which governments either keep gasoline prices fixed or allow them to fluctuate with market forces. The study also had some good news the researchers determined that about two-thirds of all countries increased their gas taxes during the study period. Raising Serious Questions ""When calculating the global average, we can't just treat a small country such as Singapore the same as China,"" he adds. Mahdavi says this pattern ""raises serious questions about whether governments are prepared to follow through on their Paris pledges."" Global Backsliding The study, called ""Global progress and backsliding on gasoline taxes and subsidies,"" also determined, not surprisingly, that the highest net taxes are highest in Europe and North America and lowest in oil-rich countries such as those in the Middle East. Mahdavi notes that the countries with the largest subsidies are all exporters, but not all exporters subsidize gasoline. ""It's a mixed picture,"" he says. ""The good news is that many countries have made important reforms, with China being at the top of the list in global significance. But overall the world's governments are moving in the wrong direction, which is bad news."" Georgetown University 37th and O Streets, N.W., Washington D.C. 20057 \"

Continue reading MARRAKECH: Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa s Green Energy Potential Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa's Green Energy Potential By HYPERLINK Friday Phiri Mustapha Bakkoury, President of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), speaking at the COP22 in Marrakesh. Credit: Friday Phiri/IPS MARRAKECH, Nov 16 2016 (IPS) Lowering investment risks in African countries is key to achieving a climate-resilient development pathway on the continent, say experts here at the U.N.-sponsored Climate Conference. Mustapha Bakkaoury, president of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), says his country's renewable energy revolution would not have been possible if multilateral partners such as the African Development Bank had not come on board to act as guarantors for a massive solar energy project, tipped to be one of a kind in Africa. Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone. HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souss-Massa-Dr%C3%A2a Souss-Massa-Dr\'e2a HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouarzazate Ouarzazate , is expected to produce 580 MW at peak when finished, and is hailed as a model for other African countries to follow. Africa has legitimate energy needs, and development of Africa will happen through mobilisation of energy resources, Bakkaoury told IPS at COP 22 after a roundtable discussion on de-risking investment in realising groundbreaking renewable energy projects. Bakkauory believes it is possible for Africa to develop its energy sector while respecting the environment. What we say is that there is no fatality between having energy resources and respect towards the environment, and Africa has abundant resources to do this through its key partner the African Development Bank, he said, noting the instrumental role of Africa's premier multilateral financier to renewable energy in Africa. And in affirming its continued commitment to universal access to energy for Africa, Alex Rugamba, AfDB Director for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, told IPS that the Bank's commitment has shifted gear as it has now a fully-fledged vice presidency dedicated to Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth. Rugamba added that the Bank has learnt valuable lessons from various initiatives it is already supporting, and knows what is required to move forward with the initiatives without many challenges. Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone. Private sector cannot be ignored because the money they have is more than what is available under public financing, she says. But the risk is believed to be too high for private investors to off-load their money into Africa's renewables, a relatively new investment portfolio with a lot of uncertainties. German Parliament State Secretary Thomas Silberhorn says the highest risk in Africa is politically related. It's not about economic risks alone, but also political risks, said Silberhorn. You don't need to convince German investors about solar energy because they already know that it works, what they need is reliability on the political environment and sustainability of their investments. Silberhorn, who gave an example of a multi-million-dollar project in Kenya currently on hold due to political interference, added that ways to reduce political risks should be devised for Africa to benefit from private sector investments in renewables. But even as risk factors abound, World Bank's Tuck believes there is hope for Africa, citing Zambia, where record cheap solar energy has been recorded. Through a competitive bidding process, we have in Zambia under the Bank's Scaling Solar' program, recorded the cheapest price at 6.02 cents per KWh, she said, heralding it as a model to follow in de-risking climate investments for Africa's growth. And in keeping with the objective of universal energy for all, experts note the need to ensure that the end users are not exploited at the expense of investors. While the state should not interfere in this business model to work, modalities have to be put in place to ensure that the people for which energy is needed, afford it, otherwise, the project becomes useless, said MASEN's Bakkaoury. Following up on this key aspect and responding to the political risk question, Simon Ngure of KenGen Kenya proposes a key principle to minimise political interference involvement of the local communities. If you involve the local communities from the onset, regardless of whether governments change, the projects succeed because the people will have seen the benefits already, said Ngure, who also noted policy restructuring as another key component to de-risk climate investments. Agreed that de-risking investment is a crucial component, small grants are another issue that the African Union Commission's implementing Agency, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), believes could unlock the continent's challenge of access to climate financing. NEPAD Director of Programmes Estherine Fotabong told IPS that it was for this reason that the agency established the http://www.nepad.org/programme/climate-change-fund NEPAD Climate Change Fund One of the objectives of the fund is to support concrete action for communities on the ground, but most importantly, to help with capacity building of member states to be able to leverage financing from complicated climate financial regimes, said Fotabong, citing HYPERLINK http://www.ecowas.int/ ECOWAS which she said used the funding to leverage financing from the \~ HYPERLINK http://www.greenclimate.fund/home Green Climate Fund , one of the financing regimes under the \~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/green_climate_fund/items/5869.php UNFCCC.

Negotiations are already under way on how the Paris Agreement should be implemented in practice, and since the Agreement has now entered into force, the first Meeting of the Parties will be held this week. ""There is no time to lose. Now we have to gather all positive forces and use the current global impetus to implement the Paris Agreement. Following the US elections, Sweden and the EU have an increased responsibility to push the work forwards,"" says Ms Lovin. As well as leading the delegation's negotiating activities, Ms Lovin will also take part in a number of ministerial meetings, side events and new initiatives to accelerate countries' emissions reductions and secure financing for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. She will also take part in the first official Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, to be held on Tuesday. Leaders from all countries that have so far ratified the Agreement will be in attendance. The major issue at COP22 is developing the Paris rule book. Sweden's three priorities are ensuring that: the review mechanism contributes in the best possible way to the parties increasing their ambitions over time; a transparent strengthened reporting system is developed in a way that makes it possible to monitor and compare all parties' commitments over time, globally and individually; and a good balance is struck between investments in renewable energy and investments in climate change adaptation in developing countries.

Without mentioning Donald Trump by name, Kerry's speech at the U.N. climate talks was partly aimed at the Republican president-elect who has called global warming a ""hoax"" and has pledged to ""cancel"" the Paris deal limiting greenhouse gas emissions. ""No one has the right to make decisions that affect billions of people based solely on ideology or without proper input,"" Kerry said. With 2016 on track to be the hottest year on record, Kerry said the impacts of global warming were now evident across the world with record-breaking droughts, rising sea levels, unusual storms and millions of people displaced by weather events. ""At some point even the strongest skeptic has to acknowledge that something disturbing is happening,"" he said. The U.S. election outcome has created deep uncertainty about the U.S. role in international climate talks - and about the Paris Agreement adopted last year by more than 190 countries. But Kerry said the U.S. was already in the midst of a clean energy transition that would continue regardless of policy-making. ""I can tell you with confidence that the United States is right now today on our way to meeting all of the international targets we have set,"" Kerry said. ""Because of the market decisions that are being made, I do not believe that that can or will be reversed."" More than 300 U.S. businesses have signed a statement calling on Trump to support the agreement - including General Mills, eBay, Intel, Unilever, and dozens of other Fortune 500 companies. Their statement reads ""implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all."" The statement is addressed to Trump, President Barack Obama and members of Congress. It calls on elected U.S. officials to maintain the country's policy and financial commitments to lower carbon emissions. Lara Birkes, chief sustainability officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said that ""the Paris Agreement was a vital step forward, but its power is in our collective action."" The Obama administration pledged during the Paris negotiations to reduce U.S. emissions by 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Bill Hare, director of the Climate Analytics research group, said the U.S. was on the right path to meeting its target ""but a bit more is needed to get there."" He said that if Trump dismantled Obama policies such as the Climate Action Plan and Clean Power Plan, then U.S. emissions would stay at current levels instead of decrease. Kerry said an ""overwhelming majority"" of Americans know that climate change is happening and support the U.S. commitments under the Paris deal. \"

Over the course of two weeks, he will provide lectures and offer training activities and hands-on computer modeling work. Ogle will also take part in field research, visiting the Orinoco River Basin, where agriculture is expanding and researchers in Colombia are gathering data on corn production systems, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through conservation management practices. Colombia conducts greenhouse gas inventories already, Ogle said.  But researchers at the university want to develop more sophisticated methods for agriculture and croplands, he explained.

The COP22 conference on 7-18 November focuses on ways of implementing the first universally binding global deal on climate change, a matter of huge urgency for the planet. Parliament is represented at the talks by a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via. At the COP21 climate talks last December, 195 countries adopted the Paris agreement on climate change. The world's first universally binding climate deal, it sets out a global plan on how to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. The deal entered into force earlier this month after the European Parliament gave its consent to the EU's ratification. This week a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Giovanni La Via, chair of Parliament's environment committee, takes part in the COP22 conference in Marrakesh. Miguel Arias Caete, the European commissioner responsible for climate action, will brief the delegation on a daily basis. MEPs will also engage in talks with NGOs, industry and delegations from various countries. COP22 : 'COP of action' The focus of this week's round of talks will be on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Delegates will work on making national climate plans as clear and transparent as possible, and on ensuring that the actions taken are traceable and that standardised reporting methods are used. There will also be discussions on enhanced action prior to 2020. As part of the Paris agreement developed countries promised to mobilise at least $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Aiming to deliver on the commitments made, the negotiations in Marrakesh will revolve around who should pay into these funds and how they should be used. There will also be discussions on the need for further support for developing countries in terms of technology and capacity-building. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA252","Just Picture the Time","January 27, 2017 Friday","The New York Times","In an interview, the singer Nina Simone once said, ''An artist's duty is to reflect the times,'' by which she meant, basically, politics of the day, and in her case, racial politics. ''I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians,'' she added. ''As far as I'm concerned, it's their choice, but I choose to reflect the times.'' Institutions can make that choice, too. The International Center of Photography did when it opened its doors in 1974 as a showcase for socially concerned photography, which encompassed photojournalism and so-called street photography. For over 40 years, the center has stayed on mission, even as the technology of picture-making has expanded, and the main street has become the internet. A new exhibition, ''Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,'' reflects those shifts. It's as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past because digital media -- smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds -- outnumber photographic prints. The embrace of the digital was probably inevitable for the center, an institution that clearly doesn't want to freeze into a yesterday-museum. But it necessitates a rethinking of old ideas. It requires seeing photography as part of a larger, amorphous category, one morally up for grabs, called visual culture. And it requires recognizing that in the digital present, visual culture does more than reflect reality: For better and for worse, it creates it. For the center, the transition has been bumpy. It started decisively with the 2016 exhibition ''Public, Private, Secret,'' the institution's inaugural venture on the Bowery. Some people loathed the show, finding it a meanspirited mess that mixed too many media to no discernible end. (For me, it captured the random, narcissistic viciousness of internet culture to a T, and gave it a history.) ''Perpetual Revolution'' is an improvement. It pushes the use of new media even further, but in a directed way, and with nuances attributable, my guess is, to the fact that this is a group effort. The center curators Carol Squiers and Cynthia Young have led a team that includes the assistant curators Susan Carlson and Claartje van Dijk, and the adjunct curators Joanna Lehan and Kalia Brooks, with assistance from Akshay Bhoan and Quito Ziegler. Different curators handled individual sections, but everyone was working with a shared model. The opening section, on climate change, gives a sense of the governing method. It starts with a familiar photograph: the 1968 NASA shot of the Earth, as seen from the moon, an image that became a kind of logo for a nascent ecology movement, which produced the Environmental Protection Agency two years later. Next comes a bit of digital wizardry in a recent video charting temperature changes across the globe during roughly the past century. Then the apocalypse, or what looks like one, in a clip from the 2012 film ''Chasing Ice,'' in which melting glaciers, filmed by the American photographer James Balog, split apart and collapse in agonized slow motion. Other works bring cosmically scaled events down to ground level. In a mural-like collage, made from internet-sourced photos and Post-it notes, the artist Rachel Schragis reconstructs the New York People's Climate March of 2014. Instagram pictures by the Native American photographer Camille Seaman document a protest in progress against the laying of a fuel pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Here we're in breaking-news territory. The collage, with its miniature banners and countless, tightly packed figures, looks like a flashback, or flash-forward, to the recent Women's March. Ms. Seaman's photographs are whiplash reminders that, in his first week in office as president, Donald J. Trump not only ordered a go-ahead for the pipeline but also imposed a communications blackout on the E.P.A. You'd be hard-pressed to find any relief to this grim picture, though the show comes up with one in a fanciful video by Mel Chin, shot in Paris during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , when the city was still reeling from terrorist attacks. The film makes the point that all violence -- personal, ideological, environmental -- is connected. And it does so through an apparitional figure: an Inuit visitor who drives a sled pulled by French poodles through Paris parks and insists that the earth's condition, though dire, is reparable if people will lay down their arms and work together. The show's second section, ''The Flood: Refugees and Representation,'' also blends static and moving images, but makes a strong case for traditional photography as a form of evidence and a vehicle of emotion. There's digital work here, including a video starring -- and that's the right word -- an unfailingly cheerful Syrian refugee named Thair Orfahli, who documented a hazardous Mediterranean crossing and a rescue by the Italian coast guard in emails, tweets, videos and selfies generated by his smartphone, his only possession. It's a spirit lifter to encounter Mr. Orfahli (and infuriating to think that if he'd arrived on American shores under our newly proposed refugee policies, he might have been turned away). Yet my eye kept returning to conventional photographs hung or projected on the gallery wall: to black-and-white images of people trying to flee war-torn Europe in the 1930s and '40s, by Robert Capa and Ruth Gruber; and 2015 pictures of Middle Eastern refugees arriving, exhausted and shaken, in Greece, by Daniel Etter and Sergey Ponomarev. Is my partly unconscious preference for the still picture simply the result of long-established habits of looking? Or is there another, resistant factor involved? When I look at moving images, my viewing time and pace is predetermined; I'm on someone else's clock. When I look at a photograph, I'm on my own clock. I see an image, but I also have the option of contemplating it, living in it, savoring its details, thinking it through. The show picks up on the bottom level of the center's duplex space, with nearly three dozen photographs in a section called ''Black Lives (Have Always) Mattered.'' These pictures are from the center's collection and constitute a capsule tour of African-American history from before the Civil War to the 1960s. It's a story of heroes (Marian Anderson, Elizabeth Eckford) and horrors (an 1863 shot of a man's whip-scarred back; a 1968 picture of a Black Panthers' office window pierced by police bullets). It's also about everyday African-American life, intrinsically political and captured in images of 19th-century cotton field workers; World War I soldiers; black members of the South Carolina legislature during Reconstruction. And the chronicle is brought up to date in three strong video pieces connected to the Black Lives Matter movement. One, by the collective HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican?, is a solid wall of images, playing on 32 stacked monitors, related to the killing of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Another is a set of digital memorials to Philando Castile, who was also killed by a white officer, compiled by the Minnesota website Pollen Midwest. And the third video, by Sheila Pree Bright, layers old and recent documentary material, including Ms. Simone's interview, to make a case for a new black civil rights movement. And that movement overlaps with another, explored in an adjoining section called ''The Fluidity of Gender.'' The fact that two of the founders of Black Lives Matter -- Alicia Garza and Patrisse Khan-Cullors -- are gay women is just one point of intersection; there are many. Although the L.G.B.T.Q. movement has been substantially documented, a visual history of the current transgender revolution is in the start-up stage. The show does its part to expand the record, much of it in digital form. There are a few vintage items: a video clip of the transgender pioneer Christine Jorgensen, giving a poised, no-nonsense press interview in 1952; and a sassy slide-show paean to 1980s performers by Linda Simpson titled ''The Drag Explosion.'' A lot of what's here, though, is new. From last year comes the music video ''I Am Her,'' by the African-American trans singer Shea Diamond, and one by the self-described multigendered Mykki Blanco (born Michael David Quattlebaum Jr.), delivering a rap version of Zoe Leonard's 1992 election-year anthem about wanting a lesbian for president. The ethnic variety of this section is wide, as suggested by hashtags like #queerappalachia and #QueerMuslim. And the degree, and kind, of self-invention is dizzying, and contagious. Unsurprisingly, this sense of openness bumps up hard against the show's penultimate section, ''Propaganda and the Islamic State,'' which consists of ISIS promotional videos. Designed for internet distribution, they're complicated and artful. They, too, play with self-invention and theater, but with the aim of hammering down, rather than loosening up, utopian possibilities. It's oppressive stuff, installed, as if for maximum discretion, like a traditional photography display: a line of small, harmless-looking framed things -- video screens in this case -- on the wall. Oppressive, too, is the exhibition's coda, ''The Right-Wing Fringe and the 2016 Election.'' With Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as the primary platforms for its racist and misogynistic images, it suggests two things. One, that with the unedited flow of visual information now streaming through the internet, ''concerned photography'' has both a weaker, and potentially more powerful, presence than ever. And, two, that to an unprecedented degree, images -- call them art or not -- reflect and shape the times. At the moment, the shaping power is up for grabs by opposing revolutions, one led by the White House, the other by feet in the street. The street needs to take visual culture -- including photography -- and make it its own, right now. This is where artists come in.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA253","'Perpetual Revolution' Shows Artists Shaping Their Times; Art Review","January 26, 2017 Thursday 00:00 EST","The New York Times ","In an interview, the singer HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/arts/debating-zoe-saldana-nina-simone-and-the-spectrum-of-black-skin.html?_r=0 Nina Simone once said, ""An artist's duty is to reflect the times,"" by which she meant, basically, politics of the day, and in her case, racial politics. ""I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians,"" she added. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's their choice, but I choose to reflect the times."" Institutions can make that choice, too. The HYPERLINK https://www.icp.org/ International Center of Photography A new exhibition, ""Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,"" reflects those shifts. It's as committedly topical as anything the center has done, with sections focused on climate change, immigration, gender issues, racial turmoil, terrorism and the 2016 election. At the same time, it looks different from shows past because digital media - smartphone videos, Twitter outtakes, Instagram feeds - outnumber photographic prints. The embrace of the digital was probably inevitable for the center, an institution that clearly doesn't want to freeze into a yesterday-museum. But it necessitates a rethinking of old ideas. It requires seeing photography as part of a larger, amorphous category, one morally up for grabs, called visual culture. And it requires recognizing that in the digital present, visual culture does more than reflect reality: For better and for worse, it creates it. For the center, the transition has been bumpy. It started decisively with the 2016 exhibition HYPERLINK https://www.icp.org/exhibitions/public-private-secret ""Public, Private, Secret,"" It pushes the use of new media even further, but in a directed way, and with nuances attributable, my guess is, to the fact that this is a group effort. The center curators Carol Squiers and Cynthia Young have led a team that includes the assistant curators Susan Carlson and Claartje van Dijk, and the adjunct curators Joanna Lehan and Kalia Brooks, with assistance from Akshay Bhoan and Quito Ziegler. Different curators handled individual sections, but everyone was working with a shared model. The opening section, on climate change, gives a sense of the governing method. It starts with a familiar photograph: the 1968 NASA shot of the Earth, as seen from the moon, an image that became a kind of logo for a nascent ecology movement, which produced the Environmental Protection Agency two years later. Next comes a bit of digital wizardry in a recent video charting temperature changes across the globe during roughly the past century.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA254","Climate Change In COP 22: Irreversibility Of Action And Rulebook Development Despite Elephant In Room - Analysis","December 22, 2016 Thursday","Eurasia Review","The design of the Paris Agreement set the stage for a technical meeting in COP 22 but the stakes were raised in the aftermath of the US election. The rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement has accelerated the development of the Paris rulebook that is expected to be finalised in 2018. Implementation, increased ambition and a just transition are the pending tasks in the minds of negotiators amid statements of the irreversibility of climate action. By Lara L\'e1zaro-Touza Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement the world of climate politics and policies has experienced a year of accelerated change. Scientific data on ever-increasing temperatures, evidence of our limited mitigation, adaptation and finance actions, a rapidly changing energy landscape, the UK vote to leave the EU, the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the establishment of a Global Market- based Measure (GMBM) under the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and the US elections have all kept the climate community busy prior to the climate meeting in Marrakech. After the political climax in Paris, and given the design of the Paris Agreement, COP 22 was expected to be a technical meeting. Progress was indeed made as regards the initial understanding of countries' positions, processes and plans. And, for the first time after a big negotiating breakthrough such as that opened up by the Paris Agreement, there was no major backtracking or re-opening of the agreed text. The unexpectedly fast entry into force of the Paris Agreement has led to an accelerated roadmap for the development of the Paris rulebook that will govern international climate action in the post Kyoto-Protocol era. Hence, the transitional period from ratification to implementation and rule development will be necessarily short. Some may argue that excessively so, as agreeing on the entire set of rules for a permanent climate governance system is likely to be a complex endeavour that could benefit from a longer development timeframe. Other interesting developments announced at the Marrakech climate meeting, aside from the political declaration (the Marrakech Action Proclamation for our Climate and Sustainable Development) include: the Partnership for Global Climate Action that seeks to engage Parties and non-Parties in pre-2020 action (in the absence of a Doha Amendment entry into force); the 2050 Pathways Platform to foster the development of deep decarbonisation initiatives across sectors; and the Climate Vulnerable Forum Vision, where 48 climate vulnerable developing countries from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific have pledged to go 100% renewable. Finally, there is a joint declaration to develop a Roadmap for Sustainable Electricity Trade between Morocco, Portugal, Spain, France and Germany. Analysis Context This section will discuss the contextual factors that preceded COP 22 in Marrakech. These include: the scientific data available as regards climate change; the insufficient advances in mitigation commitments compared to our 2\'baC benchmark as well as our insufficient adaptation finance efforts; a brief reflection on the changing narrative of the economics of climate change since the publication of the Stern Review 10 years ago; advances in the competitiveness and deployment of renewable energy; unforeseen political events; citizen views on climate change; and climate and related agreements since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. (1) Science Scientific information regarding climate change in 2016 has not been positive. In July NASA reported that the first six months of the year had been the hottest on record since 1880. Additionally, Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest extent for five out of the six first months in 2016 since records began in 1979 (NASA, 2016). By mid-November the Washington Post reported that Arctic scientists were warning that mean temperatures in that area were a staggering 20\'baC warmer than usual (Mooney & Samenow, 2016). These and other (more contested and alarming) findings (see Hansen et al., 2016) come after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC's Fifth Assessment report that warned that climate change is unequivocal, with a clear anthropogenic component and already affecting humans and ecosystems alike (IPCC, 2014). (2) Commitments and gaps: mitigation and adaptation finance In terms of progress made towards our temperature goal, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) emissions gap reports have been telling us since 2010 that there is a wide and non-diminishing gap1 between our commitments and a pathway consistent with a 2\'baC target (see UNEP, 2010; UNEP, 2011; UNEP, 21013; UNEP, 2014; UNEP, 2015; and UNEP, 2016b). In fact, the 2016 Emission Gap Report (UNEP, 2016b) warns that climate action both pre-2020 and pre-2030 has to be significantly ramped up to meet our goals. This is so because full implementation of the INDCs will overshoot our 'well below' 2\'baC by over one degree centigrade (UNEP, 2016b). As regards action to bridge the emissions gap, the latest UNEP report recommends further improvements in energy efficiency in the building, transport and industrial sectors. In the building sector, building energy codes and energy certificates are recommended. At an industry level the adoption of energy management systems and standards should be pursued. On the transport front the report focuses on improving vehicle efficiency, promoting electric mobility2 and improving logistics. Additionally, UNEP (2016b) underlines that despite the added complexity of including non-state actors in the calculations (due to the uncertainty about the additionality of their actions, accounting concerns and questions regarding potential overlaps with actions by other institutions), their role is essential to achieve a low carbon transition. What is more, actions by non-state actors can additionally help mobilise policy makers towards the implementation of increasingly ambitious climate policies. Key to the lasting engagement of developing countries in the fight against climate change is the availability of climate finance. In fact, many of the NDCs are conditional (or contain conditionality clauses) on the availability of finance in their commitments. To help evaluate the adaptation aspect of finance, the second iteration of the Adaptation Finance Gap Report (UNEP, 2016c) analyses adaptation costs, the finance available to cover these costs and the gap between the two. Despite the need for further information and despite the various methods used to account for adaptation costs, the report offers a range of adaptation cost estimates based on existing studies. These adaptation costs range from US$140 billion to US$300 billion by 2030 and from US$280 billion to US$500 billion in 2050. Total adaptation finance amounted to US$25 billion in 2014. UNEP (2016c) estimates that avoiding the adaptation gap in 2030 would require multiplying available finance from developed to developing countries by six to 13 in 2030 and by 12 to 22 in 2050. (3) Economics: from costs to opportunities As for the economics of climate change, 2016 marks the 10th anniversary of the release of the Stern Review. As Lord Stern recently stated (see Stern, 2016, and Stern, 2006), the key messages, that have arguably stood the test of time, were: Climate change is a global threat, affecting the poor and most vulnerable disproportionately. Climate change is the largest externality (market failure) we have ever experienced but there is still time for tackling the problem before the worst consequences hit. The cost of inaction significantly exceeds the cost of action3 although large uncertainties existed as regards these costs at the time the Stern Review was released. Prompt action is strongly recommended. Policies can yield promising results, especially if concerted global climate action is forthcoming. Proactive adaptation should be considered as a priority given the inevitability of the consequences of the change in climate already built into the system. After the academic debates on the results of the Stern Review (Tol & Yohe, 2006; Carter et al., 2006; Byatt et al., 2006; Nordhaus, 2007; and Dietz, Hope, Stern & Zenghelis, 2007) and the subsequent analyses on model limitations (Stern, 2013), uncertainties and fat-tail probability distributions of climate damages \- plus the limits these may imply for the use of cost benefit analysis (Weitzman 2009, 2010; and Pyndick, 2011)\- the economic narrative on the reasons for climate action (see Dell. et al., 2011; Burke et al., 2015; and Wagner & Weitzman, 2015) strengthened in the public eye. This narrative also morphed from emphasising the cost of action versus inaction into emphasising the opportunities of climate action, while acknowledging some additional upfront investment costs will exist and institutional barriers will have to be addressed. This has been particularly so since the publication of the New Climate Economy Report (GCEC, 2014, 2015 and 2016). (4) Energy: renewable electricity and e-transport? Other sectors such as transport5 are key in decarbonising the economy. In fact, the International Energy Agency IEA (2016) recently stated that in order to meet their 2\'baC scenario (2DS), there was a need to reach 10% of global penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in 2030 and over 40% (1 billion light duty vehicles, LDVs) in 2050 up from 0,1% today in a market with a prominently Chinese, Norwegian and Dutch demand (IEA, 2016). Infrastructure, cost6 and institutional barriers are yet to be tackled in earnest for such a significant uptake. Policies guided towards pushing the uptake of electric cars and vans en masse (such as reducing taxes or providing subsidies to electric vehicles, ensuring every new building has plugs for e-cars or making use of command and control regulations to avoid the most polluting cars entering city centres to mitigate air pollution problems) can nudge consumers towards low CO2 vehicles when an alternative to public transport is needed. (5) Politics: surprise, surprise As regards politics, 2016 has been a year of surprises for climate change. The vote to leave the EU by the UK was unexpected and it is arguably too early to discern the consequences for EU climate policies. Despite the small contribution of the UK to world emissions (1,3%), its potential divorce from the EU could imply that the Europeans will lose of one of their most skilful climate negotiators in the international arena. It could also mean a weakening of the EU's internal climate ambition due to the relative strengthening of less ambitious member states such as Poland. The European Emission Trading System (one of Europe's flagship climate initiatives that has been strongly supported by the UK) could be affected by Brexit should the UK decide to operate a separate Emissions Trading System (ETS) or if the UK and the EU end up de-linking and re-linking their emission trading systems. European energy efficiency and renewable ambition could, however, be raised in the absence of the UK that has been less ambitious than other member states. British-inspired calls for cutting EU red tape could be softened if article 50 is finally invoked, appeasing concerns regarding a possible weakening of European environmental standards. On the other side of the Atlantic, America's election of Donald Trump as its 45th President again caught the world off guard. Given the strident campaign rhetoric regarding climate change, dubbed a hoax made in China to reduce America's competitiveness by the President-elect, the first reaction of the international climate-change policy community after the elections could be described as one of shock and concern. It also inevitably raised the stakes of COP 22 and prompted a political declaration by world leaders regarding their steadfast determination to pursue decisive climate action. In the aftermath of the US elections, the issue was not only about getting the first truly global climate agreement to work, the fight was, once again, to keep global climate multilateralism alive. The first test for the Paris Agreement has come early on in its life. However, both the design of the agreement (based on countries' self-interest and inclusive of non-state actors) and the resolve of major emitters including China and India, as well as emerging climate leaders \- such as the High Ambition Coalition or the Climate Vulnerable Forum\- seem to have helped us pass this test. As for the consequences of a Trump Presidency in the US on climate change the jury is still out. If he abides by his campaign promises, President Trump will pull out of the international climate regime. This drastic step would take one year if he were to decide to withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), leaving the US as the only major power in the world outside the global climate-change framework of action. If Trump decided instead to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, article 28 states that this would take three years after entry into force of the agreement and one year after the notification of withdrawal has been deposited. If this were the route taken, the US withdrawal would come as Trump's term in office ends. Other actions announced by Trump could, however, be as damaging as a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, or even more damaging. Trump could, for instance, cut domestic funding for climate research. America is a powerhouse in terms of climate analyses and this would damage international understanding of the phenomenon. Trump could fail to honour America's financial commitments towards the international community (ie, US$ 3 billion, Green Climate Fund, 2016) thereby increasing tensions between developed and developing countries regarding climate finance. Trump's replacement of Judge Scalia could undermine the Clean Power Plan, one of the key pieces of climate legislation of the Obama Administration, which seeks to reduce GHG emissions from power plants by 32% in 2030 compared with 2005 levels. These, plus the recent appointment of Myron Ebell, climate-change denier and contrarian to the Clean Power Plan, to run the Environmental Protection Agency transition team are indeed a cause for concern. Not all is lost though. The economic case for climate action is growing (GCEC, 2016; and The Economist, 2016) and if Trump wants to make America great again the clean tech and renewable energy sectors can provide the country with growth, jobs and a competitive edge in the next wave of innovation (Wilenius & Kurki, 2012). Additionally, the Federal government, though important, is not the only piece of the climate puzzle in the US. Action at the state and city levels is likely to continue apace (Hultman, 2016). (6) Citizens As regards global citizen views on climate change, the survey conducted in 2015 called World Wide Views7 on Climate and Energy shows that 78% of respondents were very concerned about climate change. In line with the above discussion regarding the economics of climate change, two thirds of respondents see climate policies as an opportunity to improve the quality of life and 63% said they would support all the necessary policies for limiting temperature increases by 2\'baC. Respondents were also overwhelmingly in favour of the use of economic instruments such as taxes to implement climate policies, although citizens in the US, China and Russia were less in favour of CO2 taxation (Danish Board of Technology Foundation, Missions Publiques and the French National Commission for Public Debate, 2015). Of potential interest to Trump, according to a survey conducted by Yale University in March 2016, 70% of Americans believe climate change is happening, with 58% being at least somewhat worried about climate change and 61% of respondents supporting climate action by the US independently of what other countries do (Leiserowitz et al., 2016). In terms of foreign policy, climate change is an area governments should address as one of their top priorities, according to citizens, at lease in some countries. In two recent surveys conducted by the Elcano Royal Institute in 2016, respondents across 10 different countries were asked to choose the first, second and third foreign-policy priorities for their governments. Once they responded the question, an index was calculated to compound their preferences. According to this index, respondents in Germany, France and the US stated that the fight against climate change was their second foreign policy priority- the first being fighting international terrorism. The UK and Portugal placed climate change fourth and sixth in the index, respectively (see Figure 2). For other countries in which the option of investing in development aid was not included (Colombia, Peru, Morocco, China and India) the results indicate that it is only in Latin American countries, Colombia and Peru, that the fight against climate change is considered the second most important foreign-policy priority \- the first being improving the country's image\- . In China, climate change is ranked third, after increasing the country's influence in the world and improving its image. Both of these top priorities could arguably be achieved, inter alia, by stepping up China's game in the global fight against climate change in the (expected) absence of national-level US leadership during the Trump era. As regards India, the results indicate that fighting against climate change would come fourth in the index for foreign-policy priorities, just above increasing the country's influence on the world. For Morocco, and despite its COP 22 presidency starting just a few months after the survey was conducted, the fight against climate change was the last of the foreign policy priorities according to survey results (see Figure 3). Reflecting on what Spanish people consider their top foreign-policy priorities it is interesting to read the Elcano Royal Institute's forthcoming 38th survey (Bar\'f3metro del Real Instituto Elcano, BRIE). In this survey the index shows that respondents in Spain see the fight against climate change as the second most important foreign-policy priority after fighting jihadist terrorism10 (see Figure 4). In fact, Spanish citizens have ranked climate change as the second top foreign-policy priority in every survey since 2011 and consider climate change one of the greatest threats to Spain (Real Instituto Elcano, forthcoming, 2016b, 2015 and 2013). The newly appointed government in Spain could reflect on the above data and continue engaging in international and national climate action, aligning its priorities with those of its citizens. (7) The Paris Agreement and other climate-related agreements since 2015 The Paris Agreement was adopted on 12 December 2015. Its main goal, in line with the UNFCCC, is avoiding a dangerous interference with the climate system. In order to meet this goal the agreement seeks to limit global mean-temperature increases to 'well below' 2\'baC (aspiring to 1.5\'baC) compared with pre-industrial levels. It also strives for a balance between emissions and absorption (removals by sinks such as forests) in the second half of the century, in line with the scientific warnings that stabilisation of temperature requires gradually reducing emissions to zero (Thomas et al., 2016). The Paris Agreement resorts to a hybrid system to achieve its goals. The bottom-up process \- embedded in global climate governance since the Copenhagen Accords\- requires Parties to periodically present national commitments11 for curbing greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are to be increasingly ambitious. The top-down approach entails both a periodic review of the progress made (via the all-important transparency mechanism) and guidance to achieve the above stated goals (Stavins, 2015). Market and non-market mechanisms have also been enshrined in the Paris Agreement as additional instruments to nudge the low carbon transition. Moving away from the Kyoto-style penalty system for non-compliance, Paris hopes to engage countries in increasing cooperation that is in the Parties' self-interest, expressed through their national commitments. In order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments, the accompanying decision to the Paris Agreement stresses the need for scaling up finance (to the tune of US$ 100 billion annually by 2020, echoing the Copenhagen Accord, and above that amount after 2025). Technology, capacity building and increasing adaptation capacity are further pillars of the accord.12 This new landmark global framework for climate action was to enter into force 30 days after 55 Parties, amounting to 55% of world GHG emissions, deposited their instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval. China and the US ratified ahead of the G-20 meeting in September 2016, putting pressure on the EU to do so. When the EU, among others, ratified the Paris Agreement on 5 October, the double requirement for entry into force was achieved. Hence, on 4 November 2016 the Paris Agreement entered into force. This is quite an achievement that had been in the making since (at least) the diplomatic debacle of COP 15.13. Few expected the Paris Agreement to enter into force less than a year after its adoption. In fact, this is one of the fastest entries into force within the international agreements realm and by far the fastest of any climate-change treaty.14 It therefore seems that the 'spirit of Paris' has survived a turbulent 2016. Other international meetings have taken place \- and agreements have been adopted\- in 2016 that add to the great diplomatic success of the Paris Agreement and that, indeed, signal an unprecedented momentum in climate action, despite the election of Donald Trump in the US. These agreements include the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The Montreal Protocol that entered into force in 1989 regulates the use and phasing out of substances that deplete the ozone layer. Many of these substances, such as hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), are also powerful greenhouse gases. The Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol adopted in 2016 has mandated a phase-down of HFCs for developed countries starting in 2019 (UNEP, 2016a). Developing countries will have a longer time frame for reducing consumption of HFCs (2024 or 2028 depending on the country). By 2040 the goal is to limit consumption to 15% to 20% of countries' baselines. The Kigali amendment has been widely praised as a very positive development for climate action, with announcements that claim that it could even prevent 0,5\'baC of global warming. Climate experts caution against excessive optimism as some of the effects of phasing out HFCs might have already been accounted for within the NDCs. The aviation sector, currently responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions and one of the fastest in emissions growth, celebrated its 39th Assembly of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Governments, industries and other stakeholders agreed on a global market mechanism called Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The mechanism's goal is to achieve carbon neutrality from 2020 onwards, based on carbon emissions in 2019-20, it is to be hoped without incentivising companies to unduly increase their emissions during that period. Despite having been criticised by countries such as India (for being unfair) as well as by NGOs (that blame the aviation industry for using offsets rather than abating), the decision by ICAO has been commended by some climate negotiators who believe that progress has been significant as this type of initiative was unthinkable just a few years ago. Headline results from COP 22 Given the design of the Paris Agreement, with its five-year review cycles, facilitative dialogue in 2018, etc., COP 22 was never expected to be a meeting of grand political announcements and big agreements. In fact, as Pete Betts recently argued,15 according to the mantra of climate negotiators that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed', the complete rulebook for the Paris Agreement was not to be expected until at least 2018 (COP 24). Given this mantra and the results from COP 22 , it seems that the package-deal approval approach will push ahead. This is so despite some less-developed countries wanting to adopt individual decisions concerning the Paris rulebook as soon as they are ready, that is, without waiting for the entire Paris rulebook package to be agreed (ENB, 2016). As regards the headline results in Marrakech, it can be argued that initial understanding of Party positioning, procedural advances in the Paris rulebook, plans and calls for submissions were the key outcomes of COP 22 (C2es, 2016). It is also worth noting that, according to Alina Averchenkova,16 contrary to previous COPs that succeeded the adoption of landmark climate agreements, there was no backtracking during COP 22 , perhaps ironically due to the need to counteract the Trump effect. With the above considerations in mind some salient issues discussed in Marrakech are summarised in Figure 5. Figure 5. Summary of some headline results from Marrakech Topic Results and recommendations Comments Key meetings17 COP 22 (UNFCCC). CMP 12 (Kyoto Protocol). CMA 1 (Paris Agreement). Mitigation The diversity in the characteristics and specificity of NDCs resulted in calls for clarification to enhance transparency. Countries dissented on the flexibility that should be allowed as regards commitments, timing, monitoring and reviews. The US, Mexico, Germany and Canada were the first countries to communicate their long-term decarbonisation strategies. US target: reduce GHGs by 80% or more below 2005 levels by 2050. Mexico's target: reduce GHGs by 50% by 2050 below 2000 levels. Germany's target: reduce GHGs by 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. Canada's target: reduce GHGs by 80% in 2050 below 2005 levels. Adaptation The Adaptation Fund created under the Kyoto Protocol will continue serving the Paris Agreement in all likelihood. US$81 million were pledged for the Adaptation Fund, beating its fundraising target for 2016. The report of the Adaptation Committee and a reviewed work plan for 2016-18 was presented. Next review of the Adaptation Committee will occur in COP 27. Developing countries pushed for the Adaptation Fund to continue serving the Paris Agreement. As regards adaptation communications, effort recognition and analyses were the areas where COP 22 focused on. A shortfall in funds for the Adaptation Committee was noted. Loss and damage The first review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage took place. The review took place despite the short time available for it. Further guidance on strengthening the WIM is recommended. Periodic reviews are recommended, starting in 2019. The review will analyse the work and the long-term vision of WIM. Capacity building The terms of reference for the Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB) were adopted. Work begins in 2017. The goal is to address capacity building needs in developing countries, facilitating climate action. Finance The Australian/UK analysis of the Roadmap towards the US$100 billion was presented and recognised. Developed countries agreed to continue to increase finance and a work program was agreed. The 2016 biennial assessment report emphasised the need to improve data collection, increase granularity of data, and improve tracking and reporting of climate finance. The initial strategic plan for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was adopted. There is increasing support for climate- related financial risk disclosures to foster low carbon investments. The updated guidelines for the 6th review of the Financial Mechanism were adopted. Developing countries should enhance their institutional capacity to enable adequate reporting. There are gaps in the systematic collection of private climate finance data. Finance flows from developed countries to developing countries amounted to US$25.4 billion in 2013 and US$26.6 billion in 2014. Total average climate finance flows in 2013-14 amounted to US$741 billion. Currently 70% of climate finance is allocated to mitigation. Further balance in the allocation of climate finance should be sought. There are significant costs of fund and project management (1%-12% of approved funding). The sixth review of the Financial Mechanism will be finalised in COP 23 (2017). Technology The joint annual report of the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network for 2016 was presented. Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism are encouraged to enhance mitigation and adaptation. The importance of finance in early stages of technology development is underlined. Transparency The work programme is clearly guided by a common set of questions that all countries have to respond. Diverging views were voiced regarding flexibility in transparency requirements between developed and developing countries. Further discussions are expected on this issue. Market and non-market instruments Market and non-market mechanisms were discussed. More significant advances were recorded as regards market-based mechanisms vis-\'e0-vis non-market based instruments. Further submissions by Parties are expected. The potential use of economic instruments, such as fossil fuel subsidy reforms were tabled. Avoiding double counting was discussed in the context of ensuring environmental integrity and avoiding past mistakes (eg, avoiding hot air). Discussions were held regarding whether to precisely define the concept of sustainable development. Avoiding fuzzy conceptualisations would arguably require clarifying whether a weak sustainability paradigm (substitutability of man-made capital for natural capital) or strong sustainability (requiring the preservation of certain forms of natural capital) should be pursued. Stocktake and compliance Consultations will continue on the organisation of the facilitative dialogue in COP 23. Procedural discussions took place as regards the first global stocktake. Questions on how the compliance mechanism would work were raised. Sources: UNFCCC (2016), C2es (2016), LSE (2016), ENB (2016), L\'e1zaro-Touza & Atkinson (2013). Beyond the advances in procedural elements mentioned above, the key political declaration arising from COP 22 was the Marrakech Action Proclamation for our Climate and Sustainable Development. Of little practical substance, the proclamation is important because it reiterates the high-level political commitment to increasingly ambitious climate action that is mindful of asymmetric national circumstances. It also recognises the transition towards a low-carbon economy as an opportunity and encourages multi-stakeholder engagement in climate action. This recognition of climate action as an economic opportunity signals a paradigm change in the political narrative of climate change that arguably started 10 years ago with the publication of the Stern Review. The results as regards the multi-level and multi-stakeholder engagement with the UNFCCC framework materialised in the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action heralded by the Climate Champions Hakima el Haite and Laurence Tubiana. The goal of the initiative is to foster action and interaction between Parties and non-Parties (firms, subnational and local governments as well as NGOs and civil society organisations) prior to 2020. It calls for climate policy coherence (integration) in order to ensure effective cooperation. Complementing the UNFCCC negotiations, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action seeks to help track non-Party actions, increase ambition, identify priorities and help exchange information and experiences. The initial topics the partnership will focus on include: land-use, oceans and coastal zones, water, human settlements, transport, energy and industry. Transverse issues will include gender, education, health and 'decent work'. In fact, the inclusion of the concept of a 'just transition' is seen by some negotiators, such as Emmanuel Gu\'e9rin,18 as absolutely crucial to counteract phenomena of disenfranchisement of the population with the low carbon transition that will inevitably alter production and consumption systems. This is a topic requiring further academic and political attention if we are to ensure social appropriation of the low-carbon transition. The partnership will meet throughout the year as well as during the COP and will produce the Yearbook of Global Climate Action, containing information on policy options for decision-makers to consider. Also under the aegis of the Climate Champions, the '2050 Pathways Platform' was announced during COP 22 Another welcome development arising from Marrakech was the Climate Vulnerable Forum Vision, according to which 48 developing countries will strive to reach 100% renewable-energy production. This group of countries can be seen as significantly pushing the current political ambition regarding climate change. The leadership void left by the US could be filled by these newly emerged leaders plus China and the High Ambition Coalition (including the EU) in a move \'e0 la 2001 when the US failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and the EU took the lead in global climate action. Finally, during COP 22 the governments of Morocco, Germany, Portugal and Spain signed a joint declaration on the establishment of a Roadmap for Sustainable Electricity Trade between Morocco and the European Internal Energy Market. The declaration acknowledges that in order for the EU to meet its commitment to reach 27% of renewable energy consumption by 2030 and for Morocco to meet its commitment of producing 52% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030, enhanced electricity market integration between the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Europe could be mutually beneficial. The effective implementation of this roadmap would also help in the integration of renewable electricity. The purpose of the roadmap is to identify and suggest ways to eliminate barriers to trade in sustainable electricity (EC, 2016). Signatories of the joint declaration have pledged to work on a Sustainable Electricity Trade Roadmap (SET Roadmap) and to work towards an agreement that could be ready for COP 23. Conclusions After a turbulent 2016, COP 22 \- dubbed the 'Action and Implementation COP\- delivered a roadmap for operationalising the Paris rulebook in 2018. It also provided guidance on how to proceed for the successful development of the facilitative dialogue. Some progress was made in the analysis of positions regarding implementation and compliance, mitigation, adaptation, transparency and the global stocktake. And, as explained above, there were a host of initiatives from Party and non-Party actors that reiterated the momentum of climate action. Some of the challenges that remain include the entry into force of the Doha Amendment that establishes the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol that would increase ambition pre-2020. Developing domestic legislative frameworks to match NDCs and increasing ambition are still pending tasks. All of these, with a just transition in mind to help gain acceptance of low carbon strategies by citizens. In terms of expected hurdles, flexibility issues between developed and developing countries and allocation of responsibilities are expected to lead to disagreements in future meetings. As regards the leadership void left by the US there are indications that the world, perhaps through the actions of newly emerged climate leaders (among others), will work \'e0 la 2001 when the EU performed a directional leadership role in the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol after the US failed to ratify the agreement. Should the world push ahead with its climate commitments, the case for decisive climate action is likely to be made based on the economics on transitioning to a low carbon future, the co-benefits of a decarbonised development model (Stern et al., 2016), better messaging and (sadly) increasing climate change experience, especially with extreme weather events (Dunlap et al., 2016).

Exploring the next 40 years of global change' (last accessed 26/XI/2016). 1 The emissions gap for 2030 is currently 12GTCO2e to 14 GtCO2e for 2\'b0C scenarios and 3 GtCO2e larger for 1.5\'baC scenarios according to UNEP (2016b). 2 For instance, Canada, China, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the UK and the US announced their pledges to increase electric vehicles in government fleets through the Government Fleet Declaration during COP 22 . 3 Provided assumptions on ethics and discount rates were aligned with the choices made in the Stern Review. 4 Two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions come from the energy sector and 87% of global primary energy comes from the use of fossil fuels (IEA, 2015). 5 See for example the case of Spain in Deloitte (2016). 6 Note that some analysts believe EVs might become cost competitive vis-\'e0-vis vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) in a decade (IEA, 2016). 7 Note that the sample was 10,000 people across 76 countries who were given information about climate change prior to the survey; they had time to reflect on the information provided and they debated among themselves before answering questions about climate change. 8 Note that the survey was conducted via Internet by Q\'edndice. The fieldwork took place between 26 May and 9 June 2016. The sample amounted to 4,105 respondents (between 400 and 473 respondents depending on the country). Quota sampling was used for age, gender and location. The error margins vary from +/-5% for countries with 400 interviews to +/- 4.6% for the country (Peru) where 473 surveys were completed, for a 95% confidence level and the most unfavourable case (p = q = 0.5). The age of respondents ranged from 18 to 70.

For further analysis of the drivers of the Paris Agreement and the elements of this global climate agreement, see Clemen\'e7on (2016) and L\'e1zaro-Touza (2016). 13 It could be argued that COP 15 in Copenhagen allowed the basic pillars of the Paris Agreement to be forged (L\'e1zaro-Touza, 2010), despite comments to the contrary (see the discussion in Bodansky, 2010). 14 Note that the UNFCCC was adopted in May 1992 and took almost two years to enter into force (in March 1994). The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in December 1997 and entered into force after Russia's ratification on 16 February 2005, over seven years later (UNFCCC, undated, a, b). 15 Panel debate 'A year on from Paris: turning commitments into action'.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA255","A shift toward climate leadership","December 14, 2016 Wednesday","US Official News","Washington: The Brookings Institution has issued the following news release: Amid global uncertainty about future US policy, China could set the pace for environmental action Implementation was the keyword for the 22nd Conference of Parties meeting ( COP22 ), recently held in Marrakech, Morocco. In October, 113 out of 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ratified the Paris Agreement, representing 80 percent of global CO2 emissions. Following this achievement, two urgent matters lie ahead: the development of elaborate and concrete road maps to achieve the goals set in the agreement and fulfilling what is left in the Kyoto Protocol. Marrakech was, without doubt, the beginning of the post-Paris era. Climate finance was under the spotlight during the conference, discussed widely across national pavilions and at side events. Deep concerns were shared by developing countries, especially the least developed and most vulnerable. Although developed countries promised at Copenhagen in 2009 to give annual aid of $100 billion (94 billion euros; 79 billion) from 2010 to 2020 to help developing countries cope with climate change, so far there is still an annual $40 to $70 billion gap to fill. Additionally, this is only the financing shortage within the Kyoto time frame. The world is facing an even bigger challenge when it comes to the Paris Agreement. Last year, before the Paris Conference, developed countries, led by the European Union and the United States, secretly formed a  high ambition coalition with 79 African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries, but excluding China and India. The group emerged at the end of the conference to push for a legally binding plan to hold the global temperature increase to within 1.5 C by 2100, instead of the former agreed target of 2 C. The final version of the Paris Agreement, therefore, states  pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels . This plan serves the best interests of vulnerable countries. But the climate finance conundrum dragged the ambition down to earth at COP22 , with the name  Donald Trump contributing to the process. Noticeably, the landscape of climate leadership is shifting toward the east. China was widely expected to play a leading role at COP22 , an expectation reinforced by the pessimistic atmosphere created by Trump\' s election.

The UN climate change conference is, in some ways, occasion for celebration that the world's nations responded to the urgent call in Paris to collaboratively address and confidently agree on the agenda that lies before them, stated Bartholomew I. However, the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) in many ways is also a painful reminder that 197 countries have ratified a convention enforced after the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 only now. ""For twenty-two years, then, the world's leading authorities and politicians have fundamentally agreed on the problems of global climate change and have held endless consultations and high-level conversations on something that requires practical measures and tangible action. Twenty-two years, however, is an unacceptably long period to respond to the environmental crisis, especially when we are conscious of its intimate and inseparable connections to global poverty, migration and unrest"", stated Bartholomew I. After 22 years, it is finally time - and long overdue - for all of us to discern the human faces impacted by our ecological sins, noted Bartholomew I, for it is human beings - all of us, but especially the ""least"" and the most vulnerable or marginalized among us - who are irreversibly impacted. ""How, then, can any nation justify the suffering of its people? How can any industry defend the exploitation of its customer? Unless we all perceive in our attitudes and actions, as in our deliberations and decisions, the faces of our own children - in the present and in future generations - then we shall continue to prolong and procrastinate the development of any solution"". In a message delivered to the UNFCCC on 16 November, Bartholomew I wrote: ""What price are we prepared to pay for profit? Or how many lives are we willing to sacrifice for material or financial gain? And at what cost would we forfeit or forestall the survival of God's creation? It is our humble, yet bold prayer that all parties at the COP22 will recognize and respond to the high stakes involved in climate change."" The statement of Bartholomew I was received by James Grabert, UNFCCC Sustainable Development Mechanisms coordinator. Although the Paris agreement provides the blueprint for national contributions and the tools for international support and cooperation, all of us have the opportunity to take action, said Grabert. ""The Paris agreement is ours to implement - as individuals and as a society as a whole. We welcome this message today - it reminds us of the need to take action now and to implement what we have agreed, addressing humanity's needs"".

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA258","SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE JONATHAN PERSHING ON THE OPENING OF THE COP-22 CLIMATE CONFERENCE","November 7, 2016 Monday 12:30 PM  EST","US Fed News","WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 -- The U.S. Department of State issued the following press release: MR TONER: Hey folks. Happy Monday. Just as a precursor, or at the top of briefing, we thought it would be useful, since today marks the start of COP-22 in Marrakesh, Morocco, if we had our special envoy for climate change come and brief you on some of the expectations for that conference. Jonathan Pershing is with us today, and he'll be able to give you, as I said, an overview of the conference and then answer a couple questions. With that, Jonathan. Thanks. MR PERSHING: Thanks. Thanks very much, Mark. It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks to everyone. So 2016 is really an historic year on the climate change issue, on the climate change front. Over the past few months alone, we've seen a number of major events that have occurred. First and foremost, the Paris Agreement itself entered into force. The technical date of entry into force was on Friday, just past Friday. That was 30 days after 55 countries and at least - representing at least 55 percent of global emissions had signed onto the deal, had joined the agreement. By the way, since the 55 threshold was met, we're now just over 100 countries. So it's really continuing to grow quite rapidly. But at the same time, over the course of the year, we've had a number of other major agreements. We agreed in Montreal on an agreement on civil aviation, for the first time in history capturing some of the emissions from international civil aviation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. And the second is an agreement that was reached in Kigali in Rwanda, also in October, in which we've agreed to phase down substances called hydrofluorocarbons, which also are major greenhouse gases, and look for substitutes that replace those. So the meeting starts today. It's actually just begun in Marrakesh, Morocco. So we're seeing significant movement on that front. And it's much smaller than Paris. About 15,000 representatives will be in attendance, compared to almost 50,000 in Paris. But it's got a couple of large-scale activities that are going to be undertaken. The first bucket is actually taking cognizance of and moving forward politically based on these political agreements - the entry into force in Morocco, the Kigali agreement on Montreal Protocol gases, and ICAO. There's a huge political momentum; entry into force now really shapes the agreement and the structure. The second is the movement and aggressive acceleration of the timetable on the detailed development of rules and regulations and guidance that come out of the Paris Agreement. We'd originally thought those would really be postponed for some time; there was going to be a five- or a six-year process. The very rapid entry into force has changed the dynamic, and we now anticipate we'll have those concluded by 2018. So a very rapid acceleration of the work, of the technical guidance and detail. And the third is this is a Conference of the Parties around implementation. We finished the big framing of the negotiation in Paris; now it's the implementation agenda. And we'll have experts, including our secretary of energy who will be there, but experts from across multiple sectors, agriculture, forestry, people who deal with water - the impacts of climate change as well as ways to reduce emissions that cause climate change. And that elevation will be a chance for CEOs, for ministers, for academics to all elevate and frame what we can do and to move from this negotiating phase into an operational phase. And that's going to occupy us for some time, and we should be very clear the risks and damages of climate have become more apparent in the last year as well. And this is going to be a race as we try to work on the problem and solve the problem before those damages become so significant that we can't do so so easily anymore. So this is a major shift in where we've been, moving from these negotiating rounds into an implementation round. So with that, happy to take questions that people might have around what's going to happen and where we stand. MR TONER: Go ahead. QUESTION: We were on a background call with some officials last week about COP-22 , and there was some discussion, I think, about zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2050 as a goal. I'm just wondering where that comes from. Is this something the United States is looking to do multilaterally, or take the lead on that particular issue? MR PERSHING: Okay, thanks very much. No, there is no formal goal for 2050. What there is though is an agreement that's contained in the Paris - the Paris Agreement itself that calls for countries to develop what are called mid-century strategies. The United States is working on ours. We are hoping to conclude it and complete it before the end of the year. And in that, we will be looking at a variety of scenarios where we can do significant global and U.S. reductions in emissions. It's not around a particular target number; it's around trajectories. How can you do these radical reductions? The President has indicated that we would at least be working to an 80 percent reduction by the year 2050. QUESTION: So where does zero carbon (inaudible)? QUESTION: Okay, okay. MR TONER: Any more questions? Have we exhausted you already? (Laughter.) Okay. MR PERSHING: Thanks. MR TONER: Thanks so much, Jonathan. Appreciate it. Take care.

Faced with structural inequalities, women have less resources to put their livelihoods back together again after a draught or flood. Particularly in Africa, women are at the front-line of climate change. Even if their ingenuity and resolve has resulted in many climate solutions across the world, they remain a minority in climate decision-making and in national climate negotiating teams. Only 15% of the Green Climate Fund board members are women, whereas at the last COP only 23 % of the African negotiation teams were women. Women2030 - an EU funded coalition of 5 global and regional women and gender networks working towards the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG-13 on Climate, will bring together women and gender CSOs from Africa and other parts of the world to Marrakech, to voice their needs and concerns in the discussion of global leaders, and to address the structural barriers to climate protection, and the urgent need of climate action. Preparing for their participation in the COP 22 , Women2030 will be holding an African Regional Training for 30 Women and gender Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Marrakesh, Morocco, November 4-5, 2016. The ToT aims at providing focused trainings to the Expert Women's CSOs who will later share these lessons learnt to other CSOs at the national levels to enhance their capacity to monitor the implementation of the SDGs. After the training, Women2030 will engage stakeholders in the Climate COP22 and push for gender-responsive climate actions through series of activities ranging from meetings with ministers and negotiators, concerts and exhibitions, to showcasing and rewarding successfully-tested gender-sensitive climate actions of grass roots organisations. Women2030 is a project funded by the department of Development Cooperation of the European Commission through a Framework Agreement with 5 global and regional women's network: Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF); Women Environmental Programme (WEP); Global Forest Coalition (GFC); Gender and Water Alliance (GWA); and Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD). The strategic objectives of the Women2030 program are to:  Build capacity of women's and gender-focused civil society organizations on planning, monitoring and implementation of the SDGs/post 2015 agenda and the climate agreement.  Create awareness at all levels of gender-equitable best practices and progress of national post-2015 SDG plans  Ensure more gender-responsive SDGs/post 2015 plans with participation of women and women's organizations. The Women2030 project is being implemented in 52 countries across different regions of the world.

This gathering coincided with the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. Organized by Casablanca Finance City Authority, in partnership with Paris EUROPLACE and with the active participation of the African Development Bank, this ""Official COP22 Event"" helped deepen understanding on crucial issues for the future of climate finance, such as key success factors for green financing scale-up, mobilizing private capital flows, or green bonds as innovative financing instruments in and for Africa. During the conference opening, several significant announcements in line with the implementation of the Paris Agreement were made. Mr. Mohamed Boussa\'efd, Minister of Economy and Finance, stressed the importance of the Moroccan financial sector's involvement, announcing that a dedicated climate finance roadmap had been established, and will be presented at the COP22 in Marrakech. He added that the Kingdom of Morocco was currently working, with the support of the World Bank, to launch an initiative dedicated to climate change sensitive fiscal policies, while noting that: ""the financial resources necessary for the transition to low carbon economies are available, and that the instruments and ad hoc tools remain to be implemented."" Mr. Mustapha Bakkoury, Chairman of MASEN, announced the first green bond issue in Morocco of 1.15 Billion Dirhams (approx. 100 Million Euros). The funds raised will help finance three new photovoltaic stations in the Kingdom, with an aggregate capacity of 170MW. Other speakers added that the development of ""green bonds"" is a response to growing demand from investors looking to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios and projects. Mr G\'e9rard Mestrallet, Chairman of Paris EUROPLACE announced as Chairman of ENGIE the closing of the Hazelwood coal power plant in Australia. Finally, Mrs. Chinelo Anohu-Amazu, Director General of the National Pension Commission Nigeria, indicated the introduction of a regulatory framework for Nigerian pension funds' investments, which integrates sustainable development objectives. Furthermore, 19 international investors with assets under management exceeding 5,000 Billion Euros, announced their commitment to the preservation of the Arctic, by asking for an open-ended moratorium on oil and gas activities in the high Arctic seas. Several participating institutions have as such chosen the Climate Finance Day 2016 to premier the release of their reports, including the ""Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition"", a network of international investors led by UNEP FI and committed to publish annually their carbon footprint, which highlights an acceleration of asset portfolios'decarbonisation, with a commitment of 27 international investors and 600 billion dollars divested. The Inter-American Development Bank also released a preview of its report dedicated to sustainable infrastructure. Moreover, the ""Climate Policy Initiative""1 shared the most recent update of its climate finance flows' figures. All speakers converged on the major role played by climate finance as the ""Future of Finance"". As such, international financial institutions were presented as levers to catalyze global savings. Participants highlighted the importance of cooperation between public and private banks as well at local, national and regional levels. They also noted the risks and challenges of climate change for Africa. There is a tremendous opportunity here to make qualitative leaps (leapfrogs) and promote sustainable development, particularly in the fields of agriculture and energy. Finally, the conference highlighted the essential, vanguard role that Morocco plays as a catalyst and promoter of resilient growth, both at the national and regional levels, as well as Casablanca Finance City's commitment as a green financial center, to channel the needed capital to finance the transition towards low carbon economies in Africa and beyond.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA264","Alums and students attend, participate in COP21","February 2, 2017 Thursday","The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College","Dartmouth alumni, faculty and students were among the many delegates and attendees at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. After approximately two weeks of negotiations and meetings, the conference culminated in 195 countries adopting the first legally binding and universal agreement on slowing global warming. The agreement, which comes into force in 2020, establishes an international action plan for avoiding dire climate change by limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, according to the European Commission. Prominent among the Dartmouth participants in the conference, also known as COP21, was U.S. State Department's special envoy for climate change Todd Stern '73, the lead negotiator for the U.S. delegation. Morgan Curtis '14 and Leehi Yona '16 both attended COP21 representing SustainUS, a youth-led delegation advocating for justice and sustainability in United Nations meetings on sustainable development, climate change, eradicating poverty, biodiversity loss and women's rights. As a youth delegate and a Dartmouth senior fellow, Yona followed the negotiations at the conference, conducted interviews of delegates and academics attending the conference, participated in symbolic protests and wrote opinion pieces, she said. Before arriving in Paris, Curtis spent the five months before the conference cycling and gathering stories in eleven countries on a Climate Journey project. She focused on grassroots mobilization in climate action and gathering the stories of people who have made the transition from individual to collective action for the climate. Curtis recalled her two weeks at the conference as the ""most stimulating, difficult and transformative"" of her life. A group of students from the Tuck School of Business also attended COP21 as observers. Corporations are both the problem and solution to climate change as they are the biggest contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases, Sundaram said. He added that the industry will have to do a lot of the research and development that goes into developing these clean energy technologies to solve the climate change problem. Patrick Turevon Tu'16, observed many of the ""behind the scenes negotiations"" and attended the various panels and lectures held throughout the second week of the conference. ""I tried to attend a lot of the business lectures on building a clean energy market and investing in clean energy,"" Turevon said. Sundaram said he finds it important for his business students to see how global negotiations and consensus building processes work or do not work. The main objective of this annual conference is to review and revise the implementation of the Rio Convention, which in 1992, established a framework for action aimed at stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Although delegates and leaders from countries meet annually, an agreement is not reached every year, environmental studies professor and Union of Concerned Scientists delegate at COP21 Anne Kapuscinski said. ""This [conference] was really important because the international agreement that these nations are currently operating from was the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020,"" Kapuscinski said. ""Countries have been hard at work for the past 20 years to negotiate a new agreement and it was understood and agreed upon that at this meeting, they were going to try to reach a new agreement for the global community."" The countries at this conference took a more cooperative approach in Paris. States agreed to individually reduce their carbon emissions to a specific target rate and mutually enforce and coerce each other into continuing to lower their emission numbers in the future, Kapuscinski said. Before and during COP21, countries submitted individual comprehensive national climate action plans to reduce carbon emissions. The long-term goal of the plans was to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. The governments also agreed to track each country's commitment through an extensive transparency and accountability system. The COP21 agreement will not be implemented until 2020 and the monitoring and verification mechanisms to see if countries are abiding by their commitment will not be in place until 2023, Sundaram said. Although the agreement is a step forward, Sundaram said he is less optimistic about its timeline. Yona expressed similar sentiments about some of the agreement's weaknesses. She said that the reality of the agreement, although positive on the surface, is that the sum of the individual commitments will be emissions well over the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit and around 3.5 degrees according to an independent study by Climate Interactive. ""The agreement is a big step forward, but at a time when we need a marathon,"" she said. The Paris agreements affect the Dartmouth community since it is a public statement about the end of the fossil fuel era. To meet the goals of this agreement, a ""deep and systemic transformation of our energy systems"" is needed, Curtis said. ""With our $4.7 billion endowment still exposed to the fossil fuel industry, we must act swiftly to divest, demonstrating both our moral leadership and financial prudence,"" she added. \"

(UNV, 2016) This week, Habitat III, the third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development is taking place in Quito, Ecuador, to establish a sustainable Urban Agenda for cities as we work towards achieving the Global Goals. Growing urbanization around the world comes with major challenges, among them how to build and transform cities into sustainable, safe, effective and resilient living places. Volunteerism allows communities affected by urban policies and practices to participate in the planning and implementation of urban projects, and volunteers can play a key role in bringing together local authorities and community actors. In this context, during a side event organized by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme at Habitat III, a panel of experts in urban planning and volunteerism has discussed the idea of localizing the New Urban Agenda while promoting local capacity through volunteerism in intermediate cities. Volunteerism can contribute to local governance and the implementation of the New Urban Agenda with an inclusive and sustainable participatory focus. The organization of Habitat III has been supported by over 700 volunteers trained by UN Volunteers through a youth volunteering programme by UNV and the Habitat III Secretariat. The programme goes beyond logistical support and includes the involvement of young people in the socialization of the New Urban Agenda. This initiative stems from UNV's previous experience organizing large United Nations events in Peru the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2014, and the Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund in 2015.

The COP22 conference on 7-18 November focuses on ways of implementing the first universally binding global deal on climate change, a matter of huge urgency for the planet. Parliament is represented at the talks by a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Italian EPP member Giovanni La Via. At the COP21 climate talks last December, 195 countries adopted the Paris agreement on climate change. The world's first universally binding climate deal, it sets out a global plan on how to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. The deal entered into force earlier this month after the European Parliament gave its consent to the EU's ratification. This week a delegation of 12 MEPs led by Giovanni La Via, chair of Parliament's environment committee, takes part in the COP22 conference in Marrakesh. Miguel Arias Canete, the European commissioner responsible for climate action, will brief the delegation on a daily basis. MEPs will also engage in talks with NGOs, industry and delegations from various countries. COP22 : 'COP OF ACTION' The focus of this week's round of talks will be on the implementation of the Paris agreement. Delegates will work on making national climate plans as clear and transparent as possible, and on ensuring that the actions taken are traceable and that standardised reporting methods are used. There will also be discussions on enhanced action prior to 2020. As part of the Paris agreement developed countries promised to mobilise at least $100 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Aiming to deliver on the commitments made, the negotiations in Marrakesh will revolve around who should pay into these funds and how they should be used. There will also be discussions on the need for further support for developing countries in terms of technology and capacity-building.

A decade later, "" \~ HYPERLINK http://www.indiewire.com/t/an-inconvenient-sequel/ An Inconvenient Sequel Co-directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (taking the reigns from ""Truth"" director Davis Guggenheim), the filmmakers manage to improve on the limitations of the original by showing more of Gore's resilience in the field.

In an upsetting opening montage, the filmmakers pair images of melting ice caps with audio clips of climate-denying critics putting Gore in their crosshairs. The sequence culminates with Gore facing down one such naysayer at a 2007\~ U.S. Senate hearing, calmly expressing his desire to find common ground. So begins a competently-assembled pileup of moments featuring Gore's ongoing efforts to elaborate on the destructive effect of carbon emissions, and the movie's assemblage provides a linear path for following his logic.

In another fascinating sequence, he visits the conservative Republican mayor of Georgetown, Texas, where renewable energy policies dominate in spite of the dominant political mood. As Gore beams at the notion of bipartisanship, it's impossible not to get swept up in his cause - and relate to his relenting optimism. While ""An Inconvenient Sequel"" mostly just celebrates Gore's outlook and gives him a fresh platform to make his case, it showcases his practical impact as well. During a key moment at the Paris conference, he hastily brokers a deal between India and the American energy company SolarCity, which results in a massive loan to help the country get onboard with the Paris accords. In his own words, he may be ""a recovering politician,"" but his diplomatic skills haven't waned. In the years since ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" climate change documents have congealed into a genre, with recent entries such as the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced ""Before the Flood"" and Charles Ferguson's visually alarming ""Time to Choose"" furthering the awareness-raising tactics kickstarted by Guggenheim's film. But Gore's unique blend of pragmatism and idealistic drive handily justifies this latest entry, particularly as it informs the present moment. The movie naturally acknowledges the Trump presidency, with fleeting images of Gore watching the would-be leader of the free world trashing climate change on television; in the aftermath of the election, he's plainly frustrated. Still, not all is lost. ""An Inconvenient Sequel"" caps off the story with media footage of Gore heading into Trump Tower as he recites the movie's subtitle, before he reminds viewers that he's survived naysayers more than once before. Rolling up his sleeves, Gore hits an inspiring note at a moment when it's in short supply, and his dedication to spreading his gospel suggests that in the next few years this franchise will need another installment.

During a talk titled ""A Vision for Asian Collective Energy Security"" at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Tanaka highlighted the potential for energy issues to both stir conflict and inspire partnership between nations, citing recent territorial disputes over oil-rich waters in the South China Sea. ""Energy has a very geopolitical and strategic nature,"" Tanaka said. Drawing on the success of the European Coal and Steel Community in encouraging European cooperation and peacebuilding after World War II, Tanaka illustrated the potential benefits of energy collaboration in ensuring regional stability. ""For Asia, if countries are interested in peace in the future, starting with controlling and coordinating energy is ultimately the first step,"" he said. For example, the ""Asia Super Grid""-a prospective energy infrastructure project that would link electrical grids in Japan, Korea, Russia, and China-could serve as a source of political collaboration as well as a practical solution to rising energy demands, Tanaka said. According to Tanaka, this rising energy demand is reflected globally. State actors and policymakers will likely face challenges after U.S. shale production subsides and oil prices increase, he said. Tanaka also addressed climate change and said significant political motivation will be required to maintain carbon dioxide emissions within reasonable limits. In 2007, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrote that a rise in global mean temperature of more than two degree Celsius by the end of the century ""poses significant risks to many unique and threatened systems."" ""The [International Energy Agency] believes that, despite the [2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ], CO2 emissions will continue to grow,"" Tanaka said. ""To make it to the two degree Celsius trajectory, you have to really reduce CO2 emissions with different technologies."" These changes would be costly, according to Tanaka, and would require sufficient political mobilization in order to invest in a more diverse ""energy mix,"" including renewable and nuclear energy. The influence of large carbon producers is particularly important in combatting this issue, Tanaka added. ""If China starts getting serious about combatting climate change, then other countries will follow,"" he said.

This gathering coincided with the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. Organized by Casablanca Finance City Authority, in partnership with Paris EUROPLACE and with the active participation of the African Development Bank, this ""Official COP22 Event"" helped deepen understanding on crucial issues for the future of climate finance, such as key success factors for green financing scale-up, mobilizing private capital flows, or green bonds as innovative financing instruments in and for Africa. During the conference opening, several significant announcements in line with the implementation of the Paris Agreement were made. Mr. Mohamed Boussa\'efd, Minister of Economy and Finance, stressed the importance of the Moroccan financial sector's involvement, announcing that a dedicated climate finance roadmap had been established, and will be presented at the COP22 in Marrakech. He added that the Kingdom of Morocco was currently working, with the support of the World Bank, to launch an initiative dedicated to climate change sensitive fiscal policies, while noting that: ""the financial resources necessary for the transition to low carbon economies are available, and that the instruments and ad hoc tools remain to be implemented."" Mr. Mustapha Bakkoury, Chairman of MASEN, announced the first green bond issue in Morocco of 1.15 Billion Dirhams (approx. 100 Million Euros). The funds raised will help finance three new photovoltaic stations in the Kingdom, with an aggregate capacity of 170MW. Other speakers added that the development of ""green bonds"" is a response to growing demand from investors looking to reduce the carbon footprint of their portfolios and projects. Mr G\'e9rard Mestrallet, Chairman of Paris EUROPLACE announced as Chairman of ENGIE the closing of the Hazelwood coal power plant in Australia. Finally, Mrs. Chinelo Anohu-Amazu, Director General of the National Pension Commission Nigeria, indicated the introduction of a regulatory framework for Nigerian pension funds' investments, which integrates sustainable development objectives. Furthermore, 19 international investors with assets under management exceeding 5,000 Billion Euros, announced their commitment to the preservation of the Arctic, by asking for an open-ended moratorium on oil and gas activities in the high Arctic seas. Several participating institutions have as such chosen the Climate Finance Day 2016 to premier the release of their reports, including the ""Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition"", a network of international investors led by UNEP FI and committed to publish annually their carbon footprint, which highlights an acceleration of asset portfolios'decarbonisation, with a commitment of 27 international investors and 600 billion dollars divested. The Inter-American Development Bank also released a preview of its report dedicated to sustainable infrastructure. Moreover, the ""Climate Policy Initiative""1 shared the most recent update of its climate finance flows' figures. All speakers converged on the major role played by climate finance as the ""Future of Finance"". As such, international financial institutions were presented as levers to catalyze global savings. Participants highlighted the importance of cooperation between public and private banks as well at local, national and regional levels. They also noted the risks and challenges of climate change for Africa. There is a tremendous opportunity here to make qualitative leaps (leapfrogs) and promote sustainable development, particularly in the fields of agriculture and energy. Finally, the conference highlighted the essential, vanguard role that Morocco plays as a catalyst and promoter of resilient growth, both at the national and regional levels, as well as Casablanca Finance City's commitment as a green financial center, to channel the needed capital to finance the transition towards low carbon economies in Africa and beyond.

Credit: Friday Phiri MARRAKECH, Nov 13 2016 (IPS) The Paris Agreement hammered out at the summit on climate change in the French capital last year committed all parties to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. The big question at the follow-up meeting here in Marrakech is how that deal will be implemented, especially for the developing nations of Africa. We have three major objectives at this COP: [the first is] to set a foundation for a strong technical and legal framework of the Paris Agreement, said Seni Nafo, chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN). Africa, currently the most exposed region, has only been able to access less than four percent of global climate financing the reason being lack of bankable projects on the continent. Dubbed the COP of Implementation,' the summit dubbed COP 22 is seen by the African group as an opportunity to refine some of Paris's unfinished business. Despite adoption last year, a number of key decisions in the PA such as modalities for achieving the 2 degree C. threshold, mechanisms to enforce compliance and achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation, among others, were deferred to COP 22 . One key issue for Africa is removal of bottlenecks to accessing climate funds. Available statistics from the African Development Bank (AfDB) show that Africa, currently the most exposed region, has only been able to access less than four percent of global climate financing the reason being lack of bankable projects on the continent. With the deal based on Nationally Determined Contributions, it is feared the challenge of access to climate finance for Africa might get further complicated as it has been discovered that most countries' NDCs are vague, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). ACPC is ready to support African countries in the revision of their Nationally Determined Contributions, most of which have been found to be defective, James Murombedzi, Officer in Charge at ACPC told IPS, adding that his organisation wants to see an inclusive implementation of the PA. Murombedzi said this would, however, not be possible if COP 22 does not lay a strong foundation. The talk over the years has been capacity building to achieve the required levels of preparing bankable proposals in most African countries. Nevertheless, experts have urged caution even as the continent pushes for this need. According to Balgis Osman Elasha, Principal Climate Change officer at the African Development Bank, Africa should avoid the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) trap' by perpetually pushing capacity building and miss out on serious climate funding opportunities. Elasha says Africa could not benefit from the CDM because it was caught up in the capacity building mode while others were taking action. CDM of the HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol Kyoto Protocol provided for emissions reduction projects aimed at assisting parties not included in \~ HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annex_I Annex I in achieving sustainable development and compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments. As highlighted, a balance between adaptation and mitigation features prominently in the negotiations. And for African economies, adaptation is not a question of the future but now. And Zambia's Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Lloyd Mulenga Kaziya underscored the need for urgent action especially the improvement of hydromet services. With these critical needs identified, the AGN is determined to ensure that Africa's voice is heard at the negotiating table especially now as the rules and modalities for implementation are being discussed. In line with our major objective of ensuring finance for adaptation, one key priority is to keep adaptation at par with mitigation, said Nafo of the AGN, adding that adaptation for Africa is not an option but a must. But on its part, the continent is not seating idle. At COP 21, the Africa Renewable Initiative (AREI) was launched to pave the way for Africa's transition to inclusive green growth. AREI already has resulted in significant financial commitment of over 10 billion dollars for renewable energy projects in Africa, according to the African Development Bank, one of the partners of the initiative. The tone for Africa's demands at this year's COP was clear on day one of the event as Salahedinne Mezouar, the COP 22 President, said: Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change, underscored Mezouar, implicitly referring to Africa the most exposed region whose contribution to global carbon emissions is just about 5 percent. As negotiations enter the second week, the African group remains optimistic that most outstanding issues, especially means of implementation, would be resolved for smooth implementation of the Paris Agreement.

This is Nicole Deaner with the State Department Press Office. Thanks for joining us today to discuss COP22 , which as you know, starts next week in Marrakesh and will be the first such meeting since the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. We're pleased to have on the call today Dr. Jonathan Pershing, the special envoy for climate change at the State Department, as well as John Morton, director for energy and climate change for the National Security Council. They will both give brief remarks, and then we will go to your questions. As a reminder, today's call is considered on the record. With that, I'll turn it over to Director Morton. MR MORTON: Hi, good morning, folks. This is John Morton speaking. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. I'm just going to begin with some very top-level kind of framing remarks and then turn it over to Jonathan to discuss more of the specifics of the -- of our preparation for the COP. So I think it's fair to say that we are all really looking forward to the COP, which, as you know, begins next week. We're coming into this year's COP with a tremendous amount of positive momentum. Reaching the Paris Agreement in December of last year was clearly a watershed moment for the international community and one that was appropriately reported in that way. But frankly, by all measures, this year, 2016, has been a truly historic year for international climate action. We have seen in the last two months alone the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement, much, much faster, years faster, than most people expected. And with that entry into force, that puts us on a much accelerated path toward implementation of the goals that we laid out in Paris a year ago. We have secured an ambitious amendment, as you know, to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and use of HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, a group of the extremely potent greenhouse gases, which by some accounts, that agreement will -- puts us on a path to avoiding up to a full half a degree centigrade of warming. And subsequently to that, we achieved adoption of a global market-based measure to set international aviation on a path to sustainable and carbon-neutral growth. And international aviation, as you may know, is one of the fastest growing segments of greenhouse gas emissions. So in the last couple months alone, due to the really kind of concerted work of this Administration and the president himself and many others throughout the international community, we've set the tone for coming into Paris in a -- coming into Marrakesh, excuse me, in a very, very positive light. So as we look forward to the two weeks ahead, we see COP22 is really a COP of implementation and action. So the Paris Agreement was a turning point in terms of setting in place a framework, an international framework for action. And in the COP that is approaching, we intend to really intensify our work in turning toward implementation. So we are -- in many ways we're at an unprecedented stage in climate negotiations because we finally have a framework for implementation that applies to all countries. Getting to this point required really eight years of consistent attention from the President, from -- beginning back in Copenhagen and driving through the entry into force of the Paris Agreement at unprecedented speed. And we think it's very fitting for the Administration's final COP to be one which is focusing -- turning its attention from negotiations to implementation. And I'm sure Jonathan will have more to say about what exactly that looks like. So I just wanted to frame the kind of how we got here over the last year, say that we're really looking forward to the two weeks ahead. And as we shift from negotiations to implementation, that will be the primary focus of our participation at COP this year. So with that, over to Jonathan. MR PERSHING: Thanks very much. This is Jonathan Pershing. Thanks all for joining us. I'll make just a few brief comments; we'll turn to questions. The first point is just to emphasize John's comment: This is now increasingly getting into an implementation agenda. The Moroccans themselves are calling this a COP of action. An action agenda is therefore one of the big things that they've got. That's going to feature work by businesses, by cities, by states and civil society, either themselves or in partnership with others on a variety of topics. So they've got an energy discussion, an agriculture discussion, an oceans discussion, a cities discussion, a whole variety of these, that really begin to elevate the implementation side. The second is there's going to be a series of discussions around the details and the negotiation of specific advancing -- as John noted, it's a framework a little bit in Paris in some components. This is the start now of the detailed implementation agenda. Guidelines for transparency, the rules for what countries have to report on, discussions further about how to implement the various adaptation provisions -- all of this will take place in the round of negotiations coming forward. The third thing that I note is that the political dynamics here are quite significant. We take advantage, and John's mentioned the things that have happened -- entry into force has occurred. That's a big political signal of intent and focus. The Montreal Protocol on HFCs, the amendment there has occurred. That's a huge win. Civil aviation has occurred. But we've also had resources being put forward on the private sector side. This is a year of the first time we've seen more investment in renewables than investment in fossil fuels. Those kinds of things are a clear mark of progress, and this COP will kind of reflect those and advance those. I don't expect the consequence of this negotiation will resolve all of these technical issues. We're on a very rapid timetable. We thought we had until 2020 to finish one of these negotiations. We're going to try to work now to accelerate it and make 2018 the year -- so a two-year advancing of the schedule. It will take a lot of that time. There's going to be a great deal of intense work that has to happen to deliver this, and that detailed part of Morocco is a part of the deal coming forward here. So that's what we currently expect. Let me turn to questions and see what people like to hear more about. OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question today, please press  then 1 on your touchtone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating you've been placed in queue, and you can remove yourself from queue at any time by pressing the pound key. If you are using a speakerphone today, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question for today's conference, please press  then 1 at this time. One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Amy Harder from The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. QUESTION: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for holding this call. What is going to be your message to fellow negotiators in Marrakesh who are worried about the legality of the Clean Power Plan and what kind of both substantive and symbolic impact it could have if it's overturned or partially struck down by the appeals court? I know the Administration and the President himself have been very -- expressing a lot of confidence that you will prevail, but the fact remains that you may not, and I'm sure in conversations I've had with people around the world that they are genuinely concerned about that. So how are you giving assurances on that front? Thank you. MR MORTON: Sure. This is John Morton. I'll give a quick answer and see if Jonathan wants to add anything. First of all, as you alluded to, we do believe that the Clean Power Plan is on very strong legal standing. We do believe the courts will come to that determination and that the Clean Power Plan will continue at pace. At the same time, this is obviously a question we've been getting for a good deal of time now, and at the same time many things have happened since the stay. The production tax credits were put into place subsequent to that, and those provide an incredible boost to U.S. renewable energy development. And so what we're seeing is the market is moving ahead very, very rapidly based on both policy incentives but also, to Jonathan's point, this is the first year in history where investments in renewable energy have outpaced those in fossil fuels. So the market is moving ahead much, much faster than most people understand and most people appreciate, and we believe that will continue irrespective of whether or not the Clean Power Plan is upheld. But again, we start from the assumption that the courts will find, as we believe, very strong legal standing for the Clean Power Plan to remain. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Igoe from Devex. Please go ahead. Mr. Igoe, your line is now currently open. Please go ahead with your question. QUESTION: Can you hear me? Hello? OPERATOR: Go ahead. QUESTION: Okay, sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick ones if I could. Obviously, with the presidential election on the second day of COP22 , that's going to be closely watched. Given the two candidates' very divergent positions on the Paris Agreements and climate action in general, do you, as the Obama Administration, sort of approach these negotiations or discussions with two different strategies, or do you just move forward sort of regardless of the outcome? And then second, loss and damage has been a key issue in recent years. Countries that expect to experience some sort of loss or damage from climate change are probably going to look for a financing mechanism attached to that. Does the Obama Administration have a position on what that financing mechanism might look like or if there should be one at all? Thank you. MR MORTON: Jonathan, why don't I take a crack at the first and then hand it to you for any elaboration and perhaps a -- take the second question. So this is John Morton again. On the question of the election, obviously, I think there is a great deal of interest not just domestically, but internationally in terms of what the election outcome will be. And as you suggested, the candidates have very different views on climate. I think what we have seen in recent months and in fact in recent years is a recognized now inevitability of the transition to a low-carbon economy. And so the international community -- the international business community, the international policy community -- is moving forward and will continue to move forward, and there's no questioning anymore about the commitment at both the government and policy levels to the -- both the letter and the intent and the spirit of the Paris Agreement. So we will see countries continuing to move forward at a fast clip irrespective of what happens next Tuesday. I think the question may be what role and how quickly the U.S. moves. But the international community is moving forward, and that's very clear based upon the three international agreements that we -- that I mentioned in my introductory remarks. I think the question of commitment to action is no longer one which is being debated. It's a question of how quickly it will move forward and, frankly, who will lead and who will benefit most from this transition to a lower-carbon economy. MR PERSHING: Thanks. Let me just turn to the second question, which is on loss and damage. The issue, for those of you who are not following this in detail, is a question of damages that countries are unable to cope with. So if you imagine some rise in sea level and you can move or you can elevate your buildings, that's an adaptive strategy. But if at the other end your island gets washed away and you can't live there anymore, that's a loss and damage problem. And that distinction is real, and we're beginning to see countries increasingly concerned about this agenda. But while it's real, it's some ways off in the future, and the focus on the financing side here has been on an adaptation agenda, not the financing on loss and damage. So while I expect it to be a conversation coming forward over the years, I don't really anticipate that this will be the focus of the conversation in Morocco. On the finance side, we certainly do see enormous efforts being made by countries around the world to increase their resources for adaptation, and many of the things that you're looking to do to prevent risks, to manage this tropical storms intensity, to manage increasing sea level rise, to manage drought -- those are things that are actually being funded with resilience programs through the multilateral development banks, through bilateral lending from countries around the world. And I would note that this is going to be increasingly something that countries themselves start to pay attention to. And this is not just a developing country issue. This is something we do in United States; it's something we see in Europe, as they manage their floods; it's something we see in Japan, as they manage constraints around increasing typhoons. All of this is coming, and it's a global issue, and we're seeing increasing attention to the problem. The negotiations will emphasize this probably significantly in Morocco. OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, if you do have a question or comment for today's conference, please press  then 1 at this time. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ryan from Bloomberg. Please, go ahead. QUESTION: Hi. Thanks for having the call. China's lead climate negotiator on Tuesday criticized Donald Trump's vow to back out of the Paris Agreement, saying it was out of step with global consensus. Would you comment on concerns on the part of China and others around the world about whether the U.S. will continue to be a leader on this issue if Mr. Trump is elected? MR MORTON: Sure. We have -- just -- this is John Morton here. We have a -- we obviously have a very strong relationship with China on climate. I think as many folks on the call will know, the strength of the China relationship on climate is in many -- in many ways enabled much of the successes that we've seen in both (inaudible) contributing factor in helping reach the (inaudible) that we mentioned -- that I mentioned earlier this year. So we certainly have a strong climate partnership with China that we expect and hope will continue into the future. As to the comments that were made, we certainly don't have any comment on them. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jean Chemnick from N-News. Please, go ahead. MR MORTON: Jonathan, did you want to take that? So I expect us to want to stay in the discussion, stay active in the negotiation, but actually increasingly worried about the risks. If we take a look again back at our domestic circumstances, flooding in Florida is a real consequence of climate change. The issues around superstorm Sandy and the flooding of the New York subways is a climate change phenomenon. If we think about the increasing drought in the American Southwest, we have -- probabilities have increased substantially because of climate change. So in my view, the issue of long-term dynamics here continues to play in favor of the U.S. staying deeply engaged. We're a leading country. We'll continue to be a leading country. I think that's the likely outcome and that's the message that we're going to be passing on to the global community. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Upton from Climate Central. Please, go ahead. QUESTION: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. It's been clear that neither the shipping nor the aviation industries have any kind of climate action plan that's in line with the Paris Agreement, and I was wondering if the State Department sees these as a problem, and if so, how might emissions from shipping and aviation be addressed if those industries don't take those steps themselves? MR PERSHING: So let me just take a first cut, and John might want to add some things here. The first thing is that in the civil aviation agreement that we just reached what was clear was that there are a number of pathways for the aviation community. One is a degree of improved efficiency, and they're currently working on that and that's a longstanding interest. Fuel costs are one of the highest costs for the aviation sector. But a second one is that we currently don't have scaled-up options where they can just convert to another fuel, although that's coming and technology is certainly moving. And so there has been developed in the aviation organization an agreement to work on offsets, where they can buy reductions in other sectors that can offset their own emissions while they are working on technologies themselves to reduce their emissions. A similar kind of a level of effort in understanding the opportunities is available in the shipping space. We've just had a meeting of the International Maritime Organization, the IMO, that met in London a couple of weeks ago. And the context of that agreement, what they decided to do was to develop a long-term strategic plan. Now, ships -- like aviation, pretty complicated, but even more so because of the diversity of the variety of classes, the sizes of vessels, the places that they go, the kinds of fuel that they use. So the idea here is to work on a much more detailed and disaggregated strategy where you can think about alternative options and ways that you could reduce emissions from the sector. A lot of design areas have gone into this; can you make hulls more efficient? Can you make the engines more efficient? Can you look at fuel replacement choices? The idea was a plan agreed at the IMO, and agreed for the first time after years of negotiation, was to advance the thinking and make available a strategic vision for how to carry this sector forward. So I see real windows and real shifts and these two sectors are in some sense the harbinger of things to come. Sectors are beginning to say, ""This is the world of the future. I have to do what I do with a much smaller footprint. And how do I make that happen, what are my technical opportunities, where does my investment have to go?"" That's the dynamic of the future and we're starting to see that with these two agreements in particular. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ritter from the Associated Press. Please go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. Back to Trump and his promise to cancel the deal if elected and the concerns that the U.S. withdrawal or backing away from its commitments could have some implications for the deal itself. I mean, we saw with the Kyoto deal that once the U.S. didn't join, it really didn't have much of an impact and other countries eventually dropped out or decided not to meet their commitments. Do you get the impression that the rest of the world would move forward with the Paris Agreement even if the next U.S. president were to withdraw United States from the deal? MR PERSHING: Let me take a first crack at that and John might want to add something. The thing that I think is fundamentally different about this agreement than any prior one is it's built from the national circumstances and national decisions of countries. It's not a top-down negotiation where the globe decided internationally about what each country should do. Each country put forward its own development plan in the context of aggressive efforts to reduce emissions. And so my take is that won't change; it doesn't matter who is in the United States, it matters what countries have decided to do. And what I see from China, what I see from Brazil, what I see from small countries like Costa Rica, what I see from poorer countries like Nigeria, like Senegal -- I see them all prioritizing this because it's part of their development agenda. I see them looking at how they get access to clean electricity -- not just that it's clean, but because they need to access, and the least cost way is a solar panel. I have seen thinking about electric vehicles, not because it's clean -- although it is -- because it means reduction in the imports of fossil fuel, oil in particular, which drive security. I see dynamics in which they reduce deforestation because it has huge impacts on water quality, as well as being a climate agenda. So for me they have identified things that meet multiple purposes and I don't think the U.S. dynamic is the key, I think it's this domestic agenda that stays high. And the fact that it was agreed by heads of state making these high-level political statements to me gives it even more force, even more likelihood of moving forward. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Fairley from MIT Tech Review. Please go ahead. Mr. Fairley, your line is open. Please check your mute button. QUESTION: Can you hear me now? OPERATOR: Yes, sir, go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. My question, Jonathan Pershing, you I believe made some comments a week or two ago about setting or unveiling a path to decarbonize the U.S. by 2050 at this meeting, and I was hoping you could talk a little bit about why you're presenting that, a bit about the outcomes that you see in that path and especially where it came from. Who did the modeling for this? What's the kind of basis for the path? MR PERSHING: Thanks very much. This is work that's still underway. We're working to finish it by the end of the year, which isn't very far out, so we're looking to do it quite soon. The intent here is to think in the long term, not only in the near term. At the moment, what we have from the world are commitments for 2025 or for 2030, but we know that by 2050 or certainly by the end of the century we've got to have deep de-carbonization. Twenty percent is not enough, thirty percent is not enough. We need to think about an 80 percent reduction or perhaps more. The President himself has talked about an 80 percent reduction as a place that we should be by 2050, and we have to think about how we do that. What are the kinds of elements that you want to be thinking about here? And this is work that's been going on for some time. The United States can draw on a rich diversity of academic work -- work that's been done at MIT, among other places, but also at Stanford, also in the Department of Energy's National Laboratories thinking through what are our technology choices, what are the opportunities for various kinds of reductions in each sector, how do you think about land use and forestry, not just energy? How do you think about transportation and industry and buildings? All of these provide opportunities for deep reduction. And we see real windows for change here. We see examples in other parts of the world and in some cases the United States where people have gotten 100 percent of their energy from renewable sources on individual days and increasingly now for weeks at a time. That's a possible trend. We see domains in which countries like Brazil are aggressively moving to completely get out of illegal deforestation. That could have a reduction that applies broadly. And if we look on our side at ways to manage our forests, we could maintain a forest sink. We see programs in which you can now buy a building, a house, that's net-neutral, does not produce any more and does not consume any more energy than it produces, has no net energy demand. That's new. That's the last few years of technology. That's now available. Those are the kinds of trajectories we want to be on. So we're looking at all of these. We're doing modeling with our EPA, with our Department of Energy and the Energy national labs, drawing on an academic community and wide literature around the world. And we look forward to continuing this discussion, not just over the course of this year, but beyond that as we look for much larger, deeper reductions in the longer term. QUESTION: So you're really just announcing that this work is underway and is coming within months as opposed to unveiling the findings? MR PERSHING: So we intend to have it before the end of the year. The exact timing is still to be determined. QUESTION: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Susan Phillips from NPR. Please go ahead. QUESTION: Hi. Thanks for having the call. So since subnational actors like cities will have to put much of what's required by these agreements into practice, and given their limited resources, it seems that a local government would prioritize adaptation over reducing emissions, right, because they just are going to get more back for their dollar regarding that. So I'm wondering what's the federal government's role and what's your plan to make sure that cities and local governments work to meet the emissions goals that the State Department's agreeing to in these agreements. MR MORTON: I'll just jump in really quickly here, Jonathan, and then hand it to you. I would say thank you for the question. It's -- you're absolutely right. The focus or the question of adaptation versus mitigation is one which has been central in conversations in previous COPs and will continue to be in this COP. I think you will -- you should stay tuned for announcements that we and others will have with respect to adaptation and our commitments to adaptation going forward. We certainly will have some new things to say around our commitment to adaptation. With respect to the role of local and state governments, I think you're absolutely right, that in many cases the focus is on adaptation. I would not, however -- I would, at the same time, say that local and state governments have a lot to do and are doing a lot already on the mitigation side. The policies, plans, codes, et cetera, zoning requirements and things that are at the control of local -- state and local officials are often as heavily focused on the mitigation side or can be as heavily focused on the mitigation side as on the adaptation piece. So I think both sides are very important for state and local actors. And we will have some adaptation-related announcements to make during the COP. Jonathan, would you add anything there? MR PERSHING: The only one point I'd make is that the former Mayor Bloomberg has been appointed as the envoy for cities to the climate change negotiations and the process. And he is a tireless advocate not only for the adaptation agenda, but also for the mitigation opportunities represented by cities. And we have a full day devoted to cities, a theme day, at Morocco. And I think we'll see a lot of city action on display at that session. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Coral Davenport from the New York Times. Please go ahead. QUESTION: Hi. Again, thanks for having the call. This is a little bit more of a logistics question, but you refer to these, Jonathan, as negotiations. And I'm trying to get a sense of what precisely will be sort of the concrete outcome that will be negotiated. And you specifically talked about the sort of -- the first example you gave was a system of the monitoring and reporting verification. How -- is that kind of an outcome that we can expect to see? If we wouldn't see that at the end of the Marrakesh conference, when would -- that seems like something like a concrete thing that's going to be negotiated. When are we going to see: this is the system that will be used? MR PERSHING: Yeah. Thanks very much, Coral. A couple of things here. The first is that this is the first meeting of something called the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. And the reason it's the first meeting is we passed the threshold for entry into force enough times before the meeting that the first meeting could be held in Morocco. So there are a number of decisions around that. We'll see some decisions for a work plan probably coming out. That gets negotiated, because there's a task -- a number of tasks, including on this transparency work, including on adaptation, and including on some of the deliverables for subnational entities. All of that comes forward. But -- so the work plan happens here. The work itself will take place between now and probably 2018. So I don't anticipate that we'll see a set of decisions that are conclusive from this meeting. They're more like process decisions: how will the work be carried forward; what do we prioritize, what things do we want to pick up first or second; what's the sequence of play that we have going forward. So I think that will be a lot of this technical work on the logistical side for conclusions. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emily Gertz from Participant Media. Please go ahead. QUESTION: Hello. Thank you for having this call. In regards to the tracking of emissions reductions, forests were included in the Paris Agreement, and forest conservation and preservation were included as paths towards net-zero carbon. But all the science so far seems to indicate that deforestation is outracing conservation and reforestation in the world as a whole, despite some significant increases in some areas, such as China's reforestation program. A lot of countries have made commitments on these fronts, but they're -- the action on the ground still seems lacking. I wondered where you think discussions on forests and their role in mitigation are going to go at this COP? MR PERSHING: Thanks very much. Two things that I would just bring to your attention: The first is that I think we, for the first time, have got commitments from developing countries where a lot of the deforestation is occurring that we never had before. And I think that the level of commitment has risen; often it's heads of state who have made it. I am struck by the continuity in some places of the policy. So for example, in Brazil, President Rousseff made the original commitment, but President Temer has followed it up and is the person who ratified the Paris Agreement with this commitment at its heart. And for them, they're looking at halting illegal deforestation entirely. I look at the consequences of a country like Indonesia, which has got one of the largest forest covers of any country in the world. Vice President Kalla came to a meeting in New York, which I was on a panel with him, where he spoke explicitly about the Indonesian vision of avoided deforestation and radical reduction and managing both the intensification of agricultural crops to minimize the need for it, but also looking at significant penalties for illegal deforesters. I had some time talking to people in the Congo -- Congo Basin, another huge forest cover area. We're seeing enormous interest there in avoiding deforestation and this comes from the heads of state. So I'm seeing a new trend in a way that I didn't think we used to have where this is the policy that people are investing in. So I'm much more optimistic than I had been, although I take your point, this is not easy. It speaks to a number of different dynamics in the forest community that we have to manage. There's going to be a lot of discussion around this in Morocco. I think it's going to be a discussion that will be ongoing, not just in Morocco, but beyond that. The number of drivers that are there around agriculture, around the use of (inaudible) paper products, around the questions of can you sustainably manage new forest development? All of these are new ideas or ideas that are taking hold in the national community with resources to match them in ways that I think will drive the consequences down. OPERATOR: Thank you. And at this time we have an opportunity for one final question and that question comes from the line of Timothy Cama from The Hill. Please go ahead. QUESTION: Hi, thanks. Just kind of from a ten thousand sort of view or so, could you tell me what are the United States goals going into this conference? What sort of do you hope to gain out of it if anything? MR PERSHING: So let me start it. John might want to add a couple of things here. I've put them in three boxes. One, we are seeking to make the world aware that we are continuing to prioritize this issue. Paris was not the end; Paris is a step. This is the first phase of an implementation agenda elevating that. Two, we are working to develop the rules and the guidelines that will give more flesh on the framework we developed in Paris. And three, we are looking to elevate the implementation agenda. This is the start no longer of a negotiating discussion around text; it's the start of an implementation and action program. And that will be manifest by a variety of people from the U.S. but around the world coming to enforce and to move forward on their emissions reductions. MODERATOR: Okay. All right, I think that concludes our call for the day. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to reading your stories. Thank you. \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA275","Adaptation Funding a Must for Africa","November 14, 2016 Monday 7:25 AM GMT","iCrowdNewswire (English)","By Friday Phiri MARRAKECH, Nov 13 2016 (IPS) The Paris Agreement hammered out at the summit on climate change in the French capital last year committed all parties to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. The big question at the follow-up meeting here in Marrakech is how that deal will be implemented, especially for the developing nations of Africa. We have three major objectives at this COP: [the first is] to set a foundation for a strong technical and legal framework of the Paris Agreement, said Seni Nafo, chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN).Africa, currently the most exposed region, has only been able to access less than four percent of global climate financing the reason being lack of bankable projects on the continent. The second key issue is to push for accelerating action after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and lastly but not the least, ensuring finance for Africa s adaptation. COP 22 is seen by the African group as an opportunity to refine some of Paris's unfinished business. Despite adoption last year, a number of key decisions in the PA such as modalities for achieving the 2 degree C. threshold, mechanisms to enforce compliance and achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation, among others, were deferred to COP 22 . One key issue for Africa is removal of bottlenecks to accessing climate funds. Available statistics from the African Development Bank (AfDB) show that Africa, currently the most exposed region, has only been able to access less than four percent of global climate financing the reason being lack of bankable projects on the continent. With the deal based on Nationally Determined Contributions, it is feared the challenge of access to climate finance for Africa might get further complicated as it has been discovered that most countries NDCs are vague, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). ACPC is ready to support African countries in the revision of their Nationally Determined Contributions, most of which have been found to be defective, James Murombedzi, Officer in Charge at ACPC told IPS, adding that his organisation wants to see an inclusive implementation of the PA. Murombedzi said this would, however, not be possible if COP 22 does not lay a strong foundation. The talk over the years has been capacity building to achieve the required levels of preparing bankable proposals in most African countries. Nevertheless, experts have urged caution even as the continent pushes for this need. According to Balgis Osman Elasha, Principal Climate Change officer at the African Development Bank, Africa should avoid the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) trap by perpetually pushing capacity building and miss out on serious climate funding opportunities. Elasha says Africa could not benefit from the CDM because it was caught up in the capacity building mode while others were taking action. CDM of the HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol Kyoto Protocol provided for emissions reduction projects aimed at assisting parties not included in \~ HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annex_I Annex I in achieving sustainable development and compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments. As highlighted, a balance between adaptation and mitigation features prominently in the negotiations. And for African economies, adaptation is not a question of the future but now. And Zambia s Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Lloyd Mulenga Kaziya underscored the need for urgent action especially the improvement of hydromet services. With these critical needs identified, the AGN is determined to ensure that Africa s voice is heard at the negotiating table especially now as the rules and modalities for implementation are being discussed. In line with our major objective of ensuring finance for adaptation, one key priority is to keep adaptation at par with mitigation, said Nafo of the AGN, adding that adaptation for Africa is not an option but a must. But on its part, the continent is not seating idle. At COP 21, the Africa Renewable Initiative (AREI) was launched to pave the way for Africa s transition to inclusive green growth. AREI already has resulted in significant financial commitment of over 10 billion dollars for renewable energy projects in Africa, according to the African Development Bank, one of the partners of the initiative. The tone for Africa s demands at this year s COP was clear on day one of the event as Salahedinne Mezouar, the COP 22 President, said: Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change, underscored Mezouar, implicitly referring to Africa the most exposed region whose contribution to global carbon emissions is just about 5 percent. As negotiations enter the second week, the African group remains optimistic that most outstanding issues, especially means of implementation, would be resolved for smooth implementation of the Paris Agreement.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA278","COP22 Press Briefing with Special Envoy for Climate Change Jonathan Pershing","November 14, 2016 Monday 7:55 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","The U.S. Department of State issued the following special briefing: Moderator: Good afternoon. Welcome. Thank you for joining us today with this press briefing with the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Dr. Jonathan Pershing. At the outset, Dr. Pershing will give a few opening remarks. Then we will open it up to questions. In the interest of trying to get as many questions heard as we can, we will take rounds of three, which Dr. Pershing will then answer. We have roving mics. When you ask a question, we ask that you please wait until you receive a mic, stand, and identify yourself and your outlet. We're only taking questions from the press today at this briefing. And we... there's a potential possibility that we will have another briefing later in the week so stay tuned for that. I will now turn it over to Dr. Pershing. Thank you. Dr. Pershing: Thanks very much Emily. And thank you all for joining. As you know President Obama and our Administration have made climate change a top priority, and we have made significant strides to cut carbon pollution at home, to help bolster our resilience to the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to combat this global challenge. The continued global momentum we have seen since Paris has been reflected in the successes of the last several weeks, including most particularly the Paris Agreement passing the thresholds needed to enter into force. Here, in the context of the climate talks, we've begun the transition away from negotiation and toward implementation. Our Moroccan hosts have really been excellent throughout, and we look forward to working with them going forward. The U.S. team has spent the last week in a series of consultations and informal meetings to determine the shape of various working groups and initiatives launched by the Paris Agreement. We've made real progress in many of them, although some dialogues and contact groups are expected to continue this week before concluding. We've been focused in particular here on the work to flesh out the transparency system, which is the bedrock of this agreement. Further, discussions on adaptation communications have helpfully focused on the guidance that will build on the extensive work of the adaptation committee. Conversations on the global stock-take have also been very productive. Parties have shared a range of views, but all are converging on a process grounded in robust scientific inputs from the IPCC. We're also tremendously excited this week to launch the first CMA under the Paris Agreement - namely, the first meeting of parties who have joined the Agreement. As you're also likely aware, we have a high-level delegation from the U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz has been here on the ground doing work on clean energy deployment and our Mission Innovation initiative. Secretary Kerry will join us tomorrow and Wednesday to hold a series of bilateral meetings and will deliver a speech that highlights the urgency of addressing climate change and the importance of continued ambitious climate action around the world. Furthermore, as we all know, soon we will see a transition to a new presidential administration in the United States. In the coming weeks, we expect personnel from the transition team to arrive at the State Department and begin planning the shape and thrust of American diplomacy for the next four years. At this time, I do not have information about when that process will start or who will play a role in it, and I cannot speak for President-elect's team, or to their outlook on international climate policy. What I do know, however, is the power of the movement and the enormous momentum created in Paris and built throughout the year since. Parties are deeply invested in seeing this work bear real fruit. With the Agreement having entered into force, it is no longer a question of whether to accelerate the Agreement's implementation - but rather a question of when and how. The Paris Agreement protects economic growth and the environment - all while providing nationally-determined flexibility to accommodate differing circumstances. It is durable. It is inclusive. It is ambitious. I also want to note we need new action going forward. We need to find strategies that protect our economic development while decarbonizing our system. We will release our strategy on Wednesday to suggest some sense of the trajectories that address this goal. I will finish by noting that it was a global effort that made the Agreement possible. And the passion and the dedication that drove it is in evidence throughout COP22 . Heads of state can and will change, but I am confident that we can and we will sustain a durable international effort to counter climate change. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Question: Thank you very much, sir. My name is Wardarif. I'm Bureau Chief of the Moroccan News Wire based in Washington. As you know sir, there are numerous press reports according to which President-elect Trump is seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from a global agreement regarding the combat against climate change. What credence can we give to these reports and what should be the international community be expecting? Question: Dean Scott. Hi, Jonathan. Dean Scott, Bloomberg BNA. My question is somewhat relevant in terms of what targeting the UNFCCC would do in terms of the U.S. continuing to maintain a seat at the table for a myriad of issues that go well beyond climate, more than two decades after the UNFCCC was agreed to. Question: Hi, this is Crystal Sun working for Phoenix New Media, which is a news website in China. Mr. Pershing, you've only been on this job for seven months, do you think you can lose this job in the following two months? Dr. Pershing: Thank you so much. The last one is actually the easiest one to answer. So thank you very much. As many of you may not know, the U.S. process is one in which the President appoints a series of individuals who serve in his administration or her administration. I was appointed by the President and my term, in any event, independent of the outcome of the election would end on January 20. So it's independent of the outcome here. So yes, I will end then. With regard to the first question, I don't really have any good insight for you. We are not yet in touch with the transition team. As I noted, they have not yet been named for our agency. We're waiting to talk with them. I anticipate that will happen soon after I return to Washington. But in the absence of that, we don't have any information to offer about our expectations for them. They haven't been in touch with us. With regard to the second question on the outcome of the finance -- the UNFCCC. Are there issues beyond climate? Of course there are. This is deeply tied in a broad way, climate deeply tied in a broad way to the issues of sustainable development. And as we think about what that means, if we don't avoid some of the damages and some of the risks, there are consequences to our economies. If we see them in every part of our system. If I look only at the United States, there's now substantially increased likelihood, because of climate change, that we will see flooding such as that that affected Louisiana only a couple of months ago. We see an increased likelihood that a storm like Superstorm Sandy, which came through New York, will be more significant and more frequent. We see in the American Southwest and in California an increase in drought. That also seems increasingly tied to the change in climate. So for me it's not so much the individual institutions, it's the question of the damages that we're trying to avoid. It's a question of how we collectively, as a global community, take these next steps. And I believe the U.S. economic community, the business community, state and local government communities, civil society will move in this direction. And I think that's going to be an imperative for all of us as we take this next years and next decade of action. Question: Thanks very much. Jessica Shankleman from Bloomberg News. There's a high level meeting on climate and finance on Wednesday. Oxfam says the G77 wants adaptation finance quadrupled. There's a lot of talk about the 100 billion dollar roadmap. Can these climate finance targets be met if the U.S. withdraws its climate finance funding as the President-elect has said he will do and if so, how? Question: Thank you. Karl Ritter from AP. I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about what kind of concerns you are encountering from partner countries in these negotiations in relation to the change of administration in the United States. And also, if you could comment on what withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would mean for the special relationship that the Obama administration developed with China on climate change. Question: Pilita Clark, Financial Times. Just following on from Carl's question, Nicholas Sarkozy said on the weekend that he believed that if Trump did actually pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement then the EU should offer and should look at a carbon border tax. I wonder if you've picked up any similar comments was you've been talking to other countries at this meeting. And also, there's obviously been a huge amount of speculation on how the U.S. could actually withdraw from the agreement. You probably know more than anyone else in the room about the mechanics of that. I just wonder if you could go through how quickly this could indeed occur if you were, for example, to withdraw from the Convention or if it goes to a House vote or perhaps another option. Dr. Pershing: So thank you very much. With regard to the first question on finance, my thinking has been that the U.S. has historically managed to pay its interests and commitments in these activities. I'm struck in that sense by the Bush Administration which agreed on a financial fund for technology, which we took a little longer to pay off but did in fact pay off. That was the Bush Administration moving forward. My personal view around this is that we will continue to meet our commitments. But I note that perhaps more important than that is the need to leverage private sector investment. The U.S. contribution to the Green Climate Fund over the years that we have pledged is about $3 billion dollars. If we come a little short of that, it will have only a marginal effect on the $100 billion. What I do know is that the leverage that we need has to increase. And the leverage that's already in this system is much smaller than what we think we can achieve. If we look at our effective financial institutions, they tend to leverage risk on the order of five or ten times for every dollar spent. The current structure leverages less than one dollar for every dollar spent. We can do better. And to me, we are very close already. We're close to the $100 billion already. The expectation we can exceed that easily with additional leverage is very high. The second comment. With regard to the negotiation and the election and what the relationship with China will be. I've had the chance to meet with the senior representative here from China and he has indicated as he has in the press (and you have seen his comments) that China intends to move forward. It doesn't surprise me. Frankly, the deal, the agreement was struck on the basis of national circumstances and agreements by nations of activities in their interest. Of course, they're going to move forward. These are things you would do because they are part of your development trajectory. I'm hearing the same from the Europeans. I'm hearing the same from the Brazilians. I'm hearing the same from Mexico and from Canada and from smaller nations like Costa Rica and from Colombia. I don't think the U.S. change here is going to affect the development pathway. I think people take the issue, as they ought to, as a serious problem. And, they are moving. With regard to the last question as to what the mechanics are, it's actually quite variable, unclear. I don't really want to speculate on what the new guys would do, but in every agreement there are provisions for how a person or a country might withdraw from it. And there are the same in this one. It takes a fair amount of time under the Paris Agreement. The process requires first a three-year waiting period and then a year between notification and action. That's the Paris Agreement process. But, I also note that there's flexibility for a country. And the new administration may decide to take advantage of some of that flexibility in its action. But it's premature to speculate. The new administration may look at the commitment globally, at the interest globally in the issue and may decide to move forward that are consistent with its own polities. We'll have to wait and see. Question: This is Lucia Graves with Pacific Standard Magazine. You mentioned that are some areas of flexibility with regard to the agreement. In general we're transitioning away from negotiation to implementation, as you said, are there any areas, where with the new administration possibly being less accepting of the Accord, you might have room for flexibility to negotiate? My name is Lucia Graves. I'm with Pacific Standard Magazine. Question: Alex Carlin from PR Watch. Addressing the transition, when the new guys come in and you're in a meeting with those people, we have a new situation that is unprecedented. Their policy is not an adult rational policy based on math or science, its something else. Dealing with an existential problem for the planet, you have two questions: can you appeal to them on a basic, rational level, in other words, educate them, number one. Can you set up any kind of symposiums where you educate them that two plus two is four and not five. And second, can you demonstrate to them that if they continue with this childish position, we, America, will lose our status, we will become a pariah state, we will be humiliated. Can you appeal to these people in your unique situation where you are going to be in a one-on-one meeting with the new team? We need people like you to do that. I just have a question on whether you have thoughts on that transition. Question: Vanya Walker-Leigh, Malta Business Weekly. Apologies for the cold. The UNEP gap report issued a few days ago once again urged the importance of not only post 2020 emission reductions on a much larger scale than is on the table now, but pre-2020 reductions. Do you think the COP22 should come out with a formal decision to review and increase the cap pledges and the set the commitment period commitments. Dr. Pershing: Thank you very much for these questions. With regard to the first one, the flexibility that exists in the Agreement is fairly broad around nationally determined contributions and countries are able to turn those indicative, intended NDCs into NDCs. There's also flexibility about how a country implements it. We did not choose, in the Paris Agreement, to say what policies you had to adopt. Instead, we asked each country to identify its approach, and to act accordingly. So there's a lot of flexibility available to nations in their determinations. With regard to the second question, we look forward to talking to the transition community. They haven't been named yet. We don't know who they are. We don't know their backgrounds. We will certainly work to convey the importance that we find in this issue to them as they move forward. With regard to the third question on the UNEP gap report, we recognize the urgency of additional aggressive action. And if you come on Wednesday you will have a chance to hear a presentation where we will relay some of our own insights on trajectories and opportunities for the long term goal that may include activities that we begin immediately and some that might wait for new technology, that may include programs at a state and local level as well as things that might be done nationally and that might be in collaboration with others. Question: Hello sir. My name is Claus Hecking. I work for Die Zeit, Germany's biggest weekly magazine. One question about the renewables. Are they economically competitive already in all parts of the U.S. or do they still need the support of the government such as the tax credits Mr. Trump wants to abolish? Question: Marlow Hood, with Agence France-Presse. Can you imagine a political argument that might be convincing to Mr. Trump as to why he should stay in the Paris Agreement and adhere to its terms? Question: Elaine Mills from Argus Media. Mr. Pershing, just a follow up to a previous question. What do you think the likelihood that if the Trump administration pulls out of the Paris deal that countries like China and the EU could introduce a carbon border tax and how is the U.S. likely to react do you think? Thank you. Dr. Pershing: Thank you very much. With regard to the cost of renewables, it depends a little bit on the circumstances in which they are being installed. We have a number of cases where you are not connected as easily to the grid or the grid capacity is more constrained, in those cases it is already commercially and economically cost effective. However, we also note that it is a Republican Congress that chose to undertake the tax credits and I would assume that they will continue. In that context, with those in the next five years I think that the price will continue to come down. And if we look at the market, the market is betting that will happen because the value of stocks goes up in the expectation of increasing returns on the investment. As I look forward this past year for economic reasons, we'll have more investment in renewables than we did in carbon based fuels. On the AFP question, with regard to the political argument for Mr. Trump, I really can't speculate. I don't have a sense of how the transition team will play out or what things he will find persuasive. In regards to the Argus question on the institutions and the response in terms of a European border tax, I don't know there as well. In my discussions so far, I think people are holding judgement about what the future will hold and will make some decisions following further information from the new Administration on to actions they will take. What I do know in addition is that they have also cited and stressed the importance of the issue and I think that importance will drive their actions both domestically and with respect to the new Administration.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA279","Leaders Must Act on Paris Agreement, Starting with More Funding","November 4, 2016 Friday 10:32 PM  EST","Targeted News Service","CARE International issued the following news release: The humanitarian and development organisation, CARE International, urges governments gathering at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco, to build on the Paris Agreement's rapid entry-into-force, and translate political momentum into actions that benefit the poor - those least responsible and yet most affected by the impacts of climate change. ""One of the greatest inequalities in the world is reflected in the causes and consequences of climate change which threatens the livelihoods of billions of people, especially women and girls. The legacy of the Paris Agreement will depend on its implementation, meaning accelerated emission cuts and a disciplined focus on protecting the world's poorest people in positive ways that can help them to adapt to these changes,"" said Wolfgang Jamann, CEO and Secretary General of CARE International. Globally, the last 12 months have been the hottest consecutive 12 months on record. Countries such as Mozambique are suffering the impacts of weather extremes. Refugee numbers are on the rise due to wars and conflict as well as drought caused by climate change. Children constitute about 41 per cent of the world's refugees, and about half of all refugees are women so solutions such as those in Mozambique can help vulnerable women and girls build their resilience to climate extremes: ""CARE's experience in Mozambique during this year's El Nino taught us that combining access to community-level credit sources, enhanced drought-resistant cropping and diversifying income sources can generate critical food stores and substantial household income,"" said Sven Harmeling, Head of CARE's delegation at COP22 . ""But this amount lags far behind estimated costs, and many of these countries still support activities that generate harmful fossil fuels every year, thereby undoing many of the benefits. Developed countries should increase public finance for good adaptation solutions to at least USD 35 bn by 2020, and strengthen the UN loss and damage mechanism, known as the Warsaw International Mechanism"", says Sven Harmeling.

Addressing a panel on ""Ocean and the Environment,"" Dr. El Haite said, ""Morocco understands the impact of climate change on oceans every day."" ""The oceans are not just part of an environmental agenda,"" she added, ""but an economic agenda and human agenda."" To address these environmental and economic challenges posed by climate change, the Kingdom has undertaken a number of initiatives to protect its oceans, including adopting laws against illegal fishing, promoting the monitoring of fishing fleets, and creating protected zones along the coastlines. Morocco, which will host the next Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) in Marrakesh this November, will place oceans at the heart of its COP 22 agenda. Dr. El Haite stressed the importance of linking the aims of the Our Ocean conference to the implementation of the COP 21 Paris Agreement. On the sidelines of the event, Minister El Haite told ClimateWire that oceans should be ""put in the heart of the development and human rights agenda"" of Paris, and that ""Including oceans in NDCs [nationally determined contributions] would be a clear political signal and commitment and would encourage more programs and initiatives from the private sector, the financial community and all the non-state actors."" At the conference, Morocco also announced a partnership with France and the Principality of Monaco to ensure better protection of the biodiversity and richness of Mediterranean Sea against climate change. S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne Royal, French President of COP 21, said the partnership will strengthen the fight against pollution, noting that the goal is to set ""rules of sustainable development"" and ""to protect the cradle of the Mediterranean, that links Europe and Africa."" Morocco is frequently lauded as a leader in climate change policy. The 2016 Climate Performance Index ranked Morocco among the top ten countries making the most progress in addressing climate change and number one among ""newly industrialized countries,"" citing the country as one that shows ""the potential of developing countries to move forward."" ""Morocco understands well the necessity of being a careful steward of the planet,"" said former US Ambassador Edward Gabriel, ""which is why the country has for years led the way in sustainability and environmental protection in the Middle East and North Africa."" The Moroccan American Center for Policy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

Following the Arab Spring and President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year reign, Morsi won the 2012 presidential election. Barely a year later, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led a military coup against the government. Along with political associates and Muslim Brotherhood members, Morsi was convicted of several crimes against the state. Morsi and 105 others were sentenced to death for their role in a 2011 jailbreak. Morsi will also get a new trial. Hong Kong After earning 81,422 votes during the election, Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of the Youngspiration party have been disqualified from taking office in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. In October, Leung and Yau amended their oaths with pro-independence rhetoric. Though somewhat autonomous, Hong Kong has been under the control of the Chinese government since 1997. The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region declared Leung and Yau refused their oaths. Other pro-independence lawmakers could have their oaths invalidated too. Morocco U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon addressed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's promise to abandon the 2015 Paris Agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech. ""I hope he will really hear and understand the severity and urgency of addressing climate change,"" said Ban, according to The Guardian. Other international leaders believe the U.S. should respect its commitment. According to Reuters, a withdrawal from the deal could harm U.S. prestige and bargaining power on other matters abroad. Poland In 2010, Polish President Lech Kaczynski and others aboard a Tupolev Tu-154 airplane died when they crashed near Smolensk, Russia. A report conducted by the Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents attributed the crash to pilot error and inadequate training. The Polish government has launched a new investigation to determine if the incident was an assassination. The bodies of Kaczynski and his wife were exhumed for autopsy on Nov. 15. Investigators will search for injuries that could result from explosives. United States On Nov. 14, Chief Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court Fatou Bensouda said there was a ""reasonable basis"" to believe U.S. military forces and the CIA committed war crimes of torture and related ill-treatment in Afghanistan from 2003 to as late as 2014. Fatou also stated the Afghan government and the Taliban violated international law. Though the U.S. initially adopted the Rome Statute creating the ICC, it never ratified the treaty and withdrew from the ICC under the Bush administration.

""The Wind Dies The Sun Sets,"" by Eric Weeks, chair of photography at the Pennsylvania College of Art & Design, and collaborator Joshua Reiman of Maine, will be shown continuously in Marrakesh, Morocco, site of a 12-day United Nations Climate Change Conference . The film was the winner in the Art Speaks Out 2016 contest by ikonoTV, the world's first 24-hour fine art television channel that broadcasts globally. The 15-minute film is billed as ""a contemplative consideration of energy extraction and use in Pennsylvania,"" from coal mining to today's fracking boom for natural gas. It has no dialogue. Rather, its impact and message is contained in brief bursts of scenes and sounds woven together from mostly western Pennsylvania. Weeks, 51, for example, plays a miner and is shown silently riding a bumpy rail cart deep underground into a deep mine. The filming site was the former Pioneer Tunnel Coal Mine in Schuylkill County. In other scenes, Weeks is a land surveyor, delineating woodland destined to be cleared for hydraulic drilling of natural gas. There are sweeps of forlorn homes in depressed coal towns, smoke billowing from power plants and the hum of crisscrossing skeins of overhead power lines. Other scenes depict Pennsylvanians' reliance on energy, such as turning on a gas stove in a home to boil water, using a computer, the click of a gas furnace turning on and the illumination of a Pittsburgh cityscape. The message? Weeks says he personally finds fracking and strip mining ""horrible."" But he and collaborator Reiman realize the necessity of energy makes the ethics of how it is obtained murky. ""We are all a part of it. The people down on the ground doing these things are not actually the bad guys. It's more complicated than that,"" Weeks says. Thus, he says the film is not didactic. ""It's very open-ended and presents a lot of facts. Hopefully, people will take what they see and make their own thoughts about it, which really is what art should do."" The film will be shown for the first time locally on Friday at the Pennsylvania School of Art & Design's gallery at 204 N. Prince St. as part of Lancaster city's First Friday event. An artist's reception will be held from 5-8 p.m. in the gallery. \"

Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) and also will overshadow the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting later in the week. ""I know the American people support this overwhelmingly,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said of the Paris Agreement on climate change that President-elect Donald Trump during the campaign vowed to rip up. Kerry is to deliver a speech at COP22 in Morocco about the importance of mitigating climate change globally. ""The president-elect is going to have to make his decision,"" Kerry said during a brief joint interview with VOA and Reuters at Abu Dhabi airport before his departure for Marrakech. ""What I will do is speak to the assembly about our efforts and what we're engaged in and why we're engaged in it, and our deep commitment as the American people to this effort."" Kerry this week flew to the Arabian peninsula after a sojourn in Antarctica meant to underscore the Obama administration's serious concern about environmental change. COP22 was intended to be a celebration, including for Kerry, and a discussion about implementation following the conclusion of negotiations at earlier conferences. Shift to skepticism ""I hope he will really hear and understand the severity and urgency of addressing climate change,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday at COP22 . ""As president of the United States, I hope he understands this, listens and evaluates his campaign remarks."" Possible actions by the Trump administration include withdrawing under Article 28 of the Paris Agreement (which has been ratified by 110 member states), ignoring America's voluntary commitments under the pact and halting international funding for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Following the climate conference, Kerry crosses the Atlantic to attend the annual ministerial meeting of the 21-member APEC forum in Lima, Peru. There, too, the American statesman will confront anxious counterparts, especially those who signed on to the U.S.-led Trans Pacific Partnership. But Congress will not approve the TPP before the start of the next administration. Some critics have declared it doomed. Kerry disagrees. A so-called ""lame duck"" session of Congress - which occurs after an election but before members of a new administration or new Congress are sworn in - ""always presents complications,"" Kerry said. ""I think the TPP is going to be thoroughly and well debated. It deserves its full hearing before the United States Senate."" Candidates critical Trump strongly opposed the trade pact on the campaign trail, and Clinton also said she was against it. President Barack Obama and his top envoy have been enthusiastic proponents. ""I think the business community overwhelmingly will see its passage as critical to their own prospects in the region, the fastest-growing region in the world,"" Kerry added. Leaders of the 12 TPP nations are to meet on the APEC sidelines to ponder their next move in the wake of Trump's election. Asked by VOA what he would tell them, Kerry responded that he would ask his counterpart TPP ministers to ""stay at it, we're not finished at all,"" because in the United States, those ""who support this are not suddenly going to vanish because there's a momentary lull in terms of a lame-duck session of Congress."" The trade agreement enters into force only after it has been ratified by six countries, but the list must include Japan and the United States. A failure at this juncture by the United States to ratify TPP would clear the way for a bolder push by China for regional trade pacts that it leads. ""If China has a good idea, we should look at China's good idea and see whether or not it makes sense for us, too,"" said Kerry, an acknowledgment that at least for now, the Americans on this particular bumpy road might have to hand the steering wheel to the Chinese. \"

Mayor Walsh will join a delegation of 20 U.S. cities that will attend the Summit. Organized under the U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group, this summit is an opportunity to exchange best practices between U.S. and Chinese cities, and more than 40 Chinese cities are expected to attend. ""Boston has made significant progress on climate action, and I am honored to share best practices with cities from around the world,"" said Mayor Walsh. ""This summit gives us an incredible opportunity to build on our legacy and learn how we can better protect Boston right now, and for our future generations."" The 2016 U.S.-China Climate-Smart/Low Carbon Cities Summit is jointly organized by the United States and China and aims to promote the implementation of the U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change made by President Obama and President Xi in 2014, as well as the Paris agreement made in 2015. The summit will expand and deepen the leadership of city and local leaders on climate change and address key low carbon development topics such as carbon trading, air quality improvement, non-motorized transportation, green finance and technology innovation. Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) Steering Committee, the governing body that provides strategic direction for the network of cities on the front line of preparing for and helping prevent climate change. Mayor Walsh is currently representing all North American cities on the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) Steering Committee. Boston joined C40 in 2014 and has made significant progress in the past two years, from the release of the updated Greenovate Climate Action, which sets a clear road map to achieve Boston's greenhouse gas reduction goals of 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050, to receiving an international award for community engagement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris. Just prior to COP21 last year, Boston celebrated its compliance with the Compact of Mayors -- an important measure in achieving its climate commitments by providing a more transparent platform for Boston's climate progress. The Compact of Mayors is a global coalition of over 500 mayors and city officials pledging to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change, and track their progress transparently, and Boston has been an integral signatory in following through with its commitment. \"

With help from avant-electronica producers Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke, she presents goosebumps-inducing protest music for an era marked by drone bomb strikes and global climate change. Hopelessness as a whole picks up where previous songs of dissent left off. ANOHNI employs Bob Dylan's lyrical stylings as demonstrated on his 1963 ballad ""A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall"" and adopts the dancing-while-marching vibe of John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band's 1969 rally chant ""Give Peace a Chance."" Vocally, she channels Nina Simone's mournful rendition of Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit."" You might remember when Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke discussed politics and music in an interview with fellow environmental activist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot last Fall, just before debuting two new politically charged songs at the Pathway to Paris concert held in conjunction with the United Nations climate change conference in December. In the interview that was published by French magazine Telerama, he said: ""In the '60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. ... It's much harder to do that now."" Yorke has written his fair share of songs calling out the global climate change crisis, including the entirety of his 2006 solo album The Eraser, yet he insisted in that interview: ""If I was going to write a protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It's not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone's mind."" Mere weeks later, ANOHNI shared ""4 Degrees,"" the first single off Hopelessness and the first song released under the singer's new moniker. The driving electronica track seems like the perfect response to Yorke's suggestion that the protest song as a call to arms might be dead. ""4 Degrees"" doesn't outwardly condemn corporate polluters or pro-fracking politicians; the song doesn't advise listeners to boycott anything or vote for anyone. Instead, the singer chooses to revel in the horror of total environmental destruction to the point of ecocide, and invites the listener to simply look the reality of global climate change in the eye. The song cites recent studies that suggest the planet's temperature is on track to rise 4 degrees by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions from human activity continue at their current rate; that increase of global temperature will lead to mass extinction of various species. 2016 Legal Monitor Worldwide. \"

The follow-up to 2006's Oscar-winning climate change documentary\~""An Inconvenient Truth"" includes Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election, a result that some environmentalists view as disastrous for the future of the planet. HYPERLINK http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/sundance-2017-full-lineup-competition-premieres-shorts-1201752136/ READ MORE: Sundance 2017: Check Out the Full Lineup, Including Competition Titles, Premieres and Shorts But 10 years after former U.S. vice president Al Gore frightened audiences with his slideshow of photos, charts and reams of data bluntly displaying the impacts\~of the global climate crisis, ""An Inconvenient Sequel"" finds a surprisingly optimistic Gore working tirelessly on his mission of spreading awareness about both the impacts of global warming and the concrete solutions humans can take to avert disaster. ""It's just astounding how both absolutely devastating it is in terms of where we are with the environment, but on the other hand absolutely hopeful in terms of where we stand with the choice of alternative energy,"" co-director Jon Shenk told IndieWire in a recent interview, adding that the\~film also captures the landmark 2015 climate agreement at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. Shenk directed the doc with his wife Bonni Cohen, who previously teamed up on the 2016 Netflix documentary ""Audrie & Daisy,"" about the effects of online bullying on\~teenagers. One of the first screenings at Sundance this year, ""An Inconvenient Sequel"" serves as the centerpiece of festival's New Climate program. Participant Media produced\~the doc, which Paramount Pictures is distributing. Richard Berge and Participant's Diane Weyermann are the film's\~producers. One of the reasons Gore has an optimistic outlook in the movie has to do with the progress that has already been made in combatting climate change. ""Although Trump seems to be a climate change denier and is making cabinet appointments related to oil, even a figure like him may not be able to stop what is already underway,"" Shenk said. ""That's part of the hopeful part of of the story - that there's just this incredible well of work and support that's going on in the alternative energy world."" Instead of relying heavily on Gore's famous slide presentation, ""An Inconvenient Sequel"" follows Gore as he travels the world to discuss climate change in places like Florida, Greenland and the Philippines. Part of his strategy involves\~framing the climate crisis as human issue rather than a political issue, and the film focuses on his individual journey much more than the original. ""We really strive to capture as much humanity as we can in our films,"" Shenk said. ""Powerful people who are trying to do herculean tasks are just fascinating to watch."" The doc\~also includes negative reactions to the first movie from many climate change deniers.\~""There's an endless amount of footage of people calling Gore a gross exaggerator, somebody who panics and worse,"" Shenk said. In the 10 years that have passed since ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" however, some of Gore's predictions about the dangers of climate change have proven to be accurate. One slide in particular from the original film predicted that the combination of storm surge and rising sea levels could flood lower Manhattan. ""It was a slide that Gore was really criticized for dramatically at the time,"" Cohen said, adding that she and Shenk included it again in the sequel. ""We obviously immediately cut to Superstorm Sandy, which did exactly that."" Though a number of Gore's predictions from the original film have taken place in an even shorter period of time than Gore originally estimated, the movie makes a point to explain that alternative energy technology has advanced significantly since 2006. ""We are in a position now much more so that we were 10 years ago to turn this around,"" Cohen said. ""The question is just how quickly."" Shenk and Cohen were a natural choice to direct ""An Inconvenient Sequel,"" having already collaborated on the climate change documentary ""The Island President,"" directed by Shenk and produced by Cohen. The doc focuses on former Maldives president\~Mohamed Nasheed, whose country is the lowest-lying in the world and has already been submerged in certain areas by rising sea levels. ""For us, climate change is not something in the future,"" Nasheed told IndieWire. ""It's already happening."" Gore and Nasheed will both take part in a Power of Story panel on January 22 at Sundance. Perhaps surprisingly, Nasheed shares Gore's optimism about slowing the effects of climate change, even in the Trump era. ""We must understand that the United States is the biggest democracy in the world and you can't lose everything through an election,"" Nasheed said. ""I have been told that President Trump in many many capacities has been advised on the kind of national security threat that climate change issues can bring.\~I'm sure President Trump would be mindful of the impact climate change will have on the United States in very many ways, as it is going to start producing immigrants and refugees.""

See MoreAs 'An Inconvenient Sequel' Debuts on Sundance Opening Night, Al Gore Vows 'We Are Going to Win This'[3] Although it opens with a self-congratulatory note about the popularity of the first entry, 'An Inconvenient Sequel' makes it clear that the fallout to that movie only intensified criticism of Gore's mission. In an upsetting opening montage, the filmmakers pair images of melting ice caps with audio clips of climate-denying critics putting Gore in their crosshairs. The sequence culminates with Gore facing down one such naysayer at a 2007 U.S. Senate hearing, calmly expressing his desire to find common ground. So begins a competently-assembled pileup of moments featuring Gore's ongoing efforts to elaborate on the destructive effect of carbon emissions, and the movie's assemblage provides a linear path for following his logic. While his PowerPoint again provides an anchor for the narrative, Cohen and Shenk thankfully emphasize a broader range of encounters, yielding a more engaging dramatization of Gore's efforts: He visits melted ice flows in Greenland, then traces the water to the flooded streets of Florida, drawing a clean line between different parts of the world impacted by rising temperatures. He converses with world leaders about ways of eliminating carbon emissions and tracks positive efforts around the world. And the movie finds an ideal climax with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , when some 55 countries agreed to eliminate greenhouse emissions. The cameras are with Gore in Paris when the November shootings take place, adding a grim context to the proceedings; his emotional address to his younger peers shows his capacity for leadership in dire times, implying\~the possibilities of the 2000 election\~that could have been. See More'An Inconvenient Sequel' Filmmakers on Al Gore and Fighting Climate Change in the Trump Era  Sundance 2017[4] Though Gore spends a few minutes sharing memories of his early days in the Senate, 'An Inconvenient Sequel' is largely a professional profile, and often tips over into hagiographic territory. But he's also a figure of deep sympathy, and his relationship to his fame in the aftermath of 'An Inconvenient Truth' gives the project a unique function: It acknowledges the impact of the first movie in addition to the ire it provoked from climate change deniers, giving Gore the opportunity to drop the mic on the issue all over again. At one point, he recalls criticism of the scene in 'An Inconvenient Truth' where he predicts the site of the World Trade Center reconstruction could be engulfed in water, then explains how that exact event transpired\~in 2012. In another fascinating sequence, he visits the conservative Republican mayor of Georgetown, Texas, where renewable energy policies dominate in spite of the dominant political mood. As Gore beams at the notion of bipartisanship, it's impossible not to get swept up in his cause  and relate to his relenting optimism. While 'An Inconvenient Sequel' mostly just celebrates Gore's outlook and gives him a fresh platform to make his case, it showcases his practical impact as well. During a key moment at the Paris conference, he hastily brokers a deal between India and the American energy company SolarCity, which results in a massive loan to help the country get onboard with the Paris accords. In his own words, he may be £ recovering politician,' but his diplomatic skills haven't waned. In the years since 'An Inconvenient Truth,' climate change documents have congealed into a genre, with recent entries such as the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced 'Before the Flood' and Charles Ferguson's visually alarming 'Time to Choose' furthering the awareness-raising tactics kickstarted by Guggenheim's film. But Gore's unique blend of pragmatism and idealistic drive handily justifies this latest entry, particularly as it informs the present moment. The movie naturally acknowledges the Trump presidency, with fleeting images of Gore watching the would-be leader of the free world trashing climate change on television; in the aftermath of the election, he's plainly frustrated. Still, not all is lost. 'An Inconvenient Sequel' caps off the story with media footage of Gore heading into Trump Tower as he recites the movie's subtitle, before he reminds viewers that he's survived naysayers more than once before. Rolling up his sleeves, Gore hits an inspiring note at a moment when it's in short supply, and his dedication to spreading his gospel suggests that in the next few years this franchise will need another installment.Grade: B'An Inconvenient Sequel' premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Paramount will release it theatrically this summer.

[1] Greenpeace Global Climate Policy Lead, Kaisa Kosonen, said: ""We saw the Paris agreement enter into force with ambitious goals and record speed, now we must see action that breaks new records every year. We will be the generation that ends fossil fuels."" On Thursday, the UN Environment Programme issued a stark warning to governments about the unfinished business from Paris. [2] Even if countries' current national contributions to the Agreement were implemented in full, the world would see an average global temperature rise which is double the level agreed in Paris. ""This gap between the goal and the action is a problem that will need to be fixed in the very near future with, as the UNEP says, faster and deeper emission cuts. Otherwise we'll let the agreement's temperature goal slip out of reach before the ink has dried. ""Here in Morocco, governments must focus on delivering a two-year work plan for a strong rulebook, faster emission cuts and increased support for the poor and vulnerable,"" added Kosonen.

Marrakesh, Morocco is hosting the COP22 from November 7-18, where international climate leaders will come together to focus on the urgent actions needed to ensure the Paris Agreement is implemented. ""We need a global financial system that's fit for purpose to factor in climate risks and opportunities,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. ""Developing a green bond market is key to mobilizing the private capital flows needed to address climate change. We were delighted to collaborate with the Central Bank of Morocco on this important initiative."" ""Having become increasingly aware of the effects of climate change, at the COP22 in Marrakesh, countries are now specifying how to achieve commitments made in Paris. Bank Al-Maghrib's investment in World Bank Green Bonds has been made in that context. The investment will support sustainable development projects financed by the World Bank, including in countries in Africa."" said Mr. Abdellatif Jouahri, Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib. The 3-year USD 100 million bonds mature on December 15, 2019, and have a semi-annual fixed rate coupon payment. The sole lead manager is Credit Agricole CIB. ""This investment sends a powerful message to the global investor and climate policy community about Morocco's commitment to climate finance,"" said World Bank Vice President and Treasurer, Arunma Oteh. ""Morocco is one of the countries that has benefitted from the World Bank's Green Bond program to support its transition to a low carbon economy and is now making an investment in the global transition to a greener planet. The World Bank Treasury is grateful to have partnered with Bank Al-Maghrib at the time of the COP22 in Marrakesh, for this transaction."" Since the World Bank's first green bond launched in 2008, the World Bank has issued 128 green bonds in 18 currencies, totaling approximately USD 9.7 billion equivalent. World Bank Green Bonds offer investors an opportunity to support environmental solutions through a bond product that benefits from the triple-A credit strength of the World Bank. World Bank Green Bonds help support the financing of projects in member countries that meet specific criteria for low carbon and climate resilient growth, seeking to mitigate climate change or help affected people adapt to it. The types of eligible projects include renewable energy installations, energy efficiency projects, and new technologies in waste management and agriculture that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help finance the transition to a low carbon economy. They also include financing for forest and watershed management and infrastructure to prevent climate-related flood damage and build climate resilience.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA292","Trump win raises questions about US pledge in climate deal","November 12, 2016 Saturday","St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)","MARRAKECH, Morocco - The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president could jeopardize a $100 billion plan launched by his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton seven years ago to help poor countries cope with climate change, delegates at U.N. talks said Friday. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign to withdraw U.S. tax dollars from U.N. global warming programs designed to help vulnerable countries shift to cleaner energy and adapt to rising seas and other impacts of climate change. The immediate worry for delegates at U.N. climate talks in Morocco was what Trump's election means for the White House's pledge of $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, a key U.N. climate fund. Only $500 million of that pledge has been disbursed so far. ""That could be worrisome, as that money was never approved through the U.S. Congress and we now have a president who is unwilling to put that type of money out there,"" said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, the chief negotiator for Congo and chairman of a group of least developed countries. The Green Climate Fund pledges are part of a wider effort by rich countries to mobilize $100 billion annually for poor countries, announced by Clinton in 2009 when she was U.S. secretary of state. The plan calls for scaling up financing to that level by 2020. So far rich countries say they're about two-thirds there, though many developing countries challenge that assessment. Climate activists are calling on rich countries to raise their contributions, fearing that withdrawing U.S. funds could have a domino effect. ""The U.S. is supposed to be the leader in raising this $100 billion,"" said Lidy Nacpil of the Philippine Movement for Climate Justice. ""So if the U.S. is not going to give, why will the other countries give?"" Trump told an oil industry conference in North Dakota in May that he would ""cancel"" last year's landmark Paris Agreement on climate change ""and stop all payments of the United States tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs."" To formulate his energy policy, Trump has chosen Myron Ebell, who believes an alarmist, overzealous environmental movement has used global warming as a pretext for expanding government. Ebell backs opening up more federal lands for logging, oil and gas exploration and coal mining, and he has urged the Senate to vote to reject the Paris climate accord. Many negotiators in Morocco hoped Trump didn't really mean what he said when he voiced opposition to the climate accord. ""There will be a distinction between campaign policies and real policies,"" Chinese negotiator Gu Zihua said. ""We should still wait and see what kind of measures the U.S. will take on climate change."" Mpanu Mpanu said a U.S. withdrawal would ""hinder"" but not stop the effort to raise climate money for developing countries. ""Instead of us being in the elevator bringing us to the next floor, we may have to take the stairs,"" he said. ""But we will still get there."" 'WE NEED  A MOVEMENT' Meanwhile, in Antarctica Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that citizens who care about limiting emissions might have to march in the streets to push for more aggressive action. Kerry became the highest-ranking American official to visit Antarctica when he landed for a two-day trip. He's been hearing from scientists about the impact of climate change on the frozen continent. ""We need to get more of a movement going,"" Kerry said when addressing several hundred scientists and staff at an evening event at McMurdo Station, the large base which is the hub for U.S. operations. ""We need to get more people to engage."" Kerry said there was a risk that much of Antarctica's ice will eventually flow into the ocean, raising sea levels worldwide. Kerry has made climate change an intensive focus of American diplomacy during his term and had previously spent decades working on the issue as a U.S. senator. \"

Na dia toa mahaliana aza dia tsy afaka hanome vahaolana maharitra amin'ny lafiny rehetra ara-pamaritana ny fitrandrahana solika sy etona. Ary mety ho lasa fijaliana\~ho an'ny vondrom-piarahamonina ao an-toerana ireo loharanon£ngovo noho ny tahan'ny kolikoly[8] efa manana ny lazany ao Libanona. Hoy ny tenin[9]'i Peter Willcox, kapitenin'ny Rainbow Warrior III hoe: It is time for people here to embrace what shines in the sky 300 days a year, not what's tapped from the ground. It is not just about building a sustainable renewable energy future for the region, it's about tipping the balance away from fossil fuels for the health of the planet while self-empowering local communities.

Nanazava ny maha zava-dehibe ny takela-masoandro ho an'ny faritra i Daad, mpikambana iray ao amin'ny kaoperativa: We are forced to work manually while our electrical machines are not being used. If we had electricity round the clock, we would have a greater production. Our work would greatly benefit the women working here as well as the growth of the cooperative.

Nanazava ao amin'ny habaka ny fomba ampiasaina ny vola izy ireo: The solarization of the women cooperative center will start with an energy audit that will identify its energy consumption. Then, a set of energy efficiency measures to reduce energy consumption such as lighting retrofit and piping insulation will be implemented. Finally, a solar energy system will be installed on the roof of the Cooperative.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA294","A New Era Of Ambitious Global Climate Action - Analysis","November 8, 2016 Tuesday","Eurasia Review","By Romy Chevallier and Elizabeth Aardenburg Nearly 200 countries are convening in Marrakesh, Morocco to advance progress made on the Paris Agreement on climate change. Signed by 197 countries last December, the Paris Agreement sets out the global expectations for dramatically reducing carbon emissions. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, signalling a true global effort to tackle the climate challenge. The 22nd Conference of the Parties meeting ( COP22 ) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change represents a crucial opportunity for member countries to demonstrate their commitments on climate change. From 7-18 November, COP22 must develop rules and processes for implementing the Paris Agreement to clarify and define operational elements for key issues covered in the agreement \- such as transparency and the process for taking stock of progress and ramping up ambition. This is crucial to ensure that the global temperature rise is limited to well below 2 degrees Celsius (above pre-industrial levels), the minimum that climate scientists believe is required to prevent serious climate-related consequences. The Paris Agreement gains momentum To date, 100 countries  including China, India, South Africa and the US  have ratified the Paris Agreement. Together, these countries represent 67% of global greenhouse gas emissions. South Africa ratified the Agreement just last week, on 2 November. When a country ratifies the Agreement, it commits to the decisive actions and policies outlined in its own national climate strategy. This 'Nationally Determined Contribution' (NDC) lays the foundation for actions and investment pathways towards clean energy, green infrastructure and climate resilience. Countries that have joined are legally bound to the Agreement. The Agreement's provisions include the requirement for all countries to report their climate actions transparently, collectively take stock of progress (starting in 2018), and enhance their climate actions every five years, while also scaling up finance. Countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement become part of the Agreement's governing body, called the CMA, with authority over all procedural and operational matters. The first meeting of this body (CMA1) will be held in conjunction with COP22 , marking the start of decision-making on how to implement the Paris Agreement and adopt its rules. CMA1 must ensure that Parties have adequate time to embed their NDCs in national legislation and policy \- especially many developing countries that have complicated internal processes for ratification, such as Nigeria, Angola and Sudan. One option is to extend CMA1 beyond the meeting in Marrakesh, while setting a clear deadline to conclude it. Heated discussions at COP22 The likely points of contention at COP22 include how exactly national commitments will be monitored and verified, and the global requirements for reporting on climate action. Agreement on the latter is necessary to develop more accurate ways to measure the cost of complex climate impacts and determine what should be supported under climate finance. Clarity is also needed on the plan to raise $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Current pledges from developed countries are insufficient. Questions remain around the future of the Adaptation Fund, set to end in 2020. Will the negotiating parties extend the mandate for the Adaptation Fund, or will there be another mechanism established that supports small-scale climate adaptation projects through direct access to funding? South Africa's contribution Last year South Africa submitted its national plan, which included an emissions reductions target of between 398 \- 614 MtCO2e (Metric Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide-equivalent) over the period 2025\- 2030, largely conditional on significant amounts of external assistance. Despite praise for South Africa's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme, questions remain around how South Africa will achieve its climate targets given its continued reliance on coal. Under the country's Integrated Resource Plan (2010-2030), coal generation will still account for the lion's share of energy production. Marrakesh presents an opportunity for South Africa to reiterate its intention to implement the Paris Agreement and do its part to curb climate change. South Africa ratified the Agreement after a process of domestic approval that required a process to ensure public participation and transparency, and a demonstrated commitment to poverty alleviation and green growth. The ratification has legally binding consequences and therefore implications at many levels and across multiple sectors. Even though South Africa has a responsibility to act, based on its historical emissions, it is currently experiencing low economic growth and budgetary restraints. This makes climate change aspirations difficult to prioritise. South Africans are also awaiting the National Treasury's decision on the draft carbon tax bill. What now? Despite the momentum built around the Paris Agreement, international efforts must be coupled with continued progress by countries at home to deliver on their national climate plans. This includes building the capacity for a major increase in ambition, and ramping up support for adaptation finance. The Moroccan COP President Salaheddine Mezouar must recognise the importance of inclusiveness and accommodate parties, where possible, that are genuinely committed to the process but that are still awaiting the necessary domestic approval. However, he must be careful not to lose the momentum generated by the success of the Paris Agreement. Also, as an African country there is hope that Morocco will be an advocate for the developing world agenda \- pushing a pro-poor, sustainable development agenda. There is now much work still ahead to turn the transformational promise of the Paris Agreement into reality.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA296","PNEUMONIA AND DIARRHOEA KILL 1.4 MILLION CHILDREN EACH YEAR, MORE THAN ALL OTHER CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES COMBINED UNICEF","November 10, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF): World leaders gathered at COP22 have opportunity to make commitments that will help save the lives of 12.7 million children by 2030 Pneumonia and diarrhoea together kill 1.4 million children each year, the overwhelming majority of whom live in lower and middle-income countries. These childhood deaths occur despite the fact that both illnesses are largely preventable through straightforward and cost effective solutions like exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, quality primary healthcare and reducing household air pollution. These findings are included in a new UNICEF report 'One is Too Many: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea' released today. Pneumonia in particular remains the leading infectious killer of children under five, claiming the lives of nearly a million children in 2015 approximately one child every 35 seconds, and more than malaria, TB, measles, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all childhood pneumonia deaths are linked to air pollution, a fact UNICEF said world leaders should keep in mind during ongoing climate change talks at COP22 . ""We have seen clearly that air pollution linked to climate change is damaging the health and development of children by causing pneumonia and other respiratory infections,"" said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Fatoumata Ndiaye. ""Two billion children live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds international guidelines, with many falling ill and dying as a result. World leaders meeting at COP22 can help to save children's lives by commiting to actions that will reduce air pollution linked to climate change and agreeing to investments in prevention and healthcare,"" Ndiaye said. Like pneumonia, diarrhoea cases among children can, in many instances, be linked to lower levels of precipitation caused by climate change. Reduced availability of safe water leaves children at greater risk of contracting diarrhoeal diseases and suffering impaired physical and cognitive growth. Nearly 34 million children have died from pneumonia and diarrhoea since 2000. Without further investment in key prevention and treatment measures, UNICEF estimates that 24 million more children will die from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2030. ""These illnesses have such a disproportionately high impact on child mortality and are relatively inexpensive to treat,"" said Ndiaye. ""Yet they continue to receive only a fraction of global health investment which makes absolutely zero sense. That's why we're calling for increased global funding for protective, preventive and treatment interventions that we know will work to save children's lives."" UNICEF is also recommending increased funding for child healthcare generally and also for that focused on groups of children especially vulnerable to pneumonia and diarrhoea the youngest and those living in lower and middle-income countries. The report shows: Approximately 80 per cent of childhood deaths linked to pneumonia and 70 per cent of those linked to diarrhoea occur during the first two years of life; Low- and lower-middle income countries are home to 62 per cent of the world's under 5 population, but account for more than 90 per cent of child pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths globally. ### \"
"COP22","USA","COP22_USA297","Green Passport lets Marrakech climate delegates walk the talk","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","US Official News","Nairobi: United Nations Environment Programme has issued the following news release Delegates to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech this year can now walk their talk by following the Green Passport Map of the beautiful  ochre city . Designed by UN Environment, the Moroccan Ministry of Tourism, Michelin and the Moroccan non-profit Association Mawarid for Environment and Energy, the map marks out hotels with the Cl\'e9 Verte (or  Green Key ) environmental label, green restaurants, spas and hammams that use natural local products, and over nine traditional craft shops. Of course, the Passeport Vert, or Green Passport, also includes the city\' s main attractions, alongside recommendations for reducing your carbon footprint such as cycle hire and bus routes. These recommendations will also be shared on social media as actions tourists can take to travel responsibly and walk with light footsteps in the city. The Green Passport has been making an appearance at major events and tourist destinations since 2008. Most recently, it was part of initiatives by UN Environment to green the footprint of the 2014 Football World Cup in Brazil, 2016 Rio Olympic Games, Rio+20 environmental conference, the Paris Conference on Climate Change and 2010 Football World Cup in South Africa. The idea behind the Passport is to support cities to educate and inform tourists who often use three times more water than residents in a city to help them reduce their carbon footprint. Activities have included training the hospitality industry, administering sustainability labels for gastronomy, and awareness and education campaigns specific to tourists and the industry that seek to reduce tourism\' s contribution of more than 5 per cent of the world\' s global emissions.  UN Environment\' s Green Passport provides tourists with the knowledge they need to be responsible travellers. Cities and the hospitality industry are critical partners for sustainable tourism and we\' re delighted to see the Green Passport land in Marrakech, said Nays\'e1n Sahba, Director of Communications, UN Environment. During the Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games, for example, UN Environment worked with Airbnb and shared Green Passport materials with over 100,000 travellers to Rio, posted social media content on its channels, organized and participated in green activities with their hosts and gave reusable bags to more than 2,000 tourists. The partnership has been extended for two more years. The tips offered in the Green Passport aim to change the behaviour of the one billion tourists that travel internationally every year, essentially aligning them better with the vision of sustainable development developed by countries last year through a set of agreements. Achieving sustainable tourism, for example, features explicitly in targets under at least three of the Sustainable Development Goals, pertaining to climate change, resource efficiency and the use and care of marine resources.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA299","Mars calls on global leaders to take bold action on climate change, accelerates its own renewable energy efforts; Company announces plans for new wind farm in M....","November 11, 2016 Friday 6:21 AM EST","PR Newswire","\~Mars, Incorporated is urging the business community and global leaders at COP22 to take bold action to implement the targets agreed last year in Paris for tackling\~climate change. Mars combined this call to action with an announcement of plans for a wind farm in Mexico-its third major wind energy commitment in as many years. Mars has an ambition to eliminate all fossil fuel use from its operations by 2040. Today the company is urging business and global leaders to do the same by setting ambitious goals that go beyond the national targets agreed at COP21. Barry Parkin, Mars, Incorporated's Chief Sustainability & Health and Wellbeing Officer, commented: ""This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society. It is imperative that global businesses, like Mars, do their part to face down those threats."" Mars' new wind farm in Mexico is the latest in a series of major renewable electricity projects. In just over a year, Mars has announced three new wind projects across three continents: In 2015, Mars opened its 118-turbine wind farm at Mesquite Creek, Texas. The wind farm now generates the equivalent of 100% of the electricity needed to power the entirety of the Mars U.S. operations.In 2016, Mars announced a partnership with Eneco to activate a 20-turbine wind farm in Scotland that is providing electricity from renewable sources equal to what's required to power all of its U.K. operations.In 2017, Mars will activate its new wind farm partnership with Vive Energia and Envision to provide the equivalent of 100% of the electricity required to power its five plants in Mexico-located in Quer\'e9taro, Nuevo Le\'f3n and Jalisco. This project is expected to drive a greenhouse gas reduction of over 25,000 tonnes of CO2-e. Damian Ryan, Acting CEO of The Climate Group said:\~""It's fantastic to see Mars progressing internationally-this latest announcement is another piece in the jigsaw for achieving its goal of 100% renewable energy globally by 2040. The move will also help to develop a growing renewables market in Mexico. It sends a clear signal of support to the Yucatan government that demand for renewables is rising, and that there's an alternative to using polluting fossil fuels in this environmentally sensitive area."" At COP21 in Paris, Mars joined the chief executives of the world's leading food companies to publish an open letter to global leaders pledging individual and collaborative action on climate change and urging governments to forge clear international agreements at the meeting. Also last year, Mars signed on to the American Business Act on Climate, led by the White House. The Act is a commitment to climate action that aims to rally business, government, academic, technical and scientific communities to tackle climate change in the U.S. and on a global scale. Mars' commitments are underpinned by the science-based goals that steer all of its sustainability programs-including achieving zero waste to landfill across all its sites by 2015, and eliminating 100% of GHG emissions from all global operations by 2040.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA300","DOE CARBON STORAGE ADVANCES FEATURED IN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL","August 18, 2016 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the U.S. Department of Energy, The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL): Although the IJGGC features a number of special issues centered upon meetings or topics, this is the first time that a special issue has been focused around results from a research team. Articles in the new IJGGC special issue detail critical advancements in scientific understanding, risk assessment methodology, and computational tool development related to full GCS system performance. Research topics in the collection include Reservoir response and plume evolution. Fluid migration through leakage pathways. Groundwater impacts. Atmospheric leakage. System integrated assessment. Strategic monitoring. Ground motion/induced seismicity. NRAP brings together scientists and engineers from across the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory complex to improve understanding of environmental risk performance of geologic CO2 storage. Led by the Office of Fossil Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, NRAP also includes members from the National Nuclear Security Administration (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory) and the Office of Science (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory). The partnership applies DOE's unique core capabilities in the science-based prediction of critical behaviors of engineered-geologic systems. Release of the IJCC special issue coincides with the completion of NRAP's first phase of research, which has resulted in the generation of first-of-kind scientific data, methodologies, and simulation tools to support quantitative assessment of environmental risks associated with industrial-scale GCS. Potential risks include impact to groundwater resources, leakage to the atmosphere, and induced seismic activity. Developing credible, science-based, characterization of those risks is key to overcoming barriers to the technology's wide-scale commercial deployment. Successful deployment of carbon-capture and -storage technology will play a critical role in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion and cost-effectively meeting the goals set in COP21, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference . NRAP is now transitioning into a second phase, in which the risk-assessment methodologies and tools developed during phase 1 will be applied to real-world CO2 storage sites, and new tools and findings will be generated to help effectively manage carbon-storage operations. A significant focus will be how to strategically monitor a geologic system to reduce uncertainty in its performance and build confidence that CO2 is effectively and safely stored.

Mayor Walsh will join a delegation of 20 U.S. cities that will attend the Summit. Organized under the U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group, this summit is an opportunity to exchange best practices between U.S. and Chinese cities, and more than 40 Chinese cities are expected to attend. ""Boston has made significant progress on climate action, and I am honored to share best practices with cities from around the world,"" said Mayor Walsh. ""This summit gives us an incredible opportunity to build on our legacy and learn how we can better protect Boston right now, and for our future generations."" The 2016 U.S.-China Climate-Smart/Low Carbon Cities Summit is jointly organized by the United States and China and aims to promote the implementation of the U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change made by President Obama and President Xi in 2014, as well as the Paris agreement made in 2015. The summit will expand and deepen the leadership of city and local leaders on climate change and address key low carbon development topics such as carbon trading, air quality improvement, non-motorized transportation, green finance and technology innovation. Earlier this year, Mayor Walsh joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) Steering Committee, the governing body that provides strategic direction for the network of cities on the front line of preparing for and helping prevent climate change. Mayor Walsh is currently representing all North American cities on the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) Steering Committee.

""A year ago, the world celebrated the passage of the first universal, binding agreement to mitigate climate change, but there is a clear disconnect between the Paris Agreement's stated ambition to limit warming to less than two degrees and the commitments countries have made. That gap must be closed,"" High Commissioner Zeid said. ""Climate change is a threat to us all and to future generations, and to the enjoyment of human rights now and in the years ahead. A continually warming world will be a graveyard for entire ecosystems, entire peoples and potentially even entire nations,"" the High Commissioner said. ""That each of the last three years has been the hottest on record shows why it is imperative to focus on implementing the Paris deal and to ensure that the commitments States made to respect and promote human rights in climate action are acted upon and deepened,"" High Commissioner Zeid stressed. Recent agreements to phase out hydrofluorocarbons and offset greenhouse gas emissions from planes represent positive steps but they are not enough, the High Commissioner noted. This is why the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) due to take place in Marrakech from 7-18 November is so important, High Commissioner Zeid said. ""States need to take urgent action at COP22 to make sure that the measures detailed in the Paris Agreement are carried out. This will require adequate financing, sharing of technology and capacity-building. States also have an obligation to work individually and collectively to foster an environment for the enjoyment of all human rights by all. For this, they need to show more ambition and more willingness to cooperate internationally."" The Paris Agreement establishes a framework to measure, review and verify States' commitments, and calls for cooperation to enhance climate change education, training, public awareness and participation, as well as people's access to information. ""This framework needs to be transparent and to integrate human rights considerations within its reporting guidelines. Accountability for action - or inaction - is essential,"" High Commissioner Zeid said. The High Commissioner noted that the rights of groups and people disproportionately affected by climate change must be protected. States must also take measures to ensure that the steps they take to mitigate or adapt to climate change, such as biofuel or hydroelectric projects, do not harm those they are intended to protect. ""The climate crisis represents a fundamental threat to the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. It requires coordinated, international action by States. Businesses must behave responsibly and respect human rights, including by taking measures to cut their greenhouse emissions. And we all, as individuals, must do our part by making responsible consumer choices and by increasing the pressure on our Governments to tackle climate change,"" he said. ""I urge all the parties that will be at the COP22 in Marrakech to ensure that the meeting is about States taking action in accordance with their international human right obligations,"" the High Commissioner said. ""The world cannot wait."" \"

The accord became operational on 4 November just days before the start of the COP22 international climate talks in Marrakesh where the implementation of the Paris Agreement will be a major focus. This is a very important development. The international support for the Paris Agreement and the momentum that has made it effective even earlier than expected shows that the world is now firmly on a path to taking a determined stand against climate change, said EBRD President Sir Suma Chakrabarti. However, he warned that the real work was now only just beginning. We have all made pledges on how to deal with climate change. Now we have to deliver. The EBRD will host a series of high-profile events at COP22 in Marrakesh. Senior EBRD representatives will also participate in other events during the 7-18 November conference, sharing the experiences of the Bank as a major provider of climate finance and climate expertise across 36 countries in three continents. The EBRD is participating in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP22 , which takes place in Marrakesh, Morocco. More videos The EBRDs sessions will include a discussion of the legal requirements that will help the planet move towards a low-carbon future. There will also be a debate on how to bring private finance to the challenge of combating climate change in the agricultural sector. With the 2016 climate talks taking place in Africa, there will be a focus on the EBRDs southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, which includes Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. The Bank will present its programme to develop private renewable energy markets in these SEMED countries. The EBRDs particular strength is engaging with the private sector including the private financial sector to address the global challenge of climate change. Other sessions in Marrakesh will include discussions on climate finance and carbon market policies and on the implementation of low-carbon solutions in cities across the EBRDs region of operations. The EBRD has long placed a high priority on delivering climate finance, having already invested over 20 billion in some 1,160 green energy projects worth a total of more than 112 billion since 2006. As its contribution to the Paris Agreement, the EBRD joined other multilateral development institutions in pledging to scale up its green financing. Under the Banks new Green Economy Transition approach, approved in 2015, it aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its total annual investments to green finance by 2020, compared with an average of around 24 per cent in recent years. Since the EBRD began working in the SEMED region in 2012, it has invested more than 1 billion there in around 45 green projects. Most recently the Bank provided financing for the construction of a new wind power plant in southern Jordan. The EBRD has been supporting Jordans renewable energy programme since 2012, including the development of solar photovoltaic power plants.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA305","PACIFIC ISLANDERS CALL FOR U.S. SOLIDARITY ON CLIMATE CHANGE","January 19, 2017 Thursday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The new political power of business magnate Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Jan. 20 as the 45th President of the United States, will have ramifications for every global region, including the Pacific Islands. Pacific leaders who are witnessing rising seas, coastal erosion and severe natural disasters in the region are alert to the new president's declared scepticism about climate change and the contributing factor of human activities. His proposed policy changes include cutting international climate funding and pushing ahead fossil fuel projects. They say the United States' solidarity on climate change action is vital to protecting people in developing and industrialised nations from climate-driven disasters, environmental degradation and poverty. There are 22 Pacific Island states and territories and 35 percent of the region's population of about 10 million people lives below the poverty line. One of the most vulnerable to climate change is the Polynesian nation of Tuvalu, home to about 10,000 people spread over nine low lying coral islands. ""Tuvalu is among the poorest in the world, it is isolated, small and low in elevation. All aspects of life, from protecting our small land to food security, from our marine resources to our traditional gardens are being impacted by climate change. All the adaptation measures that need to be put in place need international climate funding. With Trump's intended withdrawal pathway, our survival is denied and justice is ignored,"" Reverend Tafue Lusama, General Secretary of the Tuvalu Christian Church and global advocate for climate action, told IPS. Trump's 100-day action plan, issued during last year's presidential campaign, claims it will tackle government corruption, accountability and waste and improve the lives of U.S. citizens who have been marginalised by globalisation and 'special interests' of the political elite. But his intended actions include cancelling billions in payments to United Nations climate change programmes, aimed at assisting the most vulnerable people in developing countries, and approving energy projects, worth trillions of dollars, involving shale, oil, natural gas and coal in the United States in a bid to boost domestic jobs. Last December, 800 scientists and energy experts worldwide wrote an open letter to the then president-elect encouraging him to remain steadfast to policies put forward during the Barack Obama administration such as reducing the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which in association with industrial processes accounts for 65 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and supporting renewable energy development. ""It is sad for us who rely on the United States to do the right thing and to hear the President embarking on the opposite path, which is ensuring our destruction,"" Reverend Lusama added. London-based Chatham House claims that a key success of the COP21 climate change conference in Paris in 2015 was the supportive £lignment' of the United States, the second largest emitter accounting for 16 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Here the United States joined the High Ambition Coalition, a grouping of countries committed to rigorous climate targets, which was instrumental in driving consensus that global warming should be kept lower than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Increased global warming could be disastrous for Pacific Island states with many already facing a further rise in sea levels, extremely high daily temperatures and ocean acidification this century, reports the Pacific Climate Change Science Program. In 2015 the region was hit by a severe El Nino climate cycle which 'forced people to walk for days seeking sustenance...and, in some cases, to become severely weakened or die from malnutrition,' Caritas reports. In Papua New Guinea, 2.7 million people, or 36 percent of the population, struggled with lack of food and water as prolonged drought conditions caused water sources to dry up and food crops to fail. And a consequence of more severe natural disasters in the region is that their arc of impact can be greater. ""Kiribati is one country in the world that is very safe from any disaster....[but] during Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu [in 2015] and Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji [in 2016], the effects also reached Kiribati, which has never happened in the past,"" Pelenise Alofa, National Co-ordinator of the Kiribati Climate Action Network, told IPS. The economic toll of natural disasters is well beyond the capacity of Kiribati, a Least Developed Country with the third lowest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world in a ranking of 195 countries by the World Bank. The economic burden extends to replacing coastal buildings at risk of climate change and extreme weather, which would cost an estimated total of 22 billion dollars for 12 Pacific Island nations, claims the University of New England in Australia. The risk is very high in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu, where more than 95 percent of built infrastructure is located within 500 metres of a coastline. Recently several Pacific Island countries benefitted from the United Nations-administered Green Climate Fund (GCF), the largest multilateral climate fund dedicated to assisting developing countries cope with climate change. Three grants, ranging from 22 million to 57 million dollars, were awarded for a multiple Pacific nation renewable energy programme, to enable Vanuatu to develop climate information services and Samoa to pursue integrated flood management. But the GCF, to which the United States, its largest benefactor, has committed 3.5 billion dollars, could suffer if Trump follows through on his promise, given that international pledges currently total 10.3 billion.

"COP22","USA","COP22_USA306","Formula E gets fan boost from pioneering explorer Bertrand Piccard","December 7, 2016 Wednesday 11:49 AM GMT","CNN Wire","(CNN) -- He is a pioneering aviator and environmentalist with two record-breaking round-the-world trips to his name -- one aboard a balloon and most recently in the solar-powered aircraft, Solar Impulse 2. Now, Bertrand Piccard is giving Formula E an uplift, lending his support to the all-electric race series. Speaking on December's Supercharged show, the Swiss adventurer praised Formula E for leading the charge to make electric cars more practical and attractive. ""Formula E is for car racing, what Solar Impulse is for aviation,"" told Supercharged presenter, Nicki Shields. ""It's a new laboratory showing how clean technology can be sexy. It's not anymore about something that is boring and expensive, it's something that really attracts the awareness of people. It's spectacular."" Piccard and compatriot Andre Borschberg completed their historic solar-powered flight in July, touching down in Abu Dhabi after covering 26,700 miles (43,000 kilometers) over 23 days. With room for only one in the cockpit, Piccard and Borschberg took turns to pilot Solar Impulse during the 17-leg adventure which took 16 months to complete. The small cockpit contrasted with the vast 72-meter wingspan -- wider than a Boeing 747 -- lined with 17,000 solar cells, with four batteries powering four engines. ""It feels like science fiction,"" he says. ""You look at the sun and you look at your four electric motors turning the propellers and you have no noise, no pollution, no fuel and you know you can fly forever ... it's the wonders and miracles that clean technologies can achieve."" With his solar flight challenge complete, Piccard is now using that success to drive take up of renewable power on the ground, launching a new initiative at last month's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco. ""The next project is really for the years to come is my dedication to The World Alliance of Clean Technologies that I'm creating now. ""For me, this is the real accomplishment of the Solar Impulse project. It was my goal of what I initiated with this project -- to have a credible tool to encourage solar and clean technologies."" Formula E is currently on its winter break but returns with the Buenos Aires ePrix on February 18 -- round three of the 2016-17 world championship. The current season opened with new races in Hong Kong and Marrakech and will conclude with first-time venues Montreal and New York in mid-2017. As far as Piccard is concerned, the sport is only going in one direction in terms of popularity, helping persuade car owners to make the switch from old energies to new. ""This is the future of car racing. People are starting to get fed up now of cars that make so much noise, so much pollution. You have to go into the future, not into the past.""

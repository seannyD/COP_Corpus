"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa1","Watering the Paris Agreement At Cop24","December 05, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Most people will experience climate change in the form of water - higher frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, an increase in waterborne diseases, and overloaded sewage systems that are unable to cope with new demands. At the same time, water offers some of the best solutions for reducing our climate impact and tackling effects of climate change. Yet, the role of water is poorly understood and often forgotten in the international climate debate. The Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 24 At the meeting in Poland, the parties need to agree on the ""rulebook"" for the agreement, i.e. how it should be implemented. But water is largely absent from the agreement. However, many of the parties who ratified the Paris Agreement made water a central component of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). At the doorstep of finalizing the road map for implementing the Paris Agreement, the water community fears a missed opportunity to leverage water's full potential to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. With recent estimates saying that emissions must come down dramatically in the next few years, this is a risk the world cannot afford. Similarly, the most powerful manifestations of climate change are water-related and if that is not acknowledged, it will be difficult for countries to respond adequately. Climate change will also exacerbate water quality and variability, through changed precipitation patterns and changes to evapotranspiration and ultimately the water balance. Trees, landscapes and agriculture are, for example, key for reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Forests and wetlands act as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and play a central role in the hydrologic cycle, filtering, storing and regulating surface and groundwater flows. Forest and wetlands can also act as buffers and provide nature-based solutions to many infrastructure problems that increasingly need to be addressed by decision-makers, not least to make human settlements more resilient to floods and droughts. To ensure sustainable development, food security and economic stability in face of climate change, it is essential that water is acknowledged and integrated into efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its adverse effects. To take action is also a question of climate justice; the people most affected by effects of climate change are seldom themselves causing major emissions. Yet, at the same time they can be strong agents of change. Inclusion of marginalized groups and stakeholders is consequently key in resilient decision and policy making. The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) and AGWA, a network hosted and co-chaired by SIWI, are honoured to be official co-coordinators of the MPGCA (Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Agenda) at COP24 . Along with other partners, we have organised several climate resilient water related events.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa2","Get Ready for Cop24 - Transition to a Sustainable Future [opinion]","December 03, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","COP24 is the time for governments to act and increase their pledges to prevent global warming ensuring a just transition that leaves no one behind. The Paris Agreement and the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deliver a clear and potent message: we urgently need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius if we want to protect our ecosystems as well as the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. To prevent severe consequences caused by the devastating effects of climate change, it has become evident and imperative that ""business as usual"" is not possible anymore. We need a transformation to a zero-carbon world in pretty much all sectors; we need to decarbonize our energy systems, our industries as well as our transport systems, we need to establish sustainable ways to do agriculture, and we need to re-think the way we build cities. The challenges we are facing are enormous, but they come with endless opportunities as well. For the necessary transformation processes to be successful, they must be managed in a just and inclusive fashion: we need a just transition to a sustainable future! In December 2018, heads of State will gather for the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), in Katowice, Poland, to continue discussing ways to implement the Paris Agreement. A just transition will be high up on the political agenda. But what does it encompass? A just transition is defined by the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, as stated in the Paris Agreement, but in a way that the well-being of all people is protected. The recent IPCC report on 1.5 degrees spotlights the need for early action, once again reinforcing that a rapid transition across all sectors of the economy is necessary to mitigate the most catastrophic risks of climate change. There is great urgency involved--we only have 12 more years to turn things around! The lives and livelihoods of millions of people, especially in Global South countries, depend on fast action and ambitious climate policies to prevent the worst-possible impacts. For them, climate change is already a harsh reality, even though they have contributed almost nothing to its creation. A just transition can only be successful if it brings all affected groups to the table. It maximizes climate protection while minimizing the negative impacts of climate change and climate policy on societies, lives and livelihoods. Climate change will influence every sector of our lives. This includes the employment sector, which will be impacted by climate change as well as by climate change policies. Workers in the fossil industries and their families and communities are at the front line of the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energies. Their interests need to be considered in the process. Structural-change processes always have a strong regional component as sometimes it is coal or oil extraction which serves as the only source of employment in certain parts of a country. Good alternatives must be made available for people who will be affected by the phasing out of coal, oil and gas--even more so because that phase-out needs to happen fast to stop global warming. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius through a just transition of the world economy opens up many opportunities, including possibilities for decent work and quality jobs. Communities least responsible for and most negatively affected by climate change can and must profit from a Just Transition through poverty eradication, sustainable development opportunities and the creation of decent and quality jobs. There is huge job-creation potential in renewable energies. The jobs of the future need to be green jobs with decent working conditions everywhere in the world. A just transition is a time-limited opportunity to shape the necessary change. If we do not act now, the risks could be uncontrollable, not only for workers and their communities but also for societies, lives and livelihoods of all people worldwide. A Just Transition starts with a high level of ambition and accelerated climate action. This is the only way to ensure that there is sufficient time to implement the transition in a just way. Currently, countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not nearly ambitious enough, putting us on a pathway to global warming of 3-4 degrees celsius. What does that portend? Unbearable extreme weather conditions, sea-level rise that threatens the existence of many people, loss of biodiversity, lack of food security, disappearing coral reefs that are essential to a healthy balance of our ecosystems as well as an increasing number of climate refugees and violent conflicts fuelled by the consequences of climate change. Do you want to live in a world like this? COP24 is the time for governments to act and increase their pledges to prevent global warming. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa3","COP24 ignores dire climate warnings","December 18, 2018","Mail & Guardian","Katowice, Poland  The 2015 Paris Agreement delivered hope that nations could come together to fight catastrophic climate change, but the ensuing battle to draw up its rulebook has left the world on the edge of a precipice three years after the historic deal was negotiated. Now two climate change conferences in 2019, in New York and Chile, will have to try to salvage the failures of the 2018 effort, most notably getting nations to commit themselves to cutting their emissions even further to save the world. Although negotiators from 196 countries finalised a rulebook for the Paris Agreement at December's annual two-week climate change conference, hosted in Katowice, Poland, talks progressed at a snail's pace, with many countries stalling. The elephant in the room was the gloomy report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCCC) and the UN Environment Programme warning that time is running out. Although the rulebook was finalised in the nick of time this year, critics say it does not bring the world closer to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep the rise in global average temperatures to well below 2\'cb C from pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement consists of just 27 pages and its 133-page rulebook is crucial to the deal. At one point, the rulebook negotiations threatened to end in a stalemate, but some political manoeuvring, which the South African delegation help to facilitate, saved the day. Maesela Kekana, South Africa's chief negotiator, said he was happy with the deal struck in Katowice. ""We can't really complain. All South Africa's expectations were met. We delivered finance and transparency, two crucial pillars of the rulebook."" He said South Africa wanted two things from the talks this year. The first was a clear rulebook and the second was for nations to increase their ""ambition"" in cutting emissions. ""Unfortunately the ambition part never materialised,"" he said. Much of the conference was spent haggling over language on how to deal with the IPCC's damning climate report. The Trump-led United States, Kuwait, Russia and Saudi Arabia faction worked hard to bury the report, insisting in heated exchanges that the report's warning should only be ""noted"". The IPCC released its special report in September detailing the urgent need to accelerate climate policy to prevent catastrophic climate change. The latest report from the UN Environment Programme also shows existing climate targets would need to be increased ""around fivefold"" for a chance of limiting warming to 1.5\'cb C. Climate activists say the newly agreed rulebook does not do enough to put the world on this trajectory. ""This was the first opportunity since the IPCC report for countries to prove to the world that they were taking this seriously,"" said Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid's International Climate leader. ""They have just about scraped a \'cb C minus when the scientists of the IPCC showed that they needed to get straight As."" He said countries such as the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Australia and Brazil had clearly shown that they were not prepared to do what they said they would. Sven Harmeling from CARE International agreed that ""multilateralism"" was held hostage at COP24 by a few powerful countries. Getting countries to be more ambitious about cutting their emissions was the big disappointment of Katowice. It was expected that countries would give some indication of their willingness to do more than their current pledges. ""There is nothing here with ambition. Absolutely zero,"" Kekana said. ""But even earlier this year we could see it was never going to be part of this year's outcome."" Kekana said 2019's conference in Chile would be crucial for putting ambitious commitments centre stage in the negotiations. ""And we have the confidence that they will. The issue of ambition is not lost; there is still time to resolve it."" He said the climate summit in September in New York would also compel nations to table their actions. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa4","Decoding Article 6 of the Cop24 Climate Negotiations","December 14, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","It is close to curtain call for the United Nations' Climate Conference in Katowice, Poland, with ministers from around the world negotiating the text for a ""rulebook"" to implement the historic 2015 Paris Agreement for climate action. Amidst the various issues being debated, one of the most technical and complicated is Article 6 of the agreement, which focuses on the country plans for climate action. While the world has been having climate conferences since 1992, the tide turned with the Paris Agreement when all countries agreed to play their part to undertake climate action. ""Developing countries now have a strong political will to contribute to the greenhouse gas reduction,"" said Hyoeun Jenny Kim, Deputy Director General at the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an international organisation that promotes balancing economic growth without harming the environment. This political will was manifested in Paris with countries voluntarily submitting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for reducing carbon emissions and building climate resilience, taking into account their respective circumstances. ""But at the same time, they need support to affectively implement their NDCs,"" Kim said, at a side event at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ), which was organised by GGGI and focused on transparency and NDC implementation. In order to get support from outside, Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of a country's carbon emissions reduction is almost a precondition as many donor agencies and even private sector organisations want to know how much greenhouse gases a developing country is emitting before they make a decision to support it. ""MRV is key for developing countries to get access to financial, technical and capacity building support, and that's why we are supporting developing countries to set up more proper and internationally acceptable MRV scheme,"" Kim said. GGGI's interventions in this area include preparing a low emissions development strategy for Fiji, Colombia's national green growth strategy and Mongolia's national energy efficiency plan. The organisation is also working on building capacity to implement MRVs in various countries around the globe, including, Mozambique, Senegal, Nepal and Laos. ""We will continue to support our members and partners in their efforts of effectively implementing NDCs with robust MRVs, so they can access more finance,"" Kim said. ""We are committed to reminding countries that green growth can happen."" One of the speakers at the panel was Ariyaratne Hewage, Special Envoy of the President on Climate Change, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, in Sri Lanka, which is on track to become a member of the GGGI. He said Sri Lanka anticipates extensive support from GGGI in the years to come for its preparation of various project proposals to fight climate change. ""The present situation in Sri Lanka is severe droughts in one part of the country and heavy floods in another,"" Hewage said. During a 2016 survey conducted by the Bonn-based NGO Germanwatch, Sri Lanka was awarded the fourth place in terms of climate vulnerability. ""We are severely affected by climate change, so we are very keen in developing climate change programs to ensure these problems are properly addressed,"" Hewage said. The proposed emission reduction i.e. mitigation targets of Sri Lanka's NDCs include 30 percent reduction in the energy sector and 10 percent reduction in transport, industry and waste by 2030. ""For energy and transport sector we already have developed MRV systems, but for the other sectors - industry, waste, agriculture, livestock, forestry - we need help,"" he added. The need for support was also stressed by Ziaul Haque who leads the Bangladesh delegation's COP24 negotiations on Article 6. ""Our main issue is lack of capacity to address this enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement at both the institutional level and the individual level,"" said Haque, highlighting the need for accurate data. ""We need to bring data on green house gas emissions from different institutions and whether they are collecting and archiving the data in the right manner is an issue that needs to be looked at. In this regard our institutional arrangement is not very strong at the national level,"" he said, stating that strengthening the capacity of institutions and individuals who will be dealing with the transparency issue is crucial. Rajani Ranjan Rashmi, a Distinguished Fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and former Special Secretary of India's Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, said at the side event that one of the fundamental issues to deciding a transparency framework is that of flexibility. ""Developing countries should be able to make gradual progression on the quality of data,"" he said. ""We have so far not been able to agree in the discussions on this level of flexibility."" Moreover, whether the same guidelines regarding MRV of greenhouse gases should be applied to all countries is also an issue of contention at COP24 , he added. Jae Jung, Deputy Director of the Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center (GIR), another panelist at the side event, said having common metrics and structured summary is crucial. ""At this moment we don't have the final text of the Paris rulebook, but we do have a very clean text of the common metric with no bracket, so there might be agreement on that,"" Jung said. ""In terms of global stock take of emissions we don't have to have a common metric in our inventory. But when we do the global stock take every five years there has to be someone doing the conversion applying the same common metric to all countries' inventories,"" he added. He also stressed the importance of ""structured summary"" - a form of presentation of aggregated presentation of data that makes it possible to see the level of carbon emissions of one country - stating that helps to avoid double counting issue. ""There is opposition to structured summary because some parties want to use qualitative indicators and narrative descriptions of their NDCs,"" he said, ""But how does it make sense logically to have qualitative results when you have a quantitative target?"" One way to address the multifaceted challenges to NDC implementation would be through engagement of the private sector, according to experts. ""Many people think Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is about the market itself, but it is about increasing cooperation,"" said Dr. Suh-Young Chung, Director of Center for Climate and Sustainable Development Law and Policy (CSDLAP). ""If you look at the Paris landscape to meet the 2-degree Celsius temperature target, you realise it is not enough and you need to bring in private sector investment. And countries need to work together on this,"" he said, adding that Article 6 eventually needs to promote cooperation with the private sector, via incentive mechanism to engage businesses and addressing the risks they face. ""Article 6 is about bringing more opportunities for developing countries, but to do so, you need MRVs first,"" he said. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa5","Poor Progress and No Finance Commitments At COP24 in Katowice","December 08, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change is in limbo as developed countries remain noncommittal to financial obligations at the ongoing negotiations in Katowice, Poland. Professor Seth Osafo, the Advisor to the Africa Group of Negotiators (AGN), said today, Dec. 8, that his colleagues from the developed world were shifting goals to put the burden of financing the implementation of the Paris Agreement on the private sector. Osafo was addressing the Pan African Parliament and civil society organisations under the umbrella of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) during COP 24 . ""A man who is drowning has no luxury of a choice. Africa is drowning and we have no choice, other than using all means to salvage the continent."" -- Augustine Njamshi, the executive director of the Bioresources Development and Conservation Programme in Cameroon. The Paris Agreement is an agreement reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, France, where the world's nations undertook a determined course to reduce climate change. Among the commitments was to keep the increase in global temperatures under 2 degrees Celcius. Osafo's concerns were confirmed by Mohamed Nasr, Chair of the AGN. He said that during this past week there had been very little progress with regards to financial commitments from the developed world to address loss and damages related to past injustices, adaptation, gender equality, and the empowerment of women, among other issues. The seeking of a commitment from developed nations on this is being spearheaded by the African team. ""The progress so far is not up to expectations, and if this is the way [negotiations will] go, it means we will not be able to implement what we agreed to in Paris,"" said Nasr. ""We should not choose parts of the agreement to implement and leave other parts behind,"" he told IPS in an interview on Friday. Despite the challenges, a document for negotiation must be drawn up by tonight. This past week, negotiators representing different Parties (countries) have been discussing the outline of what is known as the 'Rulebook' for the Paris Agreement. This includes the rules, procedures and guidelines that countries should follow to enable them implement the Paris Agreement at national level. The outcome of the week-long negotiations will then be submitted to ministers of the various countries on Monday for deliberations to decide whether or not to adopt positions taken by technical teams. ""We are hoping that we will finish drafting the rules of implementation today, so that we have a document to show to the ministers when they arrive for political engagements next week,"" said Osafo. Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries committed to availing 100 billion dollars by 2020 to finance implementation of the accord through the Green Climate Fund (GCF). However, there have been setbacks. During the Paris negotiations the United States, which is considered to be one of the main polluters of the environment, pledged to deposit three billion dollars to the GCF. Under former President Barrack Obama's administration, the country delivered one billion dollars. But since President Donald Trump assumed power he has rejected the agreement, adding that climate change is a hoax. At the Katowice negotiations, the U.S. and the European Union are asking for a Rulebook that will not demand they divulge the exact amounts of money they provide to poorer nations for climate finance, especially to cater for loss and damages. This has not gone down well with African civil society organisations who have demanded the fulfilment of the pre-2020 climate finance commitments at the onset of the negotiations earlier this week. ""We see a clear intent from the developed country parties to shift their convention obligations on the provision of climate finance to private institutions and, worse still, to developing countries. This is not, and will not be, acceptable,"" said Mithika Mwenda, the Executive Director at PACJA. ""If it continues like this, we will be forced to protest or even pull out from the negotiations altogether,"" he told IPS. Augustine Njamshi, the executive director of the Bioresources Development and Conservation Programme in Cameroon, said: ""We have no option, but to use all available means to make things happen."" ""A man who is drowning has no luxury of a choice. Africa is drowning and we have no choice, other than using all means to salvage the continent,"" he told IPS. Nasr said that the African negotiators have been forced to send messages through informal discussions with colleagues from the developed world to salvage the situation. ""We are just telling them that if we do not have the components that we have asked for, the package will not be for Africa, and Africa will not be part of it,"" he said. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa6","Looking Beyond Fossil Fuels to Reduce Emissions","December 06, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","In midst of the 24th United Nations climate change conference ( COP24 ), many are trying to double down in the search for practical, actionable solutions to the climate crisis: land itself. Ahead of the ongoing COP24 , the U.N. Environmental Programme (UNEP) launched a report warning that the international community's pledges under the Paris agreement, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, thus, ambition gap has already lead to the current impacts of climate change that can be seen around the world and will continue to see for decades to come, World Resources Institute's (WRI) global climate senior associate and one of the lead authors of UNEP's report Kelly Levin told IPS. ""The ambition of current country commitments is not in line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement. If we continue to do what we are doing right now, we are going to see over 3 degrees Celsius warming,"" she said. UNEP's annual 'Emissions Gap Report' found that governments must triple their efforts as emissions must be reduced by a quarter by 2030 to keep warming no more than 2 degrees Celsius and would have to be halved to read the 1.5 degree Celsius target. Not only is there a gap, but the report also found that there was a rise in emissions in 2017 unlike recent years. While much of the attention remains on the need to reduce fossil fuel use, land restoration and reforestation are often neglected as solutions to the crisis. ""I think that there is an underrecognition of how important the land sector in particular is right now... it is one of the most immediately available opportunities and relatively least cost,"" Lubowski said. According to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the land-use sector represents between 25 to 30 percent of total global emissions. Tropical deforestation alone accounts for 8 percent of the world's annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. If it were a country, it would be the world's third-biggest emitter. Though land-use change emissions have remained relatively flat, action targeting the sector is ""low-hanging fruit"" that can close the emissions gap by up to 30 percent, Lubowski noted. ""Reducing deforestation has already proven to be the most viable large-scale solution. What's needed I think is to go beyond these just sticks and try to introduce some carrots in terms of some positive incentives... And we haven't even come close to exhausting that opportunity,"" he added. Moving Around The Money Fiscal policy reform is among the most effective tools to create incentives for low-carbon investments and reduce GHG emissions. ""Both the traditional fiscal policies as well as creating these carbon markets and emissions trading programs have really a big part to play in land-use, particularly tropical deforestation,"" Lubowski told IPS. He pointed to ecological fiscal transfer as one such policy as it allows local governments to receive tax revenue and resources based on their performance on conservation. The inclusion of conservation indices as part of decisions around fiscal allocation provides incentives for local municipalities to protect land and forests as well as resources to expand such protections. Without resources, local governments may be forced to allocate land to agriculture, industry, and construction in order to generate revenue. Only a few countries have implemented the policy with Brazil being the first to take advantage of the opportunity with its ICMS-E programme. This has lead to a 165 percent increase in the extent of conservation area between 1992 and 2000--equivalent to an increase of more than one million hectares of protected areas. For instance, Parana, a southern Brazilian state, devoted five percent of the municipal tax share towards the protection of biodiversity conservation areas and watershed areas and has since expanded its protected areas. Brazil's efforts in curbing deforestation as a whole led to the decrease of almost 30 percent of GHG emissions. However, there are now concerns that the newly elected Jair Bolsonaro will reverse the country's trends after advocating for the reduction in conservation areas, increase in mining in the Amazon, and even the abolishment of the Ministry of Environment. Neighbouring Colombia has taken a slightly different approach to that of Brazil by implementing a tax for every ton of CO2 a company is responsible for emitting. Revenue from the tax are allocated towards land preservation and sustainable development in rural communities. The fiscal policy also provides an incentive for companies as they can be exempt from paying a carbon tax if they become carbon-neutral or engage in offsetting activities such as environmental projects. A similar carbon offsetting and reduction approach is also being designed by the aviation industry which is could be responsible for approximately five percent of global GHG emissions by 2050. The Future is Trees Since the land sector make up approximately 20-25 percent of NDCs, it is increasingly important to implement policies towards restoration and conservation, Lubowski noted. However, both Levin and Lubowski noted that this will not be enough to reduce the emissions gap and reverse trends. ""We need action in every sector. We need to step away from fossil fuel energy sources and move towards clean energy sources, we need to stop deforestation and restore our lands, we need to curb emissions from agriculture, we need to address transportation and have zero energy cities,"" Levin told IPS. According to the UNEP report, if all fossil fuel subsidies alone were phased out, it would lead to a 10 percent reduction of emissions by 2030. ""We know what the ingredients are for success, we know how to do this. It's not going to cost a lot and it will actually bring significant [benefits]... it's just a question of getting down to it,"" Levin added. ""I am definitely worried about where we are, especially if we are thinking about 1.5, the land sector becomes even more important in terms of not only reducing emissions which is essential but also going negative,"" Lubowski said. He urged for more international cooperation in reducing emissions and greater focus on forestry as a way to ramp up ambition in a cost-effective way. Levin highlighted the need for countries to scale up their commitments by 2020 and COP to step up. ""[COP] will be a really important moment to reaffirm the process for countries... it's the first test of the spirit of the Paris Agreement and it needs to send a really clear message of enhancing ambition,"" she said. \"

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa8","What the COP24 Needs - a New Emerging Mindset","December 19, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","An alternative framework of international development and new forms of consumption of good/services are implicit in achieving the goals of UN climate conference recently held in Poland. With 4.3 billion persons living on $5 or less per day, we cannot expect these persons or their countries to initially participate in the cost of climate change improvement without more favorable development. The reduction of hunger and poverty are inherent in the fight for a better climate because the poor are exactly the most exposed and least protected to adverse climate change. Rather than favor the developing world, the advanced nations have encumbered them with debt and exportation of profits; the net financial flows for the developing world are negative by 26.5 trillion dollars between 1980 and 2012 (Hickel, 2017). A more radical and effective development framework is emerging as proposed by the same author in his book the Divide. Certainly it will be an uphill battle as it involves elimination of debt burdens of developing countries, more global democracy in international financial institutions, more just wages, tax justice and land security. Obviously the current Western model of production and consumption is highly individualistic, targeting through advertising our desires, by following the trails of our digital lives through almost all of our Internet apps on cell phones and other digital devices. Even our political orientation can be influenced in this way. The consumption is short-term ""sugar-high"" satisfaction, to be repeated by purchase of another product shortly thereafter. This is extremely costly to the environment, overloading us with the production, consumption and transportation of products that serve secondary needs. The capitalization of companies selling consumer discretionary goods/services is 60 per cent of the capitalization of companies in the entire consumer sector of the S&P500 companies this year (Bespoke, 2018). And this is in sharp contrast to what really makes us happy: strong social relationships. The famous Harvard Study of Adult Development has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier. A new model of consumption is emerging based on social experience and sharing. The experience of culture in a social setting in the form of a concert or intelligent tourism staying with local natives and guides are examples. In the future, services that enhance our sociality will grow. We also have come to realize that we can share under-utilized capacity of our basic properties such as homes and automobiles; and the sharing economy has been born. In the past everyone enjoyed owning a car or a record, instead now use is more important that ownership. This greatly reduces the number of goods that must be produced. Sociality and sharing have a much lighter ecological footprint than the continuation of individualistic consumption of goods. The long-term gains of the sharing economy in terms of better utilization of capacity have been estimated at 570 billion euro for the EU28, according to the European Parliamentary Research Service (Goudin, 2016). Developing nations should be aware of these alternatives; otherwise they will develop slowly and fall into the trap of consumerism that business is so anxious to sell, which may lock them into energy infrastructures and greenhouse gas production that they could have, at least in part, avoided. We are reminded that according the latest data 670,000 MW of coal power plant capacity is currently in planning or already under construction in 59 countries (Urgewald, 2018). We are individuals and will always require some satisfaction of individual needs beyond the basic requirements of food, shelter, health and education; but at our best we are social, and should recognize that we have let individualism go too far in consumption and international relations.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa9","Call for a Win-Win Framework At COP24","December 05, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","An African delegation is in the Polish city of Katowice to join 30,000 delegates and thousands others from almost 200 countries attending the 4th edition of what has come to be known as annual climate change negotiation conferences organised under the auspices of the United Nations. This year's conference comes 24 years after the establishment of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, and it is the fourth since countries inked a deal in 2015 in France where after years of disagreements, adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change. The two-week conference takes place at the backdrop of the alarm sounded by scientists working under the auspices of U.N.-mandated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose special report released in October warned of dire consequences if the global community fails to put in place drastic measures to arrest the accumulation of climate-polluting emissions which cause global warming. In its ""state of the climate"" report released few days ago, the World Metrological Organisation (WMO) indicates that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years the global average temperature, and if the trend continues, the temperatures may rise by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by 2100. This spells doom for communities at the frontline of climate change impacts, but which may not be aware that the shifting seasons which are making it impossible for them to plant crops as they used to, the erratic rainfall which appears late and ends even before they plant, and are characterised by floods that wreck havoc in villages and cities, recurrent droughts which wipes their livestock and crops, are all manifestation of the changing climate which they should learn to live with in the foreseeable future. The negotiations taking place in Katowice are aimed at discussing the best way possible to defeat challenges posed by climate change. Over years, discussions have centred on the efforts to reduce the green house gases believed to accelerate global warming, and how to live with the damage already caused while helping those who are unable to absorb the shocks emanating from climate change impacts. At stake is the so-called ""Paris Rulebook"", a framework of the Paris Agreement implementation which has already resulted into fissures between delegations from developed countries and poor countries. Developing countries, especially those from Africa, want the elements of the Paris rulebook to be as unambiguous as possible to avoid past deliberate oversights that have rendered impotent previous Pacts aimed at addressing climate change. On their part, industrialised countries are fighting to ensure the framework helps them escape their historical responsibility, which they successfully achieved under the Paris Agreement that seemingly has watered down the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Whether Katowice will deliver a balanced rulebook or an eschewed framework favouring the powerful countries due to their manipulative, intimidating and/or carrot-dangling strategies will be judged in the two weeks. Throughout 2018, the Fiji Presidency has facilitated over a series of trust-building conversations meant to agree on contentious issues, including emission reduction levels by countries, support for poor countries and sources of money for such efforts. The Fiji-facilitated interactions, known as Talanoa Dialogue, have been characterised by mistrust and normal rituals witnessed in all negotiations, and sceptics see no credible success in breaking the persistent North-South divide. Though Fiji has tried its level best to apply the spirit of ""Talanoa"", which means, trust-building, the good intentions of the Pacific Island State have not helped to move the process forward. Indeed, the president will be handing over the baton to his Polish counterpart with his only achievement being process-based "" where are we... where do we want to... how do we want to go there"" ritual, which avoided to tackle the hard questions threatening to endanger the gains so far made in international climate governance system. For African countries, any framework for the implementation of Paris Agreement that does not define the source of money and technology is hopelessly barren. Rich countries have turned the negotiations into market places to expand markets for their goods and services. In their effort to turn climate change into business opportunities, the industrialised countries and those in transition such as China, India and Brazil have encouraged their major transnational corporations to train their eyes on the emerging opportunities in the ""climate sector"", where sectors such as ""climate-smart agriculture"", ""forest as Carbon sinks, ""clean coal"", ""climate finance, ""low-carbon"", ""climate resilient growth"", are gradually overtaking normal development discourse. There is nothing wrong in turning the challenge of climate change into opportunities as the industrialised countries have vouched in the ensuing transformation where even international development assistance is conditioned. What is curious though is the fact that these conditionalities may disadvantage people already suffering the impacts of climate change. In addition, many donors are only interested in projects that are mitigation in nature, such as energy and major infrastructure projects which assure them on bigger profit margins. Adaptation, which does not have return for investment, is not attractive to many donor partners nor private sector investors. A win-win framework in Katowice which considers the interest of industrialised countries and their businesses, as well as developing countries and their vulnerable communities to enable them transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient development trajectories without jeopardising the livelihoods of the present and future generations is thus the most suitable outcome. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa10","Africa Remains Resolute Heading to COP 24","October 18, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","In December 2015, nations of the world took a giant step to combat climate change through the landmark Paris Agreement. But African experts who met in Nairobi, Kenya at last week's Seventh Conference on Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA VII) say the rise of far-right wing and nationalist movements in the West are threatening the collapse of the agreement. The landmark Paris Agreement focuses on accelerating and intensifying actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, through greenhouse-gas emissions mitigation, adaptation, finance, and technology transfer among others. And as Parties struggle to complete the implementing measures needed to get the Paris regime up and running, African experts have identified the need to speak with one unified voice, saying a shift in the geopolitical landscape threatens climate negotiations. ""The rise of 'the inward-looking nationalist right-wing movement and climate deniers' in the West is a signal of hardening positions in potential inaction by those largely responsible for the world's climate problems,"" Mithika Mwenda, secretary general of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance, told the gathering. Mwenda said civil society organisations were seeking collaboration with governments on the continent and stood ready to offer support as Africa seeks homegrown solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Katowice, Poland in December, is earmarked as the deadline for the finalisation of the Paris Agreement operational guidelines. Since 2015 when the Paris Agreement was reached, the world has seen a shift in the geopolitical landscape, ushering in a climate-sceptic Donald Trump as president of the United States, and several far-right wing nationalist movements gaining power in Europe. ""Two strong groups have joined forces on this issue - the extractive industry, and right-wing nationalists. The combination has taken the current debate to a much more dramatic level than previously, at the same time as our window of opportunity is disappearing,"" said Martin Hultman, associate professor in Science, Technology and Environmental studies at Chalmers University of Technology and research leader for the comprehensive project titled 'Why don't we take climate change seriously? A study of climate change denial'. For his part, Trump made good on his campaign promise when he wrote to the UNFCCC secretariat, notifying them of his administration's intention to withdraw the United States from the treaty, thereby undermining the universality of the Paris Agreement and impairing states' confidence in climate cooperation. With this scenario in mind, the discussions at the recently-concluded climate conference in Africa were largely dominated by how the continent could harness homegrown solutions and standing united in the face of shifting climate political dynamics. In his opening remarks, which he delivered on behalf of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya's environment and forestry minister, Keriako Tobiko said climate change was a matter of life and death for Africa. ""We have all experienced the devastating and unprecedented impacts of climate change on our peoples' lives and livelihoods as well as our national economies. Africa is the most vulnerable continent despite contributing only about four percent to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but when we go to argue our case we speak in tongues and come back with no deal,"" he said. He said given Africa's shared ecosystems, it was essential to speak in one voice to safeguard the basis of the continent's development and seek transformative solutions. This climate conference was held just days after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius which warned of a catastrophe if immediate action is not taken to halt GHG emissions. And commenting on the IPCC report, Tobiko reiterated the resolutions of the first Africa Environment Partnership Platform held from Sept. 20 to, under the auspices of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the technical body of the African Union, which emphasised the need to turn environmental challenges into economic solutions through innovation and green investments. Tobiko said that Kenya would be hosting the first Sustainable Blue Economy Conference from Nov. 26 to 28 to promote sustainable investments in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. Just like the Africa Environment Partnership Platform -- which recognised ""indigenous knowledge and customary governance systems as part of Africa's rich heritage in addressing environmental issues"" -- indigenisation was also a trending topic at the CCDA VII. Under the theme: 'Policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa', the conference attracted over 700 participants from member states, climate researchers, academia, civil society organisations and local government leaders, among others. Experts said that local communities, women and the youth should be engaged in Africa's efforts to combat the vagaries of climate change. James Murombedzi, officer-in-charge of the Africa Climate Policy Centre of the U.N. Commission for Africa, said African communities have long practiced many adaptation strategies and viable responses to the changing climate. However, he said, ""there are limits to how well communities can continue to practice adaptive livelihoods in the context of a changing climate"", adding that it was time they were supported by an enabling environment created by government-planned adaptation. ""That is why at CCDA-VII we believe that countries have to start planning for a warmer climate than previously expected so this means we need to review all the different climate actions and proposals to ensure that we can in fact not only survive in a 3 degrees Celsius warmer environment but still be able to meet our sustainable development objectives and our Agenda 2063,"" added Murombedzi. Murombedzi said it was sad that most African governments had continued spending huge sums of money on unplanned adaptations for climate-related disasters. And these, according Yacob Mulugetta, professor of Energy and Development Policy, University London College, ""are the implications of global warming for Africa which is already experiencing massive climate impacts, such as crop production, tourism industries and hydropower generation."" Mulugetta, one of the lead authors of the IPCC special report, however, noted that ""international cooperation is a critical part of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,"" but warned African climate experts to take cognisance of the shifting global geopolitical landscape, which he said is having a significant bearing on climate negotiations. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank (AfDB), pledged continued support to a climate-resilient development transition in Africa through responsive policies, plans and programmes focusing on building transformed economies and healthy ecosystems. James Kinyangi of the AfDB said the Bank's Climate Action Plan for the period 2016 to 2020 was ambitious, as it ""explores modalities for achieving adaptation, the adequacy and effectiveness of climate finance, capacity building and technology transfer - all aimed at building skills so that African economies can realise their full potential for adaptation in high technology sectors."" Under this plan, the bank will nearly triple its annual climate financing to reach USD5 billion a year by 2020. \"

As a concrete result of our dialogue, we have jointly agreed on a management framework that will allow us to step up our cooperation on climate change and to monitor progress in the fight against climate change. It will be a continuous exercise."" She added: ""I take this opportunity to announce our new support to the Government of Mauritius for an amount of 120 million rupees to boost innovation in agriculture to be more resilient to the effects of climate change."" Continuous dialogue monitoring progress The dialogue provides a structured platform to discuss key climate-related policy issues in the framework of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that Mauritius presented in Paris in 2015. It is also an occasion to discuss how the European Union, including its member states, can further assist government in meeting its mitigation and adaptation commitments. This is a continuous dialogue to monitor progress and see how the EU and Mauritius can work together. The EU and Mauritius have agreed on a Joint Management Framework on Climate Change which is focused on six objectives that will be jointly monitored: - To comply with Nationally Determined Contribution target to mitigate climate change, subject to support from international sources, - To improve coastal zone resilience, - To enhance resilience against high intensity rainfall events, - To reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting low carbon technologies and awareness raising on energy conservation in line with the NDC, and - To increase native forest cover to enhance the climate resilience of natural ecosystems (including mangroves). - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa12","Climate change round 24 kicks off; Report warns of a 12-year window for reducing gas emissions","December 05, 2018 Wednesday","The Star (South Africa)","Representatives of almost all the countries on the planet are gathering in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. They will set the course for action on climate change by discussing the implementation plan for the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to co-ordinate international effort to halt warming at 1.5C. The COPs receive significant media attention and, sometimes, even notable public interest. They take place every year as an opportunity for countries to collectively assess progress on dealing with climate change. The first COP meetings held in the 1990s led to the creation of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which set binding emissions targets for developed countries over two ""commitment periods"" (2008-2012 and 2013-2020). However, the Kyoto agreement failed as the US did not ratify it and because several inconclusive conferences followed its implementation. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 also failed to yield any agreement on binding commitments for the second commitment period. A few major countries agreed to a short accord recognising the need to limit global temperature rises to 2C, but there were no substantial guidelines on how to do so. Similarly, COP19 in Warsaw four years later did not finalise any binding treaty. It only recognised ""a flexible ruling"" on differentiated responsibilities and loss and damage. Some even think that the 2013 conference cast some doubt on the capacity of the Polish government to successfully lead COP24 in 2018. Against this backdrop, COP21 in Paris in 2015 appeared to generate the most optimistic outcome in two decades of international climate negotiations. In Paris, the world leaders agreed on a general action plan that legally binds countries to have their progress tracked by technical experts. The countries who signed up also agreed on a ""global stock-take"" - a process for reviewing collective progress towards achieving the long-term goals of the agreement. However, lots of details about the Paris Agreement still have to be nailed down. This is precisely what the international community seeks to do this December in Poland. The major objective for COP24 is to agree upon the so-called Paris ""rulebook"" - the details of how nations should implement the Paris Agreement and report their progress. Three major areas of political discussion will receive most attention: finance, emission targets and the role of ""big"" states. In 2015, richer countries pledged $100billion (about R1.3trillion) a year by 2020 for poorer nations to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, the climate funding is still about $20bn short. COP24 delegates will need to discuss in more detail on when the rest of the money will be generated before committing to the rulebook. Perhaps even more importantly, rules for where that money comes from, and particularly whether international loans are acceptable, still have to be agreed on. Because finance is closely linked to issues of justice and fairness in the international system, it is unlikely that this discussion will lead to more generous levels of climate aid - although there is space for improvement. COP24 also needs to set some form of flexible yet comparable rules that will govern the Paris Agreement. One groundbreaking feature of the Paris Agreement is that all parties agreed to commit to national contributions to climate action. In other words, the agreement is based on a bottom-up process in which countries largely determine their own contributions, and then act upon them. This COP may settle on some basic strategies for verifying climate actions, but it is unlikely that the international community will agree on any mechanisms for delivering sanctions to states that do not meet their targets. - The Conversation Federica Genovese is a lecturer in government at the University of Essex \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa13","COP24: Raising the bar on re-imagining a resilient, sustainable future","December 10, 2018 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","Africa is one of the fastest urbanising regions in the world, and it is widely accepted that the rapid urbanisation of its burgeoning big cities will play a vital role in the continent's continued growth and development... -The Katowice Climate Change Conference is currently underway in Katowice, Slaskie, Poland (2-14 December 2018). This event aims to elevate market awareness and attention - for desired actionable outcomes - on a host of critical priorities related to climate action but also aspirational Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) centred on decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).I believe these three SDGs are unendingly interdependent, particularly for rapidly emerging and urbanising economies in Africa, and here below I ve shared my thoughts on how targeting these SDGs simultaneously with a long-term strategic vision will help nations in Africa re-imagine waste as an opportunity to meaningfully contribute towards a resilient and sustainable future.Imagining Africa s growth to 2050The UN has estimated that the global population will near 11.3 billion by 2060. Populations in Africa are expected to experience just as much exponential growth and the collective count for the continent is predicted to reach over 2.5 billion by 2050, which remarkably will represent about 26% of the world's total population by that time.Of course, these figures present immense opportunities for investors and businesses as it means that Africa currently hosts the fastest growing consumer market in the world. However, it also alludes to a very serious challenge that threatens the future resilience and sustainability of cities and urban nodes, especially in developing regions in Africa, if we don t change our attitudes to what we consider resources versus waste.In fact, according to the World Bank, in 2016 the world s cities generated 2.01 billion tonnes of solid waste, which based on the population figure at the time roughly equated to 0.74kg per person per day. While this may seem like a manageable amount , in reality, it s not. Many of the world s developed and emerging nations, alike, are finding that their landfills are already over-capacitated, and therefore to continue to maintain healthy air and ground contamination quality levels, they are having to look at implementing drastic changes wherever possible to divert waste from landfill.- Adding to this mounting pressure, research by the World Bank also indicated that annual waste generation is expected to increase by 70% from 2016 levels to 3.40 billion tonnes in 2050 and the leading root cause is rapid population growth and urbanisation. When we look at the whole picture in this context, it is evident that we need to examine more strategic approaches to how we manage our resources, as well as waste, sustainably going forward. Coming full circle The circular economy is a relatively new concept, however, in the African context it offers significant opportunities to truly deliver on more inclusive economic growth, which includes job opportunities and positive environmental practices that are direly needed for sustainable growth. As a reformative system, the circular economy is a model that aims to strip out all unnecessary waste materials, energy losses and related carbon emissions across supply chains and through integration and innovation promotes closing these gaps to allow materials, energy and resources to be fed back into the cycle. The consensus is that the linear model of the past to make-use-dispose must be done away with, and that a more sustainable eco-cycle can be achieved through long-term design and planning, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, recycling, and upcycling. While adoption of this thinking is still in its infancy in Africa, there are success stories that can be seen in pockets, where, through innovation, we are also seeing new business streams and even new industries come to the fore. For example, the drive to divert waste from landfill has directly resulted in waste disposers or management companies merging into reprocessing industries, with significant focus being placed on reuse, recycle, repurpose. This is causing manufacturers to rethink how they design their products as well as the type of resources they use to make their goods and products of today, that will (re)become raw materials of tomorrow. Additionally, in cases where recycling and reusing is not possible such as with food and other waste that cannot be safely repurposed for consumption, we are seeing growth in safe destruction facilities as well as the waste-to-energy space. In fact, waste-to-energy plants offer a unique opportunity to tackle two critical challenges to lasting, sustainable development across Africa; power generation, and sustainably managing waste by reducing reliance on landfills. Across industries, we are seeing a more concerted effort to find solutions that make active use of waste building on the philosophy of reuse wherever possible. And, where reuse may not be possible, to adopt a more environmentally friendly approach to recycling and/or appropriate waste disposal. However, we need to instil a complete culture change and shift markets towards giving back to the system in how we approach and treat resources versus waste, so as to avoid potential crises and ensure we build towards a resilient and sustainable future in Africa. - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"

Just a few weeks into his posting he is deep in meetings with fellow ambassadors and Dirco officials and this week is in Cape Town for the State of the National Address (Sona). D'Alotto is a career diplomat, with degrees in Law and Political Sciences. He served on his country's Permanent Mission to the International Organisations in Geneva and the United Nations, and in the Argentine embassies in Washington and Montevideo. He has worked in his ministry's offices of Human Rights and Foreign Policy and Administration, and he has spent time in academia, teaching International Public Law, Human Rights and, recently, International Relations at the University of Buenos Aires. Prior to this posting, he had only been in South Africa three times, first in 1998 and then twice in 2011 as part of a delegation in bilateral talks in Pretoria, and attending COP17, the United Nations Climate Change Conference , in Durban. Throughout his career he said he followed South African issues, yet when his ministry proposed last year that he come to the country, he was surprised. However, after just 24 hours to consult with his family, he agreed and started his preparations. He is accompanied by his wife Andrea while their two adult children remain in Buenos Aires, but will be visiting later this year. There are a range of commonalities between the two southern hemisphere countries, including agriculture and food security, mining, environmental issues, and culture, tourism, sport and human rights. D'Alotto is keen to review economic opportunities by revitalising the Bi-National Commission which last met in 2013. Among areas of co-operation are in the field of agriculture with a direct seeding project in the Western Cape and support through the National Institute for Agricultural Technology (INTA) of the University of Pretoria's agricultural research centre. D'Alotto has a passion for the arts, and would like to promote exchanges with galleries in South Africa, as part of promoting culture. On the sporting side he sees opportunity for soccer clinics, and would like to see more South Africans visit Argentina, not only to enjoy its cosmopolitan capital, but experience the beyond such as the Los Glaciares National Park and Iguaz Falls, and as a gateway to Latin America. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa15","African Countries Deserve an Enhanced Climate Ambition","December 04, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","African countries have been at the climate-change negotiating table for more than 20 years. The continent faces some of the most severe impacts of climate change, but questions remain over its adaptive capacity despite this engagement. African civil society organizations, trade unions and governments have advocated for three main means of implementation: climate finance for adaptation and mitigation; technology transfer; and capacity building. COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (UNFCCC) currently taking place in Katowice, Poland from 2 to 14 December. Through the Paris Work Programme (PAWP) expected to be adopted in Poland, African countries expect that COP 24 will deliver on the continent's expectations with regards to facilitating climate resilience. Climate finance for adaptation and mitigation Climate change is impacting all economies in Africa, a continent highly dependent on agriculture. The impact is increasing the already high inequality, as resources meant for investment in social amenities are being channelled into climate-change adaptation. In this case, due to climate change related disasters like droughts and flooding, there is an adverse impact on agricultural production--namely food insecurity. Therefore, resources meant to provide other services like universal and affordable health care, expansion of infrastructure and other social services for the poor are channelled to climate change response initiatives. During the COP 16, the world's developed countries agreed to mobilize 100 billion US dollars per year by the year 2020 for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. This is still a pipe dream as only 10 billion US dollars have been mobilized so far since the establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in 2006 to date. Additionally, African countries continue to face difficulties in accessing the funds as they are on a perpetual treadmill of paperwork to even qualify to receive any of the funds earmarked for them. Is imperative of global social justice that this funding be fast-tracked. As countries head to Poland, African nations approach the negotiations with the hope that issues dealing with transparency and accountability on climate financing will be made clearer and smoother. Otherwise, African countries will be obliged to divert more domestic resources to meeting their commitments under their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which could affect other development priorities. If promised international funding is not forthcoming and the shortfall needs to be made up from scarce domestic resources, this can mean these resources are no longer available at national level for example for social protection measures or food security. The decision in Poland should therefore be clear on provision, transparency and accountability of climate financing. Technology transfer and capacity building Many adaptation and mitigation solutions will require technology as well as financing, for the purposes of innovation and upscaling across various sectors. Technology transfer, therefore, is critical for African countries. One of the concerns for African countries is the sheer lack of capacity to implement new technologies for climate-change responses. But Africa has the potential to also transfer technology to the north if the existing low carbon technologies that incorporate the already existing indigenous knowledge of African countries are expanded. Therefore, a provision for reverse transfer from South to North with regard to technology should also be provided. At the moment the discussion is being handled as North-South transfer only. Africa is also cautious of becoming a testing ground for new technologies. Therefore, technologies from the north should be tried and tested before being transferred to Africa--for example short-lived solar panel technologies that end up being very expensive in the long run--a key issue that needs to be part of the discussions at COP 24 . Climate change needs to be tackled on a global level and in a just manner The climate-change crisis is now being felt in developed countries. As Europe and America battle wildfires amid massive heat waves over the past year, the impact in Africa is felt even stronger. The increasing frequency of droughts and flooding, and consequently increased risk of violent conflict in already volatile regions, present a major threat to livelihoods on the African continent. Looking ahead to Poland, it is the hope of African countries that these impacts will be reflected in the outcome document. Lastly, as parties move towards operationalization of the Paris Agreement, it is important to ensure that the commitments towards promoting decent work and a just transition are properly articulated in the Paris Work Programme. This is key because climate change is already having significant impacts on the world of work in Africa. Over 60 per cent of Africa's economically active population works in and lives off the agricultural sector, which is adversely affected by climate change. The transition to low-carbon economies offers great potential for green jobs creation, in areas such as the renewable-energy sector. This transition process however means that current existing jobs that do not offer sustainable production methods will be at a risk. It is important to ensure that this transition happens in a socially just and inclusive manner. Therefore, a socially and ecologically just outcome from COP 24 must take into consideration the African demands on the means of implementation (climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building) for adaptation and mitigation as well as the necessity of a just transition.

But Rijsberman, who has been working in the sustainable development sector for decades, knew better. He told his son that those very same oil companies would soon go broke. And instead advised him to seek employment with renewable energy companies as they would soon be the ones making money. As head of GGGI, it is undoubtable that Rijsberman has expert insight into the future of the renewable energy sector. GGGI supports governments around the world transition to environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth by helping them mobilise finance for climate action and implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) i.e. country commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. With a career spanning over 30 years, Rijsberman is one of the strongest advocates of green growth attending the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. His organisation is organising over 15 events at the conference that are focused on, among other things, how low carbon development, green finance, transparency and capacity development of countries can address climate change. Amidst his packed COP24 schedule, Rijsberman sat down with IPS for a brief interview on the state of global climate action, COP24 and the work of GGGI in attaining green growth. Excerpts from the interview follow: Inter Press Service (IPS): Climate finance has been one of the sticking points at COP24 so far. Developing countries are concerned that the developed world is shifting the role of financial contributions to the private sector. What are your thoughts on this? Dr. Frank Rijsberman (FR): Firstly, there needs to be a clean definition of the 100 billion dollars climate finance pledged to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This 100 billion shouldn't be diluted. We need this 100 billion to be clean and green. But at the same time, this is only a small part of what we need to fight climate change. We need trillions, and for that public finance is not enough. This will only come about if we get the institutional investors off the sideline and get the pension funds, the private sector to engage. IPS: What are some of the challenges that now exist with regards to engaging the private sector in funding green growth and how can they be engaged more effectively? FR: It starts with many of the governments not even realising that renewable energy has become commercially viable. They still think green growth is nice but it is expensive and [they] can't afford it. It is already commercially viable to use solar-based batteries for instance, so there is a business case there. So convincing people that these are commercially attractive investments is the first thing that needs to be done. If structured well enough, [as in the case of] Bangladesh offering 20-year power purchase agreement at a reasonable price, then we can attract private investors. Governments also must create an enabling environment for the private sector to engage and have a level playing field for renewables to attract those investments. If there are barriers, such as fossil fuel subsidies, it becomes very hard for private businesses to make a living out of renewables. In Fiji, for instance, the government subsidises dirty electricity for poor households. Stopping that subsidy and turning it into a subsidy for solar power on the roofs of low income houses is one of our projects. IPS: Two months ago, the IPCC released a report that confirmed that accepting increased global warming of 2 degrees Celsius will impact severely lives, livelihoods and natural ecosystems. This means drastic changes are needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Is it achievable here? FR: It has to be finance first. Then we need to agree on transparency. We also need to ramp up ambition and rather than to waver from their NDCs countries need to step up their commitments, but that is for next year. We need to agree on the rulebook and get over the hurdle of finance at this COP then everybody's attention will focus on more ambition, which is what we need. If we get stuck on the Paris rulebook or finance then we also don't get to the 1.5 degrees, so it is like a house of cards. IPS: Transparency is one of the key issues being debated at COP24 . What are your thoughts on it? FR: Transparency is the code word for Article 6. Part of it means developed countries reporting in a credible way. And for developing countries it also means to save their rainforests, to restore their mangrove areas - can they get money to pay for that? There are countries like Korea or Australia that can't reduce their emissions fast enough, but they are willing to buy carbon credits. But then we need to agree on a rulebook for transparency - how are we going to report, what kind of Monitoring Reporting and Verification Systems (MRVS) are necessary, and those MRVS shouldn't overly burden countries like Myanmar. We can't have the same kind of rulebook for Myanmar and Germany [and] shouldn't make the barriers to access very high. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) felt they were excluded because [these processes] were too complicated. So, this time around transparency needs to allow the Least Developed Countries and SIDS to really access that. That is the critical sticking point. IPS: Your organisation assists member states, which include developing nations, access funding from the GCF. It has also assisted member countries in developing green growth models to great success. Are you seeing an increased commitment from governments, in both developing and developed nations, to embrace green growth? What is your vision for GGGI going ahead from COP24 ? We only started six years ago with 12 countries and now 30 countries have ratified our treaty and another 30 are in the queue to become members. When our President Ban Ki-moon meets ministers he encourages them to take green growth more seriously, then those ministers contact us about how they can do so. We also see a lot of good opportunities from the SIDS. In South East Asia - Vietnam, Indonesia - there is a large portfolio of planned new coal fired power plants. So, these are the hotspots and we need to convince those governments that green growth is commercially attractive and feasible. We are very happy with Indonesia's commitment for green growth and we are strongly supporting Vietnam's government to convert their intent to climate action. I have worked on sustainable development forever, and for the longest time Ministries of Finance had no time for us, saying 'Sorry we are poor, we need to grow and we will worry about the environment later'. Even INDCs were owned by the Ministries of Environment and the Ministries of Finance didn't know about them. Now the Finance Ministers who want growth are interested in green growth, integrating these ideas into mainstream national development planning. For instance, we helped Uganda develop the green growth development strategy which the ministry of finance is leading. That is what I am most excited about. We have finally convinced ministries of finance to take green growth seriously. \"

Every week since December, the seventh-grader has made a pilgrimage to the UN headquarters demanding action on climate change. She is one of a cadre of young, fierce and mostly female activists behind the ""school strikes for climate"" movement. On March 15, with the support of some of the world's biggest environmental groups, tens of thousands of kids in at least two dozen countries and nearly 30 US states plan to skip school to protest. Their demands are uncompromising - nations must commit to cutting fossil-fuel emissions in half in the next 10 years to avoid catastrophic global warming. And their message is firm - kids are done waiting for adults to save their world. ""Mom, this is so cool,"" Alexandria says, as she reads the latest list of countries where kids have pledged to participate in a global strike: Australia, Thailand, Ghana, France. ""Where is Gir... Girona?"" They sit on the couch, still in their pyjamas, and Alexandria pulls out the planner she purchased to keep track of all her commitments. Each task is colour-coded by geographic scale: pink for global organising. Orange for national. Yellow for New York. First on the agenda is an interview with a reporter from the UK, who seems caught off guard by the young woman's fervour. ""My generation is really upset."" The deal struck at COP24 , the UN climate meeting in December, was insufficient, she says. ""We're not going to let them hand us down a broken planet."" ""Huh. Right,"" the reporter says. ""Big ambitions."" ""Yeah,"" she replies, confident. Afterwards, she changes into her striking uniform: waterproof ski pants and a down jacket, all in white, just like the congresswomen at the State of the Union and the suffragists of old. She packs her bag - planner, thermos, gloves - and grabs her plastic-encased cardboard signs, which read ""School Strike 4 Climate"" and "" COP 24 failed us"". She holds the signs facing inwards so other commuters on the subway can't see them. She doesn't like it when people stare. ""They'll probably think it's just a science project,"" Alexandria tells her mother. Then she laughs. ""Well, technically it is. It's project conservation. Project Save the Earth."" It's been four months since Alexandria decided the Earth needed saving. Last year, visiting family in northern California, she was caught in the cloud of smoke from the Camp Fire, which killed nearly 100 people and filled the air with unbreathable smoke. The girl suffers from asthma and for days afterwards felt physically ill and emotionally distraught. This isn't normal, she thought. This isn't right. She began to look up articles about the West's historic drought, read reports about recent global temperature rise, asked her mother, a graduate student in the climate and society programme at Columbia University, to explain the drivers behind global warming. She joined the New York chapter of Zero Hour, a network of young American climate activists. In December she watched as international negotiators met in Poland to carve out a plan for curbing carbon emissions. A recent UN report found that humanity has until 2030 - the year Alexandria turns 24 - to achieve ""rapid and far-reaching"" transformation of society if we wish to avoid the dire environmental consequences of warming 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Yet the agreement that was ultimately reached fell far short of what scientists say is urgently needed. In the midst of all this, Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old from Sweden, took the podium. Recalling that speech, Alexandria's eyes light up. ""She just put them in their place,"" Alexandria says. ""That was extremely satisfying."" Alexandria searched Greta's name online and found stories about the Swedish girl's climate strike in front of her country's parliament building, then in its fourth month. Greta said she had been inspired by student activists from Florida, who said they would not go back to school until gun-control legislation was passed. ""I am too young to vote and to lobby,"" she said this week. ""But I can sit down with a sign and make my voice heard."" To page 18 \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa18","African Media Poorly Represented At the United Nations Climate Change Negotiations","December 14, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","As negotiations at the United Nations conference on climate change come to a close, the highest expectation is that finally, there will be a rulebook to guide countries on what should be done to slow down greenhouse gas emissions that make the earth warmer than necessary, and how countries can adapt to the impacts of climate change. Africa is arguably the continent that is most impacted by climate change, experiencing storms, droughts, and floods; the emergence of new human and plant diseases as well as increased incidents of infectious diseases; unpredictable weather; and rising sea levels, among others. However, the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) raises one big question: Who is going to tell the African narrative of climate change? The UNFCCC secretariat has always allocated humble working space for the media, fixed with sufficient state-of-the-art computers, free high-speed internet and printing services, and an information desk to make lives of journalists easier in covering the conference. But African media has never been truly present at the conference to tell the real African story of the climate change discourse right from the negotiating room. ""It is a shame for the media houses all over Africa to be relying on wire stories when addressing an issue that is of great importance to the African continent. It is totally unacceptable,"" said Mohammed Adow, who heads climate policy and advocacy at Christian Aid. According to Tim Davis, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) manager for UNFCCC: 1,749 journalists from across the globe were accredited to cover the conference; but only 1,068 turned up. IPS contacted some of the African journalists who had registered and not attended. They said they had been prepared and eager to cover the event, but could not make it because of a lack of funding. ""I was really prepared to cover the COP, but I couldn't make it because I did not get a sponsor,"" said Elias Ngalame, a Cameroonian journalist who won the very first Africa Climate Change and Environment Reporting (ACCER) Award in 2013, and has since been reporting about the COP processes. The same was said by Friday Phiri, an Inter Press Service award-winning environment journalist from Zambia, Michael Simire, a veteran environment journalist from Nigeria, and Agatha Ngotho from Kenya, among many others. COP24 for the African population. However, sometimes freelance journalists--as opposed to reporters permanently employed at media houses--are more likely to obtain funding to cover global conferences such as this because their stories have wider reach both locally and internationally. But they are oftentimes only sponsored to cover the events of their donors and only present for a short time. And on the other hand, African media organisations are still either unable to afford the costs of sending journalists to such events, or would prefer to cover local issues. Mithika Mwenda, the Executive Director for the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), believes that African delegations must take responsibility and support at least one environmental journalist to accompany them. ""Most of the people, especially in the villages who are affected by climate change, do not have time and sometimes capacity to read and understand content from scientific reports, specialised websites, the IPCC reports and so on. Instead, they listen to radio, they watch television and they read daily newspapers,"" said Mwenda, whose organisation supported four African journalists to cover COP24 . His sentiments were echoed by Ishaku Huzi Mshelia, an Energy Legal Expert from Nigeria who told IPS that the media is indeed indispensable when it comes to climate change negotiations. ""Decision makers need to learn from the media. When we talk about something like the Talanoa Dialogue, we must have someone who will explain to the masses including policy makers what the term means, and why it is important,"" said Mshelia. He observed that the Africa Union should take responsibility to support African journalists. ""Journalists require training on the negotiation process, and resources must be made available if at all we are keen on passing the message from the discussion table to the people who desperately need to adapt to climate change,"" he said. According to Mwenda, Africa has a significant number of journalists who understand issues around climate change, and they have constantly reported about the same from their various countries. ""All we need is to fully involve them in such negotiation processes so that our narrative is not told by people who know less or nothing about the continent,"" he said. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa19","Bolsonaro spells ecological disaster for Brazil - and the world","November 30, 2018","Mail & Guardian","Last month, a divided Brazil voted to elect its next president. Faced with a choice between Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers' Party and the right-wing extremist Jair Bolsonaro, Brazilians chose the extremist  an outcome that will have far-reaching consequences for the environment, among other matters. With solid backing from the wealthiest 5% of Brazilians and rural landowners, Bolsonaro secured broader popular support by playing on people's prejudices and fears. In his campaign, he targeted vulnerable groups and pledged to reduce or eliminate protections for minorities, women and the poor. He intends to loosen Brazil's restrictive gun laws, claiming that allowing average citizens to arm themselves will stem rising crime. As for the environment, Bolso\'c2\£dnaro's plans can be summed up in one word: exploitation. For starters, he wants to reduce or eliminate environmental protections in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rainforest. And he intends to make substantial reductions to the protection of indigenous lands belonging to the descendants of the Amazon's original inhabitants. He will ease environmental restrictions on the use of pesticides and on licensing for infrastructure development. ""Where there is indigenous land,"" Bolsonaro once said, ""there is wealth underneath it."" With that in mind, he has declared that no more indigenous reserves will be demarcated, and existing reserves will be opened up to mining. Bolsonaro's agenda will hasten environmental degradation dramatically. Imazon, a Brazilian nongovernmental organisation, reported that 444km2 of forest had been cleared this past September, a 84% increase over September last year. The 12-month total amounts to 4859km2, the highest level since July 2008. Brazil's national space research agency, INPE, also reports an uptick in deforestation  about 50% year-on-year in September. As it stands, many farmers or loggers who exploit the Amazon do so illegally, risking fines or sanctions. The expectation that the new government will not enforce laws prohibiting such activities is probably already emboldening them. Once those laws are weakened or abolished, deforestation can be expected to accelerate. The government's apparent inclination to boost activities such as gold mining in the Amazon will make matters worse. There is little reason to believe Bolsonaro will not be able to follow through on his agenda. After all, far-right representatives allied with business dominate Brazil's new congress. To make destroying the environment even easier, Bolsonaro pledged to merge the environment and agriculture ministries, though he has since backtracked on this. He is looking for an environment minister allied with the ruralistas (large landowners), and has appointed a minister of agriculture who wants to lift restrictions on dangerous chemicals in agriculture. Bolsonaro promised during the election campaign to withdraw Brazil from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Though he has since backed away from that, he has appointed a climate-change-denying, anti-science diplomat as foreign minister. That will present difficulties for Brazil's bid to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in 2019. Beyond increasing the vulnerability of Brazil's natural resources to commercial exploitation, cuts to the environmental budget under Bolsonaro's leadership will undermine the country's ability to respond to disasters. Brazil has already had an increase in forest fires  and fire-related destruction  owing to the expansion of agriculture, weaker oversight and surveillance and the dismantling of fire brigades. Bolsonaro's plans will exacerbate the problem. Socioeconomic inequality will also increase. As the government hands more power over the rainforest to large business owners, citizens  including smallholder farmers and poor urban dwellers  will suffer. Over the past 100 years, Brazil has reduced the Atlantic Forest by more than 90%, and cleared 50% of the Cerrado and almost 20% of the Amazon. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is warning we need to make urgent progress in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but Bolsonaro's plans will achieve the opposite.  \£9 Project Syndicate Paulo Artaxo is professor of environmental physics and head of the department of applied physics at the University of S\'c3\£3o Paulo \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa20","Climate Finance - the Paris Agreement's 'Lifeblood'","May 15, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","As negotiators concluded ten days of climate talks in Bonn last week, climate finance was underlined as a key element without which the Paris Agreement's operational guidelines would be meaningless. The talks, held from April 30 to May 10, were aimed at finalising the PA's implementation guidelines to be adopted at the annual climate conference to be held in Katowice, Poland in December. The guidelines are essential for determining whether total world emissions are declining fast enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, which include boosting adaptation and limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2\'b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5\'b0C. Climate finance dialoge However, the catch is that all this requires financing to achieve. For instance, the conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from developing countries in implementing the Paris Agreement are pegged at the cost of 4.3 trillion dollars to be achieved. ""Finance is a very critical component for us,"" said Ephraim Mwepya Shitima, Zambian Delegation leader and UNFCCC focal point person. ""Agriculture, general adaptation and the APA agenda for implementation modalities form the core issues we are following keenly but we believe all these are meaningless without finance."" It has always been the cry of developing countries to receive support through predictable and sustainable finance for it is the lifeblood of implementation of mitigation and/or adaptation activities. And Least Developed Countries (LDC) Chair Gebru Jember Endalew agrees with Zambia's Shitima on the importance of finance. ""Finance is key to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the face of climate change, poor and vulnerable countries are forced to address loss and damage and adapt to a changing climate, all while striving to lift their people out of poverty without repeating the mistakes of an economy built on fossil fuels. This is not possible without predictable and sustainable support,"" he said. The civil society movement was particularly unhappy with the lukewarm finance dialogue outcome. ""The radio silence on money has sown fears among poor countries that their wealthier counterparts are not serious about honouring their promises,"" said Mohamed Adow, International Climate Lead, Christian Aid. He said funding is not just a bargaining chip, but an essential tool for delivering the national plans that make up the Paris Agreement. And adding his voice to the debate, Mithika Mwenda of the Pan African Justice Allaince (PACJA) expressed dismay at the lack of concrete commitments from developed country parties. ""We are dismayed with the shifting of goal posts by our partners who intend to delay the realization of actual financing of full costs of adaptation in Africa,"" said Mwenda. But for Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the final analysis of the talks revealed a more hopeful outlook. ""I am satisfied that some progress was made here in Bonn,"" said Espinosa at the close of the ten-day talks. ""But many voices are underlining the urgency of advancing more rapidly on finalizing the operational guidelines. The package being negotiated is highly technical and complex. We need to put it in place so that the world can monitor progress on climate action."" According to Espinosa, the presiding officers of the three working bodies coordinated discussions on a wide range of items under the Paris Agreement Work Programme, and delegations tasked them to publish a ""reflection note"" to help governments prepare for the next round of talks. She said the preparatory talks would continue at a supplementary meeting in Bangkok from September 3-8, at which the reflection note and the views and inputs by governments captured in various texts in Bonn would be considered. The Bangkok meeting would then forward texts and draft decisions for adoption to the annual session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) in Poland. ""We have made progress here in Bonn, but we need now to accelerate the negotiations. Continuing intersessional streamlining of the text-based output from Bonn will greatly assist all governments, who will meet in Bangkok to work towards clear options for the final set of implementation guidelines,"" she explained. The Talanoa Dialogue In parallel to the formal negotiations, the Bonn meeting hosted the long-awaited Fiji-led Talanoa Dialogue. Following the tradition in the Pacific region, the goal of a 'talanoa' is to share stories to find solutions for the common good. In this spirit, the dialogue witnessed some 250 participants share their stories, providing fresh ideas and renewed determination to raise ambition. ""Now is the time for action,"" said Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23. ""Now is the time to commit to making the decisions the world must make. We must complete the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement on time. And we must ensure that the Talanoa Dialogue leads to more ambition in our climate action plans."" The dialogue wrote history when countries and non-Party stakeholders including cities, businesses, investors and regions engaged in interactive story-telling for the first time. ""The Talanoa Dialogue has provided a broad and real picture of where we are and has set a new standard of conversation,"" said the President-designate of COP24 , Micha\'c5 Kurtyka of Poland. ""Now it is time to move from this preparatory phase of the dialogue to prepare for its political phase, which will take place at COP24 ,"" he added. All input received to date and up to October 29, 2018 will feed into the Talanoa Dialogue's second, more political phase at COP24 . The Koronovia work Programme on Agriculture Farmers are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as prolonged droughts and shifting rainfall patterns, and agriculture is an important source of emissions. Despite this importance however, agriculture had been missing and was only discussed as an appendage at the UN climate negotiating table, until November 2017 when it was included as a work programme. Recognising the urgency of addressing this sector, the Bonn conference made a significant advance on the ""Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture"" by adopting a roadmap for the next two-and-a-half years. ""From our perspective as Zambia, our interest is in line with the expectations of the African group which is seeking to protect our smallholders who are the majority producers from the negative impacts of climate change,"" said Morton Mwanza, Zambia's Ministry of Agriculture focal point person on Climate Smart Agriculture. And according to the outcome at the Bonn talks, the roadmap responds to the world's farming community of more than 1 billion people and to the 800 million people who live in food-insecure circumstances, mainly in developing countries. It addresses a range of issues including the socio-economic and food-security dimensions of climate change, assessments of adaptation in agriculture, co-benefits and resilience, and livestock management. Nevertheless, key to this roadmap is undoubtedly means of implementation--finance and technology. Developed countries pledged, since 2009, to deliver to developing countries 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 for climate action. However, the withdrawal of 2 billion dollars' worth of support by the Trump administration because of its decision to leave the Paris Agreement, leaves the climate finance debate unsettled, and a major sticking point in the talks. Big polluters influence And some campaigners now accuse some fossil fuel lobbyists allegedly sitting on the negotiating table to be behind delayed climate action. According to a study, titled ""Revolving doors and the fossil fuel industry,"" carried out in 13 European countries, failure to deal with conflict of interest by the EU is due to cosy relationships built up with the fossil fuel sector over the years. It calls for the adoption of a strong conflict of interest policy that would avoid the disproportionate influence of the fossil fuel industry on the international climate change negotiations. ""There is a revolving door between politics and the fossil fuel lobby all across Europe,"" said Max Andersson, Member of the European Parliament, at the Bonn Climate Talks. ""It's not just a handful of cases--it is systematic. The fossil fuel industry has an enormous economic interest in delaying climate action and the revolving door between politics and the fossil fuel lobby is a serious cause for alarm."" According to Andersson, to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and keep global warming to as close as 1.5 degrees as possible, there is need to clamp down on conflicts of interest to stop coal, gas and oil from leaving ""their dirty fingerprints over our climate policy."" Interestingly, there was good news for the 'big polluters out' campaigners at the close of the talks. ""No amount of obstruction from the US and its big polluter allies will ultimately prevent this movement from advancing,"" Jesse Bragg of Corporate Accountability told IPS. ""Global South leaders prevailed in securing a clear path forward for the conflict of interest movement, ensuring the issue will be front and center next year."" And so, it seems, climate finance holds all the cards. Until it is sorted, the implementation of the Paris Agreement in two years' time hangs in the balance. \"

Climate change, shift, crisis, call it what you will, and nation politics and economy are big bros, one is spurred on furiously by the other.

Last year we were at 1 degree and the big human effort now is to stop it at 1.5 degrees. There is a hole in the ozone of Eastern Cape thinking. For years greenies and scientists have been getting wound up about climate change, but if you asked any of them here to point it out in our backyard, you got a mouthful of science bollocks, mostly about how it cannot be quantified or precisely identified. Frustrating when I watched pot plants being washed off the Royal Alfred Marina, surfers catching lefts near the Kowie Bridge, the Orange River running dry, fires blazing on the Garden Route, ice particles from a storm blasting the Cederberg on the way to Namibia last month in summer ... It just keeps on and and on and on. It can feel crazy that while the politicians and business people battle on, the very stage upon which they strut and give off all that hot air, is in a state of ominous, freaky flux. So many little things that just keep adding up. You want to go to bed and hide under the covers.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa22","4 per 1000 initiative to help farmers with soil management, reverse degradation","September 13, 2018 Thursday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The aim of the initiative is to demonstrate that agriculture, and in particular agricultural soils can play a crucial role where food security and climate change are concerned... Degradation of soil health has reached 40% globally, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). If carbon was increased in soils by just 0.4% per year, the reduction in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would correspond to all annual man-made greenhouse gas emissions hence the name of the 4 per 1000 Initiative, which was launched by the government of France at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The platform brings together the initiative s project members and partners to speed up knowledge-sharing and best practice, to encourage projects to implement the most efficient science and approaches and to secure funding for successful demonstration projects. The project members and partners include 39 governments, 11 international organisations, 10 foundations and development banks, 62 research and education institutions, 35 farmers organisations, 36 companies and 88 NGOs. Stephane Travert, France s minister for agriculture and food, said: ""To be efficient and to lead to a true transition towards more sustainable agriculture, many actors have to be mobilised alongside the farmers. The 4 per 1000 Initiative will thus contribute to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It will allow farmers to live well from their work, and contribute to food security."" Why soil projects are so important Soil is an important carbon stock it stores three times as much carbon as the atmosphere. If the carbon in soil rose by just 0.4% per year, it would be enough to halt the increase in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere related to human activities. It could reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 4.76 gigatons. 40% of the world s soil is now degraded, reducing agricultural resilience and productivity. Boosting soil carbon is relatively easy, through low-tech sustainable agricultural practices. These measures not only help fight climate change, but increase biodiversity and food security. Soil health: Part of a broader suite of natural climate solutions:<!> Improving soil health is just one example of natural climate solutions. Science is clear that these solutions are essential to keep warming under two degrees and avoid dangerous climate change. Taken together, these solutions could deliver a third of the greenhouse gas reductions required by 2030. Using Carbon Markets to Improve Soil Health<!> Just 2.5% of total climate finance is currently directed towards a land-use project, including those focused on soil health. Most carbon markets (e.g. the EU or Californian cap-and-trade schemes) have historically not supported soil carbon projects. Problems included:<!> Properly accounting for the carbon benefits of soil projects Issues around their long-term feasibility. The Nature Conservancy sought to understand the status and prospects for carbon financing of soil carbon project development and its ability to make a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation. Findings and conclusions:<!> Despite a slow start in carbon finance, there are now a handful of soil carbon projects in the voluntary market. Technical barriers to soil carbon projects have largely been overcome, and now strategies exist for building soil organic carbon across croplands, grasslands, savannahs and peatlands. Markets for soil carbon/health projects are still small, but they offer a low cost-per-tonne of carbon so there s a growing buyer market. They also provide important co-benefits, such as higher agricultural yields and more secure incomes for farmers (particularly in developing countries). Investors, therefore, can maximise not just environmental impact, but also social impact. Building soil carbon into broader policy frameworks, such as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) strategies will be an important step forward in mainstreaming these projects. Boosting agricultural yields In a second phase, starting November, the hub will be opened to millions of farmers around the world, so that they can learn about the best approaches to soil management, which not only boost soil carbon, but also boost agricultural yields. Dr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, former Prime Minister of Niger and CEO of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) Agency said: ""To reduce the rate of presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, agriculture and forestry have a unique role to play. Two years since its launch, the 4 per 1000 Initiative has developed quickly and achieved international recognition that underscores the imperative to protect soils and nature, which provide vital resources for people.

The new investment - announced at the COP24 global climate summit in Poland - triples funds for the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (Repp), to support up to 40 more renewable energy projects over the next five years. It could unlock an extra 156m of private finance into renewable energy markets in Africa by 2023. Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each country's natural resources, providing 2.4million people a year with new or improved access to clean energy. ""At home, we're world leaders in cutting emissions while growing our economy and abroad we're showing our international leadership by giving countries a helping hand to shift to greener, cleaner economies,"" UK Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said. ""This 100 million will help communities harness the power of their natural resources to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. ""Building these clean, reliable sources of energy will also create thousands of quality jobs in these growing green economies."" The new investment is in addition to 48m previously committed to the Repp, which is already supporting 18 renewable energy projects in a range of countries from Tanzania to Burundi. These projects, featuring solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal technologies, are expected to provide new or improved access for more than 4.5million people over the project's lifetime, creating 8000 jobs during development and operation. | African News Agency (ANA) \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa24","SA's role in fighting climate change","June 21, 2018 Thursday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","Partnerships are crucial to successfully fight and ultimately reverse the disastrous effects of climate change and the associated environmental degradation. In this regard the European Union and South Africa have collaborated closely, notably since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) COP17 (Conference of the Parties) in Durban 2011. In fact, South Africa and the EU can claim to have been two of the driving forces behind the Paris Agreement to fight climate change - the landmark global agreement adopted by almost 200 countries in 2015. South Africa remains among the EU's strongest partners in multilateral efforts to implement the Paris Agreement for a global transition to low-emission, climate-resilient economies and societies. We already know that on aggregate the emissions reduction targets put forward will not be enough to reach the common objective of limiting global warming to well below 2C compared to pre-industrial levels, let alone 1.5C. The window to stay within these limits is closing very fast. This is why we must continue to raise our collective ambition and speed up the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The EU is well-advanced in putting in place its domestic legislative framework for delivering its target of cutting domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Last week we agreed on a more ambitious target of renewables making up 32% of the EU energy mix by 2030. This year the Talanoa Dialogue - inspired by the Pacific tradition of ""talanoa"" (a Tongan word meaning to speak) - is the first opportunity since Paris to look at our collective efforts so far, as well as opportunities to increase global ambition. The EU sees the open and inclusive Talanoa Dialogue as a key moment to deepen trust and co-operation. It also sets the tone for the annual EU Climate Diplomacy week (being celebrated this week). In South Africa, we are sharing and showcasing the EU's contribution to climate action at Adaptation Futures 2018, billed as the world's premier conference on climate change adaptation. The EU also stands ready to support South Africa's national Talanoa dialogue in the run-up to the next UN climate conference, COP24 . A further important element this year is the adoption of the Paris Agreement work programme - detailed transparency and governance rules for putting the agreement into practice. Adopting this ""rulebook"" at COP24 in December in Katowice, Poland, is vital. A set of transparency rules will enable us to track and demonstrate the progress being made around the world and will provide a shared framework to deliver on our shared vision. In parallel, we are looking beyond 2030. In March 2018, EU leaders asked the European Commission to present, within 12 months, a proposal for a strategy for long-term EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction, following a similar request form the European Parliament. Simultaneously, the EU is stepping up international co-operation and support to partners outside the EU, for example through policy dialogues, capacity-building projects and climate finance. In South Africa we have just launched a bilateral partnership project to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement in addition to support already provided by the EU Member States. Further EU initiatives include: The Electrification Financing Initiative set up to unlock, accelerate and leverage investments to provide access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy in Africa and beyond; The EU-funded Infrastructure Investment Programme which supports infrastructure projects in the energy, water and other sectors, and; The Employment Promotion through SMME's Support Programme which include focus on green industries. EU investors remain prominent in the clean energy sector - European companies and development finance institutions actively invest in South Africa's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers' Programme. On climate finance, the EU, its member states and the European Investment Bank contributed some R300 billion in public climate finance towards developing countries in 2016. This is roughly half of global public climate finance. For global efforts to have the desired impact, a decisive response is required from all nations and particularly from the major economies, including South Africa, which together account for some 80% of global emissions. Marcus Cornaro is ambassador of the EU delegation to South Africa. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa25","Money issues bedevil climate talks","December 14, 2018","Mail & Guardian","Money is a major sticking point in international talks about addressing climate change. But South Africa's head of delegation, Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom, said the finance committee at the talks in Katowice, Poland, was getting close to delivering a deal, and rich countries have committed billions of dollars to assist poor, vulnerable countries. ""But the devil lies in the doing,"" Hanekom said at the United Nations climate change conference . ""Commitments will be made; I'm quite confident of that. But what happens beyond is that the commitments need to be honoured."" Poor countries need financing so that they can become green economies and to adhere to their promises to lower their carbon emissions. Vulnerable nations will also need the money to adapt to a changing climate, including sea level rise and more extreme storms. The bickering over money was threatening to derail the 2015 Paris Agreement, scheduled to come into effect in 2020. Developed countries promised to deliver $100-billion for climate mitigation by 2020, but there were serious concerns that the promises made in 2015 have not been honoured. Developing countries say they cannot start planning their transformation into green economies until they know how much money they will receive from rich countries. Industrialised countries argue that they can't promise a figure at this stage. Hanekom said finance was particularly important in achieving a positive outcome at this year's talks. ""The question is what determines the amount of finance that is needed. It is not an arbitrary figure. There should be a clear indication of what needs to be done, what will be done."" He said nobody had said that they would renege on the $100-billion promised, but establishing that it would be paid was critical. ""On the contrary, I think there is a general acceptance that amount of money, given the enormity of the challenge, will not be adequate."" The conference this week had to establish rules on how to implement the historic Paris Agreement, but a fight over finance held up the talks for most of the two weeks. Hanekom is heading the South African delegation after the death of the environment minister, Edna Molewa, in September. Although Nomvula Mokonyane was appointed as her successor last month, it was deemed Hanekom could best handle the technical negotiations. Speaking at the conference, he said, for South Africa, finance and adaptation for climate change were the overarching priorities and drawing up a rulebook was important. The Paris Agreement cannot come into effect in 2020 without a rulebook, which includes a clear mandate on finance. Currently the negotiators, from 195 governments, are not finding common ground. Hanekom said China, India, Brazil and South Africa were in agreement that, for finance, there was ""a bit of a concern"" and ""financial commitments, as agreed to in Paris, have not been met"". The South African delegation has been pushing for a deal on finance. South Africa has been firm that it can't meet its promises made in Paris in 2015 to decarbonise its economy if it doesn't receive financial aid. South Africa's lead climate negotiator, Maesela Kekana, said at the end of last week's negotiations that the African group was not happy. ""As an African group, we simply could not accept the positions that were being put forward [by developed countries],"" he said. Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for international nonprofit ActionAid, also emphasised that clear rules on financing were critical for the agreement to succeed. Transparency was the other issue giving negotiators sleepless nights, and developed countries urged developing countries to report all their green actions. Hanekom, who co-chaired the transparency dialogue at the conference, argued that poor countries should not be held to the same standards of reporting as rich countries, because they had limited resources and capacity. Hanekom said a formula that balanced the responsibilities of all countries, both in financing and transparency, was crucial. ""This will allow us to have a regime that is fair and effective for all. To achieve this, and to build the trust that everyone is doing their fair share, we need to have a strong transparency framework to monitor and assess progress on all fronts."" Many delegates said the United States, with the backing of climate-change denier President Donald Trump, was sowing division among the parties, especially in contentious areas. The US was fingered as one of the countries holding up progress on finance. ""The worst outcome of the talks here would be no outcome,"" Hanekom said. ""I don't believe that any country came here looking for no outcome."" UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called Katowice the most important Conference of the Parties since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. ""There can be no doubt that it is a moment of truth. The Katowice package needs to deliver on the progress on finance needed to adapt and mitigate climate change as well as the way the Paris Agreement, which will kick in in 2020, will be implemented. ""Developed countries had to scale up their contributions to jointly raise $100-billion annually by 2020,"" he said. \"

Yesterday marked the opening of Energy Week South Africa's International Gas Co-operation Summit where influential energy decision-makers from across southern Africa converged. The event is a platform to explore South Africa's aspirations to build an energy hub for gas co-operation with international partners along the gas value chain. It aims to put the objectives of South Africa and the region at the forefront of international gas development, and showcase gas procurement and utilisation strategies. The meeting, which concludes today, is co-located with the Southern Africa Renewable Energy Summit and the Black Industrialists Energy Summit. Members of environmental movement 350Africa.org and partner organisations challenged the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) to distance itself, and funding, from the Thabametsi coal plant project near Lephalale in Limpopo. The 350Africa.org movement said plans for the Thabametsi plant and for new coal development in South Africa were not consistent with the need to limit global temperature increase to below 1.5C, as confirmed by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Ahmed Mokgopo, 350Africa.org divestment campaigner, said: ""The DBSA has already recognised the opportunity for clean energy which holds true to just and sustainable development. However, their inconsistency in funding renewables and fossil fuels at the same time, overshadows what could see them as leaders in promoting clean energy development for the continent."" During Energy Week South Africa, the movement encouraged the DBSA to commit to 100% renewable energy financing. ""This presents an opportunity for the bank to truly live up to its mandate and align all of its energy lending with South Africa's commitments to reduce greenhouse gases in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement currently being discussed at COP24 in Poland,"" Mokgopo said. The DBSA has an opportunity to not take the Thabametsi project into consideration, and by doing so, make a clean break from coal, he added. Organisers did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa27","Q&A - Many African Countries Already Live the Future of 2\'c2\'b0C Warmer [interview]","December 14, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","As the United Nations climate conference nears an end, all eyes are on the negotiators who have been working day and night for the past two weeks to come up with a Rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement. However, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), climate change is also a humanitarian issue. According to the humanitarian organisation, natural disasters such as droughts, storms and floods, have doubled since the 1990s. ""So nowadays there are so many people who require food assistance and other humanitarian aid after disasters than it was a few decades ago,"" Gernot Laganda, Chief of the Climate and Disaster Risk Reduction Programmes at WFP, tells IPS at the sidelines of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Kotowice, Poland. ""We are also concerned because with humanitarian aid, we cannot run fast enough as the problem of hunger in the world is running away from us,"" Laganda says. According to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people increased to over 820 million in 2017 from approximately 804 million in 2016. And Laganda says the 'trend is on the rise"". ""When we look into a future of 2 degrees Celsius warmer world, it means we will have over a billion people who are at risk of hunger and food security,"" he says. Excepts of the interview follow: Inter Press Service (IPS): How is climate change impacting on food security? Gernot Laganda (GL): Climate change affects food security in two principle ways. First, there is the whole question around agriculture from production of crops, to the storage to the transport to the market. Climate change can affect each of these stages. The other one is about extreme events that keep throwing people back into poverty. Each year, 28 million people fall back into poverty because of extreme weather events. That means no matter how much development progress we are making to achieve zero hunger by 2030, every year we slide back, and that is a concern. IPS: Will women's ownership of land be of good value especially for climate adaptation? GL: Having ownership of land certainly increases sustainability of agriculture production because people look after their land. In many cases, development projects fail also because land ownership and who has the right to use the land for how long has not been considered. So it is a big factor in development. Of course when you mention the issue of ownership of land, then the whole issue of gender comes in, in various ways. On one side, there is a discussion about women being vulnerable in general. But we see it in slightly a different way. We see it as women being agents of change in many countries and in many communities, so when you want to invest in a sustainable manner, it is a very good idea to have women saving groups. They have very good experiences in building risk reserves. And whenever there are little problems for example when the rains come late, it becomes very efficient to go through such crises. But when it comes to catastrophic shocks, we look more at insurance based models. IPS: Do you see this COP solving some of the climate problems in relation to food security? GL: This COP is primarily about implementing the Paris agreement and maintaining the global average of temperature increases well below two degrees Celsius. I think in all the discussions about temperature ranges we tend to forget that many countries, especially in Africa, are already experiencing two degrees Celsius of temperature increase. So the reality in these countries look like what we are still discussing here. Indeed, many African countries already live the future that we are collectively still trying to avoid. IPS: How has climate change contributed in terms of displacing families? GL: Statistics from the last 10 years tell us that on average 22 million people are driven from their homes every year because of climate extremes. Migration is actually a traditional adaptation mechanism because people move to other places in search of greener pastures, job opportunities and so on. But we are talking about forced displacement due to climate related disasters. Climate related events can also aggravate conflicts at local levels between farmers and herders for example, or it can still happen between countries especially where we have large international river basins. IPS: What does the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report mean to Africa in terms of food security? GL: All countries are affected by climate change but agrarian countries feel it the most. In Africa, many countries have a huge percentage of their GDP coming from agriculture. That makes such economies very vulnerable because agriculture is about climate sensitive resources such as water, crops, fish-stock, livestock among others. All poor countries that heavily depend on natural resources are the most impacted. IPS: What are your expectations for COP24 ? GL: Everybody's expectation is that we will have a Rulebook by the end of the COP. But there is also a recognition that this is not an easy task because for one it is difficult enough to agree on what we want to do. But [the Rulebook] is about how we are going to hold ourselves accountable. In the Rulebook, I expect to see a regime by which countries can track and report on the degrees of their progress against their self set targets or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). \"

These included a South African-German who helped guide Swedish teen Greta Thunberg in her quest to tackle world leaders on their inaction over climate change. All 157 aboard the Boeing 737 Max 8 were killed when the plane crashed outside the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, casting a gloomy mood on the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, where delegates were flying to when the disaster occurred. Among the dead was World Bank group staff member Max Thabiso Edkins, a 35-year old national of both Germany and South Africa, who served as communications officer for Connect4Climate (C4C). Kristalina Georgieva, interim president of the World Bank Group, paid tribute to him at the summit, attended by world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and host President Uhuru Kenyatta. ""Max was deeply committed to the fight against climate change and brought tremendous creativity, energy and passion to his work. Our deepest sympathies go to his family and loved ones, and to those of the other victims of this tragedy,"" she said. Lesotho-born Edkins attended the German International School in Cape Town and studied Environmental Science at UCT. His father, documentary film-maker Don Edkins, has told reporters Edkins had played a role in arranging Thunberg's presence at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland in December, where she lambasted world leaders for their lethargy in dealing with the climate change crisis. Thunberg, who has Asperger's syndrome, has since become a uniting force for young people anxious about the future of our planet, after she staged protests outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm. In her brutally honest speech, she accused world leaders of being too concerned about being popular instead of doing the logical thing and pulling the emergency brake on carbon emissions. ""Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We can't solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis,"" she said. She concluded: ""We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people. Thank you."" On Friday, marches took place in more than 100 countries, with events in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban. See Page 16 \"

The visual and data-rich app tracks SA's efforts to mitigate against the impacts of a shifting, hard to predict climate. It was launched by the SA department of environmental affairs (DEA). The app, named the SA Biennial Update Report Explorer, was developed in collaboration with World Resource Institute and gives civil society as well as policymakers, businesses and researchers access to data on SA's goals and progress in contributing to the international effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are the main drivers of climate change - a threat that is causing havoc to the environment globally, according to the latest report by the World Metrological Organisation (WMO). The WMO found that since the start of industrialisation in 1750 until 2017 greenhouse gas concentrations rose astronomically. There has been a 146% increase in CO\'b2, a 257% increase in CH4 and a 122% increase in N2O. Climate change is the reason polar bears are dying of starvation in the Arctic, there is mass coral bleaching (die off) and many parts of SA have received some of the worst rainfall ever recorded this year. ""If some good rain does not fall before 31 December, East London will have had the second lowest rainfall on record. Other centres also recorded similar low figures, with Port Elizabeth at the fourth, George at sixth lowest and Cradock seventh lowest,"" said Eastern Cape SA Weather Services spokesperson, Garth Sampson, on Friday. International science has found that climate change means warmer temperatures, shifting seasons, changing rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels, which disrupt the behaviour of the earth's flora, fauna, marine life and the ecosystems that support them. Hence there is the dire need for a global effort to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The Explorer will allow South Africans to track SA's progress toward tackling climate change, and give live statistics on SA's greenhouse gas, said deputy director-general for climate change, Dr Tsakani Ngomane.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa32","Why the next two years are critical for the Paris climate deal's survival","December 5, 2018 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","A mounting sense of urgency will greet negotiators as they arrive at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland... - Three years on, it s becoming increasingly clear that national decisions about climate action, which country negotiators will convey in Poland and over the next two years, will determine whether the breakthrough Paris pact succeeds both on a political and emissions reduction front. As scholars at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, we have closely followed the global climate change agreements and studied their implications. Based on our analysis of nations commitments to cut emissions, getting the world on track to achieve the agreement s signature goal to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius will require far more ambitious climate action than what countries have pledged so far. This action must begin sooner rather than later to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, from severe droughts to extreme flooding. Climate change won t wait for humanity s response Climate change is the type of problem where delay is especially costly. It is not like other pollution such as dirty urban air or a putrid stream. For these, people might clean up a polluted area this year, but if they put off the task, there will probably still be the same opportunity to get it done the following year. Not so with greenhouse gases, which hang around for decades to centuries. So if societies delay revising our current practices burning fossil fuels, chopping down forests, planting more polluting crops like rice, as well as raising cows the total amount in the atmosphere will grow. The goals for limiting global warming will get steadily more difficult to achieve. In addition, as the nations representatives gather in Poland to pursue their effort to gain control of this process, a crucial decision point is rapidly approaching. Brutal timing In the Paris Agreement, each nation is to make a pledge (what the agreement calls a Nationally Determined Contribution) to achieve a level of emissions control by a target date. For most countries this is the year 2030. They will also submit to a review of whether they did what they said they would do every two years. Our analysis shows that, fortunately, meeting these Paris pledges will halt emissions growth at least to 2030, though without additional action, growth will resume thereafter. This voluntary system of pledge and review represents real progress on this difficult issue. Experts in international affairs argue that it is perhaps the best deal possible for a 195-nation agreement. The pledges for 2030 are just the first step, however. Getting the globe onto a path to the 2\'b0C Paris goal, much less to meet its stretch objective of 1.5\'b0C, will require stronger action beyond 2030. How tough the emissions restrictions must be in the next decade or two depends on the pace of reduction that may be feasible later in the century and here emerging technology could possibly play a role. For example, a significant effort is underway to develop techniques to suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air and store it underground. If we could count on this option becoming available and affordable in the future, participating nations in the Paris Agreement could relax their emissions controls a bit now and the temperature goal could potentially still be met. We take the view, however, that it is not wise to bet the planet on the chance of a late-century technical fix. To avoid this risky bet, our analysis shows that meeting the Paris 2\'b0C goal requires a dramatic turnaround in emissions in the very near future. Why 2020 is a crucial date The Paris Agreement sets up a five-year cycle of updates and specifies that in 2020, nations should revise their pledges for 2030, increasing their ambitions if possible. Also in 2020, nations are to pledge emissions reductions to be made by the next target date, likely to be 2035. Whether there is financial aid for less-wealthy countries could have a big effect on the outcome. For 2030, and likely for future target dates, the pledges of many developing nations assume aid will be provided to help with the task. The richer countries have agreed to provide it, but the flow of funds thus far has been small in relation to the need. This assistance will be increasingly important in the future because a growing share of global emissions will come from rapidly growing developing countries. We project these countries to represent over three-quarters of global emissions by 2030, and to continue to grow after that. Failure to achieve substantial increases in ambition in these 2020 declarations, and the financial assistance to support them, would be bad news for the climate. Delay in starting the turn-down of emissions suggested in our analysis will further add to the collection of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As their concentration grows, the path of reduction leading to a 2\'b0C outcome will become steeper, and thus more costly, potentially putting temperature goals out of reach. All this means that a wimpy response by participating nations in 2020 will threaten the credibility of the hard-won Paris Agreement. The willingness of nations to participate in such a volunteer control effort depends on confidence in the fairness and effectiveness of the global effort. Are others doing their part? Is the overall regime working? If countries don t meet their Paris Agreement commitments to cut emissions and then, further, don t ratchet up their ambitions, the entire agreement risks unraveling. Time pressure The current absence of the US in global climate talks doesn t help, but fortunately most other nations recognise the global risk and are making a serious effort to ensure that the agreement succeeds. And all negotiators recognise that substantial new pledges in 2020 will help build confidence in the effort, besides encouraging everybody to make sure they meet their 2030 goals. There is great time pressure between now and 2020, given all that needs to be done. But this is nonetheless a time of great opportunity. Negotiated deals and national decisions made in these few months may determine whether or not the world s nations will get on track to meeting this global challenge.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa33","Minister Edna Molewa: Opening of South African National Talanoa Dialogue","August 23, 2018 Thursday","South African Official News","Keynote Address at the Opening of the South African National Talanoa Dialogue by the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Dr Edna Molewa, Midrand Conference Center It is my pleasure to address this national dialogue on climate change involving key South African constituencies and stakeholders, in the presence of our development partners. At the outset, I wish to recognize the presence of the European Union's Ambassador to South Africa, Dr Marcus Cornaro, and to convey our appreciation for the support our European partners have provided for the hosting of this event. I am also pleased to recall that South Africa was able to make its own modest contribution to the hosting of the European Union's Talanoa Dialogue earlier this year. I would also like to recognize the former Chief Negotiator of the French CoP 21 Presidency, Dr Laurence Tubiana and Ms Monika Trojan-Otwinowska, who is representing the Incoming Polish CoP 24 Presidency. We are further honoured to be joined here today by South African National Planning Commissioners, elected representatives, leaders of the business community, civil society, labour organisations, academia, and other fellow South Africans. Ladies and gentlemen, South Africa's national story thus far is one of struggle for dignity, self-determination and inclusive and sustainable social and economic development. Our story teaches us that it is possible to overcome even seemingly intractable challenges through dialogue. The democratic dispensation we have collectively achieved through this dialogue has already delivered on a number of our political, social and economic development objectives. However, clearly more needs to be done and there are serious challenges in the road ahead. Climate change is one of these key challenges and it poses the single biggest threat to development, with its widespread and unprecedented impacts that disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. It is therefore essential that all South Africans work together to address this challenge and that we deepen and broaden our national conversation on how best to achieve a just transition to a low carbon and climate resilient world. If we adopt the same 'Can do Spirit' that secured our transition to democracy, there is no doubt that we can also bring about the low emissions transition in a manner in which our environment, health and development gains are protected and new opportunities are created for development. Africa has a special and indispensable role to play in addressing climate change and I am recall the poignant words of the late United Nations Secretary-General and one of Africa's greatest sons, Dr Kofi Anan, who sadly passed away earlier this week. Dr Anan said: 'We must not forget that Africa can and has to be part of the solution to climate change. Africa is already experiencing the damaging impact of climate change; yet no region has done less to contribute to global warming than Africa'. Ladies and gentlemen, The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), represents a landmark achievement towards strengthening the collective multilateral approach to climate change. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the multilateral process represents our best hope of addressing this pressing global challenge. South Africa therefore continues to actively and constructively engage in efforts to fully operationalize the Paris Agreement and to raise ambition, both at the international and national level. In this regard, the Paris Agreement makes provision for the communication every five years of contributions and intended efforts of State Parties with regard to mitigation, adaptation and provision of support. These contributions are nationally determined and the onus is on each Party to determine its own best effort towards the global cause and to draw from international best practices and partnerships to help shape its pathway towards the transition to a low carbon future. In this way, the Paris Agreement has the flexibility and ownership by Parties that allows it to cater for the very different levels of capacity and national circumstances of countries. However, these national efforts are part of a collective effort linked to the achievement of globally agreed goals and have to be premised on a number of key multilateral principles, including those of no backsliding; progression of effort over time; differentiation; equity and the need to be guided by science. This necessitates periodic multilateral reviews of the collective effort and a vigorous multilateral process of scientific review, reporting and dialogue to encourage all of us to continuously strive to do more. The Talanoa Dialogue is the first of these multilateral dialogues ahead of the full operationalization of the Paris Agreement from 2020. As such, it is an important opportunity for South Africa and other Parties to demonstrate their unwavering commitment to the Paris Agreement. With this in mind, the Environment Ministers of Brazil, South Africa, India and China, who form the BASIC group, decided at their most recent meeting in Durban in May 2018 to each hold preparatory national Talanoa Dialogues to prepare for the high-level international Talanoa Dialogue at CoP24 in Poland in December 2018. It is therefore my honour to convene this South African national Talanoa Dialogue today and to invite all South African constituencies to join in a process of building South Africa's narratives on how to achieve enhanced ambition and climate action, as part of a global effort. I look forward to sharing your stories and experiences from this event with the international community at the Katowice Climate Conference. Ladies and gentlemen, Some interesting insights and stories have already been shared by State Parties and non-Party stakeholders during the year-long preparatory phase of the Talanoa Dialogue held by Fiji on the guiding questions of; Where are we? Where do we want to go? and How do we get there? These questions can be addressed from diverse points of view, such as climate science, development, business, labour, and others. What unites the stories should be the common good of enhanced climate action. Different countries have different stories to tell, but again what should unite us is that these stories should deliver global good in terms of enhanced climate action. This public consultation is a platform for all South Africans to share their stories of climate action, covering the questions of where they are, what their aspirations are, and how they intend getting there. We have been advised that the Talanoa concept is an inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue. The purpose is to share stories, build empathy and to make wise decisions for the collective good. During the process, participants build trust and advance knowledge through empathy and understanding. This consultation will be conducted in that spirit. Ladies and gentlemen, The Paris Agreement is very close to our hearts here in South Africa not only because the road to Paris started in Durban at CoP 17 in 2011, but also because it affirmed the role of multilateralism in finding solutions for what is a global problem. Climate Change response requires cooperation by the entire international community. It is therefore pleasing to note the presence of our development and negotiating partners. We should jointly press forward with the building of an international regime that is based on science and is rules-based. South Africa submitted, what is now its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the international community. In our NDC, we had three distinct components of, (i) mitigation, (ii) adaptation and (iii) the means of implementation. It builds on our 2009 emission reduction pledge, and presents an emission reduction trajectory range for 2025 and 2030. This was built on sound science and consultation across the entire country. We are greatly encouraged by initiatives undertaken by certain sectors of our society, such as business in its Carbon Disclosure Project run by the National Business Initiative. These are initiatives and stories that need to be told as they contribute to our ability to achieve our emission reduction targets. As of 2016 we are at the voluntary stage of implementing the South African Mitigation System, and such initiatives are critical in a smooth transition to the second phase, backed by legislation. Ladies and gentlemen, The world has already reached a One Degree Centigrade aggregate temperature increase since the start of the industrial revolution and we are already seeing clear signs that this is untenable. Newspaper headlines across the world are dominated by natural disasters often of an unprecedented scale and frequency. We now await further scientific insight into the implications of a One and a Half Degree temperature scenario, with the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Special Report on 1.5oC, which will inform the Talanoa discussions at CoP 24 . The South African NDC sets a number of national adaptation goals, including the development of a national adaptation strategy and plan, the strengthening of institutional capacity for addressing adaptation at all levels, and developing a national early warning system amongst others. These goals were built from a scientific exercise completed in 2015, called the Long-Term Adaptation Scenarios. The Department of Environmental Affairs has worked very well with subnational players, local government, and cities and to this end has undertaken vulnerability assessments across the nine provinces to determine climate risk with the view to develop appropriate responses. Furthermore, the provincial response plans for all the provinces have been developed to outline adaptation options, which are tailored to the provincial needs. We have supported 44 district municipalities in developing risk and vulnerability assessments and response plans through our Local Government Support Programme. Ladies and gentlemen, South Africa is experiencing slow and fragile economic growth, and is encumbered by structural problems. However, we have been looking into the possibility of scaling-up our current efforts and have found that this is not an easy task. Scaling-up efforts requires significant investment that we can only achieve with support. The 2017 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Report on Africa Public Expenditure on Adaptation presents findings that require the attention of both developing and donor countries. The report not only suggests that African countries are investing up to 9% of their GDP on adaptation - with South African investing almost 6% - but also that public expenditure provides bigger benefits for adaptation. The implication of this finding is that the budgetary support modality is most suited for adaptation, whereas the international finance mechanisms and donor policies have steadily moved towards a project-based approach. As much as project-based financing may be suited for mitigation, it is not the case for adaptation. South Africa has the requisite institutions, accountability and governance systems to make best use of budgetary support. Despite these challenges of scaling up action, we are encouraged by success stories that give us confidence that we can meet our goals. These include success in the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REIPPP); the Green Transport Strategy; and the Energy Efficiency in Industry Strategy; Expanded Public Works Programme, amongst others. This platform is precisely to hear your stories, and ideas for moving towards a low-carbon and climate resilient economy. I also wish to highlight that we are working on a Climate Change Bill which has been published for consultation. We see this as an important aspect of not only enhancing climate change governance in our country but achieving our undertakings in all areas. Ladies and gentlemen, One of the success stories South Africa has to share with the international community is the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme (REIPPP). The National Development Plan 2030 requires 20 000 MW of renewable energy by 2030 and this is supported by the Integrated Resource Plan of the Country. So far, we have procured 6 376 MW. More recently, in April 2018 we signed up 27 Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The 27 IPPs are expected to produce 2 300 MW of electricity with a mitigation potential of 8.1 Megaton CO2 equivalent per annum. Another promising story is the initiation of a process to 'decarbonize' the transport sector and lower its emissions by introducing and providing support for initiatives ranging from the uptake of electric and hybrid cars, cleaner fuels and energy efficiency, expansion of non - motorized transportation, efficient and integrated Bus Rapid Transport System, amongst others. Progress has been made in in enhancing the City of Tshwane's bus fleet using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). The City of Johannesburg is using a dual system for their bus network with a combination of diesel and CNG. For phase 2, the City has identified CNG and electric busses as potential newer technologies. The City of Cape Town has selected to procure electric busses for their phase, which are currently undergoing testing. Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to the discussions during the coming day and a half, and will listen careful, as you engage in this safe space to share your own stories. Please be mindful that this is not a platform to be critical of others, or to pronounce on what they should do, rather to speak to what you can do. More importantly, let us not forget the inspirational words of the father of the South African success story Tata Nelson Mandela who said: 'It always seems impossible, until it's done'. As a nation we have achieved a lot through dialogue and I hope that this dialogue can usher in a new way through which we look at this collective climate change problem and come up with a solution that is bigger than any single input from each of us. I thank you. \"

More than 2,000 delegates from 196 countries joined the 6-day talks at the United Nations compound in Bangkok focussed on implementing guidelines of the Paris Agreement. Signed in 2016, the Paris Agreement committed 195 countries to keeping rising global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close to 1.5 degrees as possible within this century. The Bangkok session is deemed a ""final leg"" for the agreed basis for negotiations at the COP24 conference, the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Katowice, Poland in December. Delegates at the Bangkok meeting have been urged to accelerate the negotiations given the ""modest"" progress made so far. ""We have not progressed far enough. It [the Bangkok meeting] is not just an additional session; it is an urgent session,"" said COP23 President Frank Bainimarama as an opening remark in Bangkok. Both the UN agency and non-governmental organizations have also urged developed countries to play a bigger role in tackling climate change. ""Highly inadequate climate finance compromises the capacity of the developing world to survive a [natural] crisis that rich countries are responsible for,"" said Harjeet Singh of ActionAid International in a statement. The NGOs also expressed pessimism that the Bangkok conference and the COP24 will yield any concrete solutions to climate change, calling instead for multi-level actions particularly at home. ""We see that trust in this global process is at an all-time low. We need to be pressuring our governments at home. We need to be implementing real solutions ourselves,"" Lucy Cadena of Friends of the Earth environmental network told dpa. ""[The meetings] are much more about creating loopholes and escape routes for developed countries in particular from ... taking actions,"" said Meena Raman of Third World Network at a sideline press conference on Tuesday.

The Talanoa Dialogue is a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by 2020.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa36","Limiting Climate Change to 1.5 C Is Not Impossible, Says IPCC Chair","December 03, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","When governments set a target in December 2015 of limiting global warming to well below 2\'baC above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to hold it at 1.5\'baC, they invited the IPCC to prepare a report to provide information on this Goal. They asked the IPCC to assess the impacts of warming of 1.5\'baC, the related emissions pathways of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that would result in warming of that amount, and the differences between warming of 1.5 and 2\'baC or higher. The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\'baC shows that it is not impossible to limit warming to 1.5\'baC but that doing so will require unprecedented transformations in all aspects of society. The report shows that this is a worthwhile goal as the impacts of warming of 2\'baC on lives, livelihoods and natural ecosystems are much more severe than from warming of 1.5\'baC. The global temperature has already risen about 1\'baC from pre-industrial levels. The report shows that because of past emissions up to the present it will continue to warm. But these emissions alone are not enough to take the temperature to 1.5\'baC: it is still possible to hold it at that level. This requires very strong cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030, for instance by decarbonization of electricity production, and further cuts after that so that emissions fall to net zero by 2050. Net zero means that any continuing emissions of greenhouse gases, for instance in transport, are compensated by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through measures such as afforestation or other techniques and technologies. This will be achieved by reducing energy demand, for instance through greater energy efficiency, and changes in energy use, construction, transport, cities and food and diets. Limiting warming to 1.5\'baC is possible in terms of physics; the technology and techniques are there; the question is whether people and societies will support politicians in taking these measures. What do world leaders need to know about the climate science that will affect the prosperity and well-being of their citizens? World leaders need to know that the climate is already changing because of emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from human activities such as energy production and use, transport, and agriculture and other forms of land use. These changes pose threats to people from increases in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, forest fires, drought, heavy precipitation and floods. The warming climate is causing the sea level to rise. It is affecting biodiversity and making it harder for species to survive or forcing them to move. These are already affecting people's lives and livelihoods. If we carry on emitting greenhouse gases the climate will continue to warm and these threats will get worse. The new IPCC report shows there is even a big difference in risks between warming of 1.5\'baC and 2\'baC: every bit of warming matters. The report also shows that it is pursuing policies to address climate change, by reducing emissions and adapting to the changes already underway, can creates a more prosperous and sustainable society by fostering innovation and the green economy and building more resilient communities. Economic development and climate action go hand in hand as sustainable development. How optimistic are you about our ability to limit global warming to 1.5 C? The new IPCC report shows it is not impossible, in terms of physics or technology, to limit global warming to 1.5\'baC. But the unprecedented transformations in society will require continuing technical innovation and changes in behaviour and lifestyle. The question is whether individuals and companies are ready to make those changes and encourage politicians to put the conditions in place to create a prosperous and sustainable low-carbon society.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa37","Study Shows How African Countries Are Preparing for Green Development","December 11, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","In order for African countries to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), they will require further human capacity building, and there must be involvement of the private sector from the start of the planning process. This is according to preliminary findings of a study on green growth trends and readiness across the continent jointly conducted by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB). The NDCs spell out the actions countries intend to take to address climate change, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation, and the SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The early findings of the report titled Green Growth Readiness Assessment in Africa was released on the sidelines of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland yesterday Dec. 10. Seven countries; Morocco, Tunisia Senegal Gabon, Rwanda Kenya and Mozambique, were selected for the pilot phase. The scientists presented the findings as climate talks in Katowice entered the second week of negotiations, a stage where political leaders decide whether or not to adapt recommendations brought forth following the first week of technical engagements. The report stated that high-level political commitment, appropriate policies and implementation of government strategic plans are the key drivers of green growth among African countries. ""Governments need to look at this [NDCs and SDGs] as commercial business opportunities,"" said Dr. Frank Rijsberman, the Director General for GGGI. Surprisingly, he said, ""I have asked a number of private investors as to why they do not invest in this sector, and the answer is not lack of finances, instead they say it is because of government policies."" The need for sound policies was reiterated by Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the AfDB, who said that there must be an enabling environment for countries to achieve the much-desired green growth. ""After this assessment report, findings will be shared across the board so that countries can learn from each other,"" said Nyong. According to Dr. Pranab Baruah, one of the lead researchers from GGGI, some of the seven countries in the study have demonstrated high level leadership commitment that confirms their willingness to implement a green growth model. In Kenya, for example, the researchers said that there is a National Climate Change Council that is chaired by the country's President Uhuru Kenyatta. The council oversees the implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan and also advises national and sub-national bodies on mainstreaming, legislative and implementation measures for climate change. Kenya is currently producing the highest amount of geothermal energy in Africa with an output of 534 megawatts (MW), and 84 percent of all electricity installations consist of green energy. The country is also in the process of constructing the largest wind firm in Africa with a potential capacity of 300 MW. This is despite the government's unpopular plan to construct the largest coal plant in sub-Saharan Africa. However, yesterday Kenya's Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko told IPS that the government is likely going to reconsider whether to proceed with construction of the coal plant. But above all, said Baruah, the study found that Kenya's recent introduction of a green growth curriculum in schools was key to the development of human capacity. Rwanda is another country whose green growth is spearheaded from the highest political level. While most countries around the world wait for finances for mitigation projects to come from the Green Climate Fund, Rwanda is already mobilising and disbursing funds nationally. The researchers said that Rwanda has created a 100-million-dollar National Fund for Climate and the Environment (FONERWA) as an instrument for financing the country's needs on environment, climate change, and green growth. In the same vein, Senegal is in the process of removing financial barriers for private sector participation through pilot projects. The country has a 200-million-dollar Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (REEF), which provides financial incentives to private sector led pilot projects, such as lengthening the refinancing period for the small businesses. The study also found that countries require urgent financing readiness, especially with the emergence of Green Climate Fund and that there is an urgent need for the strengthening of policy and planning frameworks for green growth. Countries studied also needed to address weak monitoring and reporting systems and work to enhance wider stakeholder buy-in to the green growth agenda. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa38","Cargo ships are emitting boatloads of carbon, and nobody wants to take the blame","December 19, 2018 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","Maritime shipping transports 90 percent of the goods traded around the world by volume... - But hauling goods around by sea requires roughly 300 million tonnes of very dirty fuel, producing nearly 3% of the world s carbon dioxide emissions, giving the international maritime shipping industry roughly the same carbon footprint as Germany. At summits like the COP24 meeting held in Poland in December of 2018 and in agreements such as the one struck in Paris in 2015, national governments have largely ignored the carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping entering the atmosphere. This is a real problem because if no country is held responsible for emissions, no government will try to reduce them. We believe as scholars of global environmental cooperation that one way forward is to make international maritime shipping emissions the responsibility of specific countries with the goal of increasing pressure to encourage emission reductions. A globalised industry In international climate change negotiations, countries are in charge of reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping could be added to this responsibility. Figuring out whose emissions they are, however, is no easy task. Perhaps no industry is as globalised as maritime shipping. The ships themselves have international webs of owners, operators and registrations. They carry goods sourced in multiple places as they traverse the high seas, stopping in many countries. A single ship might be connected to dozens of companies. It can be built by one company, owned by a group of other companies, and operated by a group of yet more companies. It may carry cargo for many hundreds of businesses destined for many ports run by different companies, be crewed by an outsourced staffing firm, and insured by another company. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development expects trade to continue to grow in the coming decades. The International Maritime Organization, the international body that regulates shipping, predicts that as trade grows, carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping could increase by as much as 250% by 2050. To date, that organisation has done little to address climate change, even though it did announce in April 2018 that it aims to halve emissions from shipping by 2050 rather than letting them soar unchecked. Maersk, the world s largest shipping company, announced several months later that it aims to reduce its emissions to zero by 2050. This is great news, but neither the IMO nor Maersk have provided any detailed information about how these goals will be achieved. Both support more research into fuel-efficient technologies for shipping, but the IMO itself admits that this is not going to be enough. So far, no country has taken ownership of any emissions from international shipping. Only emissions from domestic shipping, such as cargo hauled across Lake Michigan, are counted. The first electric vessels are only now beginning to be made. These ships would most likely have much smaller carbon footprints than those in use today, but they can now only travel short distances before having to charge their batteries again. The technology does not yet exist for long maritime voyages for large vessels. Not mine There are several ways that emissions from international shipping could be allocated to specific countries. In 1996, the countries that had ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change the first global treaty on climate change identified eight options to get this done. Over two decades later, there has been no progress with any of them. The eight options include allocating carbon dioxide emissions to countries based on where the fuel ships use is sold, where ships are registered, or the origins or destinations of the ships. Each option would lead to radically different emissions responsibilities for individual countries, making it even harder for everyone to reach consensus. We believe that a critical first step no matter what approach prevails would be to create a comprehensive and open database of international shipping routes and maritime emissions. That would establish a shared baseline for quantifying and allocating carbon dioxide emissions to countries. Given all that is at stake in a warming world, it is high time that countries stop ignoring a big chunk of the human produced carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. To avoid dangerous climatic changes, it must be all hands on deck. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Even if the world did an unlikely series of about-faces - halting deforestation, going vegetarian, paying huge carbon taxes, boosting energy efficiency - it would not be enough. As the 24th UN conference on climate change started this week, a steady drumbeat of scientific reports have sounded warnings about current climate trajectories. One warned of the need to curb global warming to 1.5C over preindustrial levels instead of the widely accepted target of 2C. Another warned of the growing gap between the commitments made at earlier UN conferences and what is needed to steer the planet off its current path to calamitous global warming. The world has waited so long that preventing disruptive climate change requires action ""unprecedented in scale"", the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in an October report. William Nordhaus, the Yale University professor who just won the Nobel Prize for his work on the economics of climate change, recently described his outlook like this: ""I never use the word 'pessimism'; I always use the word 'realism,' but I'd say it's a kind of dark realism today."" Climate scientists and policy experts realise that they walk a fine line between jolting consumers and policymakers into action and immobilising them with paralysing pessimism about the world's ability to hit climate targets. John Sterman, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's business school, said the world had missed the chance to contain warming without huge disruptions. ""Now, it's technically possible to do that, but we don't have the policies in place,"" he said. ""That's discouraging. But that just means we have to redouble our efforts."" It's not that corporations and governments haven't attacked the problem or made advances in energy technology. But effective policy is lacking. Nordhaus advocates a whopping carbon tax, which the Climate Interactive model shows would kill off most coal, sharply reduce driving and boost purchases of more fuel-efficient vehicles. He said that hitting the 2C target would require global carbon dioxide prices of about $250 (R3500) a ton in 2020, and rising rapidly after that. ""This assumes that all major countries are on board and that economies can handle a large fiscal and trade shock in which energy expenditures rise by about $2trillion in a few years."" Nordhaus has blamed the lack of climate policy progress on the strong incentive for what economists call ""free-riding"". And when it comes to climate change, he said, free-riding was ""particularly pernicious"". There's lots of carbon to absorb. The world will need to sustain consumers' habits and living standards while replacing the energy industry's massive infrastructure. Every day, the world burns about 100million barrels, of oil - up about 2% from the year before. Most of that goes into the petrol tanks of cars and trucks. Replacing them with more fuel-efficient or electric vehicles will take a long time. In November, the number of electric vehicles in the US hit the 1million mark. But that makes only a small dent in the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Global coal consumption is running at more than 5 billion tons annually. A project off the coast of Belgium provides a good example of the need to run to stand still. In November, MHI Vestas, the world's largest maker of wind turbines, announced it would provide 23 of its new biggest turbines to a project in the Belgian North Sea. The massive turbines can power 137471 German homes, the company said. Yet the number of German dwellings grew by 245000 last year. Royal Dutch Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden noted in 2014 that solar and wind provide about 1% of the world's energy. ""How on earth do we think that 1% is going to become 90% of a system twice as big as what it is by the middle of the century?"" he asked. ""Whether you like it or not, it won't happen. ""That might be a gloom-and-doom-type picture,"" van Beurden added. ""But the real challenge is not so much how do we accelerate renewables but more about how do we decarbonise the system we have."" Yet taking carbon out of the system means coming up with technology - and a carbon price to cover the costs. Companies already know how to take carbon dioxide from the air and stuff it below the Earth's surface. But it's expensive, and unless it's used for enhanced oil recovery, it makes no economic sense without a carbon price. On November 27, the UN Environment Programme issued a report saying that the gap between countries' action pledges and the measures to limit warming is getting larger. The report also says that after three years of relatively stable emissions, global greenhouse emissions were up 1.2% in 2017. But all this hasn't discouraged people who say that the world needs - and will inevitably develop - a breakthrough technology. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is one of them. He has invested in Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a $1billion private investment fund, to fund researchers. One of the earliest climate change models was drawn up in 2004 by a pair of Princeton University professors - Robert Socolow, an engineer, and Stephen Pacala, an ecologist. In their model, a series of ""wedges"" could alter the trajectory of rising temperatures. The wedges included things such as: increasing wind capacity tenfold; covering huge areas with solar panels; doubling the fuel efficiency of all cars; tripling the world's capacity of nuclear power; halting global deforestation; or planting new forests over an area the size of the lower 48 states of the US. Socolow now prefers to call climate action a horse race. At the moment, wind and solar are running ahead faster than expected, while nuclear power and carbon capture are trailing behind. He says he worries that the 2C target is setting people up for an inevitable letdown. ""My worry is that people will start talking about game over,"" Socolow said. ""Climate change is not like that."" | Washington Post \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa40","Working together for climate change","July 13, 2018 Friday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","Being in South Africa is always a thrilling experience. This time it will be something special, as the world gets together to honour the 100th birth anniversary of one of its great statesmen, late President Nelson Mandela. Madiba has always been a source of inspiration to me. Still today, I carry with me the kind words of wisdom he shared during my three meetings with him... and a reason why I have a large portrait of him in my office. Hence, it is not only an honour for me to represent the French Government and the French people on this occasion, but a duty as well, because we owe a lot to Mvezo's champion of equal rights and his achievement remains a stellar example for reconciliation in many a strife across the world. As French Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition, I will focus my bilateral meetings on building a strong partnership between South Africa and France regarding the environment in the context of the strategic partnership and hope to have fruitful discussions on fighting climate change, renewable energy and sustainable transport solutions. Our two countries have forged a partnership in international fora based on the common understanding that global warming is a threat to our planet and the well-being of its inhabitants. From COP17 in Durban in 2011 to the Paris agreement in 2015, France and South Africa played a key role and I'm sure this will continue to be the case at this year's COP24 in Poland. Fighting climate change also requires enhanced global action to preserve our ecosystems on land and sea. Nature has endowed us with sufficient resources to prevent global warming. Man has embarked on a vicious cycle as he has polluted the oceans thus reducing their carbon capture potential while at the same time destroyed mangroves that prevented rising sea levels from coastal erosion and water table salinity. As for the fauna, the statistics are alarming: the Earth is hurtling towards its sixth mass extinction, meaning three-quarters of all species could be wiped out in the coming centuries if no action is taken. Africa is one continent where this problem is acute and I commend the South African authorities for the reintroduction of the black rhino from Addo to Chad, where it disappeared 46 years ago. France and South Africa can work together to enhance the current international targets known as the Achi Targets in the coming years especially at the COP15 of the UN Biodiversity Conference in China. The dramatic drought the Cape province has experienced in the recent months is another example of what citizens have to endure if nothing changes and I will be travelling to Cape Town to launch the Hessequa solar-power desalinisation plant, subsidised through a R4.3 million grant from the French Government and co-funded equally by the Western Cape government. In France we have decided to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and our commitment to collaborating with the South African government remains strong in all domains: renewables, energy storage solutions, green finance, expertise and funding for South Africa to achieve energy transition and green growth. Since 2009, 55% of the subsidies from the French Agency for Development (AFD) in South Africa have been dedicated to projects with climate co-benefits. The epitome of these projects is Sunref, a credit line of almost R1 billion aimed at funding innovative enterprises such as Bio2Watt, South Africa's first industrial biogas plant and Africa's biggest to date. Be it on renewable energy, water or waste recycling, to name just a few important sectors, French companies established here in South Africa offer innovative solutions adapted to local needs. As for France, we have a lot to learn from South Africa in terms of innovation, resilience and research on the protection of biodiversity, the reason why I intend to learn from the SANParks experts during my stay. A lot has been achieved over the years but a lot more remains to be accomplished. To some it may seem like a Herculean task and yes, it is. But as Madiba famously said: ""It always seems impossible until it's done"" and if our two countries stand shoulder to shoulder and act together, I'm convinced we can make our planet great again! M.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa41","Costa Rica shows us how","October 12, 2018","Mail & Guardian","The country\' s successful reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is an example that needs to be followed  because no one will be spared the consequences of climate change COMMENT The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body tasked with providing scientific evidence and consensus on climate change and its implications for decision-makers and the public, has just issued its latest, long-awaited report and the challenge it presents to all of us is huge. To avoid severe economic and social shocks and to protect essential ecosystems, we urgently need to limit the increase in global temperature to within 1.5\'b0C of the pre-industrial level. Achieving the required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will require boldness, creativity and some hard choices. But Costa Rica\' s experience shows that, in the long run, what is gained far outweighs the sacrifices for all. Climate change is not the first daunting challenge the country has had to overcome to preserve its biodiversity, which is among the world\' s most diverse per square metre. Deforestation for cattle grazing nearly halved the land covered by forest over the four decades prior to 1986. Government investment in protecting these natural assets was essential, which meant eliminating subsidies for the cattle industry and perverse incentives for agrarian reform. With subsidies and negative incentives gone, Costa Rica\' s cattle population dropped by a third, taking pressure off grazing lands. In the five decades since, forests have recovered and now cover more than half the country. And, although forest cover doubled, Costa Rica\' s per capita income tripled. From this foundation, the economy has grown sustainably and the country has become a world leader in ecotourism. Now, as this latest IPCC report makes clear, rising temperature is the new threat to both biodiversity and our economy. We all must combat it. Costa Rica, for its part, has set what President Carlos Alvarado has called the  titanic and beautiful task of decarbonising the economy. One of the goals of the national decarbonisation plan, which will be launched in December, is to ensure that the market properly accounts for the costs of climate change. This policy has the effect of rendering fossil fuels economically uncompetitive and creating incentives to use Costa Rica\' s nearly 100% renewable power in the transportation sector to cut its dependence on oil. A moratorium on oil and gas exploitation, respected by five different governments, reinforces these incentives. Making the energy sector work properly  an objective that unites both environmentalists and economists  means recognising that a short-term economic boost cannot justify the long-term costs of fossil fuels. As a minister and a climate activist, we both agree that government has an important role to play in achieving decarbonisation. But the work of non-state actors such as local businesses and citizens will also be essential. For this reason, government policy has focused on boosting community-based, low-impact tourism initiatives that value local knowledge. The Costa Rican experience shows that environmental stewardship is a job done best by alliances between local people and national leaders, united by the common cause of conservation. At its heart, Costa Rica\' s approach to climate change is about people, not industry and markets. Our commitment to tackling climate change is based on an understanding of the enormous health risks and costs that arise from inaction. Costa Rica devotes significant resources to tackling problems such as dengue fever and malaria because our people remain our most important asset. And staying below the 1.5\'b0C limit will mean 3.3-million fewer cases of dengue fever annually in Latin America and the Caribbean, fewer people at risk of malaria and less food instability and poor nutrition caused by higher temperatures and unstable weather patterns. Costa Rica is proud to be leading the world by putting this approach into practice. As a result, Costa Rica is one of the few countries ready to exceed its commitments under the Paris climate agreement. Not all the changes will be easy, and getting them right will require perseverance and a commitment to adaptability. Other countries that agreed as part of the Paris agreement to boost the ambition of their national climate plans by 2020 can learn from Costa Rica\' s experience in aiming for decarbonisation, investing in natural assets and recognising the importance of the climate for a healthy population. One of the most obvious lessons is about the interdependence of these policies. Climate change is a collective problem; no single policy is enough, and no country can solve it alone. But this interdependence cannot be an excuse for paralysis. Limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C is a goal around which we can all unite in diverse ways. Next month\' s Climate Vulnerable Forum will bring together leaders from the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change for the first entirely virtual summit of heads of state. Together with the next key intergovernmental meeting, the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) in Poland this December, political leaders have an opportunity to prove they understand the science underpinning the IPCC report and are ready to take ambitious steps to achieve the 1.5\'b0C target. Unless all of us do so, the consequences will spare none of us.  \£9 Project Syndicate Monica Araya is the founder and executive director of Nivela, leads the citizens group, Costa Rica Limpia and is vice-president of Costa Rica\' s Electric Mobility Association.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa42","Climate change: Africa confronts global warming","March 22, 2019 Friday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","Record global greenhouse gas emissions are putting the world on a path toward unacceptable warming, with serious implications for development prospects in Africa... - Limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics, but doing so would require unprecedented changes, said Jim Skea, cochair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group III. But IPCC, the world s foremost authority for assessing the science of climate change, says it is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C if, and only if, there are rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities . For Sub-Saharan Africa, which has experienced more frequent and more intense climate extremes over the past decades, the ramifications of the world s warming by more than 1.5\'b0C would be profound. Temperature increases in the region are projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase; regions in Africa within 15 degrees of the equator are projected to experience an increase in hot nights as well as longer and more frequent heat waves. Benefits of limiting climate change Recognising the increasing threat of climate change, many countries came together in 2015 to adopt the historic Paris Agreement, committing themselves to limiting climate change to well below 2\'b0C. Some 184 countries have formally joined the agreement, including almost every African nation, with only Angola, Eritrea and South Sudan yet to join. The agreement entered into force in November 2016. In December 2018 countries met in Katowice, Poland, for the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) known as COP24 to finalise the rules for implementation of the agreement s work programme. As part of the Paris Agreement, countries made national commitments to take steps to reduce emissions and build resilience. The treaty also called for increased financial support from developed countries to assist the climate action efforts of developing countries. But even at the time that the Paris Agreement was adopted, it was recognised that the commitments on the table would not be enough. Even if the countries did everything they promised, global temperatures would rise by 3\'b0C this century. Sahel to experience strongest drying West Africa has been identified as a climate change hotspot, with climate change likely to lessen crop yields and production, with resultant impacts on food security. Southern Africa will also be affected. The western part of Southern Africa is set to become drier, with increasing drought frequency and number of heat waves toward the end of the 21st century. A warming world will have implications for precipitation. At 1.5\'b0C, less rain would fall over the Limpopo basin and areas of the Zambezi basin in Zambia, as well as parts of Western Cape in South Africa. But at 2\'b0C, Southern Africa is projected to face a decrease in precipitation of about 20% and increases in the number of consecutive dry days in Namibia, Botswana, northern Zimbabwe and southern Zambia. This will cause reductions in the volume of the Zambezi basin projected at 5% to 10%. If the global mean temperature reaches 2\'b0C of global warming, it will cause significant changes in the occurrence and intensity of temperature extremes in all sub-Saharan regions. West and Central Africa will see particularly large increases in the number of hot days at both 1.5\'b0C and 2\'b0C. Over Southern Africa, temperatures are expected to rise faster at 2\'b0C, and areas of the southwestern region, especially in South Africa and parts of Namibia and Botswana, are expected to experience the greatest increases in temperature. Sahel population growth Perhaps no region in the world has been affected as much as the Sahel, which is experiencing rapid population growth, estimated at 2.8% per year, in an environment of shrinking natural resources, including land and water resources. Inga Rhonda King, president of the UN Economic and Social Council, a UN principal organ that coordinates the economic and social work of UN agencies, told a special meeting at the UN that the region is also one of the most environmentally degraded in the world, with temperature increases projected to be 1.5 times higher than in the rest of the world. Largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, the Sahel is regularly hit by droughts and floods, with enormous consequences to people s food security. As a result of armed conflict, violence and military operations, some 4.9 million people have been displaced this year, a threefold increase in less than three years, while 24 million people require humanitarian assistance throughout the region. Climate change is already considered a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing problems, including conflicts. Ibrahim Thiaw, special adviser of the UN secretary-general for the Sahel, says the Sahel region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with 300 million people affected. Drought, desertification and scarcity of resources have led to heightened conflicts between crop farmers and cattle herders, and weak governance has led to social breakdowns, says Thiaw. The shrinking of Lake Chad is leading to economic marginalisation and providing a breeding ground for recruitment by terrorist groups as social values and moral authority evaporate.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa43","Q&A - 'There's a Lot More Climate Finance Available Than People Think' [interview]","January 11, 2019","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","While growth in the green economy looks promising, government regulation and a business-as-usual approach are among the hurdles inhibiting cleaner energy production. Dr. Frank Rijsberman, director-general of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), believes shifts are needed to realise more projects. And he believes funding is available. ""We have teams in more than 30 countries. We work on policy barriers and help develop bankable projects. In the last two years we have helped our member countries mobilise at least one billion dollars in green and climate finance,"" Rijsberman told IPS. GGGI is a treaty-based international organisation that assists countries develop a green growth model. Rijsberman was among panelists discussing 'Unlocking Finance for Sustainability' at the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) Ministerial Conference being held in Cape Town, South Africa from Jan. 10 to 11. It gathered government leaders, businesses and environmentalists to focus on the challenge to ""reduce inequalities, protect the environment and grow the economy"". The conference focused on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted three years ago. ""It is time now to take these global goals and turn them into real changes in the lives of people and nations. It's time for action,"" stated the conference agenda. ""We can restructure our economic and financial systems to transform them into drivers of sustainability and social inclusion; the two prerequisites for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" it continued. At the December United Nations' Climate Conference in Katowice, Poland, where ministers from around the world negotiated on how best to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, which outlines commitments to mitigate climate change, accessing finance was a topical issue. IPS reported from the 24th Conference Of The Parties ( COP24 ) that the African team of negotiators had been concerned about who would carry the burden of financing the implementation of the Paris Agreement. PAGE gathered around 500 innovators and leaders from governments, civil society, private sector, development organisations, media and the general public. The idea was to showcase ""the experiences and creativity of first-movers... and engage in an open debate about what it is going to take to for us to have a 'just transition' to economics and societies that are more inclusive, stable and sustainable."" Rijsberman offered his insights gained from working in different countries on accessing financing for green projects. Excerpts of the interview follow: Inter Press Service (IPS): Where is this money that you mention for green projects? Frank Rijsberman (FR): There's a lot more finance available than people think. There tends to be an over focus on development money but the largest amounts of money is with the private sector and institutional development such as pension funds. We need to get the private sector off the sidelines and to invest in renewable energy. IPS: And how can that be done? FR: They need to realise that green investments are attractive. If you want to do socially important projects then renewable energy is it. It has become the cheapest, most attractive form of energy. IPS: What about the role that governments play in this? They are the regulators that sometimes inhibit the private sector. FR: Sometimes we sit in the room with the private sector and ask them what stops them from investing and they say it's regulation and policies. We have to find a more welcoming environment. We talk to governments and they talk about a study they did three years ago and tell us renewable energy is expensive. But we tell them prices have come down. All that governments know is how to build fossil fuel power plants. Fossil fuel project developers are still in their contact lists. The banks know what to do. They need to look at an energy mix. IPS: So what is it about government policies that hinder moves to renewable energy? FR: Some governments have laws that they use to disconnect companies from power if they put solar on their rooftops. Other countries, like Finland, still have old polices that are bad and that are still on the books. It is also difficult politically when the government subsidises fuel and not renewable energy. Governments need to remove policy barriers. We are in the middle of such a rapid transition but if you sit in a country where governments don't see that it's difficult. Coal and oil is more certain [to produce power] but for countries that need to import that, where prices are uncertain, it's a lot more certain to use the sun and wind if you have this in your country. IPS: How is the prospect for renewable energy looking in the developing world? FR: If you are using only coal-fired power plants then you will sit with a stranded asset. Countries that already have a lot of investment in fossil fuels will find the change to renewable energy painful. In Africa, most countries don't have this. In some countries only 20 percent of people have energy access. These countries can invest in green energy and they can avoid making bad investments and can leapfrog into renewables. They don't have to look like Asia where they have rapidly developed economies and sit with coal-fired power stations that pollute their cities. There is a real opportunity to avoid the problems that other countries have. IPS: What about developing country examples of renewable energy that worked? FR: Just two years ago when the Indian government wanted to a build a power plant they found the prices of large-scale solar panels less than coal-fired power plants. They scrapped all their plans. They are looking at solar power projects. But there is still a lot of inertia. People are still continuing to invest in fossil fuels. We are trying to show governments through information and projects that this is feasible. We want to show how it can reduce risk. We are working on projects. In Fiji the government gives a subsidy to low-income houses for electricity. We have proposed a project where the government puts solar panels on the roof and uses the same subsidy to finance this. It's about using that money for sustainability. Low-income houses have TVs and mobile phones. Making a package for people that puts solar on their roof is better. They can charge their mobile phones and [solar] also connects to their fridge and TV. Social movements have done this in some countries. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa44","Climate Action Should Be a Global Priority for World Leaders","December 04, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The IPCC report says that it is not impossible to limit climate change to 1.5\'cd\' C? Do you think we can realistically achieve that? Politically, what needs to happen? History shows that when the human race decides to pursue a challenging goal, we can achieve great things. From ridding the world of smallpox to prohibiting slavery and other ancient abuses through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we have proven that by joining together we can create a better world. Today, I believe we can succeed in limiting climate change to 1.5\'b0C - but only if we once again work in solidarity with a powerful unity of purpose. Humans have evolved to respond to immediate threats and opportunities. We find it more difficult to address problems that play out over years and decades. We must overcome this natural short-sightedness and commit to urgent climate action. The Paris Agreement confirms the political commitment to climate action, and the UN system provides a platform for international collaboration. What we need now is for more leaders and more citizens to recognize climate action as a global priority and to start working together more urgently. There was a great surge of enthusiasm for action among industries, governments and even regular people after Paris. Do you think that enthusiasm has been sustained and how can their involvement be ramped up? There is no quick fix for climate change. Effective climate action will require a long-term, full-time commitment by virtually everyone. Every climate policy, every new technology, every personal action that contributes to reducing emissions and building resilience should be recognized and applauded. There will be other surges of excitement, as in 2015 when the Paris Agreement was adopted, but most importantly we need to rely on consistent, steady action. We can sustain enthusiasm by sharing success stories, closely monitoring and publicizing emissions levels and climate trends, and keeping the climate conversation alive on a daily basis. Climate change is, in many respects, the quintessential multilateral issue. What needs to happen to strengthen multilateralism to tackle climate change? Climate change is a global phenomenon that requires global solutions. Fortunately, we already have platforms for multilateral action such as the United Nations and forums such as the G20. Meanwhile, thanks to the media and to rapid communications, people are increasingly aware of what is happening in other parts of the world. They see how migration, trade and technology are making us more interdependent than ever before. Although we do see a backlash against global integration in some parts of the world today, I am convinced that the sense of international solidarity will only grow in the years to come. An increasing awareness that we have a shared destiny on this fragile planet will help to strengthen inclusive multilateral action in the years to come. How do we get people and governments to move beyond commitments to concrete actions? Governments need to translate the multilateral goals of the Paris Agreement into specific policies. These policies must to reflect national circumstances and priorities. They need to create what we call an ""enabling environment"" that motivates and rewards companies, communities and individuals to take concrete actions. Through the Paris Agreement we will monitor national and global emissions trends to determine which national policies seem to be working and which need to be reviewed. So in sum we must build on the broad political commitment set out in Paris to craft national policies that encourage and recognize concrete measures by the full range of actors. We are all responsible for emitting greenhouse gases, so we all have a role - whether in our work, or in our personal lives - in taking concrete actions to reduce emissions. There are many success stories in all regions and all sectors that demonstrate the enormous potential of climate action. To start with, a growing number of cities and regions have adopted targets to achieve zero net emissions between 2020 and 2050. These targets are often developed in collaboration. Just one example: Nineteen city leaders from the C40 coalition signed the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Declaration to ensure that all new buildings operate with a neutral carbon footprint by 2030. The rise of inclusive multilateralism, where not only national governments but local and regional governments as well as a diverse array of associations and organizations work closely together, is a powerful force for climate action. Collaboration is also taking place among actors in particular economic sectors. Earlier this year, the global transport sector, which is responsible for some 14 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, created the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance. The Alliance recognizes that lowering transport emissions will also help to reduce urban pollution and improve public health. Transport companies and managers are creating innovative solutions, including new materials and designs, the increased use of renewable energy, improved public transport systems, and more efficient management of road, air and other transport networks. Building collaboration within a sector is a great way to raise ambition and to share success stories and best practices. We also see a growing list of individual corporations adopting emissions targets. Many have signed up to a Science Based Target to ensure that they are in line with the 1.5-2\'b0C temperature limit enshrined under the Paris Climate Change Agreement. To date, over 700 leading businesses around the world have made strategic climate commitments through the We Mean Business coalition's Take Action campaign. There are so many more inspiring examples from a wide range of actors. Their efforts, more than anything else, is what gives me hope that we can achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement and minimize global climate change and its risks. Their stories should inspire all of us to contribute more energetically to climate action.

The SDG Media Compact seeks to inspire media and entertainment companies around the world to leverage their resources and creative talent to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. World leaders are meeting at the Climate Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, 2 to 14 December, to finalize the rulebook to implement the 2015 landmark Paris Agreement on climate change. In the agreement, countries committed to take action to limit global warming to well under 2\'b0C this century. At the conference in Poland, the UN will invite people to voice their views and launch a campaign to encourage every day climate action. \"

Premier fashion brands, retailers, and supplier organisations have agreed... Forty-three brands, including Adidas, Burberry, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc. Hugo Boss, H&M Group, Inditex, Kering, Levi Strauss & Co., Puma SE, PVH Corp.,Target; leading membership organisations, including Business for Social Responsibility, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, China National Textile and Apparel Council, Outdoor Industry Association and Textile Exchange; global logistics company Maersk; and global NGO WWF International have committed to implementing or supporting the 16 principles and targets that underpin the Fashion Climate Charter. The Charter, which is open for other companies and organisations to join, recognises the crucial role that fashion plays on both sides of the climate equation - as a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and as a sector with multiple opportunities to reduce emissions while contributing to sustainable development. Net zero emissions by 2050 Aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the Charter contains the vision for the industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and defines issues that will be addressed by signatories, ranging from decarbonisation of the production phase, selection of climate-friendly and sustainable materials, low-carbon transport, improved consumer dialogue and awareness, working with the financing community and policymakers to catalyse scalable solutions, and exploring circular business models. To make concrete progress on these commitments, six working groups have been established in which signatories will work to define steps for implementation. The signatories are not waiting for these issues to be fully elaborated and have set an initial target to reduce their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 and have defined concrete measures, such as phasing out coal-fired boilers or other sources of coal-fired heat and power generation in their own companies and direct suppliers from 2025. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/462/184758.html :EMBED--> The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture, so I am pleased to see it now also leading the way in terms of climate action, said UN Climate Change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa. I congratulate the signatories of this important charter, which represents a unique commitment and collaboration from an array of fashion leaders. The Charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow. The Charter is industry-led, and open to a wider group of fashion stakeholders. It is supported by a range of relevant organisations and NGOs that will foster ambition which will be tracked and recognised by UN Climate Change. The Charter aims to drive climate action in the sector, including by complementing and supporting other fashion sector initiatives aimed at increasing climate action. We are aware that more than 90 percent of Puma s carbon footprint is being generated in shared supply chains. If we want to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chains, we need to work together with our industry peers, said Bj\'f8rn Gulden, CEO of Puma. The Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action provides a collective industry effort to support the goals of the Paris Agreement. We appreciate that UN Climate Change has set up a global platform and call upon our industry peers to join the initiative. Karl-Johan Persson, CEO H&M Group commented: This charter is about getting the fashion industry united in important climate work. Our industry has a global reach and only together can we create the change that is urgently needed. We are happy to be a signatory of this charter as part of our ambition to become climate positive in our value chain. <!--EMBED: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/462/182092.html :EMBED--> Clarion call for the fashion industry In early 2018, fashion leaders volunteered to shape a climate movement through discussions in working groups chaired by Puma SE and H&M Group. The launch last week, during the critical UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland ( COP24 ), reflects sectoral buy-in and is a clarion call to the fashion industry globally to sign-up to climate action. The founding signatories are: Adidas, Aquitex, Arcteryx, Burberry Limited, Esprit, Guess, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Hakro Gmbh., Hugo Boss, Inditex, Kering Group, Lenzing AG, Levi Strauss & Co., Mammut Sports Group AG, Mantis World, Maersk, Otto Group, Pidigi S.P.A, PUMA SE, re:newcell, Schoeller Textiles AG, Peak Performance, PVH Corp., Salomon, Skunkfunk, SLN Textil, Stella McCartney, Sympatex Technologies, Target and Tropic Knits Group. Supporting organisations include: Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC), China Textile Information Center (CTIC), Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Outdoor Industry Association (OIA), Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), Sustainable Fashion Academy (SFA), Textile Exchange, WWF International and ZDHC (Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation). <!--EMBED: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/462/174742.html :EMBED--> By signing on to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, CEOs and presidents of these organisations have confirmed their commitment to address climate change and their willingness to step up collaboration within and beyond the fashion sector towards a cleaner, low-carbon future. The fashion industry which encompasses textiles, clothing, leather, and footwear industries, from the production of raw materials and manufacturing of garments, accessories and footwear to their distribution and consumption has long supply chains and energy-intensive production. Burberry is proud to be a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, said Marco Gobbetti, chief executive officer, Burberry. While we have committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations, achieving a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the entire global fashion industry by 2030 will require innovation and collaboration. By working together with other signatories of the Charter, we believe that we can achieve systemic change and build a more sustainable future. A key challenge of our lifetime Principles and actions outlined in the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action will be pursued and developed collectively through working groups which will be convened by the UN Climate Change in early 2019. Any company or organisation professionally engaged in the fashion sector, regardless of where they are in their environmental journey, and who are committing to the principles of the Charter by signing it, may participate in this work. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa46","Nations round on US, allies as UN climate talks wrap up","September 9, 2018","Mail & Guardian","Developing countries rounded on the United States and its allies at emergency climate talks Sunday, accusing the world's richest nations of stalling a deal aimed at preventing runaway global warming. Experts from around the world wrapped up discussions in Bangkok geared towards creating a comprehensive rulebook for countries to implement the landmark Paris Accord on climate change. But talks foundered over the key issue of how efforts to limit climate change are funded and how contributions are reported. Delegates representing some of Earth's poorest and smallest nations said on the final day of the summit that the US and other Western economies had failed to live up to their green spending commitments. ""Developed countries are responsible for the vast majority of historic emissions, and many became remarkably wealthy burning fossil fuels,"" said Amjad Abdulla, the head of a negotiating bloc of small island states. ""Yet, we face devastating climate impacts and some of us could be lost forever to rising seas"" without progress on the Paris deal by the end of the year, he added. The Paris deal, struck in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rises to less than two degrees Celsius and to below 1.5 degrees if possible by the end of the century. To do this, countries agreed to a set of promises, including to establish an annual $100-billion fund to help developing nations react to our heating planet. But the details of the final rulebook are subject to intense debate. The US and other developed economies want less oversight on how their funding is gathered and more flexibility over how future finance is structured. But developing nations insist they need predictable and open funding in order to effectively plan their fight against the fallout from climate change. A senior climate negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP Sunday that the US and rich nations were asking poorer ones to trust them to self-regulate climate financing. ""We want to do our bit, but how can we trust them? Show us the money,"" the negotiator said. Delegates ended talks Sunday with an agreement to hand over technical discussions to a panel of experts, who will continue to meet before the COP 24 kicks off in Katowice, Poland, at the start of December. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate change secretary, told reporters progress had been made in Bangkok ""on most issues"" but that ""no issues have been fully resolved yet"". The issue of climate finance was ""very difficult and politically sensitive,"" she added. ""For Katowice to be successful, work needs to speed up and political will needs to be intensified.""Paris deal 'on brink' The Bangkok talks were organised as an emergency negotiating session after little progress was made at previous rounds towards a final rulebook. Under the timeframe set in Paris, the guidelines for nations must be finalised by the end of 2018. While delegates made some headway on areas such as new technology and carbon markets, activists said the US -- with Western acquiescence -- had stonewalled any momentum on the key funding issue. Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for NGO ActionAid, said Sunday the Paris deal was ""on the brink"". ""Developed countries are going back on their word and refusing to agree clear rules governing climate finance,"" he told reporters. ""If they remain stuck in their positions and fail to loosen their purses, this treaty may collapse.""'Unimpressed by politicians'The US under President Donald Trump will leave the Paris process in 2020, but multiple delegates in Bangkok told said that it was still actively hindering progress in talks. One senior negotiator said the US was ""poisoning"" the atmosphere of trust that led to the Paris accord. Activists also called out the European Union, Britain and Australia for falling into line with Washington's position. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the rate of climate change was rapidly outstripping the political effort to curb it. ""As this summer's devastating wave of heat waves, wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather events across the world makes abundantly clear, the Earth's climate system is unimpressed by politicians' rhetoric."" \£9 Agence France-Presse \"

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa48","BRICS ministers roll up their sleeves for milestone 10th summit in Joburg","June 06, 2018 Wednesday","Cape Times (South Africa)","The MINISTERS of Foreign Affairs/International Relations of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa met in Pretoria on June 4. They reflected on the importance of this year marking a decade of BRICS Summits, as a testimony to the fortitude of BRICS co-operation and reiterated the commitment to implement the outcomes and consensus of past BRICS Summits. The ministers welcomed South Africa's chairship and looked forward to the 10th BRICS Summit to be held under the theme, ""BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the Fourth Industrial Revolution"" and committed themselves to work together for a fruitful Joburg summit. The ministers recalled the BRICS tradition of outreach to extend its co-operation to fellow developing and emerging economies. In this respect, they welcomed South Africa's two-pronged outreach approach through the BRICS-Africa Dialogue and the BRICS Plus co-operation to be held during the summit. The ministers expressed their gratitude to South Africa for hosting the meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations, contributing positively to the BRICS co-operation. They exchanged views on current issues of global significance in political, security, economic, financial and sustainable development spheres, as well as intra-BRICS co-operation. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the UN as the universal multilateral organisation entrusted with the mandate for maintaining international peace and security, advancing global development and to promoting and protecting human rights so as to build a brighter shared future for the global community. They recalled the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can respond adequately to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN. The ministers underscored the importance of sustained efforts aimed at making the UN more effective and efficient in implementing the mandates conferred upon it. In this regard, they committed to intensifying dialogue among the BRICS countries on the administration and budget of the UN, with a view to strengthening the organisation and preserving its member state-driven character. The ministers expressed their support for continued co-operation of BRICS members in areas of mutual interest, including through regular exchanges among their multilateral missions. They also reconfirmed the commitment to fully implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental. They pledged their support for the important role of the UN, including the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in co-ordinating and reviewing global implementation of the 2030 agenda, and support the need to reform the UN Development System with a view to enhancing its capability in supporting member states in implementing the 2030 agenda. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to tackling climate change. They welcomed the entry into force of the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. They expressed hope to complete the Paris Agreement Work Programme at COP24 . The ministers reiterated BRICS commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international order and in this regard reaffirmed the centrality of UN, World Trade Organisation (WTO) and international law. They pledged their support to efforts towards making global governance more representative with greater participation of emerging markets and developing countries in global decision-making. The ministers emphasised the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalisation. They underlined their firm commitment to free trade, and the centrality of a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, multilateral trading system as embodied in the WTO. They opposed the new wave of protectionism and the systematic impact of unilateral measures that are incompatible with WTO rules, and undermines global trade, and economic growth. In this regard, they reiterated that the WTO Dispute Settlement System is a cornerstone of the MTS as it is designed to enhance security and predictability in international trade. The ministers reaffirmed their resolve to foster a global economic governance architecture that is more effective and reflective of current global economic landscape, increasing the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing economies. They reaffirmed their commitment to conclude the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2019 Spring Meetings. They will continue to support the implementation of the World Bank Group Shareholding Review. The ministers welcomed the institutional progress of the New Development Bank (NDB), including the upcoming establishment of the Americas regional office in So Paulo, Brazil, which, alongside the Africa Regional Centre (ARC), will help the NDB consolidate its presence in those continents. The ministers deplored the continued terrorist attacks, including in some BRICS countries. They condemned terrorism in all its forms and urged concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis, and expressed their conviction that a comprehensive approach was necessary to ensure an effective fight against terrorism. They recalled the responsibility of all states to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories. The ministers highly value the Third BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group Meeting held in Nelspruit on April 19 and 20. They called for an expedited adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN General Assembly and expressed concern over the ongoing conflict and heightened tensions in the Middle East, especially with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian situation. The ministers reiterate the need for renewed diplomatic efforts to achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East on the basis of relevant UN resolutions, the Madrid Principles, the Arab Peace Initiative and previous agreements between the parties through negotiations with a view to creating an independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian State living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel. The ministers reiterated that the status of Jerusalem is one of the final status issues to be defined in the context of negotiations between Israel and Palestine. They reiterated their countries' support for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). They commend the vital role it plays in providing health, education and other basic services for almost 5.3 million Palestinian refugees and underscored its relevance to bringing stability to the region and the need for ensuring a more adequate, sufficient, predictable and sustained funding for the agency. The ongoing conflict in the Republic of Yemen is a further concern, having become a major humanitarian crisis. The ministers urged all parties to fully respect international law to cease hostilities and to return to the UN brokered peace talks, leading to an inclusive Yemeni-led dialogue towards the achievement of a political solution to the conflict. The ministers reaffirmed their support for an ""Afghan-led, Afghan-owned"" national reconciliation process. They expressed their concern over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, particularly the increase in the number and intensity of terrorist-related attacks on the Afghan National Security Forces, the government and civilians. The ministers called on the international community to assist the government and the people of Afghanistan in stabilising the security situation in the country as well as for the return of dialogue with the objective of working towards the realisation of peace in the country and an inclusive political process. They also welcomed the parliamentary elections which are scheduled to be held in October and the presidential elections next year. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment for a political resolution of the conflict in Syria, through an inclusive ""Syrian-led, Syrian-owned"" political process which safeguards the state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria in pursuance of UN Security Council Resolution 4 (2015) and taking into account the result of the Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue in Sochi. They reiterated their support for the Geneva process and the mediation offered by the UN, as well as the Astana process, and stressed the complementarity between the two initiatives. They expressed their support to the efforts by Russia to advance the Syrian national dialogue. The ministers reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful resolution in Syria. They expressed their opposition to measures that run contrary to the UN Charter and the authority of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and do not contribute to advancing the political process. They also highlighted the importance of unity in the fight against terrorist organisations in Syria in full observance of the relevant UNSC resolutions. The ministers reiterated their strong condemnation of the use of chemical weapons by any party, for any purpose and under any circumstances, and renewed calls for comprehensive, objective, independent, and transparent investigations of all alleged incidents. The ministers called for efforts to be enhanced to provide necessary humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, bearing in mind urgent reconstruction needs. The ministers recalled the importance that all relevant parties of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear issue fully comply with their obligations, and ensure full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to promote international and regional peace and security. The ministers welcomed the recent developments to achieve the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and to maintain peace and stability in north-east Asia. They reaffirmed the commitment for peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation. The ministers also reaffirmed the importance of the elaboration under the UN auspices of rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of states in ensuring security in the use of ICTs. They acknowledged the work to promote co-operation, according to the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Co-operation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs or any other mutually agreed mechanism. They acknowledge the initiative of the Russian Federation on a BRICS intergovernmental agreement on co-operation in ensuring security in the use of ICTs and look forward to its consideration at the upcoming meeting of the National Security Advisers/High Representatives in Durban. The ministers commended African countries and the AU on the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area as an important step to economic integration on the continent and the unlocking of the tremendous potential of intra-African trade and addressing the socio-economic challenges. In this regard, the ministers reiterated their support for Agenda 2063 and efforts to promote continental integration and development. They underlined the importance of the upcoming meeting of the National Security Advisers/High Representatives in Durban. They also highlighted their support for the meeting of BRICS Deputy Ministers/Special Envoys on the Middle East and North Africa in taking BRICS dialogue further. The ministers look forward to the next meeting on the margins of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly. - Department of International Relations and Co-operation \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa49","Debate around the Carbon Tax Billgetting hotter by the day","January 07, 2019 Monday","The Star (South Africa)","THE CURRENT COP 24 taking place in Poland and the recent announcement by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni that the South African government is going ahead with the implementation of Carbon Tax in June 2019 comes amid many questions - most of which will remain unanswered due to the contentious nature of the levy. The debate around the Carbon Tax Bill recently tabled by the National Treasury is far from concluded, and the big sticking point is not the merits in reducing greenhouse gases (GHG), but rather its proposed implementation and ability to make a difference for ordinary South Africans. Instead, questions are being raised about the wisdom of introducing a new tax into an environment that is reeling with rising costs of living due to spiralling energy costs, food prices, joblessness and growing inequalities. How the collected taxes will be utilised by the government is a significant point of debate with growing calls for the income being deployed for mitigating initiatives rather than to increase the fiscus. Because of the legacy of industrialisation, the new law would affect between 1000 and 1500 companies and 75percent of national emissions. It proposes a tax rate of R120 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent and states that total tax-free allowances during the first phase until 2022 can be as high as 95percent. The South African government has been drafting carbon tax legislation for more than a decade with the aim of reducing pollution which has been part of the country's landscape for more than a century as the local economy ramped up industrialisation through the development of mines, cement and steel plants and fossil powered electricity plants. In 2006, the South African Cabinet mandated work on the Long-Term Mitigation Scenarios (LTMS) with some form of carbon tax being the central feature of measures aimed at curbing activities of these big businesses considered high emitters. South Africa is not alone in wanting to fight carbon emissions. But the country is one of the few developing or middle-income countries that has agreed to difficult commitments to reducing GHG at the Paris Climate Accord (COP 21) in 2015. The main objective of the agreement is to limit the global temperature increase to below 1.5C. The recognition of the 1.5-degree target is of central importance to South Africa as an African and developing country that is highly vulnerable to climate change. South Africa ratified the Paris climate change pact two years ago and has pledged to cut emissions by almost half by 2030, when they are seen peaking between 398 and 614million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. South African corporates, such as AfriSam, operating in the cement industry, are in support of carbon emission curbing measures, if the instruments are appropriately implemented and there is government financial support. Cement production accounts for about 5percent of global carbon emissions, making it the second biggest source of carbon emissions from global industry, after steel. Reducing its carbon emissions has been a core focus for AfriSam for almost 30 years and have made great strides due to enhancements in technology, equipment and its cement manufacturing processes. As a result, the company has managed to reduce its GHG emissions by 31percent since 1990. Through the Association of Cementitious Material Producers (ACMP), AfriSam has actively been participating in carbon tax legislation development and has had interactions with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Treasury on the design of the carbon tax and implications thereof. AfriSam has improved the energy efficiency of its clinker manufacturing process, by implementing high-level process control systems and various other mechanical improvements on critical equipment. This resulted in significant improvements, such that it justified the awarding of a Section 12L tax rebate. In looking at the medium-term implications for the company, there will undoubtedly be a financial implication and an increased drive to implement carbon reduction projects. AfriSam believes that South Africa needs to ensure that it positions itself in the global context as well, and that it works towards a more holistic approach towards GHG management. There is a very fine balance between the sustaining of economic activities in the country and complying to international GHG reduction commitments. Ensuring that carbon reduction technology can be more financially accessible, will fast-track the implementation of these. The tax rate is set at R120 per ton of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) produced. To allow businesses time for transition, a basic percentage-based threshold of 60percent will apply, below which tax is not payable. Another major concern is the uncertainty of the legislation's near future. Not knowing how the legislation will be carried out makes it quite hard for companies to make necessary plans for sustainability. For instance, knowing that in four to six years from now all allowances will fall away might make it worthwhile to install a more capital-intensive solution rather than to wait to pay massive taxes. Over and above this, there are anticipations that the funds paid due to the implementation of Carbon Tax are ring-fenced to assist companies in the implementation of projects that will result in a reduction in GHG emissions. The tax should be used as an instrument to achieve better results on GHG reduction strategies, rather than general fiscus boasting exercise. Hannes Meyer: Cementitious executive at AfriSam.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa50","New Year's messages from agri leaders","January 14, 2019 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The agriculture sector survived a year of rising uncertainty in 2018, but with the national election and the threat of drought looming, 2019 will be every bit as challenging. According to leaders in the sector, farmers will have to be resilient and partner with the right role players to face the trials that await. We need partnerships Senzeni Zokwana, Minister, Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries It is with great excitement that we begin 2019. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) has much hope for the country s economy as a whole, as well as for the agriculture sector in particular, thanks to the renewed certainty that has been unfolding from government since early last year. The agriculture sector suffered a huge setback last year due to the impact of the drought, which significantly affected our country s GDP. This shows the critical role that the sector plays in South Africa s economy. It would be remiss of me to not briefly reflect on the discourse that has dominated much of 2018. I want to reiterate government s position that the policy shift on land, especially in relation to land expropriation without compensation, will not result in the confiscation of commercial farms that are producing goods for our agro-food markets. Food security for this country is a fundamental issue, but the issue of land redress is equally important. It is in this regard that we urge all stakeholders to focus on workable solutions as proposed by government. In terms of land reform, DAFF is working with provincial departments to grow capacity to be able to better respond with post-settlement support to ensure the success of land reform beneficiaries. But we need to forge partnerships with the public sector and mentorship mechanisms with established commercial farmers. Another concern is the high unemployment rate in the country.<!> <!--EMBED: https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/718/185739.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/718/185739.html :EMBED--> According to Statistics South Africa, the unemployment rate among young people aged 15 to 34 is 38,2%, or 21 million people. This means that more than one in every three young people are unemployed. This poses a massive challenge for South Africa s future. We believe the agriculture sector can make a major contribution in employment creation for young people. The sector is undergoing disruptions occasioned by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with new technologies replacing old methods. However, to successfully target the youth, there will have to be investment in the sector. The policy will be the overall national policy framework for the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors, and will guide the Census of Commercial Agriculture, which will run from 15 October 2018 to June 2019. This will also assist us in establishing an up-to-date frame of reference for conducting surveys in the agriculture sector, and help us to clearly understand the national distribution of commercial and emerging farmers and their performance. We anticipate a good year and consistent recovery of the sector in its contribution to the national economy. A year of big issues looms for agriculture Dr Theo de Jager, president, World Farmers Organisation This year promises to be an exciting one for agriculture. In South Africa, politics will dominate our discourse and destiny, especially in the run up to the national election, with the debate around land and expropriation likely to heat up as election day approaches. On the international front, there are new developments and initiatives that will also impact on how we go about our business, and 2019 might well be crunch time for some of those issues. The UN s Food and Agriculture Organisation has decided to launch a Decade of Family Farming in 2019.<!> One of the goals of this initiative is to counter the global phenomenon of corporatisation of primary production, where large companies farm huge tracts of land in competition with smaller family farmers, killing rural towns and knocking the smaller farmers out of the industry in the process. Family farming is one of the most broad-based mechanisms to create wealth where it is needed most: rural areas. The other big event for agriculture in 2019 will be the Climakers Campaign, a farmer-driven agenda on climate change, which was launched at COP24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. The campaign centres on answering these two questions: what can farmers do to mitigate and adapt to climate change?; and what would farmers need to do it? The third issue that has the potential to disrupt the well-being of global agriculture is the future of trade under US President Donald Trump s rule. Whether called a potential trade war or not, the first shots have certainly been fired, and casualties, such as the pork industry in the US, can t be avoided. At the World Economic Forum in Davos early in 2019, farmers will take a stand on the impact of trade conflicts on the livelihoods of those who produce perishable goods, and we hope to bring some stability to the discourse on agricultural trade. We need to convince politicians not to use our products as batons to fight each other when they disagree on issues that have nothing to do with agriculture. To have the voices of farmers heard, we need strong farmers organisations, and broader involvement of individual farmers. The participation of each and every farmer is thus vital. May you be blessed on the little piece of the planet that was entrusted to your care, and may it reward you and your family with a profitable and sustainable livelihood! A glimmer of hope Dr Vuyo Mahlati, president, African Farmers Association of South Africa However, black farmers continue to face stumbling blocks as they strive to grow to feed their households and contribute to national and household food security. Despite this, they continue to play their part to be counted as players in the mainstream economy. Their efforts to succeed also increase their exposure to the failures of agriculture-related systems, which risks undermining their hard work. These include extension services, training centres, land, water, markets and access to finance. The African Farmers Association of South Africa (AFASA) is thus determined to continue pushing for the transformation of the agriculture sector as part and parcel of the broader agrarian reform government policies promote. AFASA s second Agribusiness Transformation Conference, which took place in 2018 and focused on value chain integration and farming as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, succeeded in promoting smart partnerships between investors and landowners and amongst farmers themselves. This glimpse of hope gives us courage to push forward. As South Africa embarked on the delicate, and agonising, but inevitably long-standing, issue of land reform with Parliamentary public hearings on expropriation without compensation, the leadership shown by various farmers organisations through their joint statement on 27 August 2018 is commendable. Another show of resilience was the GDP growth in the third quarter of 2018 following a slump in the first two quarters. During the conclusion of the 2018 planting season, we sawhow climate change continues to be a reality. To address the challenge of changing weather patterns, AFASA will put in place a contributory insurance scheme to cover qualifying investors and, most importantly, the farming community. In 2019, AFASA will aim to improve the performance of black farmers by promoting the modernisation and improvement of farming systems through the introduction of improved technologies and efficient use and management of land. Together we can and we shall! Hope for progress, despite uncertainty Dr John Purchase, CEO, Agbiz The year 2018 was an eventful one, to say the least, especially in the agribusiness sector. Many challenges came to the fore, such as land reform, AgriBEE, job creation, electricity supply, water availability and quality, and uncertainty in the investment environment, to mention but a few. Undoubtedly, we will be entering 2019 with a number of these issues creating uncertainty, and they will require our undivided attention. At the end of a year during which the phrase land expropriation without compensation was the most used phrase in the media, the debates around the contentious issue of land reform, particularly of land expropriation without compensation, remain a key risk that could potentially undermine investment in the sector if not handled well. Orderly, predictable and market-based land reform, within the ambit of the current Constitution of South Africa, is essential to ensure tenure security and business confidence, and to maintain the integrity of the agro-food system. Although South Africa boasts a healthy and robust agro-food industry, it could come under pressure in 2019. At the end of 2018, sentiment in the agriculture sector remained subdued. However, given the uncertainty at the end of 2017 regarding many unresolved issues, great strides have been made in 2018, and many of these issues are in the process of being resolved through, amongst others, the Zondo Commission of Enquiry into State Capture and the Nugent Commission of Inquiry into the South African Revenue Service. With the challenges of greater uncertainty, less control, and greater risk, more opportunities present themselves. I urge the agriculture and agribusiness fraternities to identify and exploit these opportunities, and to continue working smart and planning ahead to ensure that we manage the setbacks brought about by these challenges as best we can. Thank you to the agribusiness and agriculture family for their continued support throughout 2018, and I wish you all a prosperous 2019. Support and innovative thinking needed Louis Meintjies, president, TAU SA Each new year brings fresh opportunities that should be embraced. Taking hold of these opportunities gives us a sense of purpose and hope for the future. Given the harsh realities we currently face in South Africa, many people are asking whether there are still opportunities worth pursuing in this country. The future seems dark and uncertain, and as a result, many South Africans, who find themselves in a position to do so, are leaving the country. For many of us, this is simply not possible, and those of us who stay will have to work together to ensure that there is a future for all South Africans. As farmers, we are rooted in South Africa, but the reality we are faced with is that the ANC has placed party above country, and its actions are aimed solely at saving the ANC no matter the cost. Over and above the turbulent political situation, farmers also face the threat of drought, poor water quality, and unreliable and expensive electricity supply. Some farmers have not had rain for the past three years, and have suffered repeated poor harvests. For them it has become impossible to carry on. Banks and input suppliers that have profited from these farmers in the past have now withdrawn to the sidelines, becoming mere spectators to their suffering. What will happen if those farmers in the drought-stricken areas of Mpumalanga, the Free State, North West and Limpopo are forced to give up their farms? What will happen to South Africa when there are no commercial farmers left? Where will the banks and agricultural input suppliers go to find clients? How will these businesses survive? Certainly not by servicing the subsistence farming sector only! Who will grow the food that has to feed 60 million South Africans and people in other African countries? We need farmers to remain on their farms and to continue farming. The opportunity we have at this uncertain time is to look at the primary agriculture sector and the entire agricultural value chain through a new lens. What do we want the primary agriculture sector to look like by 2030? We hold the future of farming and food security in our hands, and together we have to establish a new dispensation characterised by innovative thinking and solutions. TAU SA has already started implementing this new approach and our doors are open to anyone who believes that we can be the captains of our own future by adopting a fresh approach to create a safe and secure, as well as economically sustainable, operating environment for farmers. We will continue to pray for wisdom, insight and strength. Farmers will persevere Dan Kriek, president, Agri SA I believe 2018 can best be described as an emotional rollercoaster for farmers. The massive uncertainty unleashed by the expropriation without compensation (EWC) process had a devastating effect on investor and business confidence. The sentiment on the ground among those who are against and those who support changes to the Constitution alike has become unhealthy and, in some cases, irrational and racially polarised. <!--EMBED: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/718/185696.html :EMBED--> The outcome of increased frustration about the slow progress of land reform on one side, and massive uncertainty on the other, was always going to be a hardening of attitudes. In the absence of meaningful intervention, situations like these could lead to a standoff and, heaven forbid, a showdown. We thus need visionary leadership on all sides to break the deadlock and get people talking about solutions. We must give due credit to the ANC leadership for initiating meaningful dialogue with organised agriculture and agribusiness. Agri SA participated in top-level discussions on the possible impact of EWC on productive agricultural land and ways to enhance sustainable land reform. The private sector will play a key role. Even the worst situations have silver linings. The heated EWC debate inevitably made way for discussions on what the alternative solutions should be. Politicians, policymakers and civilians will have to acknowledge the effect that EWC will have on the economy. Any negative impact on land prices will have definite negative consequences for food security and future economic growth. Ultimately, we do not take our assurances from politicians. Our civil liberties are enshrined in the Bill of Rights and should be rigorously protected. Giving property rights to those not yet privileged enough to enjoy it will be the greatest empowerment exercise this country has ever seen. While this whole debate is raging, ordinary farmers are going about their daily task of producing food, fuel and fibre. They do so in times of hardship and tribulation; they produce on private land, state land, leased land and in communal land tenure systems; they come in all shapes and sizes; they suffer because of violence and crime and are forced to resort to extraordinary measures to protect themselves, their loved ones and their belongings; and they produce for a global market with very little government support. Our farmers are progressive and understand the need for sustainable land reform and transformation initiatives. The real debate should be on how we enable and create meaningful partnerships in developing the agriculture sector on an inclusive and sustainable basis. This year will be a year of choices. We will go to the polls to elect our freely elected representatives . May we strengthen our democracy in a peaceful and orderly manner, and may we reaffirm the values enshrined in our Constitution. I believe that we will find solutions to our problems in calmer waters after the national election. This article was first published on Farmer's Weekly. \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa51","Of Cockroaches and Humans [opinion]","December 19, 2018","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Rita Levi-Montalcini, the Italian Nobel laureate honoured for her work in neurobiology, once gave a splendid conference with the title ""The imperfect brain"". There she explained that man has a brain that is not used completely, while the reverse is true for the cockroach. In the growing fog that envelops the planet and its inhabitants, looking at things from the point of view of a cockroach would probably give us a new perspective. Also because the cockroach survived the atomic bomb in Nagasaki, it is 300 million years old, and it is distributed around the planet in over 4,000 species. All things that give it a great advantage over man. Obviously, both are part of the animal kingdom. But man does things that other animals do not. For example, torture. Man has a level of consciousness and intelligence that no other animal possesses. But he does not, for example, learn from mistakes, which all other animals do. Today, 70 years after its adoption, we are celebrating the Declaration of Human Rights, but we are recreating all the conditions that led to the Second World War, so much so that we talk about the ""New Thirties"". We have returned to waving the well-known flags of ""In the name of God"" and ""In the name of the nation"", flags under which millions of people died. We have been questioning ourselves about the climate since the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). Rio de Janeiro gave rise to the Kyoto Protocol for the control of climate change which, despite its good intentions, has had negligible results. Finally, after years of negotiations, we managed to convene the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris in 2015, with the participation of all the world's countries. For it to happen, every country was left free to set its own goals for reducing carbon monoxide emissions and responsible for monitoring their application. (Just think what would happen if we left citizens the same rules for their taxes). We now know that the result of the commitments made in Paris is leading to a 3.6\'b0C increase in the planet's temperature. Since 1992, the work of climate scientists has been to calculate how far the temperature can rise from the days of the Industrial Revolution without causing too much damage. The consensus is 1.5\'b0C, and that at more than two degrees the consequences of heating become irreversible and escape man's control. For example, the permafrost of Siberia would melt, releasing a quantity of methane, an element 25 times more harmful than carbon monoxide. And the Paris agreement does not include methane, which is already massively produced by livestock farms, planes, ships and much more. Long before the Rio Conference, in 1988, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which brought together the climate scientists of 90 countries to present reports on the state of the climate. These reports have progressively identified human activity as responsible for the increase in temperature, obviously with the opposition of the fossil, oil and coal sectors. But the figures speak clearly. CO2 emissions have continued to increase, even after the Paris Conference. And the latest report of the 2018 ""emissions gap report"" sounds a brutal alarm: at the current rate, we need to triple efforts to stay within the famous 1.5 degree mark, because we will get there within the next 12 years. Only 57 countries are on the correct path. Now we have entered into the realm of myth. That of indefinite development, in which science and the market will be the saviours of the planet. The Trump administration has even presented a report to the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) defending fossil fuels, with the support of producer countries (Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc.). As for science, there is no doubt that it is playing a positive role. But science has become a market variable. If its findings are not used, they count for little. And history shows us that the free market uses them only if they can give immediate profits and do not create conflict with the sources of profit already in use. An easy example is that of the automotive industry. Without the progressively introduced regulations, we would have cars that are much inferior to those of today if we were to increase their safety and efficiency, and reduce their pollution. And the myth of the efficiency of the free market, which has been left without checks and controls since the fall of the Berlin Wall, has created some winners, but many losers, who wear yellow jackets and bring revolt to Paris. To keep to the theme, total subsidies to the fossil industries currently amount to 250 billion dollars a year, while those in the renewables sector now stand at 120 billion... and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service, has calculated that inaction on climate change will cost Europe 240 billion euro a year, with southern Europe as the major victim. Then the worst that could happen to the climate happened: it became no longer a problem of survival of the planet, but a political confrontation. Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement for three reasons: i) to undo what his predecessor Barack Obama had done, which is one of Trump's automatic reflexes; ii) to satisfy the North American fossil world, which runs from unemployed miners to the billionaires of the fossil sector like the Koch brothers, who invested (their declaration) 900 million dollars in the last US presidential elections - a good example of democracy in a country where corporations have the same rights as citizens); and iii) to oppose any international agreement because America must play its role of great power without being harnessed into any multilateral agreement. And his world echoes him: the new Brazilian foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\'fajo, has declared that ""climate change has been used to increase the regulatory power of states over the economy, and the power of international institutions over nations and their population, as well as slowing economic growth in democratic capitalist countries, and promoting the growth of China."" And here, by mechanical logic, the battle against climate change has become a thing of the left (as have peace, solidarity and social justice). It is the thesis by which Trump withdraws from the Paris agreements and has declared that he does not believe the three reports of his administration on climate change, including one of 1,700 pages. And since he has become a specialist in putting Draculas to administer the various blood banks that for him represent the various administrations inherited from Obama, the administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is opening national parks and protected areas to the exploitation of fossil companies, just like newly-elected Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro declares he wants to open the Amazon to deforestation and the production of soy. Moreover, this is the common thread that connects us with two other major events of December 2018 - the United Nations conferences in Katowice, Poland (on climate change), and Marrakech, Morocco (on migration). These, along with the revolt of the ""yellow jackets"" in France, mean that this month will go down in history as the date on which the international system formally entered into crisis and the revolt of the excluded can no longer be ignored, with Trump as a central protagonist. The Marrakech conference was about adopting a document of principles on migration, for coordinated action, with respect for the human rights of migrants. It ended up leaving every state to establish its own policy. It was a non-binding document, which was not even signed. In Marrakech, the United States revolted, issuing a statement which, among others, stated: ""We believe the Compact [Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration] and the process that led to its adoption, including the New York Declaration [for Refugees and Migrants], represent an effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of States to manage their immigration systems in accordance with their national laws, policies, and interests."" This was enough for the quick formation of a coalition of sovereignists, xenophobes and populists who boycotted the agreement. After Austria, here come Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Switzerland and Trump's allies, such as Israel, Australia and Chile. And it is here that migration, like the climate, becomes something that is of the left... and the Belgian government loses the far-right party of Flemish autonomy and is forced to redo its coalition, because it decides to participate in the Marrakech conference. And Germany and Italy pass the buck to their parliaments. All this over a non-binding document of principles! What is apparently incomprehensible is that a serious debate about migration continues to be avoided. The great phenomena of migration, like that of Syria, were caused by international intervention to change the regime, without even thinking about the aftermath of invading. Obviously there are those who flee from poverty, and not only from conflicts. But this distinction is becoming increasingly blurred. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), every two seconds one person is expelled from their territory due to conflict and persecution: the result is an unprecedented total of 68.5 million migrants in the world. Of these, 24.5 million are refugees, and more than half are under the age of 18. The number of authoritarian states has been on the increase over the last 10 years, and those fleeing from them has also been increasing, also for political reasons. But those who flee for ethnic, religious or political reasons are refugees (and not economic migrants, who have no rights). And there are 10 million people (like the Rohingya in Myanmar) who are denied nationality, and do not have access to basic rights, such as education, health and freedom of movement: they do not legally exist. And now comes a new category that does not exist legally: that of environmental refugees who, according to the European Union number 258 million people, forced to leave their homes for climatic reasons. But this is a whole new and difficult discussion. While it is clear who are the victims of a hurricane or an earthquake, it is more difficult in the case of desertification. Let's think about the case of island countries like the Maldives where an increase of just one metre in sea level would be enough for them to disappear physically. You can send an immigrant who comes to another country to escape hunger back to Senegal for example, but where do you send back people who no longer have their country? One of the laws of physics is that of communicating vessels. Africa will double its population in a few decades. Nigeria alone will grow to 400 million inhabitants. Sixty percent of Africans are under 25, compared with 32 percent for North Americans, and 27 percent for Europeans. According to the United Nations, Europe will need at least twenty million immigrants to maintain its pension system and its competitiveness. Even Japan, which has always struggled to keep its identity and ethnic and cultural purity intact, is opening its doors without fanfare in the face of the aging of its citizens. European statistics are public, but ignored. In Italy, immigrants totalling five million out of a population of 60.6 million have produced 130 billion euro, 8.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product, an amount larger than the GDPs of Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia. And Italy now has seven births against 11 deaths. In the last five years, 570,000 new businesses out of six million have been created by immigrants in Italy, and the complaint of entrepreneurs, especially in agriculture, is that an Italian workforce cannot be found. At global level, according to William Swing, former director-general of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), although immigrants account for only 3.5 percent of the world's population, they produce nine percent of the world's GDP. But this is not what people believe. According to a survey by the European Union on the myths and reality of immigration, Italians believe that immigrants account for 20 percent of the population while the figure is actually 10 percent. They believe that 50 percent are Muslims while they are really 30 percent, and that 30 percent are Christians while they are 60 percent. They also believe that 30 percent of them are unemployed while the figure is 10 percent, not far from the national average. These Italian myths are actually shared by the whole of Europe, and with Trump by the United States. Fox News, Trump's television arm, now refers to immigrants as ""invaders"", and Trump wants to erect the most expensive wall in history, after the Great Wall of Chinese, to keep out criminals and drug traffickers. And here comes the central theme of this article, which is too short to deal with issues that are apparently unrelated to each other in an effective way. Who elected the Trumps, the Salvinis, the Orbans, the Bolsonaros, and who sees peace and the fight against climate change as leftist positions, international cooperation as a plot in favour of the Chinese and immigrants as invaders? Well, the Catalan nations where a far-right party, born from nothing, won 400,000 votes can be very useful for understanding the revolt of the ""yellow jackets"" in France. In Andalusia, the arrival of Vox has messed up all the cards. It took votes from the electorate of the right-wing parties, the Popular Party and Ciudadanos. After 23 years of governing the region, the PSOE, the Social Democrats, has lost control. How did it happen? In order of importance, the arguments of the voters were: 1) Vox fights against immigrants, who are an invasion;2) the party fights corruption, which is instead widespread in traditional parties; 3) it wants a strong government, because with the struggle for the independence of Catalonia Spain is becoming dismembered; and 4) why should a Spaniard go hungry, or be evicted for not paying rent, when food and a roof are being given to arriving immigrants? There was a heavy female vote, despite the anti-gay statements and anti-feminist slogans such as WOMEN IN THE HOME. Now the place where Vox took more votes than any other party is the town of El Ejido, in the province of Almeria, which has become the nursery of Spain. It has a population of 86,000, of whom one-third are foreigners and one in five is Moroccan. These work in the nurseries surrounding the town, in precarious conditions and exploited. Unemployment is lower than the Spanish average. The town has no library, and a total of 600 newspapers a day are sold. It is evident that immigrants, many of them not registered, do a job that Spaniards do not want to do. If one-third of the population was to leave, that would be the end of prosperity. And who employs immigrants, at 41 euro for eight hours of work (35 for those who are not registered)? They are Spanish citizens. The situation is identical for immigrants in the south of Italy, exploited by local farmers who say that they manage to survive with cheap labour. Otherwise, they would have to shut down. In other words, immigration has become a myth. America first has become Spain First, Italy First, and so on. The mayor of Almeria sums the situation up: Vox is the voice of anger. How was this anger reached? It was not born today, but has been created over three decades. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, the threat of communism has disappeared, social concerns have fallen, and the market has replaced man as the central element of society. Spending that is not immediately productive (health, education, assistance for the elderly) has been progressively decreased. The rich, because they are productive, receive a progressive reduction in taxation, unlike the poor. Globalisation has led the rich to become richer, and the poor poorer; it has delocalised businesses and reduced the purchasing power of the middle class, while finance has grown in a world of its own, free from business. The class of craftsmen/women and small traders is disappearing, if it has not already disappeared, devoured by the likes of IKEA and supermarkets. Cities become increasingly important, and the countryside increasingly empty and poor. A farmer's product is sold to intermediaries for one-quarter of the final price. Where voters once identified themselves with a factory, with a trade union, with a community of peers, today they are atomised in a vacuum without incentives. And because, after the end of the Soviet Union, the new ethics is to become as rich as possible (today 80 people possess the same wealth as 2.3 million people) and the value of individual competition is increasing the frustration of the losers. Finally, the financial crisis of 2008. The arrival of the Fourth Industrial Revolution with technological development, which is eliminating technology that has not been updated from the market, creates a situation of fear and insecurity; the losers no longer feel represented in politics, which seen at the service of the elites and in the hands of a self-referential, corrupt political class, which is directed to satisfying above all the world of the city, the elites, the system. Institutions are perceived as serving the system, and the same fate awaits international institutions, the European Union and the United Nations. Anti-politics is born, and the wave is ridden by parties born largely after the 2008 financial crisis. The struggle of anti-politics against politics becomes stronger than the division between right and left. This struggle leads, for example, to Brexit, where cities vote to remain in the European Union and the countryside to leave, something that was repeated recently in the Polish elections. It is the same policy of fear and redemption of the losers that led to the power of Trump, who lost in the cities, in the rich states, and won among the poor, in the rural world, in the world of closed factories and abandoned mines, among voters motivated by rancour, anger and fear. In all small cities, the phenomenon is the same. An investigation in Montauban, one of the most active towns in the ""yellow jackets"" revolt with less than 60,000 inhabitants, found that there were 27 butchers before the arrival of Carrefour. There are four left. The same happened with greengrocers, with many clothing stores and craft workshops after the arrival of supermarkets. In all, around 900 shops had closed down. Respected citizens considered middle-class suddenly found themselves marginalised and ignored. Through television, they basically see programmes from cities and a world that is changing in which they have no future. Is it any wonder that this turns into resentment towards the system and those who belong to it? Le Monde has published a table on salaries, which shows that those in a higher intellectual profession earn an average of 2,732 euro a month, which falls to 1,672 for farmers, artisans and traders, but plunges to 1,203 for those in precarious activities. And the ""yellow jackets"" revolt was triggered by a 10 euro cent increase in the tax on diesel fuel. One of the demonstrators' slogans was: 'Macron fears the end of the world, we fear the end of the month'. Now, to remain in France, Macron has failed to understand that for the losers rational analysis of efficiency increases their estrangement. Life is above all a human fact, and no one is concerned with this aspect any longer. Schumpeter's model - that the efficiency of the market creates a process of economy that grows thanks to the market's capacity for creative destruction - is for the losers proof that the system is made only for the winners, and that neither they nor their children will ever have the ability to escape the situation in which they have come to find themselves through no fault of their own. The 'Yellow Jackets' movement has been very successful, because many categories feel ignored. When frustration increases with the passing of the years, of governments, and is reduced only to an economic problem of subsidies, the passage to violence, from dignity that is awakened, is unstoppable. And those who present themselves as ""the man of providence"", capable of listening and understanding, opening fights against corruption, for the restoration of law, for traditional society, for the world in which everything went well - from the old independent Britain to the great factories and steel mills of the United States - will have unshakable support. In reality, there was once a social contract, also regulated by intermediary forces such as trade unions, by a sense of hope and collective identity, such as being a worker or a railwayman. This sense of community has disappeared, almost all places of aggregation have disappeared, such as clubs or dance halls, replaced today by the halls of supermarkets and discos, to which only young people have access. It would also be necessary to open a chapter on the impact of technology, with internet and social media, which instead of leading to greater communication, have led to a self-referential and narcissistic world, where each one organises their own virtual world, escapes from real society, creating aggregations among peers and no longer dialogue with others. Another instrument that is felt as exclusion for generational reasons. Even though the revolt of the 'Yellow Jackets' was made possible by Facebook, which brought together hundreds of thousands of people aggregated against the common enemy: the system, which ignored and marginalised them. However, it should be clear that robotisation and artificial intelligence will put more people on the margins of society than immigration ever will, with new priests of the system, technicians who will manage the world of artificial intelligence. It is thus now clear that without social justice, we will not go far. Macron who lifts taxes from the rich to attract investments to France lives in a world that is different from that of most of its citizens. And above all, in a world of numbers and Excel tables. A world in which ""men of providence"" will lead us inexorably towards a war. Exploiting fear and injustice works politically for obtaining votes. The battles of the losers of globalisation have been opened by social movements, by the World Social Forum. But who uses them is not the left, which with Tony Blair's 'third way' thought it could ride the wave of globalisation, when it only managed to lose its base: the battle of the losers is used by right that is not ideological but of the gut. Creating a new social pact as existed before the fall of the Berlin Wall is not easy. Money - which is no longer there - is necessary. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) tells us that world debt exceeds 182 trillion dollars. In just one year, it has increased by 18 trillion dollars. Since the 2007 crisis, it has increased by 60 percent. We are all living on credit, and Macron, who now would like to use social justice to restore peace, has no funds to do so. Moreover, as always in a world that has lost its compass, the money would be there. Every year, countries' tax authorities collect 150 billion dollars less than they could because of tax havens that could easily be outlawed in a very short time. It is always the same: if we could introduce social justice as the first objective, it would be easy, even on a global scale. The United States, for example, spent the absurd sum of 5.9 trillion dollars in military operations and armaments after the attack on the Twin Towers. In 2017, 1.719 billion dollars were spent on armaments worldwide, a figure never before reached in history. And if military expenses could be considered necessary by some, I do not see who defends the spending for corruption: in the last year, according to the United Nations, this amounted to one trillion dollars, and the money stolen in governments another 2.6 trillion. Another proof of the efficiency of the free market! And now let's go back to our cockroach. According to scientists, we are heading towards the sixth crisis of extinction of the animal and plant kingdom. Extinction is a natural phenomenon, affecting one to five species each year. But scientists estimate that the current rate is at least a thousand times higher, with dozens of species every day. It is believed that by the middle of the century at least 30 percent of existing species will have disappeared. Obviously, the cockroach is not one of these. It is estimated that a building in New York has at least 36,000 cockroaches. But men have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to find a way to give animal proteins in a different, more sustainable way, and that the path to follow is to eat insects. There are cultural resistances (not in China and other countries), but they can be overcome with an appealing presentation ... And our cockroach can only desire that the bunglers of the animal kingdom, called men, get out of the way as soon as possible. The entire animal and plant kingdoms, and probably also the mineral one, are asking for this. Certainly, without man, in the space of twenty years the planet would become ideal for nature... \"
"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa52","Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs and International Relations","June 4, 2018 Monday","South African Official News","Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign AffairsInternational Relations1. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the Peoples Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met on 4 June 2018 in Pretoria, South Africa.2. The Ministers reflected on the importance of this year marking a decade of BRICS Summits, as a testimony to the fortitude of BRICS cooperation and reiterated the commitment to implement the outcomes and consensus of past BRICS Summits. The Ministers welcomed South Africas Chairship and looked forward to the 10th BRICS Summit to be held under the theme, BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution and committed themselves to work together for a fruitful Johannesburg Summit. 3. The Ministers recalled the BRICS tradition of outreach to extend its cooperation to fellow developing and emerging economies. In this respect, the Ministers welcomed South Africas two-pronged outreach approach through the BRICS-Africa Dialogue and the BRICS Plus cooperation, to be held during the Summit.4. The Ministers expressed their gratitude to South Africa for hosting the Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations, contributing positively to the BRICS cooperation. The Ministers exchanged views on current issues of global significance in political, security, economic, financial and sustainable development spheres, as well as intra-BRICS cooperation. 5. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations, as the universal multilateral organisation entrusted with the mandate for maintaining international peace and security, advancing global development and to promoting and protecting human rights so as to build a brighter shared future for the global community. 6. They recalled the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN.7. The Ministers underscored the importance of sustained efforts aimed at making the United Nations more effective and efficient in implementing the mandates conferred upon it. In this regard, they committed to intensifying dialogue amongst the BRICS countries on the administration and budget of the United Nations, with a view to strengthening the Organization and preserving its Member State-driven character. 8. The Ministers expressed their support for continued cooperation of BRICS members in areas of mutual interest including through regular exchanges amongst their multilateral Missions. 9. The Ministers also reconfirmed the commitment to fully implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensionsndash economic, social and environmental in a balanced and integrated manner. The Ministers pledged their support for the important role of the United Nations, including the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in coordinating and reviewing global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and support the need to reform the UN Development System with a view to enhancing its capability in supporting member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. They urged developed countries to honor their Official Development Assistance commitments in time and in full and provide more development resources to developing countries. 10. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to tackling climate change. They welcomed the entry into force of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which reflects the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. They expressed hope to complete the Paris Agreement Work Programme at COP 24 . They drew attention to the importance of strengthening cooperation to face the challenges brought by climate change, which requires financial flows and technology transfer. They therefore urged developed countries to fulfill their commitments in this regard. 11. The Ministers reiterated BRICS commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international order and in this regard reaffirmed the centrality of UN, WTO and international law. The Ministers pledged their support to efforts towards making global governance more representative with greater participation of emerging markets and developing countries in global decision making. 12. The Ministers emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalization. They underlined their firm commitment to free trade, and the centrality of a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, multilateral trading system as embodied in the WTO. They opposed the new wave of protectionism and the systematic impact of unilateral measures that are incompatible with WTO rules, and undermines global trade, and economic growth. In this regard, they reiterated that the WTO Dispute Settlement System is a cornerstone of the MTS as it is designed to enhance security and predictability in international trade. 13. The Ministers reaffirmed their resolve to foster a global economic governance architecture that is more effective and reflective of current global economic landscape, increasing the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing economies. They reaffirmed their commitment to conclude the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2019 Spring Meetings. They will continue to support the implementation of the World Bank Group Shareholding Review. The Ministers welcomed the institutional progress of the New Development Bank (NDB), including the upcoming establishment of the Americas Regional Office in Satildeo Paulo, Brazil, which, alongside the Africa Regional Centre (ARC), will help the NDB consolidate its presence in those continents. 14. The Ministers deplored the continued terrorist attacks, including in some BRICS countries. They condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever. They urged concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis, and expressed their conviction that a comprehensive approach was necessary to ensure effective fight against terrorism. They recalled the responsibility of all States to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories. The Ministers highly value the 3rd BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group Meeting held in Nelspruit on 19 and 20 April 2018.

"COP24","South.Africa","COP24_South.Africa53","No Headline In Original","October 10, 2018 Wednesday","The Star (South Africa)","Editor's Note THE FIRST verse of Chapter 11 of Hebrews says: ""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."" This thought-provoking line, in its simplest form, suggests that though faith is merely belief, it is the foundation of a believer's relationship with their God. There are some who regard climate change as a matter of faith - something to be believed without proof by the converted, but perfectly okay to be disregarded by everyone else because ""there's no evidence"" of its existence. On page 7 today, we focus on the effects and possible repercussions of rising global temperatures caused by humankind. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has just released a fresh warning on global warming, ironically the same day that the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Romer, an economist and the pioneer of the endogenous growth theory, and William Nordhaus, also an economist at Yale University, best known for his work in economic modelling. Romer and Nordhaus both try to deal with the problem of climate change on a planetary scale. The reality is that the results of the despoliation of planet Earth by its inhabitants - through, among others, carbon dioxide emissions and pollution - are not a matter of conjecture. They are there for all to see, all around us. And if we continue in this reckless, uncaring manner, if we do not radically change our individual behaviour or national policies, we will destroy our planet irrevocably. At the moment, the risks are too remote in time for many to comprehend. The challenge, therefore, is for scientists to translate the abstract scientific language into something that ordinary people can relate to. The London-based charity Christian Aid warns that rising seas - caused by climate change - pose unprecedented threats to millions of homes. It says cities such as Jakarta - which is sinking by 25cm each year - Bangkok, Houston, Lagos, Manila, Dhaka and Shanghai are particularly at risk. And a study published in the journal Science Advances earlier this year says many low-lying atoll islands are likely to become uninhabitable by the middle of the century. It said scientists predict that as sea levels rise, thousands of islands will be afflicted by frequent flooding, lack of fresh water and damage to infrastructure. The Paris climate change agreement, signed in 2016, was a moment of tremendous hope for the whole planet when almost every nation on Earth agreed that the common shared future of humankind was greater than the short-term interest of any economy. On the technology front, we have had advances such as electric cars, which increased our hopes, and concepts such as renewable energy, recycling, energy efficient homes, offices, hotels and factories have boosted our optimism. These and the Paris Agreement, though, are not yet perfect or a panacea. While President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement and turned his back on his global responsibilities, the rest of the world has no choice but to carry on. Trump is the leader of the world's largest economy and the biggest polluter, yet is proving to be the largest single obstacle to saving the planet's ecology. The Katowice climate change conference ( Cop24 ) takes place in Poland in December. It will be an opportunity for the rest of the world to renew commitments to save the only planet that we call home. We cannot fail. n Makgabutlane is an assistant editor at The Star. \"

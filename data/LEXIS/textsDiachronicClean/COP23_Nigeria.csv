It ensured that the conference's results were neither 'further', nor 'faster', and certainly not 'together'.An analysis of the results by CSE, says: 'The US' strong and obstructionist attitude in the COP process ensured that progress was extremely slow and hampered on several occasions and the old divide between developed and developing nations remained.''Ahead of the COP, the US had signalled that it would engage in the negotiations process to secure its interests and had talked of a possible re-negotiation of the Paris Agreement to enable it to rejoin the Agreement.'Instead of working together and standing united against the US intransigence, the old bickering between developed and developing nations continued at Bonn,' Chandra Bhushan, deputy director-general, CSE, said.\l"

These delegates will gather for the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Only two years ago, the Paris agreement made the record as the second most supported treaty in the history of the United Nations, after the Montreal Protocol with 195 countries signing, 175 of that number signing in a single day, and 169 of that number having ratified as of October 2017. To say that Paris was historic, would be an understatement.Two years after, we return to Bonn, to determine how far we have come in implementation in the past two years and to negotiate on important issues like financing, nationally determined contributions of states, transparency, adaptation, policy, technology and energy governance.What bothers me though, is whether Nigeria is truly ready for the COP 23.

"COP23","Nigeria","COP23_Nigeria4","COP 23 agreements and implementation","December 5, 2017 Tuesday","Nigerian Tribune","After two weeks of deliberations, negotiations and meetings dragging late into the night, the 23rd session of the Conference of Parties (COP) has come to a close in Bonn, Germany. Questions linger however; questions on what took place in Bonn, questions as to the landmark decisions that were made, questions as to implementation plans over the next one year. These questions, I will attempt to answer in this memo from Bonn.I could have been writing this from a packed press briefing room somewhere in the Bonn Zone, but I am writing this from Nigeria, where the Paris Agreement cries to be implemented.This is why the memo from Bonn means a lot to me, and I am writing first to you as fellow countrymen, not as the government or office holders, but as everyday people, and I am trying to let you know that what happened in Bonn is your business too.This year's Conference of Parties gives us reason to re-assess our priorities, ad rethink our game plan as a country. This year was the first year the COP was chaired by a small island state- Fiji -and the push, drive and commitment of fellow small island states to see their goals achieved in the negotiations was palpable. And their goals are goals that concern developing nations, chief among which was the clamor for financing from developed countries through the loss and damage (L and D) dedicated financing mechanisms. Expectedly, developed countries antagonized the move, as accepting the concept of loss and damage would mean their acceptance of the fact that developed countries have caused major irreparable loss to the rest of the world. Germany had earlier opened the Conference on the first day with an announcement of an additional 100 million Euros to support climate change adaptation in developing countries, it is ironical then why it was difficult for a bloc of countries to which they belong to commit to financing for loss and damage? This very easily shows the rest of the world how developed countries will not accept responsibility quickly. In fact, the European Union and Australia suddenly began to raise claims of there being no scientific proof linking climate change to extreme weather conditions. What this portends for us in this part of the world, is a need to start thinking ahead; developing financing methods to cushion budget shortfalls in addressing issues of climate change, potential loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation. I have suggested elsewhere that the African Development Bank should fly Green Bonds which are increasingly becoming attractive in the international stock market. Also, de-risking financial instruments, and generally pooling capital market investments for Green development is a great way of financing climate in the Nigeria. There should also be the consideration of a regional capital market for Africa to float such bonds in order to attract private sector funding on a continental level. In order to do this, there is a dire need for knowledge dissemination on green investments to provide a repository for financial analysts, investors and private actors to properly understand the climate investment market. There is also the need to use local expertise to pool investments with a view to benefiting local communities, who are most affected by the effects of climate change. The Abidjan Declaration of ECOWAS concluded in June this year speaks to this.Some other very interesting occurrences at the COP this year was Syria's signing of the Paris Agreement, something many have praised, but a few have maligned as being not well thought out for a war-torn country. Despite the criticisms, the move remains a commendable one, and one that typifies the United States as the child in the circle being taunted by other children for peeing her pants. Another development which puts Trump's government on edge is the 'We are Still In' movement which was showcased at the COP by Governor Jerry Brown of California, a movement that brings thousands of US citizens together as they continue implementing the Paris Agreement, regardless of Trump's stance. The lesson to take away from this is that we, the citizens, are powerful, and that if we should one by one commit to taking action to combat climate change and its effects, we can do a lot of good, even more for our country that has signed the Paris Agreement.At the COP, the Gender Action Plan was also launched for the first time, a plan of action to ensure more inclusiveness for the female gender in climate activities; negotiations, high-level decisions, policy making, adaptation and mitigation programmes, loss and damage activities, financing etc. It is laudable because the Paris Agreement and its eventual success had women at the forefront and still does.There is no doubt that much can be achieved with more women involvement in decision making.\l"

We will help Africa unlock its full energy potential while developing a balanced energy mix to support industrialization. Our commitment is to ensure 100% climate screening for all Bank-financed projects.''The share of renewable energy projects as a portion of the Bank's portfolio of power generation investments increased from 14% in 2007-2011 to 64% in 2012-2016.The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) whose goal is to deliver 300 Gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy in 2030 and 10 GW by 2020, is now based within the Bank, as requested by African Heads of State and Government. The G7 has promised to commit US$10 billion to support the initiative, which came out of COP21 and subsequently approved by the African Union.On November 8, 2017, the African Bank Group approved its Second Climate Change Action Plan, 2016-2020 (CCAP2) as a clear message of its commitment to helping African countries mobilize resources to support the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of Regional Member Countries, in ways that will not hinder development.The approval of the action plan echoes discussions at COP23 in Bonn, Germany to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C.The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Bank's High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Bank's Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015As part of its wider mandate under the New Deal on Energy for Africa, the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank on December 15, 2017, approved an investment of US $20 million in the Evolution II Fund  a Pan-African clean and sustainable energy private equity fund.The Bank's investment in Evolution II Fund reflects the High 5 development priorities of the Bank, the agenda to light up and Power Africa, and the Bank's commitment to promoting renewable energy and efficiency in Africa.The Evolution II Fund is expected to contribute to green and sustainable growth by creating 2,750 jobs and building on the track record of the Evolution One Fund (which created 1,495 jobs, of which 20% were for women, and generated 838 MW of wind energy and 87MW Solar PV energy).

"COP23","Nigeria","COP23_Nigeria13","Water, Agriculture and Energy sectors join forces to address climate change issues","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Business Day","Water connects sectors, as they all need water to operate sustainably. The inextricable linkages between water, energy and food require a holistic approach if water and food security, sustainable agriculture and sustainable energy production are to be ensured. Inter-linkages are compelling governments, the private sector, communities, academia and other stakeholders to explore integrated solutions. This approach eases pressures and helps explore development avenues based on a sustainable and efficient use of limited resources. This interlinking approach requires continued dialogue between the different communities, highlighting the significance of forums like the CoP23 and the upcoming World Water Forum in March 2018 in Brazil, in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals.Optimal water management and investment in water infrastructure requires a top-down and bottom-up integrated strategy. Therefore, local solutions for local problems are often most suited to meet water challenges, as highlighted by Aziza Akhmouch, acting division head at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),'Cities that are resilient are actually cities that fix upstream their water problems.' The profound knowledge and mindful resource management for seamless adaptation already exists. It simply requires being shared across sectors as a means to best confront the adverse effects of climate change. It is increasingly evident, for example, that efficient water usage in agriculture is possible. Up to 70 percent of water is consumed by agriculture, compared to 20 percent by industry and 10 percent for domestic needs. The agricultural sector, through shared information, could follow best practices pioneered in unrelated areas by applying shared experiences. 'We would be wise to apply lessons from across the world, even traditional rural populations in Africa or Asia, which have the potential to inform innovative, sagacious and responsible resource management, to adapt our planet to climate variation's onslaught. The knowledge is there, we just have to listen and tap into it,' explains Maggie White, Manager International Policies, Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), Co-Chair, Alliance for Global Water Adaption (AGWA) and Steering Committee Member of the ClimateIsWater Initiative.Lo\'efc Fauchon, honorary president of the World Water Council (WWC) which coordinates the ClimateIsWater initiative, moderated the outcomes discussion from the Water Action Day. He indicated that, 'Innovative technical solutions are key to have better and cheaper solutions that drive global water security.'He further underscores, 'The political obligation of cooperation on all levels-from local to basin-wide, to city level, national and international level in governance, financing and knowledge sharing-this should translate to enhanced efficiency in optimized integrated water management and should be complemented by horizontal collaboration between all sectors including the 5 main ones: water, energy, food, health and education.' He continues by saying that, 'In order to ensure water security, government agreements are needed: A global pact under the UN umbrella to provide a further framework for implementation of the climate change goals and commitments and for financial engagements from development banks and funds, but also local pacts and agreements, per water basin and per metropolis.'Creative solutions for sustainable agriculture under a changing climate necessarily carry water at their core: drought resistant crops, improved salt tolerance of different crop varieties, enriched seed varieties, developed cultivation practices such as conservation agriculture, improvements in soil organic carbon, organic practices. By sharing specialised experience and wisdom across the agricultural, hydro and energy arenas, climate-smart solutions have the potential to be three times as effective. And the most recurring factor in this equation is water dependency and vulnerability. 'Some of the smartest applications of sustainable farming come from countries and regions such as the south of Morocco or Pakistan, to name just a few, which are naturally poor in access to water from rainfall and riverbeds', comments James Dalton, Coordinator, Global Water Initiatives, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).'Climate change impacts freshwater availability, but the greatest impact is made evident in how we manage precious resources. Water scarcity is not the only issue; mismanagement is. To this end, we need to tackle how water is distributed globally. Despite Brazil, to mention an example, being home to nearly one fifth of the world's fresh water, Sao Paulo, recently lived through one of the biggest crises in its history when it experienced an unparalleled drought. Furthermore, at this very moment, droughts are also being experienced across the world in places like the northern U.S., Australia and even China. In Puerto Rico, the opposite is true. Despite a horrific flood following a mega storm, less than half of the island's population had access to drinking water,' highlights World Water Council President, Benedito Braga.\l"

That is where the world's multilateral development institutions come in.BONN - Climate action is not just about controlling global temperatures. It can also be a driver of development and poverty reduction all over the world. At the COP 23 Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany, in November, multilateral development institutions showed themselves to be more committed than ever to the urgent and central issue of supporting and financing these critical goals.Today's political climate is uncertain. But climate change is not. Partnership around the world must be maintained in the global effort to achieve a smooth transition to low carbon and climate-smart development. Multilateral development institutions have never been more relevant.Climate-smart development also makes good economic and business sense, particularly when it comes to sustainable infrastructure. We have already witnessed tremendous growth in renewable energy, creating with it new business opportunities and jobs. Many climate-smart investments can also reduce air pollution and congestion. Building resilience now saves money later. We are committed to supporting a climate-smart future.As multilateral development institutions, we reconfirm our commitment to the Paris climate agreement. Our role is to facilitate the public and private finance that is a vital part of the climate solution.That is why, two years after the Paris accord was successfully negotiated, we are increasingly aligning actions and resources in support of developing countries' goals. In July, the G20 Sustainability Action Plan embedded the Paris agreement in G20 policies and noted that more effective use of financing from multilateral development institutions is key to innovation and private investment in climate action.In 2016 alone, multilateral development institutions committed over $27 billion in climate finance, and we continue to step up our work, determined to broaden the private and public finance mobilized for climate action at . We commit to:Deliver on the promises that we made in 2015 to increase our support for climate investments in developing countries by 2020, both from our direct financing and from our mobilization efforts;Increase mobilization of private-sector investment by supporting policy and regulatory reforms. This includes aligning price signals, making innovative use of policy and finance instruments and, as applicable, leveraging concessional (below-market-rate) finance to help scale up public and private investment in climate projects.Strengthen international efforts by working together and with other development finance institutions, to increase transparency and consistency in tracking climate finance tracking and reporting greenhouse-gas emissions;Support countries, cities, and territories with their own climate action plans and build the conditions for an ambitious next generation of such contributions; andWork with our clients to support initiatives that protect the most climate-vulnerable areas, including small island developing states, while mobilizing more finance for developing countries to build resilience and to adapt their infrastructure, communities, ecosystems, and businesses to the consequences of climate change.Each of these measures supports our strong commitment to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. By pursuing them, climate action will become a key part of the international community's work to place infrastructure and the rollout of new technologies and policies for energy, water, and mobility at the core of sustainable development.This is a serious response to a serious challenge. Climate change poses a grave threat to the natural environment, to economic growth, and to the lives of all people around the world, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.It is fitting that this threat to national economies and to every person on earth, and the opportunity to counter it, should be tackled with the backing of multilateral development institutions. We call on others to join us in placing climate action at the centre of their business, stepping up climate finance, and tracking its impact around the world.\l"
"COP23","Nigeria","COP23_Nigeria15","When climate change comes knocking: The Benin City example","January 26, 2018 Friday","The Nation (Nigeria)","Since the coming together of countries to chart a path for global climate in 2015, the topic of climate change has gained much relevance and the spotlight in national discussions. Nigeria, who happens to be a signatory to this contract did not pay the due attention to implementing the resolutions met at the conference until climate change came knocking at the borders of the country. The incidents of recurrent flooding, typhoons and evident temperature increase are fast becoming a norm in the country. This has pushed the government and policy makers to pay the necessary attention to climate action in the past months. This saw Nigeria been represented by a train of delegates headed by the Honourable minister of state for the environment , Ibrahim Usman Jibril in COP23 that was held in Bonn, Germany last year November. The president alongside key players in the country politics were also participants in the One planet summit hosted in Paris, France a month after. These activities of the government has put 'climate stories' in the league of main stream issues in the country but the implementation of the Paris agreement of 2015 still remains an uncompleted task leaving the citizens at the mercy of climate change.A perfect case study of this theme is Benin City. Benin City, the capital of Edo state is an ancient town globally known for its dexterity in bronze casting and home to the most revered royalty in Africa- Oba of Benin. It is the fourth largest city in Nigeria with its population equaling that of Luxembourg, Cape Verde and Seychelles put together. The prevalence of flooding in this elephantine city can be easily attributed to its high greenhouse gas emission and carbon usage. Benin City plays host to the International center for bronze casting that attracts millions of tourists across the world. This monument unfortunately contributes a large quota to the high carbon emission in the Niger Delta region. Artisans make use of coal at high temperature to mold and cast sculptures. Speaking with Chris, a sculptor in Igun, He clearly spelt out the tedious process involved in bronze sculpturing. He explained that coal is used to generate heat for melting the wax used in carving the bronze to desirable shapes and structures. He even joked that there is no fair person in Igun because the heat generated does a lot of damage to the skin of the artisans. He further stated that the Governor of the state promised to provide ultra-modern facilities that would aid cheap, clean and timely bronze artefact production but they insisted on sticking to the archaic method claiming it was passed to them by their forefathers and must be transmitted to their children without adulteration from the westerners.This high level of carbon emission has left Benin City stranded with endless flooding when it rains which has led to an inevitable loss of lives and properties, devastating health effects, traffic congestion, relocation of industries and manpower, cut-off in power supply and a low internally generated revenue (IGR). In recent times, Benin residents have had unforgettable experiences that would not be quick to erase from their memory such as the massive flooding that occurred on Saturday 7th October, 2017, sacking thousands from their homes and causing millions of naira in damages to properties. Amongst the worst affected places was the Edo State headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Benin City. A section of the building's perimeter fencing collapsed after two hours of heavy downpour, pushing in muddy waters inundated vehicles, files, computers and card reading machines. Another incident was when the landlords of Anigboro Street and its environs in Egor Local Government Area of Benin city sent a Save Our Soul (SOS) to the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, in August 2017 appealing to him to come to their aid before their houses and property were swept away by flood in the area.The residents of Uhunmwode community in Benin City are another set of people with a first-hand experience of climate variability especially with regard to food crop production which is a common sight in the area. Farmers are beginning to notice the impacts of climate variability on their food crop production. They found out that climate variability/change has caused poor crop yields, reduced soil fertility, increased flood, poverty and food shortage. Food crop agriculture in Uhunmwode does not only provide food for the inhabitants of the area, but also for nearby local government areas and cities. However, the recent changes in patterns of climate/weather elements are a huge challenge to food crop production in the area. For the crop farmers in the community, climate has greatly varied over recent years with rainfall decreasing and air temperature increasing. This combination is not in any way healthy for crop production, especially for farmers who are dependent on rain for their farming, as in the Uhunmwode community. Also, onset of rain in the area, according to the farmers has shifted. This also in no small measure will adversely affect food crop production, as adjustment may be difficult, especially where what will happen the next farming season is not known.These incidents have seen the birth of organisations that are geared towards sustainable development and climate justice in the mega city. A vivid example is the Borokinni Joshua Initiative, a non-profit that centers on climate action. They flagged a campaign in Benin City tagged #SafeClimate4Africa in collaboration with the Nigeria society of Victoria (NSV). The campaign featured awareness-raising, school tours and round table discussions. The team of five visited Patricia Private School (Ikpoba hill) and Torch Bearers Academy (Ikhueniro), in November 2017 to sensitise and intimate the staffs and students of these institutions on climate change which spread across various topics such as; Carbon pricing, Mitigation and Adaptation of cities, Greenhouse gases, deforestation among others. They aired their views on radio stations and onl"

Climate change is impacting now.""He looks forward to engaging with the American government and all other actors in the United States and around the world to build the sustainable future for our children and future generations,"" Guterres said.Under article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a Party may withdraw at any time after three years from the date on which the Agreement has entered into force for that Party, and such withdrawal takes effect upon expiry of one year from the date of receipt by the Depositary of the notification of withdrawal.The United States accepted the Paris Agreement on Sept. 3, 2016, and the Agreement entered into force for the United States on Nov. 4, 2016.The Secretary-General would circulate the text of this communication as a depositary notification, in English and French, early next week.The U.S. Department of State, in a statement, confirmed ""the United States submitted a communication to the United Nations, in its capacity as depositary for the Paris Agreement, regarding the U.S. intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is eligible to do so, consistent with the terms of the Agreement"".""As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favourable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers.""The United States supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security.""We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in many nationally determined contributions.""The United States will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP-23) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect U.S. interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration.""Such participation will include ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris Agreement,"" the department said.\l"
"COP23","Nigeria","COP23_Nigeria17","Climate and health: Healthy climate for healthy people","September 29, 2017 Friday","Nigerian Tribune","Climate change is a medical emergency (The Lancet) whose impact on health is alarming, and for decades now, the African continent has been disturbed by its impacts, one in which Nigeria as a nation has had her share. The issue of health challenges in Africa, and more importantly Nigeria, has been made worse by climate change on a personal level than it used to be and critical stakeholders have not realised this.Nigeria, as both the most populous country and a major exporter of oil in Africa, faces the challenges of balancing global energy demands and its domestic economic stability, with the need to address climate change impacts and other environmental considerations. However, we must understand and admit that a healthy climate will definitely produce healthy people. Climate Change and Health Expert of the World Health Organisation (WHO), D.H. Campbell-Lendrum, affirms in the Climate Tracker Climate Change and Health YouTube Webinar, that 'the health of people are the lives of people.'Evidences from recent climate-sensitive health issues in our nation, such as the recent flooding in Imo and Benue states, the food insecurity issue in the north, the disturbances in the environment brought about by climate change on the fast spread of Lassa fever into many Nigerian states, as the vector, a rodent (multimammate rat) thrives on contaminated water, food and are highly adaptable (501 cases and 104 deaths as of 9th of June, according to WHO), proves the statement above to be true.Climate change impacts, such as extreme weather, floods, and droughts, invariably have a direct impact on our health; but its indirect impacts such as food insecurity, population migration and air pollution are equally consequential considerations.Drivers of climate change and effects on healthAir pollution exists in its various forms such as outdoor air pollution (OAP), short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) and the household air pollution (HAP). In Nigeria, it is saddening that HAP accounts for about 258,000 deaths, as well as 57% of an estimated 130,900 child deaths. This is due to acute lower respiratory infection. Death from generator smoke inhalation in Nigeria between 2008 and 2014 amounted to no fewer than 10,000, with four Nigerian cities now on the list of the most polluted cities in the world. 94% of Nigerian citizens are now exposed to air pollution levels that exceed WHO guidel"

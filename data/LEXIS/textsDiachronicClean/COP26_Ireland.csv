"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland2","Taoiseach and Cop26","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Sir, - I read with dismay the following phrase from your report at the Cop26 conference: ""Taoiseach stresses pledge is global and not national.""If global methane emissions are to be reduced by 30 per cent, wealthy nations will need to reduce their individual outputs by at least that amount. And Ireland is most certainly a wealthy nation within the global context. The Taoiseach's comments display a total lack of solidarity with the climate pledge, and prepare the ground for Ireland to fall far short in our attempt to meet this target.A 30 per cent global target requires a 30 per cent national target. Anything less means we are expecting other nations to do the work for us.Ireland is a small country. But this is not simply a matter of scale; it is one of responsibility. Last year we had the EU's second highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita, behind only Luxembourg.Let's hope the others adopt a more proactive attitude.- Yours, etc, JAMES BROWNE, Phibsborough, Dublin 7. Sir, - In his interview at Cop26 yesterday the Taoiseach accepted that Ireland's emissions would increase in the short term. He makes the basic error of assuming it's purely a Government responsibility. In contrast David Attenborough appealed to everyone to rise to the challenge. I suggest Miche\'e1l Martin shows leadership and asks everyone in the country to make simple changes to show we are listening. Simple changes such as drive 20 per cent less, cycle, walk, use the bus or train. Turn the heating thermostat down two degrees. Wear warmer clothes. Reduce meat and dairy consumption. Reduce the number of flights you take, grow your own vegetables.We have done so well as a nation in the pandemic, let's keep showing what we can achieve as a nation when we have a common goal.- Yours, etc, DAVID SPROTT, Ballincollig, Cork.Sir, - At a time when massive industries all over the globe are pumping out trillions of metric tonnes of carbon in order to manufacture countless unnecessary luxuries for our delectation, and while a substantial number of people in the world are starving, I find it curious that a primary focus of the Cop26 should be to reduce the production of food? I suggest a recalibration of values might be in order. - Yours, etc, TOM FANTHOM, Newcastle, Wicklow.Sir, - Kevin O'Sullivan reports that ""China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has failed to increase its commitments to address the climate crisis as demanded by other countries at the Cop26 climate summit.""

However, poorer countries say the group's promises were not accompanied by clear plans.G20 leaders also recognised that reducing methane is one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost effective means to limit climate impacts, but they could not agree on a deal to phase out coal use. This all leaves Cop26 with the uphill task of setting out what strengthened ambition should look like in this decade.UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said the G20 outcome fell far short of delivering real leadership on the crisis, and that he left Rome ""with my hopes unfulfilled . . . but not buried"".

We'll only know that in a week, but there is already some very real progress,"" he said.Environmental activists locked out of the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow last week lamented the fact that the fossil fuel companies had a wide range of delegates in attendance at the 25,000-strong summit, which heard a number of pledges from world leaders on robust action to tackle climate change.Despite the pledges, activists have largely dismissed the words of global leaders, claiming the event is high-level ""greenwashing"".Greenwashing refers to firms and organisations embellishing their green credentials through slick marketing, scant evidence, and out-of-context claims. Prof Mann tweeted: ""Beware of the slippery slope from cynicism to nihilism. It leads to the same place as denialism: inaction. Which is precisely what polluters and those doing their bidding want.""Prof Mann has authored more than 200 peer-reviewed and edited publications, and is considered to be one of the outstanding scientists in the climate change realm.Inside Cop26 are opportunities for academics, researchers, and business leaders to network at a level that is unreachable outside of such a setting, University College Cork (UCC) professor Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir said.The director of the Cork-based Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine (MaREI) and professor of energy engineering at UCC said that Cop26 has given a golden opportunity for future partnerships to spring up as delegates from around the world meet in person.""It is a unique opportunity. We all have our conferences and workshops that we attend, but to have this on our doorstep, so close to Cork, is why UCC sent a delegation. The value of the networking, the value of having access to the latest information and the politicians and the policymakers from around the world, it's unique in that regard.""If you look at it on an annual basis, there is no other topic in the world that countries come together to discuss and listen to the science, to work out what the next steps should be. There is a bit of theatre surrounding the world leaders, but in fact, the ambitions they express puts it up to the negotiators to push further.""World leaders will talk about 1.5C but it's only through negotiations over the two weeks that we'll really know how that is progressing.""The fashion industry is the latest to signal its intent to reduce emissions at Cop26, with updated targets under the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action.It pledged to halve emissions by 2030, with a pledge to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050 - considerably higher than the previous target set of 30% aggregate greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030.\l"

At the UN summit in Glasgow, many countries, including some major emitters such as India, promised to increase their ""national determined contributions"" required under the Paris climate agreement in the form of revised emission reduction targets, with a view to achieving net-zero emissions.Up to now, climate projections predicted the world was facing a 2.7-degree rise driven by rising carbon emissions, which would make vast areas of the planet uninhabitable. The main target of the Paris agreement is containing global temperature averages to 1.5 degrees this century, while the UK government - as Cop26 host - has ""keeping 1.5 degrees alive"" a key priority at the summit.Speaking yesterday about progress so far at the two-week long Cop26, Mr Kerry said while the latest modelling indicating the world was on a trajectory to limit temperature rise to below 2 degrees for the first time was welcome, humanity was facing a race to reduce warming.""Let me emphasise as strongly as I can: job not done. The first part of the job of codifying the urgency will hopefully be done. But that's just the beginning. This is a decade-long race,"" he said. ""We do know that we could have a critical mass of countries moving in a way that keeps [1.5 degrees] alive. This was never going to be done in one week.""Three separate analyses this week - most notably by the International Energy Agency - indicate if these revised ambitions are realised, global warming will be limited to below 2 degrees, and possibly to as low as 1.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""This is a global first and a significant win arising from Cop26,"" UCC energy expert Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir told The Irish Times.Analysis previewed by the Energy Transition Commission suggests, if delivered in full, commitments made by the close of the first week could deliver 9 gigatonnes of the further 22 gigatonne reduction in emissions required to achieve 1.5 degrees.Meanwhile, coinciding with the day's youth climate theme, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg led more than 25,000 mostly young people - including many from Ireland - through the streets of Glasgow. She told a rally in George's Square: ""The leaders are not doing nothing, they are actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks to benefit themselves and to continue profiting from this destructive system."" Young climate leaders At Cop26 itself, views of more than 40,000 young climate leaders were presented to ministers, negotiators and officials including a call for their voices to be heard and demanding ""action to prevent catastrophic climate change in our lifetimes"".The week has also secured tangible progress on climate finance with the long-awaited $100 billion (EUR 86.46 billion) a year promised by rich nations to poor nations set to be delivered in 2022, a year earlier than previously thought. Delivery of the money to fund emission cuts in developing countries is considered a critical test of Cop26 in building trust between wealthy and poor nations. It is to assist collaboration in addressing the climate emergency and transitioning developing countries from using fossil fuels to use of renewable energy.On Thursday evening Mr Kerry said Japan's promise to pay $2 billion a year would unlock another $8 billion a year of private sector money.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland45","Cop26 failed to consider tackling toll taken by war industry","Irish Examiner"," ","AS THE ink has barely dried on the Cop26 agreement and citizens are poring over the entrails to see if anything significant has been achieved, one thing is certain: The planet remains in mortal danger and actions now need to match, or indeed far exceed, words.Despite extreme weather events and the threat to life posed by greenhouse gas emissions, governments, especially those of rich countries, are woefully reluctant to take the necessary steps to seriously address this issue.And a huge elephant in the room at Cop26 was the failure to even consider tackling the war industry's part in this crisis.This industry is powered by fossil fuels and is among the biggest polluters on the planet. For example, the US defence department has a larger carbon footprint than most countries - in fact, if it were a country it would register as the 55th biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.Some readers may be feeling a sense of relief in the belief that the Republic of Ireland, at least, is not making a contribution to this aspect of planetary peril.However, they would be wrong in that assumption.Although, traditionally, before our neutrality was steadily and stealthily eroded, we had a limited involvement in the arms industry, all that has changed and is set to change more drastically in the coming years.The event, which will be officially opened by Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, proudly proclaims itself as a high-level seminar and networking event, on the new EU funding and technology supports for the defence and security research, innovation, development, and manufacturing ecosystem in Ireland.The use of the term ""ecosystem"" is especially offensive when one considers the environmental damage done to the ecosystem by the military/war machine.The promotion for the event goes on to say that, ""The seminar will provide significant networking opportunities with senior officials from the EU Commission, the European Defence Agency, Enterprise Ireland, and European Defence Industry who will present on the European Defence Fund, defence tech engagement, and Horizon Europe opportunities over the next EU budgetary cycle, 2021-2027.""Is this not extraordinary and disturbing in equal measure?We, in Ireland, know better than most the damage that weapons can do to people and our environment. The issue of decommissioning weapons following the Good Friday Agreement which was happily achieved, to a greater or lesser extent - dominated our media and public discourse for many years.Yet we are now deliberately getting ever more deeply involved in the business of building weapons systems for profit, the consequences of which will inevitably be death, suffering, and forced migration of people whom we do not know and against whom we have no gripe or grudge.The world is already awash with weapons that are killing, maiming, and driving people from their homes. And we don't need more! The global arms industry racked up an almost incomprehensible bill of $ 1,900bn in 2019, a vast multiple of the pledges to save the planet made at Cop26.What is official Ireland's response?A decision, under the watch of the Green Party, I might add, to participate in building more weapons, costing - literally - the earth.I'm sure those who will attend this conference will be highly qualified, politely spoken, and neatly dressed, but the business they will be promoting is the business of blood and of ecological devastation.For the welfare of the planet and its people, Mr Coveney and the Department of Defence should reflect on the millions of victims of war around the world and call off this grotesque event.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland46","Key areas targeted by upcoming Cop26 climate change summit","Irish Examiner"," ","The Cop26 summit in Glasgow is being billed as the biggest UN climate conference since countries secured the Paris Agreement in 2015.However, there is no big new deal like the Paris Agreement to hammer out at Cop26 - instead, Glasgow has to deliver on the promises made six years ago and, alongside the formal UN negotiations, drive action to tackle the worsening climate crisis.Keeping 1.5C within reachGlasgow has been billed as the last best chance to limit global warming to 1.5C in the long term.Under the Paris Agreement, countries committed to curbing temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C - beyond which worsening impacts of climate change will be felt.But back in 2015, it was clear that the emissions cuts countries had signed up to left the world far off track to meet the global temperature goals. So under the Paris deal, countries were due to bring forward more ambitious post-2020 national plans ahead of Cop26.CashThe key to success at Cop26 is delivering on a long-promised (EURO)100bn a year for 2020 to 2025 for poorer countries to develop cleanly and cope with the impacts of climate change.It is seen as a matter of trust between developing and developed nations for donor countries to deliver on the promised private and public climate finance, and conversations will also begin on unlocking further funds after 2025.There is pressure for finance to be split equally bet emissions and to adapt to climate change.CoalCoal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and polluting coal plants need to be phased out in the next two decades to meet climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency.CarsRoad transport accounts for a 10th of global emissions, so countries are being urged to commit to ensuring all new car and van sales are zero-emission vehicles by 2035 or 2040 and put in place policies to boost uptake. Vehicle manufacturers are also being urged to commit to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 or earlier.TreesHealthy and restored forests can absorb and lock up vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. Protecting trees - along with other carbon-storing natural habitats such as peatlands - is seen as key to cutting emissions and helping communities and wildlife cope with climate change.The pressure is on countries to take steps to halt and reverse deforestation, switch to sustainable agriculture, and support efforts to protect or conserve 30% of the world's land and oceans by 2030.While the most significant greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, methane is a powerful, but short-lived, climate-warming gas. Cutting methane emissions is seen as a key way to curb warming in the short term. A US and EUled ""global methane pledge"" which commits countries to cut emissions by 30% by 2030 has already garnered a number of signatures ahead of its formal launch at Cop26.Back in the negotiations, there are still some outstanding issues about how parts of the Paris Agreement are going to work, and they need to be resolved to make it operational and effective.Editorial: 8\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland48","Agreement may keep hope alive; Cop26","November 15, 2021 Monday","The Irish Times","The angry desperation in countries most vulnerable to climate change following the final Cop26 agreement in Glasgow is tragically well founded in their experience of international failure to deal with this crisis to date. ""You might as well bomb us,"" one Pacific islands leader said bluntly.Conversely, the hubris of the countries that systematically unpicked the strongest clauses in the agreement's early drafts lacks any experiential, scientific - or ethical - rationale . There were certainly chronic flaws in the Cop26 process. There were 500 fossil fuel lobbyists present, when many suffering the lethal consequences of their industries were excluded. Would we countenance a global conference on lung cancer with a similar lobby from the tobacco industry?The final declaration was blatantly redacted by massive fossil fuel polluters. An initial intention to ""phase out"" coal power, and the current massive subsidies for fossil fuel production, was neutered to a ""phasing down"" of coal power, and ""accelerating efforts"" on the phasing out of ""inefficient"" subsidies. This wording implies that coal power will be maintained well into the future, and that it is somehow possible to ""efficiently"" subsidise industries that are bringing us ever faster towards catastrophic levels of global heating. Nevertheless, optimists can point to some wins at the Glasgow conference, just enough to keep hope alive that the international community may yet make an effective commitment to mitigating, if not reversing, the crisis. Those wins included the US-China agreement to co-operate on this issue; heightened commitments on deforestation; global endorsement of the EU-US agreement to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Ireland can take some comfort in Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan's imaginative move to revive stalled plans to create an effective ""loss and damage"" fund for poor countries. He also argues that this Cop gives ""legal certainties"" to implementing the 2015 Paris Cop deal.For climate Cop veterans, the mere mention of fossil fuels in the declaration for the first time is a significant advance. But this is also an indication of just how successfully world leaders have avoided heeding the science in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports up to now. The fact all parties to the agreement are being asked to increase their commitments at the Cop in Egypt next year is just enough to sustain a belief we could yet keep temperature rises within the (barely) safe limit of 1.5 degrees.Perhaps the best hope now is that public opinion has shifted massively on this question in many countries. If our children are to enjoy a habitable world, politicians across the globe must respond by making greater advances, much faster.\l"

Global solidarity and an acceptance of scientific fact will be critically important in the coming weeks if humanity is to have any chance of maintaining a sustainable future on this planet.

Photo: Stefan Rousseau/PANegotiation, negotiation, negotiationWhile much of the world's attention in the first week of the UN summit was on the presence of leaders and big announcements on saving forests, phasing out coal, cutting methane and stopping fossil fuel finance, there were also negotiations between countries going on at the same time.AdvertisementMuch of the hard work will happen this week as the ministers lead political negotiations, on finalising parts of the Paris Agreement to make it operational and effective and on finance for poor countries to cope with climate change and address the loss and damage they suffer.And negotiators are trying to hammer out a ""cover decision"" from Glasgow that will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged to take under the Paris Agreement and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.The atmosphere could become more fraught as countries push for competing outcomes, and long nights and a much later finish than the supposed end of the day on Friday are likely.More announcements\~Cop26 organised by the UK as hosts continues, with more announcements on commitments by countries and businesses in various areas expected.Look out for pledges on issues such as switching to electric vehicles on transport day, which is Wednesday, while other days focus on adaptation and loss and damage, gender, science and innovation and cities and regions.Who's in town?

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland53","Cop26: What would success look like at the climate summit?","October 31, 2021 Sunday 11:27 AM GMT","BreakingNews.ie","Making a final assessment of the progress achieved over the two weeks of the Cop26 talks in Glasgow will be complex. Unlike past climate summits, the event won't deliver a new treaty or one big ""win"".Rather, it will attempt to produce a myriad of smaller victories - from the formal UN negotiations on the Paris Agreement, and from the new climate pledges that countries, companies and investors announce during the conference.Its success will be judged on whether all those can together keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal alive.The gap is huge. Scientists say capping warming at 1.5 degrees would require global emissions to plummet 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels, and reach net-zero by 2050. Countries' current pledges would see emissions soar by 16 per cent by 2030.Cop26 will use three levers to attempt to steer the world towards 1.5 degrees. AmbitionAdvertisementFirst, it will devise a plan for how countries will accelerate their emissions reduction pledges in future years.Cop26 will almost certainly not deliver enough pledges to put the world firmly on course for 1.5 degrees. But a credible deal to ramp up ambition more frequently in the coming years could at least keep it alive.Denmark and Grenada have been put in charge of drawing up options for this, and Britain is considering a proposal that would require countries to come back with new, more ambitious pledges as early as 2023.The conference's British hosts are also lining up a set of side-deals on phasing out coal, clean vehicles and deforestation. Those could help inch towards the Paris Agreement goals, in the absence of new commitments from the world's biggest polluters.FinanceThe second lever is money.Wealthy countries confirmed last week they failed to meet a 2009 promise to deliver $100 billion ((EURO)86 billion) annually by 2020 in climate finance to help poorer nations cut their own emissions and build resilient systems to weather worsening storms, floods and other climate impacts.That has stoked anger and mistrust among developing countries, and undermined rich nations' requests that the developing world cut emissions faster - which would require huge investments to decarbonise everything from power plants, to factories, to transport and farming.AdvertisementCop26 will need to produce a plan to make sure the $100 billion arrives. It will also start negotiations on a new climate finance goal for 2025 - and the rules to make sure rich countries cannot avoid delivering the money.A bloc of the world's most climate vulnerable countries are also demanding that Glasgow starts talks on financing for so-called ""loss and damage"" - money to compensate them for the spiralling costs of climate change, from crop failures to rising seas.Cop26 host Britain has also beckoned in the private sector, and is lining up pledges from banks and investors to push billions into clean investments and plug the gap left by wealthy countries' lagging donations.Analysts at Bernstein estimate that $2-4 trillion must be invested in low-carbon industries each year for the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Compare that with the $79.6 billion that rich countries offered poor countries in climate finance in 2019.Economists increasingly agree that cost of doing nothing - and letting climate change unfold unchecked - would be far higher.RulebookThe third priority for Cop26 is for negotiators from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to finish the rules to implement the accord. That includes thorny discussions on carbon markets, how countries will set climate targets in future, and finance.""Paris was the engagement party, but now we're at the wedding, waiting to see if the key countries and corporations are ready to say 'I do',"" said Greenpeace head Jennifer Morgan.\l"

I would like to thank Foyle College for all its amazing support.""The judges said they were impressed by Alex's entry because of the way she brought the continents together to look after mother nature, with her piece depicting animals that need to be protected and the technologies that will enable this.Spice Girl Geri Horner was so impressed with the Eglinton artist's piece that she decided to put it on display in her collection at her countryside home.In recognition of Alex's success, former Derry City and Strabane District Council Mayor Brian Tierney invited her to a special reception in the Guildhall.Last month, Alex attended the launch of The Boat of Hope campaign in London.Her piece was featured within a 42ft mural by artist Justin Eagleton called Hope.The mural, which shows the journey a person goes through when suffering with depression, is central to the campaign, which focuses on starting conversations about mental health.\l"

And the choices you are set to make are vitally important.""But China and India insisted that language on fossil fuels be weakened in the final summit decision text.As the final deal was clinched, a tearful Sharma said ""I apologise for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry,"" before banging down his gavel.Delegates entered the talks charged with keeping the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5-2C degrees within reach.They were also tasked with finding the funding for nations most at risk of climate-related droughts, floods and storms supercharged by rising seas.Observers said the agreement fell far short of what is needed to avert dangerous warming and help countries adapt or recoup damages from the disasters already unfurling globally.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the deal, but stressed it was ""not enough"".""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.""Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg said the talks had achieved nothing but ""blah, blah, blah"", echoing earlier comments.Laurence Tubiana, the architect of the Paris deal, told AFP that ""COP has failed to provide immediate assistance for people suffering now.""But a statement from the European Commission said the deal had ""kept the Paris targets alive"".British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government hosted the talks, insisted the deal was a ""big step forward"" even if much more work needed to be done.SurvivalThe final text urged nations to accelerate efforts to ""phase down"" unfiltered coal and ""phase out"" inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.Large emitters China and India had opposed the mention of the polluting fuels, and the language in the final text was significantly more nuanced than earlier drafts.The deal also called on all countries to accelerate their emissions cuts by submitting new national plans by 2022, three years earlier than agreed in Paris.But after resistance from rich nations led by the United States and EU, the text omitted any reference to a specific finance facility for the loss and damage climate change has already caused in the developing world.""For some loss and damage may be the beginning of conversation and dialogue,"" said Shauna Aminath, the Maldives environment minister.

These two sectors combined account for over half of emissions in Ireland, well above the global average.Both sectors are pivotal to our export industry, but they are also two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.The vast majority of our agricultural and manufactured goods get to their market destinations by road and sea freight, with road being the fastest growing greenhouse gas emitter.Transport is one of the main sectors responsible for climate change. It accounts for close to one quarter of energy-related emissions. And unlike other sectors, it has not yet succeeded in reducing its carbon intensity.The difficulty for the transport industry is that this will offset any expected reductions they will get from new technology trucks. This will lead to an increase in emissions by 2050, not a reduction.But cost-effective alternatives are still lacking. Diesel-powered heavy goods vehicles offers a level of flexibility and accessibility. To reach climate targets, zero-emissions fuels for trucks would need to be in general use well in advance of 2050.Given the current state of research and commercial deployment, none of the known zero-emissions truck fuels will see widespread use in the short to medium term.Airl"

It is billed as a chance for humanity to save itself from climate catastrophe. It is the latest and most urgent summit in a protracted diplomatic process entering its fourth decade.In 1992, countries agreed to an international treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which set ground rules and expectations for global co-operation on combating climate change.The ""parties"" are the 196 countries that ratified the treaty, plus the European Union. The United Kingdom, partnering with Italy, is hosting COP26 in Glasgow.It was due to take place last year but was postponed because of the global Covid-19 pandemic.Who will be there?The summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.The UN says that more than 190 world leaders will participate, along with tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses and citizens for 12 days of talks.Some leaders have said they will not be attending, namely Russia\' s Vladimir Putin and the leader of the world's most populous country, President Xi Jinping of China, is not expected to be there in person.Pope Francis is not expected to attend.

Here's your guide for what to look out for and how we plan to cover what has been described as our 'last best chance' to combat global warming.  What is COP26 For the first two weeks in November a summit of world leaders, scientists, activists and policy makers will be gathered in Glasgow, Scotland to form the UN Convention of Parties (COP) on Climate Change. This meeting, COP26, is aimed to reach agreement about what needs to be done to make sure the rise in global temperature is kept to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.   Why do I need to know about COP26?This comes at a crucial point after the recent IPCC - the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report written by scientists from all around the world, which declared £ red alert for humanity' and said that climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying. The IPCC made it clear that human activity was driving this.   Delegates from more than 190 countries are tasked with finding solutions to the crisis that will bring down harmful emissions. This requires increased efforts and climate actions by all nations. They also aim to resolve issues around climate finance including how to help less well-off nations to adapt to climate change. UN Climate Conference President Alok Sharma called COP26 our ""last best chance"" to combat global warming.  How can I find out about what is happening at COP26 and Climate Change issues?As the world looks to unite to tackle the issue of climate change at the global UN COP26 event next month, RT\'c9 will bring audiences to the heart of November\' s summit with special news & current affairs programming and easily accessed expansive digital content as part of its continued coverage of climate change.As the World Leaders Summit begins in Glasgow, Scotland on 1 November, RT\'c9 Radio 1's Morning Ireland and RT\'c9's Six One News will broadcast live from the conference.

It said ""rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions"" were needed to avert the worst impacts of heating, which has already seen countries worldwide slammed by fiercer floods, droughts and storms.COP26 was billed by host Britain as an opportunity to ""keep 1.5C"" alive after a year-long delay due to Covid-19.However, countries' latest decarbonisation plans are likely to see Earth warm 2.7C this century, according to a United Nations assessment of the pledges.Negotiators are also trying to hammer out agreement on technical parts of the global climate treaty, the Paris Agreement, including common timeframes for national commitments on emissions reductions and agreed ways for countries to report on their progress, to help turn pledges into action.There are also negotiations on providing finance for developing countries to cope with climate change and address the issue of loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure caused by global warming in poorer nations.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland71","After Cop26, the real (estate) work begins; Recent talks must mark a turning point for the building sector","November 17, 2021 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Was it just two weeks of handshakes and photo ops or will something positive come from Cop26?Global leaders and their negotiating teams recently rode into Glasgow with the very serious mandate to take meaningful action immediately to reduce the impact of climate change. However, past Conference of the Parties (Cop) meetings have promised much and unfortunately delivered very little beyond unmet self-policed targets. So will the follow-on from Cop26 be any different?There are some positives - renewing commitment to the Paris agreement targets, halting de-forestation, tackling methane emissions, additional countries signing up, and co-operation agreements. On our turf, Ireland has signed up to most, if not all the commitments of the Cop26 agreements and had already started the journey by adopting the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill earlier this year, along with announcing the new Climate Action Plan. So now it's up to us to make good on our promises and commitments.If we are to achieve the goals set at , then we must start with the first step - meet the Irish target of achieving 51 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. That means slashing emissions by half in eight years. If that sounds too difficult as a first step, it's only because we have failed to make any significant changes to meet much smaller goals in the past, and it will only get more difficult, if not impossible, if we don't take serious action now. For that to happen, Cop26 must be a turning point for the biggest contributor - the building sector, which is responsible for 40 per cent of global CO2 emissions.How we see it Our best advice for building owners and developers is simple. The path to achieving these goals is to work now on anticipating the imminent regulations and producing an action plan to deliver the required targets. Apart from the obvious need to mitigate climate impacts, failure to take action will inevitably lead to a reduction in overall building value and lettability.The Irish market is not without shortfalls. We have seen inadequate implementation of technology, less than optimal operation of buildings, poor maintenance of systems and meagre engagement with tenants, especially in the older building stock. A shortage of specialised technicians, architects and engineers is also a factor.Regardless of what motivates you, Ireland has enough to keep us hopeful. There is access to technology and equipment, available renewable resources and free cooling, stringent energy code, supportive government and financial incentives, demanding corporate clients and an equally rewarding market return, and an abundance of colleges and technical schools .How we do it When I meet clients for a coffee, their first question is ""How do we start?"". The answer is to find out where you need to be in 2030 to meet the targets, and then cast back to where you should be today, and every day, for the next eight years to succeed. Then devise the plan to keep you on track to achieve that.These comprehensive action plans must have ambitious targets and an end goal to deliver on-the-ground change to reduce carbon emissions and waste, lower pollution, boost biodiversity and ultimately make buildings and cities more sustainable and resilient. Commitments alone are not enough - delivering on these targets must be a key measure of the business success.The recent news that the US and Chinese governments have agreed to work together on climate change targets highlights a vital perspective. We must seek out all potential allies to succeed in this journey, up and down the supply chain: governments, NGOs, communities, clients and even competitors.Ultimately, it is up to each one of us if something positive is to come from Cop26. If there is one thing we have learned during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that our ability to change and adapt drastically in the face of existential threats is far beyond what we thought it would be.There is no greater existential threat than climate change. Let's find the cure, and we must start now. Rami Nassar is head of sustainability with JLL\l"

HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/cop26/Latest COP26 newsThe government of Brazil, much criticised for its environmental policies, announced yesterday at the summit that it would cut 2005-level greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 - up from a previous pledge of 43%.""We are presenting a new, more ambitious climate goal,"" Environment Minister Joaquim Leite announced in a message transmitted from Brasilia to Glasgow.Mr Leite also said Brazil would aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.India targets net-zero 2070For his part, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a target of net-zero emissions by 2070.India's commitment was eagerly awaited, as the South Asian giant is the fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China, the United States and the European Union.Swedish activist Greta Thunberg urged the leaders gathered for COP26 to act and stop their ""blah blah blah"" during a demonstration in Glasgow. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/Latest climate newsAlmost a quarter of all man-made emissions of carbon dioxide can be attributed to land use activity such as logging, deforestation and farming.President Joko Widodo of resource-rich Indonesia said his own archipelago's rainforests, mangroves, seas and peatlands were key to restricting climate change.""We are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations,"" he said in a UK government statement.Ten more yearsThe summit pledge to ""halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030"" encompasses promises to secure the rights of indigenous peoples, and recognise ""their role as forest guardians"". While Mr Johnson described the pledge as ""unprecedented"", a UN climate gathering in New York in 2014 issued a similar declaration to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020, and end it by 2030.However, trees continue to be cut down on an industrial scale, not least in the Amazon under the far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.Humans have already cut down half of Earth's forests, a practice doubly harmful for the climate when CO2-sucking trees are replaced with livestock or monoculture crops.Greenpeace criticised the Glasgow initiative for effectively giving the green light to ""another decade of deforestation"".""Indigenous peoples are calling for 80% of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,"" said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali.""The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal,"" she said.Many studies have shown that the best way of protecting forests worldwide is to keep them under the management of locals with generations of preservation knowledge.The commitment comes a day after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres harangued the gathered leaders to act to save humanity.""It's time to say: enough,"" he said. ""Enough of brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.""Mr Johnson warned of the ""uncontainable"" anger of the younger generations if the leaders failed to act decisively on climate change.The UN COP26 conference will continue for another two weeks to try to craft national plans to forestall the most devastating impacts of global warming.\l"

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Ryan called for real action at the COP26 summit and said wealthier countries should pay to help poorer countries adapt.He said big polluters such as China must do more and called on it and others to invest in renewable energy systems.Earlier, the Pope told Today: 'We have lost our sense of security and are experiencing a sense of powerlessness and loss of control over our lives.' He said the crises being faced 'forecast a perfect storm' but also provide opportunities.Francis added: 'These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy. At the same time, moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities. Opportunities that we must not waste. The political decisionmakers who will meet at COP26 in Glasgow are urgently summoned to provide effective responses to the present ecological crisis and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations.'And it is worth repeating that each of us - whoever and wherever we may be - can play our own part in changing our collective response to the unprecedented threat of climate change and the degradation of our common home.'The two-week climate conference is being seen as key to increasing action on cutting emissions to deliver on the pledges in the global Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to 'well below' 2C and try for the safer 1.5C goal.Leaders of major economies will go to Scotland from a G20 meeting in Rome where climate is set to dominate the agenda, although key heads of state, including China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, will miss both summits.Countries - in particular major emitters - are facing calls from across society to increase action to keep the 1.5C goal in reach and avoid catastrophic climate impacts.There will also be pushes to phase out coal power, boost electric vehicles and protect forests, while developed countries also need to deliver finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and cope with the already inevitable impacts of a warming world.In an interview on BBC Radio 4, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger said everyone has to work together to tackle the issue. He said: 'It's very important we have a positive attitude, that we can see it and we all work together because not one person can deal with it themselves. It's a huge undertaking.'

But they're connected","November 6, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","On the surface, the climate summit and the protests outside it look like two completely different worlds, but they're intrinsically connected. Unlike the man at the gates shouting into a loudhailer that ""the global elite doesn't care about you, why are you going in?"", few of the protesters think that what happens at Cop is a complete waste of time. Most people, inside and out, are headed in the same direction, just with infuriatingly different senses of pace and urgency.There are about 30,000 people in the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, and the place is vast and overwhelming. At one end of it, Zone F, where all the political negotiations happen, the clothes are more formal and the pace is brisker. This is where powerful people travel in huddles of functionaries, orbited by photographers.Things have been achieved here already, though the details still need to be negotiated by hardworking civil servants and scientific advisers. The net-zero pledges announced by world leaders in the first few days, coupled with the Global Methane Pledge, will keep temperature rises within 1.8 degrees (according to analysis from the International Energy Agency). That's still short of the 1.5 degrees aspired to at Paris but it's a big step. They also worked to bridge the shortfall in the Green Climate Fund designed to help poorer countries adapt, so it should now reach the $100 billion a year promised in the Paris Agreement. Yes, they're just promises, but as UCC professor of energy engineering Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir reminds me, change starts with promises. He's cautiously optimistic.I spend lots of time in the delegate pavilions where countries, agencies and NGOs compete for attention with talks, announcements and, sometimes, free food and coffee. It's a lively place. I encounter some scamps from Nuclear for Climate cadging coffee from the barista at the Global Wind Energy Council. ""Obviously, we welcome everyone,"" says Rebecca Williams, director of this pavilion. Nuclear for Climate's David Watson turns around with expert timing to reveal the words ""Together is better"" on the back of his T-shirt.Williams's organisation has, when I arrive, just signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" with the Global Solar Council, and she introduces me to their chief executive, Gianni Chianetta. Significant meetings are happening all over the place here - collaborative partnerships, announcements, rounds of applause. Gummy bear Nuclear power is a harder sell due to the historical antipathy with which it is viewed by environmentalists. One of the Nuclear for Climate pitches is that a gummy bear-sized piece of plutonium creates the same amount of energy as a ton of coal, so they have a huge inflatable gummy bear at their stall. They also have someone called Eric who sings opera arias with the lyrics changed to reflect benefits of nuclear power. ""Nuclear Power is the key to universal prosperity, it is nuclear energy, we must embrace for the human raaaace.""Yes, in some ways, Cop26 can feel like a trade fair. But then you meet activists from all over the world who cared about the planet well before there was political capital in it, or representatives from poorer countries that are already suffering the sharper edges of ecological collapse. The disconnect between the different versions of Cop26 can be jarring. There seems to be no natural overlap between Leonardo DiCaprio, who barrels through the delegate pavilions on Tuesday, and Vedant Kulkarni, an 18-year-old Indian activist, whose stay was made possible by a free room with a local family thanks to the Human Hotel's Cop26 Homestay Network.

A global plan to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 was also approved.What's more, Brazil - where huge stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories to the forest pledge.The alacrity with which the world has moved to tackle methane emissions also gives real hope that the world is finally waking up to the massive threat posed by warming gases.The thrust is to cut emissions by 30pc by 2030. The main focus in the short-term will be the fossil fuel industry. Most of the curbs can be achieved at little or no cost.The potential benefits are huge - scientists believe it could help the world avoid 0.3C of warming by 2040. At a time when every fraction of a degree matters, that is a major saving that could help keep the golden goal of a 1.5C threshold in view. Undeniably, the fact that major emitters such as Russia, China and India are not party to the commitment is regrettable.Nonetheless, a sense of agency has been restored and the paralysis broken. Momentum must be maintained. A previous deal in 2014 unforgivably failed to slow deforestation at all. Felling trees drives warming because forests absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. Another milestone was arrived at with an initiative to boost the uptake of clean technologies.More than 40 leaders promised to work to scale up clean solutions, with new worldwide standards.This would offer certainty to investors that global markets will be created for low-carbon technologies. Speaking in Glasgow, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin was anxious to strike a more hopeful note, saying:""It's not too late to turn the tide."" But we must also act. ""Climate change will catch up with us. It will catch up with our farming, with our agriculture, if we don't take action,"" he added.Understandably, inability to agree more rapid reductions in the use of fossil fuels - the main cause of man-made warming - has upset the poorer countries likely to be hit hardest.One can only concur with Costa Rican president Carlos Alvarado Quesada's view. He said: ""If the world was a private company, and the leaders of the world were to be different CEOs of the corporations - today we would all be fired."" Clearly, we must think again. COP26 can show the way.

Here's why that is important.What is the significance of 1.5C?When the Paris Agreement - the global treaty on climate change - was negotiated in 2015, there was a strong and ultimately successful push by nations such as low-lying islands to include the 1.5C target in the deal because they felt letting temperatures go any higher would threaten their survival.As a result countries pledged to keep global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C over the long-term.Will limiting temperature rises to 1.5C really make a difference?Yes, according to a special report by the UN's climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in 2018.It found a 2C rise would lead to more heatwaves, extreme rainstorms, water shortages and drought, greater economic losses and lower crop yields, higher sea levels and greater damage to nature.In one of its most sobering findings, the report said coral reefs would decl"

If not, why not?Prince Charles, who opened the Cop26 summit on climate change, warned that the world is in ""the last chance saloon"". Boris Johnson said that we are at ""one minute to midnight"" to prevent catastrophe.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, claimed that if leaders failed to reach a climate change deal, they would be ""cursed"", seen as worse than even the Nazis, because they would be allowing ""genocide on an infinitely greater scale"".The Archbishop subsequently apologised for dragging the Nazis into it, but the overall message remained clear - cut CO2 now, or we're stuffed. Finished. The end.Yet the actions of many of these world leaders, royals, billionaires and assorted VIPS do not match their apocalyptic words. In fact, the words and actions are in direct opposition to one another.There is a grotesque irony, not to mention blatant hypocrisy, in flying to a climate change summit on board your own gas-guzzling plane. 400 private jets are expected to arrive in total.Jeff Bezos of Amazon has already zoomed in aboard his \£348m Gulf Stream.It's been reported that the conference will generate about 13,000 tonnes of carbon - which is equivalent to the amount that 1,600 Scottish people produce in a whole year.Why couldn't they get together on Zoom, as the rest of us have been forced to do for the last year and more?Mr Johnson, channelling his inner Greta Thunberg, spoke of the urgent need to eradicate the ""suffocating blanket of CO2"" which is killing the planet.So how is he getting back to London after this swanky shindig?Private jet. Of course.The filthiest CO2 polluter at Cop26 is Joe Biden, president of the United States. His 85 car convoy, recently deployed for the G20 meeting in Rome, is bad enough.But his flight to Glasgow, in that stinking behemoth, Air Force One - accompanied by four other jets - is calculated to emit 2.16 million pounds of carbon over the five days he's there.I've got to say, Joe Biden didn't look all that worried about the climate emergency. He was pictured having a lovely refreshing snooze during the speeches. For him, ""one minute to midnight"" seemed to signal that it was time for beddy-byes, not imminent Armageddon.These pompous, pampered politicians are basically telling us - do as I say, not do as I do.You, the proles, must stop eating meat and flying to Lanzarote once a year, in order to save the planet.Meanwhile we, the global elite, will continue to gad about whenever and wherever we like in our exclusive private jets, bloated with beef, and laughing at the little people far below, earnestly sorting their recycling.The super-rich, the Harrys and Meghans - and the VIP delegates at Cop26.That's why, personally, I couldn't give a monkeys that our own environment minister, Edwin Poots, pootled off to Glasgow via Easyjet or whatever. People like you, me and Edwin Poots are not the problem here. The ultra-privileged and globally powerful are.If there was a chance that Cop26 could translate into real, dynamic measures to fairly and sustainably curtail global emissions, then you could argue that the whole carbon-heavy circus was worth it. But these summits have historically scored high on theatrical rhetoric, low on real-world action.Plus there is a built-in limit to whatCop26 can achieve, because three of the world's main polluters - China, Russia and Brazil - are not even present.Look, nobody sane is denying that gigantic steps must be taken to protect the natural world. And individual responsibility is an important part of that. We all need to feel that we can contribute in meaningful, practical ways to the health of the planet.But you can't expect people to be motivated if they are constantly beaten down with catastrophic talk of doom and destruction, which indicates that the battle is all but lost. That way, they're more likely to shrug their shoulders, have another burger and resign themselves to ultimate extinction.Earlier this week, a Channel 4 reporter posted a video on social media showing the streets around Cop26Do these very important people think that we are entirely stupid? They should stop exhorting us to make all the sacrifices, stop trying to scare us silly, and step up to the plate themselves.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland114","Great expectations as Cop26 looks to build momentum in bid to fight climate change; Global unity is now a key target, says Frank McGovern","October 29, 2021 Friday","Irish Independent","THE 26th Conference of Parties to the UN Convention on climate change, Cop26, has achieved almost legendary status even before it opens. One way or another it will be historic.It is taking place during a unique confluence of events which would have been deemed fanciful when the UK formally announced its hosting intentions at the Cop25 in Madrid.Perhaps there were already omens of what was to come, and if you look for omens many can be found. Cop25 itself should have taken place in Santiago in Chile. Due to social unrest it was moved at the last minute to Madrid.The planned run-up to Cop26 in November 2020 would have been one of the shortest ever. The UK was working intensely with its Chilean counterparts on the handover of a very complex process. Then the world changed.The shadow of Covid-19 was already looming over the February 2020 meeting of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That turned out to be the last in-person meeting held by either of the key global science or policy bodies.Postponement to November 2021 meant the run-up to Cop26 has become the longest and perhaps the most intense in history. InAugust, and after a significant delay, the IPCC completed the first volume of its Sixth Assessment Report, in a virtual setting.A key focus for the Cop is the international climate policy community's response to the latest science. Past experiences in this are mixed.The IPCC was established in 1988, four years before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the first IPCC Assessment Report informing its establishment. In that sense, the IPCC is sometimes referred to as a parent to the UNFCCC.As is the case for many parents, a growing child can be troublesome. All was well at the start, as the IPCCSecond Assessment Report informed the adoption of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but then things stalled.That was going to change at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009.The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report had just been published. The Nobel Prize was awarded to the IPCC, along with Al Gore.Within the UNFCCC things were not so rosy. Copenhagen would not deliver the expected outcome.Some errors in the IPCC report became a focus of media attention, along with questions about the validity of the global temperature record, in what became known as 'Climategate'.A period of soul-searching around international processes followed the Copenhagen Cop. On the science side, a series of reviews and inquiries found the analysis of the global temperature records was robust, as were the IPCC procedures, but a number of improvements were adopted.At the 2010 Cancun Cop, governments strongly affirmed their support for the international process. They adopted the 2C limit as the long-term global goal for the UNFCCC and a sciencebased process to consider its adequacy in avoiding dangerous climate change.That review was informed by the IPCC Fifth AssessmentReport. It in turn informed the Cop21 Paris Agreement in 2015 and the goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C.The latest IPCC report provides compelling insights on the steps needed to halt human-induced climate change. The message is of urgency and there is a need for swift and effective actions in the period to 2030. These should enable net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century, and also address other greenhouse gases.How will governments respond? Covid19 shows that what might seem a logical and clear response in one country does not always translate across international borders. For climate change, like Covid19, a failure to respond effectively anywhere can have global implications.The prescience of the Paris Agreement is it was designed to take account of such differences. Each country committed to making its own nationally determined contribution, but these contributions should add up to what is needed.The global stocktake is the forum in which the adequacy of our collective ambition will be determined. That first stocktake will take place in 2023. It is effectively being kicked off at Cop26 when governments will, for the first time, have an opportunity to consider their collective ambition.Right now, we know from multiple sources that stated ambition is not enough. A number of key actors have yet to commit while others are still considering revisions.So back to Cop26 in Glasgow and the omens. We have a new IPCC report, another Nobel Prize for climate science, but this is different. We have the agreement, the science is unequivocal, what is needed is the willingness and capacity to take the required actions.Expectations are high for Cop26. Success may not be apparent for some time. Cop26 should create the momentum and clarity required so that in 2023 we can say we are collectively on a pathway to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. If Glasgow does this, it will be historic for the right reasons. Frank McGovern is chief climate scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency\l"

Some 51% believe Ireland will not hit its key climate goals within the next 20 years, while nearly nine in 10 believe society and the Government is not doing enough.It is not only political leaders that are failing in the crisis, most teenagers said.More than four in five think companies are failing to play their part, while 45% do not believe individual people are doing enough.When it comes to their own behaviour, some 94% claim they currently recycle, 76% say they are careful about food wastage, 70% use public transport, 53% buy secondhand clothes, and 42% buy food that does not rely on plastic packaging.Four in five claimed they have no intention of owning a car powered by petrol or diesel.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland135","World leaders pretend as Cop26 fails to deliver; Last call","November 13, 2021 Saturday","Irish Independent","ooray! We're all saved!HWell, actually, that's not entirely true. The Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow was touted as one of the most important political gatherings of the last 100 years.As the weather continues to fluctuate wildly around the world, we were informed that the hundreds of bigwigs in attendance would put their heads together and formulate a plan that would help us get out of the mess. Instead, we have been treated to bickering, dithering and bloviating. And that's just from the people who bothered to turn up.The absence of the two worst carbon emitters, Russia and China, immediately meant that the two-week borefest in Scotland would be rather pointless.So, as the leaders who did turn up (and I can't shake the great REM song World Leader Pretend from my mind) informed us that we were looking at years of hardship ahead of us in our efforts to get a handle on the situation, China merrily announced that it was increasing its coal production to 11 million tonnes a day. Read that again: 11 millions tonnes a day. They just gave the world a massive two-fingered salute.For the record, I'm not a 'climate denier', which is an obnoxious phrase designed to evoke a subconscious connection with Holocaust denial. But, like many of us, I am extremely sceptical about the methods that have been proposed to cut emissions. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease and the insanely draconian measures g that ordinary people will be expected to take are simply unsustainable.Apart from anything else, I'm baffled by the complete lack of logic from both the politicians in the Glasgow conference and the activists who gathered outside.The protesters, particularly, don't seem to have thought this one through. As StGreta of the Order of the Permanent Scowl rallied her troops outside the venue, one thought immediately struck me and it was this - hang on, they're barracking the very people who are trying to make a difference? What about the countries that are burning fossil fuels like there's no tomorrow? Why aren't they protesting outside the Russian and Chinese embassies? Their actions seem rather, shall we say, logically inconsistent.But then logic and rational debate have never had much place in a religious movements - and that is what the climate movement has become: a modern-day faith for modern-day people. In fact, you only have to look at the messianic zeal of St Greta and the slavish adoration of her flock to realise that we're witnessing the formation of a brand new orthodoxy; an orthodoxy that brooks no dissent and punishes the miscreants.TWO CAMPS But she is not the problem, she's only a convenient symbol.China and Russia refused to attend because they are more concerned with their own economies. Australia did attend but refused to ratify the agreement to reduce coal because... it would be bad for its economy.The world's governments seem to be split into two camps - those that are genuinely freaked by the climate crisis and are prepared to plunge their own citizens into poverty and cold to make a difference and those who realise that you can't bankrupt your nation to appease other countries.The lack of coherent thought is, ironically, best exemplified here in little old Ireland, which according to the last reputable figures contributes 0.1pc of the world's carbon output. In one of the madder ideas ever floated, various activists are now demanding that we reduce the national herd to curb methane emissions.The result? Well, that means we will simply end up buying more beef from Brazil; the same Brazil that is cutting down vast swathes of the rainforest to make room for more cows... to sell to countries like us. That simply flies in the face of reason.As individuals, we should be focussing on sustainability and environmentalism. For example, I've taken one flight in the last 10 years (and that was a work trip to Syria). I don't drive a car, I don't have kids and I only eat locally sourced meat. Yet the people who drive gas-guzzling cars and take multiple flights are telling me I have to get rid of my gas boiler and replace it with an expensive heat pump that may not even work when it gets too cold and you need it the most?There is, as ever, a solution - nuclear power, yet the great and the good who gathered at Cop26 seemed to gloss over that possibility because they have been brainwashed into thinking we'll be glowing in the dark if we go down that route. It is screamingly obvious that we need to have a sensible debate about the future of the planet. It's equally obvious that we didn't get that in Glasgow.That is what the climate movement has become - a modern-day faith for modern-day people\l"

Using a football match analogy, the Prime Minister said the world had 'pulled back a goal or perhaps even two' in the fight against global warming after landmark deals on methane emissions and deforestation.Beijing's climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua appeared to undermine hopes of further progress by insisting the higher of two maximum temperature rises agreed by world leaders in 2015 under the Paris Agreement had to remain up for discussion. 'If we only focus on 1.5, we are destroying consensus and many countries would a reopening of the negotiations,' he said.In Paris, countries agreed to limit temperature rises to 'well below' 2C and 'pursue efforts' to restrict them to 1.5C, compared with preindustrial times. Many had hoped Cop26 would lead to further commitments to reach the tougher figure.But the absence of the Russian and Chinese presidents from the talks involving around 120 world leaders has cast major doubts on this.And addressing the summit last night, Mr Biden said: 'I think it's been a big mistake quite frankly, China not showing up. They've lost their ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at Cop.'Mr Johnson earlier spoke of his optimism after agreements on deforestation, limiting methane and pledges to work towards net zero, and tweeted: 'Let's keep 1.5C alive.'In a stark warning, he said: 'If we don't fix our climate, it will be an economic catastrophe as well as an environmental catastrophe. The only way to fix this is to reduce CO2 and tackle climate change.'He said the British people had a 'great wisdom' and were 'not dumb' and knew it was a problem that needed to be fixed.Mr Johnson was also asked about the absence of Xi and Putin but said they had told him it was because of the pandemic and 'you have got to respect that'. He added: 'That doesn't mean the Chinese are not engaging.'However, a UK source criticised China, saying 'we are not seeing the sort of leadership people want to see' from the world's biggest emitter. And Microsoft bil- lionaire Bill Gates, at the conference to support a US campaign to cut carbon emissions, sounded a pessimistic note over the 1.5C target, saying: 'There's no comparable feat that mankind has ever achieved.'He said the cost of subsidising countries to curb emissions would be too great, so richer nations should focus on cutting the cost of green technology.In an interview with former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt for the Policy Exchange think tank, Mr Gates said: 'What happened with solar panels where they were very expensive, and now they're cheap, or lithium ion batteries - we need to do that for about six other technologies.'50C 'Lucifer' heatwaves every 3 yearsEUROPE will see extreme 50C heatwaves every three years if greenhouse gases rise further, the UK's Met Office has warned.Unless the world takes action, Europe can expect 'Lucifer' heatwaves to take place by 2100, it said.

The answer will be clear: the promises made to date and efforts to meet them have been woefully inadequate.The 2015 Paris climate agreement committed nations to holding global temperature rises well below 2C from pre-industrial levels, while endeavouring to keep that increase nearer to 1.5C.Yet, according the UN, the world is still on course to warm by 2.7C by the end of this century. As secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres put it, this is code red for humanity.Despite the scale of the challenge there remains a chasm between the rhetoric of governments across the globe and reality.The UK is a case in point. Despite the boisterous claims of Boris Johnson's government, it remains a long way off meeting its own climate targets. In Northern Ireland, like on so many issues, we continue to lag behind. Calls for meaningful climate action have long been overshadowed and drowned out by the jingoism of the main parties.We still don't have a stand alone climate change act or NI-specific emissions targets. Nor do we have the long-touted Independent Environmental Protection Agency to hold government accountable. Our biggest enemy is no longer climate denial, but climate delay.

(Phil Noble/PA)Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt, requires global emissions to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century - but countries' plans for this decade leave the world well off track.The draft is published after analysis warned existing plans for this decade put the world on track for 2.4C of warming - well above the goals internationally agreed in the Paris accord to curb temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.Cop26 president Alok Sharma has made it clear that there is no attempt to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, but the draft document says the impact of climate change will be much lower with 1.5C of warming than 2C.And it ""resolves to pursue efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C"" which will require more action in this decade.The draft urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris temperature goal, which still covers both numbers, by the end of 2022.The document published on Wednesday also urges countries to set out long-term strategies by the end of next year to reach net-zero emissions by about mid-century.It includes a call for developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change, as part of scaling up finance for poorer nations to tackle the crisis.There is also a recognition of the need to do more to address the inevitable loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure in developing countries that more extreme weather will bring.Delegations are expected to be in contact with their leaders and capitals to discuss what their position will be - particularly in those countries whose leaders did not attend the summit, such as China and Russia.Some of the most vulnerable countries have called for more action on finance, and warned that the language in the text is not strong enough to prevent dangerous warming.The Alliance of Small Island States group's chairman, Aubrey Webson, said: ""We won't get the ambition on emissions we need for 1.5C if we don't scale up the provision of finance, and this includes the long-overdue recognition of a separate and additional component for loss and damage.""AdvertisementHe said: ""Urging, calling, encouraging and inviting is not the decisive language that this moment calls for.""We have limited time left in the Cop to get this right and send a clear message to our children, and the most vulnerable communities, that we hear you, and we are taking this crisis seriously.""Environmental campaigners criticised the draft deal, with Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan saying it was ""not a plan to solve the climate crisis"".""It's a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year,"" she said.Christian Aid's Kat Kramer said it was a ""historic moment"" with the first outl"

""If we get to two degrees they are all gone.""Temperatures are already up nearly 1.2C and the overriding goal of the Glasgow negotiations is to keep alive hopes of limiting warming to 1.5C, the toughest goal set by almost 200 nations in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.Forty-five nations were making pledges to safeguard nature including Ireland, the US, Japan, Germany, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Vietnam, the Philippines, Gabon, Ethiopia, Ghana and Uruguay.Sharma said the pledges included $ 4bn in public sector investment which would help spur innovation such as developing crops resilient to droughts, floods and heatwaves that could benefit ""hundreds of millions of farmers"".Campaigners said needed shifts to agriculture to curb emissions and protect food security should have a larger share of the global spotlight.The summit has drawn the world's attention with celebrities and public figures joining the world leaders, environmentalists and policymakers. ""We need to shine a light on climate justice, and we need to make food and farming sexy,"" said Idris Elba, a British actor and goodwill ambassador for the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development.Vanessa Nakate, 24, a climate justice advocate from Uganda, warned that in her country, ""we're watching farms collapse,"" with floods, droughts, heatwaves and swarms of locusts making hunger more widespread.Among pledges at Cop26, Canada said it would allocate about $ 1bn - out of $ 5.3bn previously pledged for climate finance - to ""nature-based climate solutions"" in developing countries over the next five years.Britain said it would give a $ 500m ((EURO)434 m) boost to protect more than 5m hectares of tropical rainforests across Africa, Asia and Latin America.Nations including Peru and Cameroon said they would increase support for small-scale farmers, while Nepal and Madagascar said they would join efforts to protect at least 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030.But other similar past pledges have fallen short.Officials said there was hope the Glasgow pledges would be different. They pointed to plans to track pledges, as well as the promises of cash and innovative technologies, such as high-yielding, drought-resistant crops.Britain said 28 nations that are big consumers of deforestation-linked commodities such as beef, soy, palm oil and cocoa had joined a Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) roadmap launched in February this year.FACT says it promotes sustainable land use as a step to unlock investments, create jobs and protect forest livelihoods.""The next challenge is to go from bold statements to real implementation,"" said Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford.Reuters\l"

I want to play whatever part I can in contributing to that good outcome. And I've made that very clear to the prime minister who I know wants to secure that good outcome as well. ""So I hope we can put whatever differences we have away for the next couple of weeks and just focus on doing what needs to be done,"" she told The Irish Times.The meeting in Glasgow aims to keep alive the target of limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees by securing detailed plans from each country for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon acknowledges that the leaders are going into the summit with big questions still unanswered about how to deliver emissions reductions and how to help poorer countries to fund the changes necessary.""I think there is a big, big challenge confronting this summit. But a big responsibility to make sure that it succeeds. It is easy to exaggerate the importance of events like this, but we are literally talking about the future of our planet. We are talking about the sustainability of the future that today's young people will or will not have,"" she said.\~""This is the world's best chance but\~it\~might actually be the last real chance the world has to avert climate catastrophe\~and to address the tipping point the world stands at. So there has probably been no more important gathering certainly in my lifetime than the one taking place here over the next couple of weeks."" Climate emergency The summit also offers Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party (SNP) governs in coalition with the Greens, a chance to showcase Scotland as a progressive European country committed to tackling the climate emergency.\~""We would be much more powerful as an independent country. Not least, we'd be sitting around the negotiating table at . Directly in our own right, if we were an independent country, we would have more financial wherewithal and clout. ""Things that right now are the decisions of UK government around oil and gas licensing, for example, would lie with the Scottish government,"" she said.Sturgeon won Scotland's parliamentary elections this year promising a second independence referendum by the end of 2023, and she says she is still working to that plan unless the coronavirus pandemic knocks it off course. A binding referendum could require the authorisation of Westminster (although some lawyers believe the Scottish parliament's assent alone would be enough) but Sturgeon says that if she wins a parliamentary majority for an independence vote, Johnson will have to decide if he accepts democracy or not. Democratic choice ""Because of Brexit we have lost our freedom of movement across the European Union. We're no longer members of the European Union, all against our democratic choice. And, well, that's the price of not being independent,"" she said.\~""We're doing our best to contribute to the global efforts to tackle climate change. But at the Cop26""And becoming independent, yes of course, as for all independent countries, it brings with it challenges. But I don't know of a single country that is currently independent that would agree to give up its independence. And I think that probably tells a quite powerful story.""\~\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland154","HIGH-FLYING G HYPOCRITES; COP26 CLIMATE SUMMIT 'Out of touch' VIPs arrive for eco summit on up to 400 private jets","November 2, 2021 Tuesday","Irish Daily Mail","DOZENS of world leaders, business chiefs and eco-activists faced allegations of hypocrisy yesterday for taking private jets or domestic flights to Glasgow while telling the rest of the world to cut their carbon footprint.Culprits included billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Hours after telling delegates at Cop26 that the conference 'can and must mark the beginning of the end' of the climate change catastrophe, Mr Johnson admitted he would fly home to London from Glasgow rather than travel by rail.His revelation came after Mr Bezos's (EURO)56.5million Gulf Stream private jet was pictured landing in Glasgow - flying in from Rome where he had discussed the climate crisis with Prince Charles. Pri- vate jets are the world's highest carbonemitting form of transport.Prince Charles himself was among those who travelled by non-commercial plane after attending the G20 summit in Rome. However, a spokesman for Clarence House said the flight made use of 'sustainable aviation fuel'.Critics said the move showed a 'complete lack of preparedness for the wholesale switch away from fossil fuel cars that we require'.Mr Biden addressed the summit claiming the US 'would lead by the power of example' in the fight against climate change - after driving from Edinburgh to Glasgow in a 20-car motorcade.Mr Biden arrived in Edinburgh yesterday on Air Force One, and was accompanied by three other planes and the Marine One helicopter.On landing, an enormous motorcade including 'the Beast' presidential vehicle, a number of Range Rovers and Chevrolet SUVs carried the presidential party to Glasgow's Scottish Event Campus.If all the vehicles are petrol-run, estimates show they will have pumped out 360kg of carbon over the 40-mile journey. It is estimated the entire journey for the President could generate up to 2.2milmercial lion pounds of carbon. Prince Albert of Monaco and representatives from the Bank of America also used private jets to fly to the conference, while the likes of German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron made use of official government aircraft.It was estimated that as many as 400 private jets arrived for the conference. Conservative predictions suggest the fleet would emit 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in total. Many arrived from cities such as London, Stockholm, Rome and Brussels, which are served by com- routes. Last night Labour's environment spokesman Luke Pollard said world leaders should be 'leading by example'.'People have sympathy for world leaders flying in from the other side of the world but those coming domestically should be coming by train,' he said. 'The idea the Prime Minister will fly home from Cop26 after flying from London to Cornwall for the G7 smacks of being out of touch.'In terms of Mr Bezos, if you want to have credibility in the debate, you have to not only be decarbonising your company, you should be demonstrating your commitment with your own actions, especially when you are one of the richest people on the planet.'Mr Johnson's official spokesman defended the sight of hundreds of private jets flying in, saying it was important for leaders to meet face to face for such important talks. HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ienews@dailymail.ieBelching out fumes, Biden's 20-vehicle motorcade 1. MERCEDES SPRINTER MINIBUS The convoy includes two, both believed to transport members of the press accompanying US president Joe Biden. They emit around 3.75kg of CO2 per mile and get around 14.5 miles per gallon. The average for cars is around 38mpg, research shows. 2. PRESIDENT'S LIMO, AKA 'THE BEAST' The convoy includes two of these Cadillacs: Mr Biden's vehicle and a decoy.Each one reportedly emits around 4kg of carbon per mile - ten times more than an average car.The Beast can achieve a measly eight miles per gallon.3. SECRET SERVICE CHEVROLET SUBURBAN Mr Biden's convoy appears to have at least two of the specially made vehicles.Reports suggest it has a 6.2-litre, V-8 engine which is about 420 horsepower.It achieves about 15-21 miles per gallon, depending on conditions.These are likely to carry secret service and security personnel.4. 2018 JAGUAR With a UK registration, the vehicle is believed to belong to the welcoming British police escorts.The car, thought to be an XJ, emits around 2.75kg of carbon per mile. It has a gas-guzzling three-litre diesel engine.Cleric sorry for Nazi analogy THE Archbishop of Canterbury was forced to apologise yesterday after claiming world leaders who fail to act on climate change could be worse than those who ignored the Nazis.Archbishop Justin Welby, right, suggested politicians who shirked the task of limiting global warming would £llow genocide on an infinitely greater scale' than that committed by Hitler's regime. He later issued an 'unequivocal apology' to Jewish people over the comment, admitting that it was 'not right' to make comparisons with the Nazis.The remark came during an interview with the BBC in which he said that world leaders at the COP26 summit would be 'cursed if they don't get this right'.Asked about his use of the term 'cursed', he said he had 'consciously' used the word, adding: 'People will speak of them in far stronger terms than we speak today of the politicians of the '30s - of the politicians who ignored what was happening in Nazi Germany.'This will kill people... for generations, and we will have no means of averting it.'He later issued an 'unequivocal apology', saying he had been trying to 'emphasise the gravity of the situation facing us at COP26'.US TV network CNN was mocked yesterday for suggesting the summit was happening in Edinburgh, not Glasgow.'I'm now reporting from Edinburgh in Scotland where 20,000 world leaders and delegates have gathered for the COP26 Climate Summit,' wrote presenter Wolf Blitzer alongside a tweeted photo of a temporary studio in the Scottish capital below its famous castle.Opticians Specsavers joined in the onl"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland155","Charles right when he says Cop26 our 'last-chance saloon'; Global climate change summit has future of world in its hands","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","Belfast Telegraph","PRINCE Charles, with characteristic frankness, recently expressed his understanding of why radical climate change campaigners like Insulate Britain take to the streets to demand action.Insulate Britain, a breakaway from Extinction Rebellion, has blocked major motorways in England, causing massive traffic hold-ups and widespread anger from frustrated motorists. While he carefully stressed that blocking roads ""isn't helpful"", the prince understood the frustration of the protesters and insisted they should do things in a way that doesn't alienate people.He said they ""should direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive, rather than destructive"".Prince Charles colourfully described the forthcoming Cop26 Glasgow climate change summit as ""the last-chance saloon"" for the international community.He bluntly stated, if serious action wasn't taken, it would be catastrophic. He added: ""Nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather.""It is refreshing to hear such a passionate warning by a non-politician like Prince Charles on such a critical problem as climate change.His views were well thought out and skilfully expressed. He sensitively reflected on the enormous challenges facing the world and the immediate action required to be taken by governments right across the globe at the Cop26 summit, beginning on Halloween.His timely warning is similar to the intervention by another non-politician, Pope Francis, whose time in office has been marked by his emphasis on what he has termed ""an integral ecology"".His inspirational encyclical, Laudato Si, published in 2015, highlighted his commitment to dealing with the enormous challenges of environmental degradation and global warming.In that seminal document he emphasised the moral duty of Christians, in particular, to cherish the Earth, which God has given to mankind to look after as his stewards.In Rome two weeks ago, together with several other religious leaders, both Christian and non-Christian, Pope Francis signed a joint appeal to the world's governments to commit to ambitious targets at the Cop26 meeting.The pontiff and the other religious leaders jointly declared: ""Care for the environment is a moral imperative to preserve God's creation for future generations.""Sombrely, they warned us: ""We have inherited a garden. We must not leave a desert to our children.""Collectively, the leaders have pressed the need for the developed economies, which in effect have brought about global warming and the subsequent climate emergency, to provide financial support to the most vulnerable economies.But for the ordinary man or woman in the street, though distantly aware of the imminent meeting in Glasgow, the question is: what can be achieved by this much-heralded summit?The simple answer is time is running out, as the window for opportunity for action on climate change is narrowing at an increasing speed.We have all witnessed on our TV screens this year incidents of extreme weather, causing widespread destruction and death across Europe, Asia and America.In August the United Nations published an expert panel report on climate change that concluded there is unequivocal evidence human activity is already changing the world in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described it as ""code red for humanity"".Therefore, is a vital opportunity to make good and build upon the pledges on climate change made at Cop21 in Paris in 2015.Almost 200 nations signed a binding treaty to hold global average temperature rises to well below 2 degrees centigrade, compared to pre-industrial levels, and try to limit rises to 1.5 degrees centigrade.Specific pledges were made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These commitments are acknowledged to be insufficient, therefore it is necessary to revisit them in order to ratchet them upwards. Unfortunately, despite the Paris commitments, greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. The primary aim is to plot a way forward to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.The UK, EU and the US have all pledged to cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030.But other major countries like China, Russia, Australia and India have yet to agree improved reductions.Cop26 are immensely challenging and its success will only be measured by the commitment of states to fulfil their pledges.Meanwhile, the future of the world hangs in the balance. And, as Prince Charles has suggested, we really are in ""the last-chance saloon"".\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland158","COP26 LOFTY TALK IS MUGGED BY MATERIAL SELF-INTERESTS","November 13, 2021 Saturday","Irish Independent","EARLIER this week at , former US president Barack Obama urged young people to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change. On the last day of what was billed as our last opportunity to do something meaningful to rescue our planet, the lamentable efforts of global leaders can only have further fuelled their fury.The planet's rising temperatures, sea levels, droughts and threats of famine have said all that needed to be said. Radical action was required. Not the tepid commitments and scaling back from the high-blown hopes.The ""real green revolution"" needed to halt greenhouse gas emissions, regenerate nature and adapt to the realities of the worsening climate crisis is sadly still awaited.The commitments from governments to stop global average temperatures to rising 1.5C above what they were in the pre-industrial era seem insufficient.Most damning of all, they argued the level of business interests represented at the summit amounted to ""corporate capture"". The conference, they conclude, was undermined.The softening of resolve to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely was clearly disappointing. Just as the arguments over how much money rich nations owe poorer ones for contaminating Earth's atmosphere were depressing.But haggling over how often to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the UN was downright disgraceful by governments in the last chance saloon as the clock ticks down.Given past experience, expectations of delivering the sweeping deal demanded were arguably too high. Past promises on climate change and declarations should have prepared us for the yawning chasm between intention and implementation.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had set the bar for world leaders to make progress.What must be done, he said, was to find a way to move the world closer to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. But such a goal seems highly unlikely.""The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging - but they are far from enough,"" a deflated Mr Guterres said.If Glasgow will be remembered for anything it may be for the fact the world's two biggest emitters - the United States and China - banded together to declare their joint commitment to reach a deal. Time will tell, After all the lofty talk, the poetry of the prime ministers' and presidents' speeches of the opening days was brought down to earth with a bang in the flat prose of technical groups. The opportunity to do something meaningful was mugged as material self-interests asserted themselves.And what might have been a showcase for the spirit of global solidarity was reduced to another well-intentioned grand pageant.Academics' open letter deemed the much trumpeted Glasgow summit to be a 'failure'\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland165","COP26 countries struggle to find compromise on funding; :: 'We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us'","November 12, 2021 Friday","Irish Independent","THE COP26 climate talks enter their final day with vulnerable countries determined not to let negotiations close without agreement on substantial funding from rich nations.Disagreements over finance stalled progress yesterday, with the attitude of the US and Europe both coming in for criticism from the global south.Among the issues in dispute were the fulfilment of a decade-old pledge to guarantee a high level of annual adaptation funding to help countries climate-proof their economies and infrastructure.The fund moved closer to the $100bn-a-year target during these talks, but the text of a draft agreement calls for that to be scaled up urgently.Disagreement over separate funding for 'loss and damage', which would provide emergency relief and rebuilding funds after climate-related disasters, was more entrenched.Dr Saleelmul Huq of the Bangladesh delegation said rich countries would have to be ""shamed"" into accepting their responsibilities for building their economies on fossil fuels now putting developing nations in peril.""In Bangladesh we have 10 times bigger floods but nothing to pay for loss and damage. In Europe they are paying for their own citizens but not for ours.""Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan agreed the loss and damage issue was causing difficulties. However, he said Ireland's position was that while loss and damage should be funded, a separate funding structure would involve unnecessary replication of bureaucracy.He said some ideas in circulation in the negotiations around how funding could be provided included giving poor countries access to 'special drawing rights' from the International Monetary Fund so they did not have to resort to expensive borrowing.Multiple strands of negotiations were continuing last night, with more fresh draft agreement texts due before a meeting of ministers from all nations at 11am this morning.Aside from finance, the inclusion of a commitment to enhanced efforts on mitigation - cutting emissions to stem global temperature rise - was also causing tensions.It emerged that at one point, a group of 22 nations who are part of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, which includes China and India, proposed deleting the entire section on mitigation in protest that developing countries were being asked to make the same percentage emissions cuts as rich nations.Talks president Alok Sharma said in his last press conference of the day: ""We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us.""Another sticking point was the proposed commitment to phase out fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies.Large oil, gas and coal producing countries want to keep supplying the fuels while attempting to offset emissions with technology or natural solutions.Mr Ryan, who earlier in the day signed Ireland up to become a founding member of the new Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, said the phaseout text needed to stay in.""I think it's vital that we do keep that language in,"" he said. ""How can we be subsidising something that's edging us closer to the abyss?""That language has to remain strong.""COP26 venue this morning.\l"

Climate change is already a reality in all parts of the world. If we are to leave a habitable planet to future generations we must act now.'The challenge is big, but I have faith in the capacity of humans to work together to overcome it. Science is leading the way. Leaders must put the right policies in place, as we are doing in Ireland.'I also hope that COP26 will see a real step forward in climate finance, supporting the most vulnerable countries. The transition must deliver climate justice - nobody should be left behind.'US president Joe Biden and Indian PM Narendra Modi are among the major figures due to take part.But, in a sign of the global divisions on the issue, the leaders of several major polluting nations have turned down invitations. China's president Xi Jinping, Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro are among the big names who will be missing. And a hoped-for deal to phase out the construction of new coal-fired power stations by 2030 fell apart. Major coal users including China, India, Australia andRussia are said to have blocked the deal.As Ireland faces into a further carbon budget on Thursday, the Taoiseach is facing growing internal unease over the reality of the climate change programme as distinct to the promises.In a politically embarrassing development, two former senior ministers have issued scathing denunciations of the Coalition's much-touted Just Transition policy.The Just Transition is a flagship initiative to deal with the closure of the peat and power industries which are believed to have cost over 2,500 jobs in the Midlands.But former constituency foes Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael and Barry Cowen from Fianna F\'e1il have united to sharply criticise the failure to implement any of the grand schemes, with Mr Flanagan claiming significant elements of the scheme are a 'fiction'.The Government claimed more than (EURO)244million would be allocated for projects in the Midlands including a (EURO)108million Bord na M\'f3na peatlands restoration project to facilitate the move from £ brown to green economy', (EURO)77million from the EU Just Transition Fund and (EURO)20million to the Midlands retrofitting programme. An indignant Barry Cowen told the Taoiseach and Environment Minister Eamon Ryan that spending to date was just (EURO)166,000.Mr Cowen told the Taoiseach: 'Not one job has yet been created from the Just Transition fund to assist communities affected by the phasing out of peat for electricity generation.'Mr Cowen said he was furious at 'the ridiculously slow, poorly administered and apparent inept governance' of the programme to date'.Former foreign affairs minister Mr Flanagan said: 'A thousand jobs were initially lost directly fromBord na M\'f3na and the ESB and a further thousand lost indirectly. It is impossible to quantify hundreds of seasonal workers from small farmers.'Mr Flanagan said: 'Frankly, some of the money is a fiction. It is only drawn down if there are matching funds and struggling rural communities don't have those funds.'Unease is also growing over Government claims that climate change targets will be met by a stabilisation of the national herd rather than a cull.Independent TD Michael Healy Rae colourfully dismissed this on the Week in Politics, noting: 'The Government talking about stabilising the national herd is like people talking about reconfiguration of the health service. That means cuts and stabilisation also means cuts.' HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ienews@dailymail.ie'Nobody should be left behind' 'Some of the money is a fiction'\l"

When the predicted, dreaded apocalypse occurs, the vast majority of the human race will have to battle for survival. The time for the haves and have-nots to fight for climate justice is now.While billionaires like Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos can easily pay for space explorations, their interest and investment in other habitable planets needs our close attention. It could be that their gigantic egos of being part of the 'billionaire club' allow them to do so while thousands of their workers struggle to make ends meet, or perhaps they know something we don't. These ""space vacations"" promoted of late, bring to mind the movie, Don't Look Up.Climate justice used to be viewed as something of an attention-seeking, elitist, opportunistic 'hobby' by a wealthy minority of the world's leaders, countries and corporations. Many of whom were actually drivers of climate change. They would see Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a threat. It is common knowledge that those most devastatingly affected by climate change are from minoritised disadvantaged communities. They also tend to be least responsible for causing the catastrophic change.The harmful effects on minoritised communities renders the fight to stop climate change a matter of life and death. It remains uncertain how it should be stopped and who should take what action to stop it. Just ahead of Earth Day (this Friday), a focus on how international climate justice might be prioritised seems apt.Events like Cyclone Idai and Cyclone Kenneth, which devastatedMozambique in 2019 are one example.There have been severe droughts, and floods, and millions of people around the world are suffering. This has left millions of people seeking humanitarian aid even though they had no act nor part in the causes of the extreme changes that devastated their lives.Climate justice means different things to different people, but at its core is the recognition that those who are disproportionately impacted by climate change are not those most responsible for causing it. But it is not only an environmental problem: it intersects with social systems, privilege and embedded injustices, and it affects people of different class, race, gender, geography and generation unequally.The climate solutions proposed by climate justice advocates aim to address long-standing systemic injustices. Since its negotiation in the UN Climate Convention in the 1990s, climate justice has been on the radar of member countries but it was only vaguely mentioned in the Paris Agreement, where it notes ""the importance for some of the concept of climate justice"".However, climate justice is not just a concept as it is heavily interlinked with historical injustices of slavery and colonialism, which answers the question of who bears responsibility for how climate change should be stopped, and who should take what action to stop it?Climate justice, like all social and racial justice movements, both past and present, will continue to unearth centuries-old injustices.As we have witnessed, justice is attained not only through political discussions at summits, but through awareness, and action, at all levels. It is about more than discussions on who should cut emissions.The powerful global community must accept the bitter and inconvenient truth that poverty in global south countries is due to colonisation. This is because so much of the vital raw materials and natural resources were - and continue to be - taken from these countries by industrialised nations.When the twin cyclones of Idai and Kenneth hit Mozambique in 2019, the country was forced to take a loan from the International Monetary Fund, adding to its already large national debt. Instead, Mozambique should have been allowed to avail of the $100bn ((EURO)92.5bn) - ""the grand bargain"" of the Paris Agreement - pledged to global south countries a year, from 2020 onwards, to help tackle climate change. Climate justice in this case would take into account the ongoing legacies of colonialism with Portugal and Britain. The two countries would recognise their responsibilities and pay reparations, thus leaving Mozambique debt-free.But invariably, the debate over who should take what action gets bogged down in politics.The UN climate summits aim to make resolutions and find equitable solutions for climate action and justice. But richer countries often refuse to take accountability for their enormous amounts of emissions despite the devastation they cause on less powerful nations. In 2020, the US exited the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The move had been announced by the Trump administration in 2017.At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference summit (COP26)in Glasgow, Alok Sharma, the president for COP26, offered an emotional apology after a last-minute package was agreed, with changes to its wording on coal.A key commitment to ""phase out"" coal was changed to ""phase down"" after China and India led opposition to it. Sharma announced how ""deeply sorry"" he was for the way the negotiations had ended.The longer political leaders shift their positions to collectively hold global warming to ""well below"" 2C and ""pursue efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C as per the Paris Agreement, the longer all forms of injustices will persist. There is no single way to define, let alone champion, climate justice. We have to get to a point of recognition that it is in all of our interests and ally ourselves with other social justice movements.Only when we reach a point where every human being lives a life of dignity - recognising we cannot all afford that space shuttle ticket off planet Earth - will we have achieved climate justice. There is no single way to define, let alone champion, climate justice. We have to get to a point of recognition that it is in all of our interests and ally with other social justice efforts\l"

Those negotiations will be taking place against a backdrop of several planned large demonstrations, with smaller and impromptu protests also gaining momentum.As leaders departed yesterday afternoon and evening, a section of an Extinction Rebellion protest, that had earlier held up traffic in the city, managed to get within several hundred metres of the talks venue and stage a sit-down protest.Many other smaller protests seeking to highlight carbon pollution, biodiversity loss, ecosystem destruction and human rights abuses also took place outside the venue and around central Glasgow. Extensive preparations have been made to deal with unrest around the event, with 10,000 police officers on duty in the city each day and road closures and barricades in use on approach routes.The largest protest is planned for Saturday as part of a global day of action on climate which will be replicated around the world.Protests will be taking place in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, with 39 Irish groups pledging participation, including a large number of environmental groups, trade unions, student unions, teachers' organisations, the National Women's Council, political parties and lawyers.The demonstrations are being held to keep the pressure on governments as the COP26 talks continue, with campaigners warning the commitments signalled so far would still not go far enough to prevent runaway global temperature rise.\l"

That pathway, in the form of a ""Glasgow pact"", would allow for future updates to emissions pledges in the next few years that could be sufficient for the world to stay within scientific advice on carbon levels.A UN official said: ""We are not going to get to a 45% reduction, but there must be some level of contributions on the table to show the downward trend of emissions.""A British spokesperson said: "" will not deliver all that we want $(on emissions$)."" However, Britain, charged as host with delivering a successful outcome, is hoping progress will be made on other issues, including phasing out of coal, climate finance for poor countries, and the protection of forests.A US official said countries must still aim as high as possible on emissions cuts: ""No one in the administration wants to admit defeat before we have made the maximum effort. You should set an ambitious agenda and may have to, in the end, take baby steps, but you should plan for long strides.""Climate economist Nicholas Stern said falling short on emissions plans should not be equated with failure.""I agree with $(the UN$) and most observers that we will not close that gap $(between emissions pledges and scientific advice$) completely,"" he said. ""But we should hope for good progress in closing that gap and we should hope for mechanisms and ways forward on how we close that gap further between now and 2025. That's the way we should think about what is a good, or better, or worse result -- a language of success or failure doesn't seem to me to be very helpful.""At the Paris climate summit in December 2015, 196 nations agreed to hold global temperature rises to ""well below 2C"", with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. However, the pledges they brought to Paris did not fulfil either goal, and would have led to heating of at least 3C.For that reason, the French hosts wrote into the agreement a ""ratchet mechanism"", which would require countries to return to the negotiating table every five years with fresh targets to meet the temperature goals.\l"

Other countries across Europe have had the same experience and a joint plan could be a huge carbonsaving move across the EU. agreement would leave the goal of limiting rising temperatures to 1.5C in 'mortal peril' as negotiators battled over the final text.The summit in Glasgow had been due to end last night, but went into extra time as countries clashed over the wording around fossil fuels and a blame game broke out.A pledge that richer nations will give the poorest countries (EURO)87billion a year to adapt to climate change also appears to have been watered down, with Ireland among those developed countries that were refusing to sign up to the original wording.Scientists say that restricting warming to 1.5C is crucial to avoid devastating climate change which will wreak havoc on the world.But a draft agreement published yesterday evening made little movement towards meeting that goal.Various countries including Saudi Arabia, Australia, China, the US and Russia were blamed for holding back progress on different areas.Angry activists marched through the conference centre yesterday, while island nations painted a bleak picture of what further global warming meant for them.The draft text ran into issues over ending the world's dependence on coal and fossil fuels - mention of which has never made it into a COP document before.While an earlier draft of the text called on countries to £ccelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel', a new version appeared to have been watered down.The new text added that nations accelerate the phase out of 'unabated' coal power and of 'inefficient' subsidies - a far lower bar.While negotiators were applauded for getting a reference to coal and fossil fuel subsidies into the text, fierce pushback is expected and the words may not make it into the final text.Countries are also 'requested' rather than 'urged' to strengthen their 2030 targets by next year, triggering a row over which word was stronger.Another area under negotiation is a bid to force countries to return in a year to toughen their current commitments.At present, they are expected to return in 2025 - a date that campaigners say is not soon enough.However, there is more included in the draft on finance for poorer countries to adapt with climate change and a request for all nations to strengthen their plans for cutting emissions up to 2030 by the end of next year.British prime minister Boris Johnson said the goal of the UN conference was to 'keep 1.5C alive' however, experts have warned that current pledges would mean 2.4C of warming. Mr Johnson warned yesterday.: 'What needs to happen now is that people need to understand that the deal that's on the table - the so-called cover decision - that is the text.'We either find away of agreeing it or I'm afraid 'We risk blowing it'.

'It did not move for one hour... and [looked] exhausted,' Mr Singh told the BBC.COP26 EXPLAINED: WHAT HAS IT ACHIEVED?Q&A What is COP26's goal? THE 196-nation summit's aim is to 'keep 1.5C alive'- referring to the COP21 conference in Paris six years ago, at which national leaders agreed to 'pursue efforts' to curb global temperature rises to 1.5C by cutting greenhouse gas emissions .What does the deal say? THE current text calls for 'rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions', including reducing CO2 emissions 'by 45% by 2030'.It also calls for the phasing out of 'unabated' coal power and of 'inefficient' subsidies - a or fossil fuels'. However, there is a special allowance for countries with carbon capture technology which can suck CO2 out of the air and store it underground.Specific language criticising fossil fuels has never appeared before in the final text from a UN climate conference. If the wording survives, the UK team running COP26 believes that will count as a success.The draft text calls for cuts to methane emissions and more aid for nations hit by warming. Can we limit global warming to 1.5C? YES, but pledges at the summit to cut emissions will still let global warming rise by 2.4C. The Earth is 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial levels. Experts project that 2.4C warming would lead to more extreme weather, rising sea levels, the loss of almost all the world's coral reefs, deadly heatwaves, drought, increasing wildfires and catastrophic food shortages as result of widespread crop failures.How will we get to 1.5C? IF the deal is accepted, nations must pledge further cuts next year. While the problem will not have been finally cracked in Glasgow, it will be a big step along the way. However, even a 1.5C rise will have severe impacts. What else is agreed? THE US and China agreed to work together to l imi t global temperature rise to 1.5C. More than 100 leaders promised to reverse deforestation by 2030, including Brazil. The US and EU created a global partnership to cut methane emissions by 2030. More than 40 countries committed to move away from coal - but not big users such as China and the US.The sticking points? BRITAIN and others want more ambitious targets. Developing countries want more money to help them adapt to the impacts of global warming and to develop renewable power sources such as wind and solar rather than cheap coal-fired plants.Why make rich nations pay to help poor ones? POORER nations argue that the First World grew rich on cheap power from coal, oil and gas, the use of which must now be stopped or limited.What is not in the deal?

For Boris Johnson, it was a tipping point that will push the world towards more ambitious goals, and more than that, it was ""global Britain in action"".""We will build on the historic Glasgow climate pact, which calls for countries to do better next year - accelerating the five-year cycle set out in the Paris Agreement. We will push for more ambitious goals, stronger plans and better implementation, and so we further narrow that gap to 1.5 degrees,"" Johnson told the Lord Mayor's Banquet in London this week.Most delegates in Glasgow agreed that Sharma did a good job as Cop26 president, using modest, quiet but assiduous diplomacy to shepherd almost 200 countries towards a shared final text. When he choked up on the podium as he apologised for a last-minute change in the text, representatives from states large and small applauded him because they believed he had done his best to keep his promises and to maintain a transparent process. But it was on the floor of the plenary hall that a true picture of global power emerged as huddles formed around the representatives of the US, the EU and China. All three powers bear responsibility for the inadequacy of the final agreement: China for its last-minute demand that coal should be ""phased down"" rather than phased out; the US because of its mean-spirited refusal to agree to meaningful compensation for poorer countries already suffering the effects of climate change caused by rich nations, and the EU for the poverty of its ambition in the negotiations.But there was no question in Glasgow of any initiative gaining traction without the support of two out of three of the big powers and once the final text had the support of the US, China and the EU other countries fell into l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland187","Johnson unveils climate strategy ahead of Cop26","October 20, 2021 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Boris Johnson has promised to boost the expansion of electric cars, subsidise householders to switch from gas boilers to low carbon alternatives and develop new green technologies in order to reach net zero by 2050. Less than a fortnight before he hosts the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow, the prime minister published a 368-page strategy paper outlining how Britain will reach that goal. He said the plan would put Britain ahead of other countries in green technology and would unlock \£390 billion (EUR 107 billion) of private investment and secure 440,000 jobs by 2030. ""The UK's path to ending our contribution to climate change will be paved with well-paid jobs, billions in investment and thriving green industries - powering our green industrial revolution across the country. By moving first and taking bold action, we will build a defining competitive edge in electric vehicles, offshore wind, carbon capture technology and more, whilst supporting people and businesses along the way,"" he said. The strategy promises \£3120 million to develop new nuclear technologies including small reactors that can be built and assembled more quickly than large-scale nuclear plants. Two sites have been earmarked for carbon capture and storage and the government will invest in hydrogen projects. Car manufacturers will be obliged to sell more electric vehicles and the network of charging stations will be expanded. Householders will be offered a \£35,000 grant to replace gas boilers with heat pumps but the \£3450 million allocated for the programme will fund only 90,000 grants. The treasury said the measures would require more public spending but the biggest impact on public finances would come from the loss of tax revenues on fossil fuel-related activity. It warned that the gap would have to be funded by new taxes. ""If there is to be additional public spending, the government may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably, and consistently with the government's fiscal principles,"" it said. ""Seeking to pass the costs onto future taxpayers through borrowing would deviate from the 'polluter pays' principle, would not be consistent with intergenerational fairness nor fiscal sustainability, and could blunt incentives. This could also push up the economic cost of the transition."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said the plan had been ""torpedoed"" by the treasury, leaving it inadequate for the green transition demanded by the climate crisis. ""Homeowners are left to face the costs of insulation on their own, industries like steel and hydrogen are left hobbled in the global race without the support they need, and the government cannot even confirm they will meet their climate target for 2035,"" he said. ""While Labour has a bold climate investment pledge of \£328 billion extra each and every year to 2030, the government offers a tiny fraction of that. This does not meet our ambitions for British industries to thrive, prosper and lead the world or show the government leadership required to tackle climate breakdown and bring the benefits of a green transition to Britain."" \l"

A lot rides on whether the US Congress will pass key infrastructure and budget bills that would set clean power and transportation goals and unleash trillions in spending.US Congress members from Biden's Democratic party have been negotiating about the bills, with some opposed to the price tag and climate measures. Biden needs solid Democratic support because the measures are opposed by Republican lawmakers.Energy Innovation, a California based research group, said these bills, if combined with state policies and executive action, could set the United States on a path to achieve its 2030 target.Obama, during his first term as president in 2009, travelled to Copenhagen where he helped directly intervened in climate summit negotiations with other world leaders that resulted in an agreement that for the first time called emission pledges by all major economies, not just industrialised nations. - Reuters\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland197","Ryan confident Cop26 will end with agreement; Summit sends message to Ireland about direction world is moving in, says Minister","November 13, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","Minister for the Environment and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has expressed confidence that Cop26 will end with an agreement that keeps alive the goal of limiting global warming since the industrial revolution to below 1.5 degrees. Speaking to reporters in Glasgow yesterday as the summit ran over its scheduled time and delegates continued to negotiate, Mr Ryan said he believed the final text would be reasonably ambitious. ""My sense of the negotiations is they're not in a bad place because the ambition is not being scaled back. Certain things are slightly weakened, but it's not fundamentally been weakened."" Mr Ryan acknowledged that the commitments made in Glasgow were not enough to reach the target of 1.5 degrees even if they were fulfilled, but he hoped the meeting would help to accelerate movement towards that goal. He said he understood why many of the activists outside the conference centre were angry and disappointed by the summit's failure to agree on more radical steps to reach the 1.5 degrees target. ""There's always an issue about political science as well as climate science, not just like in our own country but in every country. How do you get people to change their livelihoods? ""I was talking to the Indian transport minister as an example of this the other day, and he said 'I have 30 million people working in transport in the current system. How am I going to switch them?' That's a reality as well. And those people in climate justice are absolutely right. They say you have to have a just transition, but that's a reality. That's why you have to get 200 countries together and then each country and the government has to get re-elected while doing this, and that is a real challenge,"" he said. 'Change is difficult' ""If we'd started this 20 years ago we'd have been in a very much easier glide path but we didn't. Why didn't we? Because change is difficult. People, particularly those whose livelihoods are connected to the current system, are nervous about change."" Mr Ryan said that among the most valuable outcomes from Cop26 was the message it sent to people in Ireland about the direction the world was moving in and what would be required for success. ""In my mind the most important thing is that there's a clear message and a clear understanding to everyone: okay, this is the way the world is going. That's what you need out of it, it's kind of a signal to everyone at home that this is where we go now."" European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans suggested that the EU could offer more funding to help poorer countries deal with the impact of climate change and fund the changes they need to make. However, Kevin Conrad, chief negotiator for Papua New Guinea, said the EU's rhetoric was not matched by its actions. ""The European Union makes grand statements about commitment to adaptation, commitment to a lot of things, but when you look in the text they are part of the group that is unwinding anything solid when it comes to commitments or anything that is automatic in terms of contributions,"" he said. ""It's nice to talk about something, but unless a developing country feels certainty that they are going to be helped it's just words."" US climate envoy John Kerry told the summit that the 20 countries that account for 80 per cent of the world's emissions had the greatest responsibility and must live up to it. ""Climate change is an existential threat today and people are dying today. All around the world the impacts are being felt today. We have to live up to the expectations of young people that don't want this to just be a place of words. It has to be in the next hour a place of action."" \l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland198","Cop26 Diary: Work together to avoid 'more blah blah blah'","Irish Examiner"," ","A group of local primary school children, accompanied by their parents, holding up hand-drawn signs.A young girl draws a sign for me, pencil on a notebook, an eye. The eyes of the world indeed are on Glasgow during these two weeks. ""We should not be here"", a sign reads, ""Unfk our future!"", another. It expresses what many young people feel: Fear for their future - and in many places, the present - and the knowledge that something needs to happen now. ""Change is possible, Covid showed us that"", a young man from the US tells me.A series of speakers take their turn on stage. The variety of their contributions illustrate how large, wide-reaching, and complex the issue of climate change is. Inequalities experienced in other social issues are also reflected in attempts to address climate change: Poorer communities are more excluded and more strongly affected; globally the less industrialised regions of the world in the global south, with the least CO2 emissions are most strongly impacted by climate change.Last to speak, Greta Thunberg takes the stage and-criticising the lack of real impact of previous COPs and pledgesThe scene inside the Scottish Event Centre is quite different: Hustling and bustling to the point of being nearly overwhelming, but also very much activity, discussions, negotiations, and business. There are about 2,000 official country delegates, party members, and observers from different NGOs - from UN Climate Networks to Universities - are trying to find their way to the different side events, meetings, and discussions. There is a good amount of youth representation, too, for the first time in the history of COP events.Those involved in the negotiations have a bit over one week remaining to agree on what will be a historic decision, for better or worse.It's been a very busy week, and what has been achieved is significant: The combined effect of the commitment by India to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 and the pledge to cut methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030, signed by over 100 countries (including Ireland) were both important.Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas emitted from oil and gas fields, from landfilled rubbish and from agriculture. The good news is that, as it only stays in the atmosphere for a relatively short time, the warming process can be slowed quite quickly and effectively by reducing methane.Similar pledges have been made to phase out coal, and to stop deforestation. Significant contributions have been made towards the previously agreed commitment of $ 100bn ((EURO)86bn) per year from wealthier countries in climate financing to aid poorer countries to support their efforts to reduce emissions. Despite these achievements, the race for the necessary greenhouse gas reductions to limit global warming to 1.5C will be a close one. The latest estimates are that the combined effect of the pledges may get us to 1.8C (quite a shift from the 2.7C reported before COP26).Of course, these pledges need to be translated into national legislation - in a fair way - and then implemented. For this to work out, we need to think globally, and act locally.Although Ireland is a small country, our national greenhouse gas emissions are among the highest in Europe. If the countries in similar situations work on this too, we can achieve a significant amount in greenhouse gas reductions.And we need both aspects - communities and policies - to work together.If this doesn't happen, COP 26 will be just, as Greta put it, more 'blah blah blah'.

The point of this global summit is to get those nailed down and add an accountability mechanism that locks them in.I have heard someone say Glasgow will not be a ""Eureka"" moment, it will be a meeting that leads to more meetings.The rallying call coming into this summit was ""Paris set the target, Glasgow must deliver"".But what will it deliver? Well, it will depend on the final text of the communique.But going on the draft, which is the basis for negotiations, it will attempt to secure deeper emissions' cuts than have already been pledged.It will also try to increase the cash available for developing countries to transition out of fossil fuel dependency and adapt to the climate impacts they are already suffering from.And for the first time there is talk of compensation for countries - like the small island states here - who are watching their land mass being surrendered to rising seas.Getting the finance deal right here will be crucial. It greases the wheels of all the other parts.If you are India and dependant on coal for power, how do you move out of fossil fuels if you can not afford an alternative fuel mix?If you are a low-lying island and you can not afford to build sea defences, what choice do you have other than to begin to abandon your homeland? HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/Latest Climate newsThe truth is that the money being talked about here for this kind of work is peanuts. The UN talks in terms of providing billions. The emerging and vulnerable countries say it will take trillions.It seems an unbridgeable gap.A senior politician from the island state of Tuvalu - a low lying Pacific Island, addressed the COP conference up to his knees in seawater to make a powerful point about rising sea levels. Where he stood had once been dry land.And that is the thing about COP. For developed northern hemisphere nations this is mostly about the financial implications of eradicating fossil fuels - the bedrock of thriving economies.For the global south, it is often about life and death of citizens and like Tuvalu, the destruction of an entire way of life.On the way to the conference centre one morning, we shared a taxi with a couple of delegates and got chatting.Wanjira Mathai is vice president and regional director Africa of the World Resources Institute.She is also what is called a Friend of COP26, one of a body of people who advise COP President Alok Sharma.And she has a big focus on developed countries, which caused global warming, living up to their responsibilities to those who are suffering from it. Vulnerable countries and indigenous people have a right not to have to carry the financial burden of trying to adapt, she says.""Anchored on this process is trust. If we lose the trust, then we lose everything. The negotiating process has trust as one of the biggest casualties if we do not make good on some of those commitments,"" she said.She says the key things from Glasgow will be technically dense, difficult to explain, and ultimately very important.For her, it is back to the issue of trust. It is building a system of reporting and measuring emissions that's transparent and where everyone is working to the same timeframe, instead of the pick and mix approach which appears to hold now.That gives countries confidence that everyone is on a level playing field - not hiding behind some impervious accounting mechanism which allows polluters to pull a fast one and gain an economic advantage.As the talks continued into Friday night, it started to feel like everyone was looking for a soft landing.This is a process based on consensus, and with 197 parties to the treaty to placate, we can but imagine the shuttle diplomacy involved into the small hours.A diplomatic source suggested that people were a little confused about the purpose of Glasgow. It was not to negotiate a new treaty, they said, it was to finalise the implementation of the one agreed at Paris in 2015.What countries had committed to was coming forward with targets for cutting emissions out to 2030 with the aim of limiting global warming.They saw some positives, promises from countries which had not publicly agreed a position before.And ofcourse the early slew of pledges on cutting methane, coal and ending deforestation.There is spin in all this of course. The people who have invested so much political capital in this summit want to be able to be hail it a success.Set against that is the climate experts who have been pointing out that the cuts do not go anywhere near far enough to meet the Paris targets of keeping warming well below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C.So now it falls to bank the Glasgow wins - some very important - and build on them for the next COP. The EU's Frans Timmermans, its chief climate negotiator, has said the intention is that new emissions reductions brought forward in the near future will mean the path to 1.5C of warming is still alive.That would mean the world to Tuvalu and other threatened nations. But they will be looking for product from the developed countries not more promises.\l"

Could these five-yearly festivals of disappointment, where agreements fall short both in ambition and execution, still be the world's best hope of avoiding climate catastrophe? At a demonstration in Glasgow last week, she said that change would not come from inside the conference centre and that it was on the streets that real leadership was to be found. ""We say no more blah blah blah, no more exploitation of people and nature and the planet. No more exploitation. No more blah blah blah. No more whatever the f they are doing inside there,"" she said. It's not easy, even from inside the conference centre, to work out ""whatever the f they are doing"" and the most important meetings happen behind closed doors and beyond deepening layers of security. The venue itself is a study in alienation, so vast that one German journalist noted that his daily step count was higher than during a walking holiday in the summer. Social distancing and hygiene measures that are a throwback to the early months of the coronavirus pandemic add to the atmosphere of discomfort and awkwardness. A shortage of chairs and desks sees delegates, activists and reporters sitting on the floor of cold, hangar-like spaces, or perched on the sides of tables as they peer into their laptops. By the end of the second week, everyone looks seven years older than they did at the beginning, nobody has tasted a fresh vegetable since October and the mood has curdled. Billboards around the conference centre show images of pristine snow or solar panels with the single word ""now"", which is precisely when most of the people who pass them would like to go home. Those billboards capture something of the curious spirit of climate negotiations, which are dominated by abstract language even as they focus on concrete actions to prevent real catastrophe. Ask one of the participants what they hope the conference will produce and they will say something like ""solidarity, credibility and ambition"". Mood shift Key concepts such as mitigation (reducing greenhouse gases), adaptation (making infrastructure more resilient to the impact of climate change) and loss and damage (compensation for damage caused by climate-related events such as storms and flooding) remain obscure to most outsiders. Even the central goal of ""keeping 1.5 alive"" is little understood (it means ensuring that the global temperature does not rise by more than 1.5 degrees compared with the middle of the 19th century). There is no established rule for how decisions are made at climate conferences but the practice is that they are taken by consensus, which means that the pace can be set by the least willing. The British presidency of Cop26 sought to circumvent this by starting the conference with a series of multinational announcements on forests, methane emissions and finance. But after the leaders left Glasgow early last week and the negotiations moved into a more technical phase, the initial mood of confidence gave way first to frustration and later to pessimism. It was clear by the middle of this week that the summit's participants would not be able to agree on commitments that would bring them anywhere close to 1.5 degrees and attention turned to securing an agreement to meet again in a year or two with improved offers of action at a national level. Meanwhile, scientific experts and climate activists have pointed out that there is less to some of the summit's most high-profile announcements than meets the eye. A commitment to end deforestation by 2030 restates a goal first identified at a summit in 2014, a methane emissions pledge was already announced two months ago and state-controlled companies such as Coal India and Saudi Aramco could evade curbs on coal and oil. But this year's deforestation pledge is different because big players such as Brazil and Indonesia have signed up to it, and the initiative on methane backed by the US and the European Union has the support of more than 100 countries. Separately, the US and China - the world's two biggest carbon emitters - have agreed to co-operate on ""concrete and pragmatic"" regulations to decarbonise, cut methane emissions and fight deforestation. As it entered its final hours, Cop26 looked unlikely to resolve disagreements over how a carbon trading system should work but the summit saw other initiatives to direct financial markets away from fossil fuels and towards clean technology. Like all its predecessors, Cop26 will be a disappointment, delivering too little too slowly and with inadequate mechanisms to guarantee that promises are kept. But if today's situation is compared with that in Paris six years ago rather than with an ideal scenario, there are grounds for modest optimism. It was pressure from small island states in Paris that pushed the industrialised countries to consider shifting their goal from 2 degrees to 1.5 degrees. In Glasgow, the more ambitious goal has been at the centre of the negotiations and it is accepted by most participants as essential. Emissions have been falling in some developed countries, even if they continue to rise elsewhere and China's will continue to increase for a number of years before peaking by 2030. National plans to cut emissions may not go far enough but they are more ambitious than before and many, such as Ireland's, are enshrined in law. Among the most important changes has been in the attitude of the financial sector, which will not only make financing harmful industries more difficult and expensive but demonstrates that the world of finance recognises the political imperative of dealing with climate change. What has happened since Paris and been accelerated in Glasgow is nothing less than a reorientation of global capitalism towards a carbon neutral future. Economic actors led by the US, China and the EU will make the shift in different ways and at a different pace but the change of direction and increase of urgency are unmistakable. And that amounts to more than blah blah blah. \l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland205","Hurtling towards our own self-destruction","Irish Examiner"," ","Good scientists aren't prone to hyperbole, typically detesting media sensationalism and anti-intellectual rhetoric, so when some of the world's finest minds say we're hurtling towards self-destruction, it's worth paying attention.This isn't the first rodeo for the hundreds of scientists across the world forming the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). How long, how long must they sing their song, before world leaders and the public listen to their grim words?The planet has already passed the point of no return for some of the effects of climate change and has a narrow window to avoid even further pain for billions of people.While to some it may sound like sensationalism and doom-mongering, the 34,000 cited references in theIPCC report put together by professors, doctors, and other experts tell a different story - this is pure science. IPCC co-chair Professor Debra Roberts said: ""Our report clearly indicates that places where people live and work may cease to exist, that ecosystems and species that we've all grown up with and that are central to our cultures and inform our languages may disappear.""Academia, for all its faults, has no time for sentiment - the conclusions are based on cold, clear, and unambiguous evidence.""Increased heatwaves, droughts, and floods are already exceeding plants' and animals' tolerance thresholds, driving mass mortalities in species such as trees and corals.""These weather extremes are occurring simultaneously, causing cascading impacts that are increasingly difficult to manage. They have exposed millions of people to acute food and water insecurity, especially in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, on small islands and in the Arctic,"" the IPCC says in its latest findings.Bear in mind, this is less than eight months since its previously grim projections of passing 1.5C global warming, and less than four months since world leaders at Glasgow's Cop26 climate change summit pledged to co-operate to radically reduce global emissions in the coming decades.How long, how long must they sing their song?Cop26, we have a US Congress strangled by political posturing from a maddeningly anti-science Republican Party, and a ruling Democratic party held to ransom by two of its own senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who are blocking President Joe Biden's already weakened climate mitigation package from passing into legislation.In Europe, we are seeing emissions return to almost pre-pandemic levels and, closer to home, there has been no consensus on tackling emissions from agriculture in Ireland because of the political fallout.More pressingly, the IPCC report this week must fight for every inch of newspaper space and every minute of television time due to the actions of a reckless Russian president in his neighbouring Ukraine.Poignantly, the tragedy of Ukrainian refugees will be replicated over and over again in the future as communities all over the world are forced from their lands because of a force even more powerful than Russian tanks and mortars - the force of climate change.It is also sad that Russia's dominant position when it comes to oil and gas has emboldened President Vladimir Putin's imperial ambitions, gambling that he would ride out the storm geopolitically because of the West's reliance on fossil fuel.If environmental factors weren't reason enough to strive for a renewable energy future, then geopolitical reasons have now bolstered the case.Unfortunately, the perilous change in climate doesn't hang around for political cycles. It doesn't stop for peace talks or ceasefires.Hurricanes don't take breaks to go campaigning, monsoon rains don't stop for election day.Climate change just marches on, growing stronger from the insidious energy that humans feed it.It's the people living on it, and the animals and creatures that most of us profess to love and cherish.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland211","Challenges face leaders in bid to deliver 'successful' Cop26","Irish Examiner"," ","As the clock ticks down to the start of , the challenges facing efforts to deliver action to avert dangerous climate change are coming into sharp focus.The summit, taking place in Glasgow from tomorrow, has no global treaty to agree - unlike the last major UN climate conference in Paris in 2015.But it is being described as the conference that must deliver on the Paris Agreement and its key pledge to limit global warming to well below 2C or 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.The talks come in the wake of ""code red"" scientific warnings on the climate crisis and the risk of going over 1.5C of warming, and severe climate-related weather extremes from heatwaves in the US to deadly flooding in Europe and China.Earlier this week, UN scientists warned the build-up of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had sped up and hit record levels in 2020.The UN has also warned that the latest national action plans and pledges from countries to tackle emissions up to 2030 are far off what is needed to limit dangerous warming, and put the world on track for temperature rises of 2.7C.So a key factor in making Glasgow a ""success"" is keeping the pathway to 1.5C within reach by increasing climate action in this decade, with more national efforts from countries, progress on areas such as coal and saving forests, and a process to ensure countries take more action in the next few years.It is a goal made arguably harder by the latest climate plan submitted by China on Thursday, which does not increase its ambition beyond existing announcements.There is also the question of the long-promised $100bn a year from 2020-2025 for poorer nations to develop cleanly and adapt to the changing climate, and negotiations to finalise the last bits of how the Paris Agreement will work.It has emerged developed countries will not deliver on the $100bn goal until 2023, although around $500bn of climate finance will be provided over five years to 2025.Peter Betts, former lead negotiator for the EU, and the UK, at UN climate talks, said: ""Defining success in Glasgow is harder than it was in Paris, where we had a treaty to wave at the end.""Success in Glasgow is more about implementation and action.""He said that on efforts to curb warming ""we need very substantial step-ups in countries' emission reduction plans, coupled with serious sectoral coalitions on issues like finance and coal, and a road map to more ambition raising in the coming years.""On finance it means the $100bn goal being met, with better delivery for the most vulnerable including on adaptation,"" adding he expected developing countries to press for discussion on the delay to the delivery of the promised funding in Glasgow.Importantly, he said, the Paris Cop21 was successful - despite insufficient commitments - because people saw governments were serious and that drove action.""We need the same boost to momentum from Glasgow"".Nick Mabey, chief executive and co-founder of E3G climate think tank, said the biggest hurdle to success would be whether enough had been put on the table - particularly from China given its disappointing new action plan - to give confidence there had been enough progress towards 1.5C.And whatever is committed by countries and sectoral deals, it will not be enough, so a process is needed to come back sooner than expected to raise efforts in the face of starker scientific evidence on climate dangers, he said.""It's about the pace of change. Yes, we are changing, that's very clear, but we have to go faster because the climate risks are worse,"" he said.He added it was right of the UK to push for keeping the 1.5C goal within reach at the Glasgow talks, and it was up to countries to decide if they wanted to pursue it.World leaders will kick-start the summit by setting out the domestic action they are taking, although key players will be missing including China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin.But a year's delay to the talks as a result of the pandemic has allowed for the election of a new US president, Joe Biden, who has announced a net zero goal, and a significant boost to climate finance - and will attend the summit.All G7 leading industrialised nations have targets to hit net zero emissions - needed by mid-century globally to meet the 1.5C goal - along with major polluters such as China, and in the past few days from the likes of Saudi Arabia and Australia, though critics question how robust these targets are.And they do not solve the problem of the need for far greater action in the 2020s - seen as the ""decisive decade"" for putting the world on the right track to 1.5C or even ""well below"" 2C - with the UK the only major economy judged as being close to having plans in l"

We know what's causing climate change - human activity.""""Something that is caused by humans can be solved by humans,"" he said, before repeating his pledge to achieve a 50-52% reduction in US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.Mr Biden's approach to climate change is very different to that of his predecessor Donald Trump, who once suggested that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese.He later said he was joking, but throughout his presidency he questioned the human impact on our changing climate.Mr Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Accord was reversed by President Biden.But can the world trust this president's climate promises if they too can be undone by his future successors?It is one of the biggest challenges facing Mr Biden, according to Barry Rabe, a Professor of Environmental Policy at the University of Michigan.""I am not sure how he resolves this. He has to say to the world that not only is he committed but that they can count on things he is proposing actually being delivered,"" Professor Rabe said.""In three years, Joe Biden will be 82 years old, will he seek re-election? Will a Republican candidate or even Donald Trump be returning to the Oval Office in a few years and then undo the handiwork of their predecessor?""""I don't think there is any question that the standing and reputation of the US in the climate space has been damaged by this uncertainty and back-and-forth,"" Prof Rabe said.It is easy for presidents to undo the executive orders of their predecessors but legislation that has been passed by Congress is far more difficult to overturn.""The legislative package is crucial because it is much harder for a future president from another party to simply reverse it through executive action, it would take another act of Congress. A legislative piece is likely to be far more durable,"" according to Prof Rabe.But getting climate change legislation passed by a divided US Congress is proving difficult for Joe Biden and one of the biggest obstacles is coming not from Republicans, but from within his own party.Democratic Senator Joe Manchin is opposing many of the proposed clean energy initiatives. He has ties to the coal industry and represents the coal mining state of West Virginia.Just outside the town of Thomas, West Virginia the conveyor belts and coal piles of the local mine dominate the landscape.In the town, the future of the industry dominates conversation.""I don't know that there are a lot of alternatives to coal for us here so I think it definitely plays into attitudes that may be a little resistant to climate change measures.""Everybody wants to be more environmentally friendly but when it is people's livelihoods, it is a real concern,"" she said.Joe Biden will this week try to convince the world to follow his lead when it comes to cutting emissions, but convincing Americans, including some in his own party, remains an uphill battle.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland215","Cop26 will pay lip service to the cause while the planet burns","Irish Examiner"," ","THE United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26) now under way in Glasgow might conclude with a big international agreement. But whatever tactical successes are achieved, the results are likely to mark a strategic setback for humanity - at least when compared to the hopes of climate activists.The world is missing target after target. This should not be surprising: While a growing number of countries have set net-zero targets, for example, very few have credible plans to meet them. And even if we did meet existing targets, that would not be enough to achieve the 2015 Paris climate agreement's main goal: Limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report warns that the planet is likely to reach the 1.5C limit in the early 2030s. As long as multilateral engagement is defined by nationalism, power politics, and emotion, rather than solidarity, law, and science, our future will continue to grow bleaker.At the height of the Cold War, the American television series The Outer Limits told the story of an idealistic group of scientists staging a fake alien invasion of Earth, in the misguided hope they could avert nuclear Armageddon by giving the world a common enemy against which to unite. When faced with the prospect of extinction, the logic went, the Soviet Union and the US would turn their attention from competition to shared survival.Today, nobody needs to contrive a common cause. Climate change poses as great a threat as any alien invasion. But, far from shocking national leaders out of their petty competition, it is being wielded as a weapon in a many-sided propaganda war. From Brazil and Australia to China and the US, countries are trying to game climate negotiations in order to shift the costs of adaptation onto others.For example, the Brazilian government is trying to get the world to pay it to stop destroying the Amazon rainforest. Chinese President Xi Jinping will participate in Cop26 only by video link, and Russian president Vladimir Putin might not attend at all.Meanwhile, the advanced economies - including those that proudly claim to be committed to climate action - have broken their promise to provide $100bn annually to support the climate transition in the Global South. And even if they did deliver, it wouldn't be enough.Developed economies are finding increasingly coercive ways of shaping other countries' behaviour. Commitments by most of the Western and multilateral development banks to stop financing coal (now joined by China) restrict options for grid expansion in developing countries where demand for power is growing rapidly.Influential countries have also urged the International Monetary Fund to attach green conditions to debt relief for poor countries, as well as to its new allocation of special drawing rights (the IMF's reserve asset). And the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism - a non-trade barrier intended to force exporters to Europe to shift to green production - disproportionately hurts small emitters in Africa and Eastern Europe with a lot to lose.This is not to disparage coal bans, green financing, and carbon pricing. On the contrary, these tools have a crucial role to play in changing how the global economy works. But that doesn't mean we can disregard the (very serious) consequences for developing economies. Instead, we need to create a new grand bargain focused on supporting adaptation in the developing world.More broadly, we must ensure that any multilateral agreement for tackling climate change is governed by international law, rather than dependent on the will of individual countries. And decision-making should be driven by scientific truths, not political slogans.The Paris agreement's predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, was broadly in l"

The previous two parts warned of ""unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades"".The first IPCC report last August issued the starkest warning yet of a ""code red for humanity"", setting the agenda for world leaders to make a range of pledges at the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November.Backed by 270 authors, 675 contributors, and more than 34,000 references, the IPCC revealed that human-caused climate change, which has pushed up global temperatures by 1.1C, is driving weather and climate extremes in every region across the world.The second part of the report in February warned that the already ""dangerous and widespread disruption"" to nature and billions of people will be made worse. Even temporarily exceeding 1.5C in global warming will result in extreme impacts, some of which will not be reversible, the report said.Stop Climate Chaos (SCC), made up of 30 Irish civil society organisations, said that next week's report is likely to focus on four key issues.""The report will emphasise that we need to do more, and quickly,"" it stated.""We are on a path to overshoot 2C of warming even if all countries meet their Paris Agreement emission reduction pledges.

""They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.""That leaves the world highly vulnerable.""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. It is time to go into emergency mode,"" he said.The summit did not deliver enough emissions-cutting pledges from countries to set a clear path to limiting warming to 1.5C. Instead, it struck a deal for the nearly 200 countries represented at the event to increase their pledges next year to close the gap.The gap is huge. Governments' current pledges to cut emissions this decade would lead to 2.4C of warming.To align with the 1.5C target, countries need to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45pc by 2030 from 2010 levels. Under current pledges, emissions would rise by nearly 14pc by 2030.""While compromises atCop26 keep the 1.5C target within reach, it is hanging by a thread,"" said Bert Wander, the acting CEO of environmental group Avaaz.China, the world's biggest carbon dioxide emitter, announced in a joint declaration with the US last week that it would accelerate efforts to reduce emissions by curbing coal use, tackling methane, and preserving forests. It provided few details, however.China was also among a group of resource-rich developing nations that watered down language targeting fossil fuels in the deal.The draft called on countries to phase out coal use and fossil fuel subsidies. But as the negotiations played out, words were changed: Coal became ""unabated coal"", leaving scope for continued use of coal that uses tech to capture emissions.Subsidies became ""inefficient subsidies"", without a definition of which types of subsidies counted as inefficient, providing wriggle room for governments to continue funding oil, gas and coal.A last-minute intervention by India and China just before the pact was adopted also changed the requested coal ""phase out"" to a ""phase down"".The Glasgow agreement delivered a mixed bag on finance, a contentious issue between poor countries and their rich and powerful counterparts. Finance boils down to the issue of fairness, and whether rich nations whose historical emissions are largely responsible for causing climate change will pay the costs it is imposing on the world's poorest countries.The deal made some headway. It asked developed countries to ""at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country parties from 2019 levels by 2025"". It also, for the first time, made mention of ""loss and damage"" in the cover section of the agreement. Loss and damage refers to the costs countries are already facing from climate-driven disasters, for which those countries have for years sought compensation. But after resistance from the US, the EU and other rich nations, the accord failed to secure such compensation.The world's most vulnerable countries backed the final deal grudgingly. Antigua and Barbuda negotiator Lia Nicholson said her country and other small island states at the talks ""will express our grievances in due course"".Rich countries broke a 2009 promise to deliver $100bn ((EURO)87m) annually by 2020 in climate finance, making poor countries wary that promised cash will not arrive.They now expect to deliver the $100bn by 2023.The world's most vulnerable countries backed the final deal grudgingly\l"

The report, including recommendations to governments, will be issued today.This is the second part in a global climate assessment released every five to seven years, and it will propose strategies for adapting to current and future warming, sea level rise and ocean acidification, as well as extreme weather events.""We have some delegates from other cities, not only Kyiv, and they were forced to go to shelters,"" said climate scientist Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Ukrainian delegation. ""But most important is that it's very difficult to think about climate change impacts when you have impacts of Russian missiles in our Kyiv, and tanks everywhere."" She hoped, nonetheless, that what is known as the IPCC Working Group 2 report would get the coverage and attention it deserves.Preparedness It is likely to be the starkest warning yet about the impacts of climate change on people and the planet - notably impacts that are inevitable due to current levels of carbon emissions and related temperature rise. It will also assess preparedness under ""adaptation"" measures, such as the ability to withstand extreme weather.It is being published today, in the wake of the Cop26 summit that agreed to increase action to try to limit global warming to 1\'bd degrees to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The outcomes of UN talks in Glasgow were described as keeping the temperature goal alive ""but only with a weak pulse"", by conference president Alok Sharma. The surge in fossil fuel prices since - especially natural gas in Europe - has undermined global momentum.A draft version leaked last year warned of the risk of crossing dangerous thresholds or ""tipping points"", where things such as the melting of ice sheets or permafrost, or rainforests becoming grassland, become irreversible, with huge consequences.It will set out the effects of rising temperatures, which have already reached 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, such as droughts, floods, storms and effects on health, agriculture and cities - as well as cascading and irreversible impacts.There will be a specific focus on the different regions of the world, as well as looking at vulnerable populations and communities, migration and displacement.Ahead of its publication, Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group of mayors taking action on climate change, warned the latest report was likely to ""paint a grim vision"" for big cities from London to Lima.""City residents are already on the front l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland222","Climate crises are a heavy burden on young shoulders","April 26, 2022 Tuesday","Irish Independent","The issue of climate change has certainly moved centre stage as far as farming is concerned, so when I heard some young Irish people being interviewed on RT\'c9 recently in relation to a proposed youth debate on climate change in the Seanad chambers, it certainly caught my attention.These young people appeared really concerned about climate change, claiming it is an issue which is ""affecting us every single day, in our summers and our winters"". I thought to myself, have I been sleepwalking through life or has the influence of modern media hype become that persuasive?While CSO figures suggest an average rise in our temperature of 0.8 of a degree over the last century, I must confess that personally, I have noticed very little changes in Irish weather patterns over recent decades.So while I must disagree with these young people's comments, at a global level, the issue is not as simple. Some scientists may blame an increase in solar activity, however the burning of fossil fuels has been identified by most scientists as being the major cause of changes in our global climate.Alarmingly, the current war in Ukraine has exposed the extreme dependence of developed western economies on secure supplies of oil and gas.This dependence has put into sharp focus the difficulties which would arise, not alone in farming, but in all sectors of our economy if these energy sources are restricted for environmental reasons.What is also disturbing is the growing reluctance of wealthy westernised societies to carry the burden of rising consumer prices resulting from these shortages. For example, many media outlets are currently being inundated with calls from irate members of the public protesting about the rising cost of living, including food.While many of these callers are people trying to make ends meet, it is obvious that others are simply reluctant to relinquish an affluent lifestyle and supply of cheap food, which they have become accustomed to.COP26 meeting in Glasgow, are also realising how politically difficult such reductions would be for any government to implement.This has also led to a situation where the UN Secretary General has been obliged to say that the 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report' is ""a litany of broken climate promises"".So as they fight their way through the thick fog of populist media hype and cynical vested interest, it appears that our youth may find themselves on their own in solving our climate problems. These are indeed very heavy responsibilities to have resting on such young shoulders On a related issue, something which has really changed in the last 12 months is the cost of farm inputs. It's funny how you have to feel the pain before you can fully realise how bad things have become. That is exactly what happened to me when I dropped in to pay my fertiliser bill recently.The situation is certainly not helped by the fact that our Government appears to have very few plans in place to soften the phenomenal increase in farm inputs costs.You could be forgiven for thinking that once again the farming community will be obliged/expected to further subsidise increases in the cost of the public's weekly shopping basket.Of course, the truth is we really don't know what lies ahead. Will the current marketing system, which appears to guarantee that farm-gate prices are kept to a minimum, continue to dominate or will an expected rise in food prices be sufficient to offset rising input costs?Whatever the outcome, it appears that from a farming perspective, we are facing a very scary, rollercoaster ride, so all I can say is hang on to your seats.John Heney farms in Kilfeackle, Co Tipperary.\l"

""But this administration seems to have recognised the positive value we bring. We were really excited to get out of that relatively unscathed.""Methane, expelled by cows and by their manure, is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Although methane dissipates after 10 to 20 years, it warms the planet at 80 times the rate of carbon dioxide and emissions are accelerating at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN.Although Mr Biden's November pledge to reduce methane included new rules for the oil, gas and coal industries, it proposed only voluntary actions for an agricultural sector the Environmental Protection Agency says contributes more than one-third of the country's emissions. In a November interview with Reuters, agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack said he trusted the agriculture industry to do the right thing in response to federal incentives.""Agriculture will respond to this because they have historically responded to financial and market incentives,"" Mr Vilsack said in that interview. ""They appreciate the time has come.""Some in Houston made that appreciation clear, with at least one speaker telling the trade show audience that the beef industry stands to make a lot of money off federal emissions-reduction incentives.New rules would stifle an industry that is already working hard to fight climate change, Ms Hart told the trade show audience. ""The last thing we need to do is implement regulations. They'd get in the way of that productivity,"" Hart said. ""Global beef demand isn't going away. If US cow producers aren't allowed to do their job and do it well, that production's just going to go to a less sustainable country.""Some cattle producers are making an effort to reduce emissions, such as feeding animals grass or other lower-emission materials, but the US will never meet Mr Biden's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction goals without regulation, said Brent Kim, a program of ficer with the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.""We urgently need to curb greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, of which livestock is the biggest producer,"" Mr Kim said.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland228","A guide to Cop26; The United Nations Climate Change Conference is widely seen as the last chance to avoid catastrophic damage to Earth, writes Kevin O'Sullivan","October 23, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","The United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26), which launches on October 31st, will dominate world news with heightened expectation that it will trigger a strong global response to an already-happening climate crisis. What is Cop26Almost every country in the world will attend the 26th gathering under the UN ""conference of the parties"". The 13-day long summit, which will be held in Glasgow, is billed as the last chance to put the world on track to avoid catastrophic damage to Earth due to vast quantities of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The conference is the only global mechanism to galvanise action in addressing this human-caused damage to planet Earth. Who will be there? Superpowers will sit alongside tiny island states from the South Pacific; immensely wealthy countries, who have contributed most to the crisis, will be across the table from impoverished states from sub-Saharan Africa, who are least to blame. What is at stake? The impacts of human-caused overheating of the planet is predicted to persist for centuries but threaten the existence of humankind much sooner. If global temperature rise continues to accelerate and carbon emissions are not dramatically cut, the world faces a temperature rise of 2.7 degrees and an overwhelming sea-level surge this century. No place on Earth will be safe, Ireland included.Yet many climate scientists agree the worst effects can be avoided by swift action. It's possible to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees - the key target of the Paris Agreement forged at Cop21 in 2015. That is provided ambition is ratcheted up. What's more, solutions exist.What will happen at the conference? With upwards of 20,000 people gathered in the one place, a Cop looks at first glance like a recipe for chaos. Numerous briefings, report launches, press conferences, protests, stunts, corporates trying to show off their newly-found green credentials and harrowing stories of climate disruption take place from morning into late evening in crowded venues - with many happening simultaneously. One minute a minister is trying to defend his country's expansionist fossil fuel policy, the next a pastor from Fiji is making a plea for help as a voyager way of life existing for centuries is threatened by rising seas.So, will people work together to find a solution? A fully-fledged Cop somehow restores faith in humanity. Instead of unbridgeable differences, common ground suggests global citizens can in unison restore a scarred Earth, though the clock is ticking faster and faster. Meanwhile, heads of state, ministers, negotiators, advisers and diplomats are ensconced away from the madding crowd. Here optimism is more tempered. Painstaking work is conducted behind closed doors and the mood ebbs and flows in pursuit of agreement. Can we expect an agreement? All too often the outcome has meant disappointment and, more recently, despair as the interlinked crises of a climate emergency, biodiversity loss and pollution arising from excesses of consumerism, are getting worse. The Paris pact left too much to interpretation and failed to provide a mechanism to drive urgent action. Will Covid measures impact the event? Covid-19 will cast a shadow over Cop26.

This is not to say the whole thing is a waste of time - far from it. But people know to take the posturing around the event with a pinch of salt.It is a political speechwriter's dream. ""We are digging our own graves"", said the UN. Another attention-grabbing phrase referred to our ""moment of truth"". It is ""either up to us to stop it, or it stops us"", said another. Queen Elizabeth urged everyone to ""act now for our children"", while Boris Johnson described it as ""one minute to midnight on the Doomsday Clock"".The event seems to be primarily about garnering attention for political leaders, while also very legitimately and positively raising awareness about climate change issues for the public at large. It is hard not to be sceptical about some of the commitments that are made. When stripped back, you have to wonder what they really mean. The publicity around the Paris Agreement in 2015 was enormous.The commitments seemed to portray a real sense that governments were taking the urgency around climate change seriously. But were they?Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal. US president Joe Biden reversed the Trump decision and arrived in Glasgow, more or less saying, ""sorry about all that. We are back on track"". Yet more Americans voted for Donald Trump in the election he lost than for any other previous election candidate in US history.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi gave a commitment in Glasgow for his country to go to net zero emissions by 2070. The 71-year old would be 120 at that stage and it is safe to say he will most likely not be in government.knock-onSeveral of the most forested countries pledged to end deforestation. But that won't be happening until 2030. So it is chop away until then. This pledge echoed a similar pledge given in 2014 yet forests in Brazil for example, continue to be destroyed on a huge scale.Some of that deforestation goes on producing cheap cattle feed which is exported around the world. Every country's actions have knock-on consequences elsewhere.Take Norway, one of the foremost exponents of electric vehicles. This is because electric vehicles there are not subject to road tax, have free charging and a raft of other state-subsidised incentives for people to buy them. Yet Norway remains the largest exporter of fossil fuels per capita in the world.Few of us are above the charges of hypocrisy that go with the pledges and the battle to deal with climate change. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin is in Glasgow talking about what Ireland is going to do, yet we have been complete laggards in cutting our own emissions reduction targets.Five years ago we were developing food production and expansion strategies built on convincing farmers to borrow money to increase their dairy herds following the end of restrictive EU milk quotas. The size of the national herd is being talked about now as a major obstacle to achieving emissions reduction targets. Farmers get the blame but you have to have some sympathy for dairy farmers in particular who invested heavily in their businesses on the back of a government strategy for the sector.Few of us are hypocrisy with climateThe Government is nervous about saying the national herd will have to be cut, so instead it is talking about 'stabilisation' of the herd. Does that mean keeping it to current levels, or does it mean actually cutting it back? While it isn't outright saying this, people know, not least farmers themselves, that we will not meet targets unless the herd numbers are cut back.At some point that debate will shift towards compensation rather than maintaining a fallacy of cutting methane gas and ammonia levels while simultaneously growing herd numbers.This is where the honesty issue comes in. There is a complete lack of honesty and realism about what is required to make the transition that is needed. Big businesses have been plugging away at carbon reduction, not so much to save the planet but to comply with regulations and ensure they have a business in the future.Some are just greenwashing by relying on questionable carbon credit offsets.

Sir Keir Starmer has also opposed the exploitation of the Cambo oil field, one of those ministers are assessing.But a source close to Mr Kwarteng rejected the idea, saying: 'We are not halting production and we are not slowing it down. We want to see more investment in the North Sea.'The transition to net zero is exactly that - a transition. Yes, we need more offshore wind and tidal power and nuclear.'But in the short term at least we also need oil and gas to help provide that security of supply. There will continue to be demand for oil and gas for decades - we are moving to net zero emissions, not zero.'Yesterday's Cabinet discussion coincided with the announcement by oil giant BP of \£39.5billion profits, however No 10 indicated there was no shift in the Government's opposition to calls for a windfall tax on fossil fuel firm.'There is obviously volatility in gas prices, you are seeing that reflected in profits,' the Prime Minister's spokesman said. 'I am not going to comment on individual companies. Those that perform well pay more in taxes, including corporation tax.'Environmental campaigners condemned the prospect of further North Sea exploration, saying it was at odds with the Government's commitments at last year's Cop26 summit.Philip Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said: 'This would represent a stunning retreat from the pro-climate posturing we saw from the Government at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.'Ministers put a moratorium on fracking in 2019 because of concerns about its potential to cause mini earthquakes.Some Tory MPs are pushing for the ban to be lifted, arguing that the technology could provide a cheap and secure supply of gas. But a Government source insisted the issue was not on the table.Comment - Page 16 \£39.5bn BP's Bumper ProfitsIt prompted campaigners and MPs to demand it was time to target the 'obscene' amounts with a one-off tax to help families struggling to pay soaring energy bills.BP and Shell are predicted to make \£340billion this year as gas prices spiral. BP posted profits of \£33billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 - 35 times the same period in 2020.Adam Scorer, of National Energy Action, said: 'We need deep, targeted measures to help the fuel poor.'BP chief Bernard Looney rejected the idea of windfall tax, saying: 'We need to be encouraging investment in natural gas in Britain, not discouraging.'\l"

""To say that the answers to climate change are not going to be negotiated inside the COP but constructed around people who want these systems to change.""I think the message we send when we take to the streets is that hope is still alive while we are organising to change the world.""We have nothing to say to the politicians. It's all just blah, blah blah, as Greta says.""And that is the challenge for the world leaders when they return to Glasgow next week to see if they can agree a communique at what we are told is the ""last, best chance"" to stop runaway climate change.How will they convince distrustful activists and people already suffering due to global warming, that they will deliver on the promises that have been made, and will show the ambition needed?And yet the reality is that we need the big political beasts to have any chance of driving down emissions.The richest 20 nations in the world - the so-called G20 - is responsible for the vast bulk of greenhouse gas emissions.If they can be locked into an agreement it has to be an important contribution to the wider effort.China is part of the G20 and the single biggest emitter on the plant.It got some criticism when President Xi Jinping did not attend the world leaders' summit at COP26 in person.But it has now got a net zero target of 2060, and has promised to stop funding coal powered electricity stations overseas and cancel those already planned.Climate expert Professor Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir of University College Cork, who spent the first week at COP, said that alone could save as much emissions as the entire net zero ambition of the EU out to 2050.He also points out that China's emissions per person would be much lower than many other western countries, and while they are a big polluter now, they haven't been at it for as long as many others. It all just shows the complexity of the climate narrative.What's to stop leaders returning home and doing business as usual?/nIt would be churlish not to acknowledge some of the commitments made this week. Countries signing up to stop burning coal - though not the ones heavily dependent on it; others, including Ireland, committing to cutting global methane emissions, still others to stopping deforestation.India, one of the planet's biggest emitters, has set itself a net zero target for the first time. It feels it'll be 2070 before it gets there.How do you measure the effectiveness of emission promises?Several groups of climate experts have looked at the promises and worked out that if they are all kept, global warming could be held below two degrees against pre-industrial levels - which would be in l"

The latest verdict of CAT - the world's most respected climate analysis coalition - provided a stark warning to almost 200 countries gathered in Glasgow as negotiations enter their most challenging phase. Temperature rises will top 2.4 degrees by the end of this century based on the short-term goals countries have set out, CAT concludes in its latest analysis. That would far exceed the 2-degree upper limit of the Paris agreement, and 1.5 degree limit aimed for at the Cop26 talks. At that level widespread extreme weather - sea-level rises, drought, floods, heatwaves and storms - would cause devastation across the globe, it predicts.The estimate is in sharp contrast to optimistic forecasts last week suggesting warming could be held to 1.9 degrees or 1.8 degrees, thanks to commitments announced at the talks.The UK, as hosts of Cop26, were due to release overnight a first draft of the summit communiqu\'e9, which will lead to consultations with national capitals across the globe. \l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland236","UN chief tears into world leaders over climate crisis; As report warns of irreversible changes, how we still have 'window of time' to act","March 1, 2022 Tuesday","Irish Daily Mail","POLITICIANS have shown a 'criminal' abdication of leadership on climate change, the UN general secretary said yesterday.Antonio Guterres issued the warning as a new UN report said many impacts of global warming are now irreversible.But there is still a window of time to avoid the very worst, its authors said. There is an immediate need to prevent irreversible impacts - such as melting of polar ice shelves and destruction of ecosystems, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment said.It also predicts worldwide food shortages that will leave millions starving and sea level rises which will destroy coastal communities and hit the world's economy.Mr Guterres said: 'I've seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like these. Today's IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of fake climate leadership. With fact upon fact, these reports reveal people on the planet are getting clobbered by climate change. Nearly half of humanity is living in the danger zone - now.'Many ecosystems are at the point of no return - now. And unchecked carbon pollution is forcing the world's most vulnerable on a frogmarch to destruction - now.'The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal.The world's biggest polluters are guilty of arson on our only home.'Mr Guterres's comments were retweeted by teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who added: 'Delay means death.'It comes more than 100 days after world leaders agreed new efforts to limit warming and to deliver finance for adaptation at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.The report, called Assessment Review Six, warns it is essential to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, which will require the world to cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.But global emissions are set to rise by 14 per cent in the next decades, Mr Guterres said. Coal, oil and gas were 'choking humanity' and he called on governments to 'dismantle' coal power stations. The report is the latest in a series produced by the IPCC, which is a UN body assessing science around climate change. It has been released after being approved in a process involving representatives of 195 governments and scientists.It said human-driven climate change has led to increasing heat and heatwaves, rising sea levels, floods, wildfires and drought, causing death, food and water scarcity, and migration. Current rates of cli- mate change will 'cause loss and degradation of much of the world's forests, coral reefs and low-lying coastal wetlands'.Different weather extremes are happening at the same time, causing 'cascading' effects increasingly hard to manage. The report warned we are nearing 'tipping points' such as melting of ice sheets in Antarctica, thawing of Arctic permafrost or the loss of Amazon rainforest.Some 3.3 billion to 3.6 billion people live in situations where they are highly vulnerable to climate change, the report warns. Consequences of warming will hit sub-Saharan Africa and small island states hardest.At 1.5C of warming - and we are now at 1.1C - 14 per cent of species will face risk of extinction. The world needs to safeguard nature, including conserving 30-50 per cent of land, freshwater and sea habitats, to reduce warming impacts.The report also calls for measures such as restoring wetlands to guard against flooding, avoiding building on flood plains and planting more urban trees to cool cities.Lab-grown meat could reduce pressure on creating pastures for cattle. But it warns against 'maladaptation' - such as hard sea walls which can cause more problems.Debra Roberts, IPCC co-chairman, said: 'This is really a key moment. Our report points out very clearly, this is the decade of action, if we are going to turn things around.'Emma Howard Boyd, chairman of the Environment Agency, said: 'It is adapt or die. Previous IPCC reports have talked about terrible climate risks, this report shows how impacts to people, nature and the economy are interconnected.'The IPCC offers us a glimmer of hope, the window to deliver climate resilience is still there, but it is closing fast.'A Government spokesman said: 'The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change, decarbonising our economy faster than any country in the G20, and helping over 90 per cent of the global economy set net-zero targets during our Cop26 presidency.''Arson on our only home'\l"

Here are some key milestones in the history of climate change:- James Watt patented his steam engine in 1769, helping drive the Industrial Revolution and its use of fossil fuels.- Joseph Fourier recognised the atmosphere acts as a blanket, keeping the Earth warmer than it would otherwise be, the ""greenhouse effect"", as early as 1824.- Just a few decades later Irish physicist John Tyndall measured the absorption of heat by greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide in his laboratory in London, publishing a paper on his findings in 1861.AdvertisementA few years before him American female scientist Eunice Newton Foote conducted an experiment revealing the heat-trapping properties of carbon dioxide, and warned in a scientific paper in 1856 that an atmosphere of that gas would give the Earth a high temperature.- Before the end of the 19th century - which saw the development of ocean-going steamships, coal fired power stations for electricity and the motor car - scientists began to spell out the impact of changing carbon dioxide levels.In 1896 Svante Arrhenius published a paper on ice ages which estimated temperature changes due to changing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.He was followed a few years later by fellow Swede Nils Ekholm suggesting the gas could increase in the atmosphere over the coming millennium due to the burning of coal, which would warm the Earth.

Only around a dozen countries, and the EU as a bloc, have enshrined the target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in law.Ireland has done this nationally in the Climate Act and as an EU member.That, along with the carbon budget announced this week, puts Ireland in a position of being able to show a degree of leadership to other countries.The official delegation is also keen to take part in discussions on climate finance - assistance to poor countries to enable them to develop their economies with clean technology and renewable energy.Irish representatives will also be involved in talks about ""loss and damage"" - the establishment of a permanent fund for climate catastrophe assistance that usually comes piecemeal after repeated appeals for donations. Sustainable agriculture, protection of oceans and gender issues will also have Irish input.Mr Ryan said he would measure the success of the summit if a genuine commitment emerged from all parties to work harder and faster toward the Paris goals.""Keeping 1.5 alive - that's what it's all about,"" he said.Mr Ryan told the Indo Daily podcast he agreed with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg's criticisms of the ""all talk, no action"" approach of the international community.""She's right. We don't have room now. We have to stop talking and we do have to start acting,"" he said.""We've been involved in this for 30 years now, and if we'd started 30 years ago with real action it would have been so much easier, it would have been a gentle glide to decarbonise. But now we don't have that luxury, we don't have that time.""He said Ireland did not always have a good record on climate issues, but with the Climate Act, carbon budgets, a new Climate Action Plan on the way and the halt to fossil fuel exploration, things had changed.\l"

""It is true - a lot of climate opposition comes from fossil fuel companies trying to make a buck, despite the green ads they run on TV,"" he said.""It is true that there are climate deniers out there who for ideological reasons you will never convince.""But I'm not talking about them - I'm talking about the fact that we've got to persuade the guy who has got to drive to his factory job every day, can't afford a Tesla and might not be able to pay the rent or feed his family if gas prices go up.""We have to think about the mother in India who, yes, will suffer droughts and floods made worse by climate change, but whose more immediate concern is getting electricity so her children don't have to sit in the dark and can't do their homework.""You can't dismiss that concern - there are workers and communities that still depend on coal for power and jobs and yes, they are concerned about maintaining their wages - that's not unreasonable for them to be concerned about that.""Moving away from fossil fuels, the former president said, will have a cost, but it was for the more developed nations to ensure ""the people most effected by the transition to clean energy aren't the ones baring most of the cost"".""They don't have any margin for error,"" he said.He added: ""Any climate plan worth its salt has to take these inequities into account - whether that its through subsidies to poor people to ease the transition to clean energy, whether its technology transfers that help poor countries meet their development goals by leapfrogging dirty fuels - we have to pay attention to those embedded inequities and the politics that surrounds that.""He urged young people to ""stay angry"" about climate change, but asked them to channel their frustration into action.He said: ""Keep pushing harder and harder for more and more - because that's what's required to meet this challenge.""Gird yourself for a marathon, not a sprint.""For solving a problem this big and this complex has never happened all at once.""Quoting Shakespeare, former US president Barack Obama said the ""wounds"" caused to the planet by climate change will ""be healed by degrees"".Referencing a l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland243","Critical moment to tackle climate","Irish Examiner"," ","The next three years will be the most critical in recent global history if ""unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages"" are to be avoided.That is the stark warning from the latest assessment of the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says it is ""now or never"" if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5C.The public must immediately be encouraged to move to more plant-based diets, heat homes in a more environmentally friendly way, and take up walking and cycling or driving electric cars. Cities must be made greener, more walkable, and healthier.There will need to be fewer flights taken by individuals, the widespread electrif ication of transport, and the rapid adaptation of more renewable energy.Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have to peak by 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% by 2030, while at the same time, methane - one of Ireland's biggest emissions culprits - would need to be reduced by about a third if the 1.5C target is to be met, says the IPCC.Even if this is accomplished, ""it is almost inevitable that we will temporarily exceed this temperature threshold but could return to below it by the end of the century"", states the report.UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said: ""Some government and business leaders are saying one thing but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.""Even if all the pledges made up to 2020 had been implemented, a rise of 3.2C would occur, the scientists found. Mr Guterres said that would mean heat waves, storms, and water shortages on an unprecedented scale.Eoin Lettice, plant scientist and lecturer at the School of Biological, Earth, and Environmental Sciences and the Environmental Research Institute, said: ""The agriculture sector in Ireland is not on a sustainable lowcarbon path, according to the Climate Change Advisory Council.""This will need to be tackled, as farming is the largest contributor by sector to greenhouse gas emissions in the country.""Among the most problematic of issues is what we do about methane, he said. ""Methane is a short-lived but potent GHG which is derived mainly from cattle in the Irish context. The IPCC calls for a 30% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 if we are to avert disaster.""Despite signing the global methane pledge at Cop26 in Glasgow and committing to this reduction and timeframe, the Government was quick to clarify that they consider this a global pledge, and that Ireland may not reach anywhere near this target,"" said Dr Lettice.Stop Climate Chaos, a group comprising 30 Irish civil society organisations, said Government action to reduce emissions immediately and phase out fossil fuels ""must begin now, not in 10 years' time"".It pointed to the IPCC's finding that average annual GHGs were at their highest recorded level between 2010 and 2019, and that global emissions from energy hit a record high in 2021.The IPCC report states the global temperature will stabilise when carbon dioxide emissions reach net zero.""For 1.5C, this means achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions globally in the early 2050s; for 2C, it is in the early 2070s,"" it said.Peter Thorne, a leading Irish contributor to previous IPCC reports and a professor at Maynooth University, said the pathway is narrow but achievable. ""Nationally, the Climate Act puts in place the governance aspects but governance is nothing without action. We now need to see progress on the ground.""\l"

But climate campaigners in Belfast were less than impressed that the DUP man jetted to Cop26.Green Party MLA Rachel Woods said: ""Minister Poots is opposed to the cross-party consensus that Northern Ireland should aim for a net zero emissions target, so it comes as little surprise that he's seemingly not taking emissions reductions seriously in terms of his own travel choices.""Northern Ireland is already in an embarrassing place as Cop26 gets under way, as we still have no climate legislation, and the highest per-capita emissions in the UK and Ireland. This is likely to further add to our poor reputation for climate action.""Queen's University professor of green political economy John Barry said Mr Poots' decision was disappointing.""We don't want to be 'flight shaming' people, but for shorthaul flights like this? You can understand coming from Australia and so on,"" he said.""The minister could have easily got the ferry to Stranraer, got the train up to Glasgow and shown some leadership.""Other local politicians will be taking more sustainable routes to the Glasgow summit. Mr Smyth, along with Belfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl and his Green Party councillor colleague Aine Groogan, will be taking the ferry. And Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan cycled there.DAERA said: ""The minister is committed to ensure that his department offsets any emissions associated with travel to and from the conference. To that effect officials will be gathering details of journeys made and putting in place a programme to plant native broadleaved trees to offset more than the equivalent emissions.""Meanwhile, Sammy Wilson has branded Cop26 a ""climate circus"". In a letter published in today's Belfast Telegraph the DUP MP also questioned whether world leaders can really ""control the Earth's thermostat"" simply by reducing C02 emissions. In a Commons question to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Wilson had asked: ""Given the commitments which the Prime Minister is making at the climate circus in Glasgow this week, how can the Chancellor possibly say that public finances will be managed effectively when the huge costs of net zero are not even published by the Treasury, let alone known by the public, and we are already seeing taxes increasing to pay for the huge infrastructure changes which reaching net zero are going to entail.""The Chancellor said the net zero strategy would be backed up by \£330bn of investment, with Northern Ireland to receive around \£31.5bn.In his letter, Mr Wilson questioned efforts at Cop26.""Those with a basic knowledge of geography, science and history would know that the Earth's climate is constantly changing and the natural forces which are responsible are well beyond the ability of man to influence,"" he said.Friends of the Earth said: ""The DUP should be deeply embarrassed in the face of the climate denialism brazenly shown by Sammy Wilson - while his party colleagues are at the Cop26 negotiations and when the survivability of life on our planet is at stake. ""Does the former Environment Minister, who previously tried to ban adverts warning of the effects of climate change, know more than the world's leading climate scientists?"" Letters, Page 21\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland245","Some progress made, but vows to reduce emissions still fall short","November 15, 2021 Monday","Belfast Telegraph","COP26 should have been the Cop of increased ambition, decisive action and financial reparations. Instead, we have the Glasgow Climate Pact, and this pact is not enough.While early drafts of the pact talked about 'phasing out' fossil fuels, last minute opposition meant the wording of text changed from 'phasing out' to 'phasing down'. Watering down the language of the final draft is highly significant, 'phasing down' can mean anything from curbing emissions from 0.1% to 50%.Secondly, the Glasgow Climate Pact does not deliver justice for the world's most vulnerable countries.In Cop15 in 2009, it was agreed that developed countries would provide $100 billion per year to fund developing nations. Cop26 did not close this gap.While the Glasgow Climate Pact may not have gone as far as we would have liked, we must recognise that to disregard the pact as a failure undermines significant commitments made by some countries to further progress. Climate finance was undoubtedly a major topic of discussion in Glasgow, and wealthy states and developed countries have committed to doubling climate adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025.The £ccelerating efforts' of developed countries to limit coal use are also politically significant. Indeed, Cop26 is the first time that 197 countries have universally acknowledged the harmful impact of fossil fuels and coal. Countries will also strengthen their 2030 climate plans next year.Loss and damage funding - established to help countries already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis - is also a topic which will be revisited next year. With negotiations dragging on in Glasgow, vulnerable nations were forced to accept this decision in order to move the talks forward.Putting off funding commitments for loss and damage until next year is deeply unfair. The climate crisis has injured, displaced and destroyed communities around the world.Loss and damage reparations is one of the most pressing topics on our global agenda, and should have been the first issue which was addressed and resolved in Glasgow.Where establishing an international loss and damage fund has been put off in the name of 'compromise', emotionally-charged statements from the Informal Plenary on Friday reveals how the only thing being compromised is our future.'The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us', in the words of the Maldives. 'We are negotiating our very existence', in the words of Bangladesh. '1.5 degrees is not a statistic, it's a matter of life and death', in the words of Kenya.Following this Cop, the projected level of warming is 2.4 degrees. Despite pledges 'to keep 1.5 alive', we are not even close. Those disappointed and outraged by the outcome of Cop26 have every right to be angry. After two gruelling weeks of intense negotiations, many of us have been stretched beyond our capacities.However, even in these challenging months to come, we must keep up the momentum. We must choose to persevere. We must continue to hold our governments to account. We must rise to the next level of our abilities.Rosalind Skillen is a climate activist and Cop26 delegate'Loss and damage reparations is one of the most pressing topics on our agenda'\l"

An International Energy Agency analysis late last week suggested that we are currently on target for 1.8C when the new pledges are taken into account. It's not 1.5 (yet) but it's closer then we've ever been before.So, progress is being made but there is no shortage of bad news.We hear in talk after talk of the impact of climate change today on countries that were struggling even before global warming and severe weather events hit. Elizabeth Robinson of the London School of Economics highlighted in one session how undernourishment in Ethiopia had decreased from 47% in 2002 to 14% in 2016 before increasing to 16% in 2020.Gains in human health outcomes across many developing nations are being eroded by the impact of climate change on crop production and this erosion will continue.""Climate change makes everything harder,"" said Prof Robinson.As we adapt food production to a changing climate there are legitimate concerns that natural ecosystems will continue to be lost to make way for agriculture.

After two or three days it became apparent the swans were hatching this year's brood of cygnets. Both the male and female will incubate the eggs for up to 40 days then the young will emerge into the cool and clear early summer river of life.Seeing the swans each day gives me a great delight. I do not go near them. They are in their world and I am in mine, so it would seem, but that is not so for we all live in this shared world.The imagination of the world created the beauty of the swans. The imagination of man created the bridge I travelled over. It is a worthy addition to this world but our imagination has also created other things, dark things that can threaten those young cygnets. They are the inheritors of a world that is changing, a world that needs action and thoughts of different kinds.Perhaps it was the swans, perhaps it was nature at its most beautiful, but I have taken to reading the collected speeches of Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist.Greta's school strikes, starting in August 2018 when she was 15, began outside the Swedish parliament with a call for stronger action on climate change by her own government.However, in this digital age, word soon spread, and Fridays for Future was born, when young people around the world protested on Fridays in a call for greater climate action.Thunberg, who is a plain and direct speaker, something that I greatly admired in reading her speeches, rose to public prominence quite quickly and by December 2018 gave an address at the UN climate change conference. In 2019 the protest movement became a major one, with millions attending events.The movement caught many by surprise and brought for the first time the children of the world into the debate on climate change.Thunberg had the ability, as she says herself through her self-titled ""gift"" of Asperger's syndrome, to see things in a different way - to coalesce the, at times, complex issues of climate change and emissions into simple dialogue.She has become the symbol and voice for the change we need.In her speech ""I'm too young to do this"", she addresses the fact that some people think she has over-simplified - she just wants the emissions of greenhouse gases to stop.The question, as Thunberg outl"

However, while the 2015 agreement set 2C as the minimum, it included language that suggested countries should push for a more ambitious goal: 1.5C.A preliminary draft of the COP26 agreement released on Wednesday ""reaffirms"" the Paris agreement's goal: limiting warming to well below 2C and pursuing a target of 1.5C. But it does not commit to meeting the 1.5C threshold.The difference between the two targets may seem small, but they represent divergent outcomes for the planet.Some experts doubt that 1.5C remains achievable. Evidence shows that the two targets also represent different scenarios for the climate's impact on human life. A study released on Tuesday by the UK Met Office, Britain's national weather service, found that one billion people could face heat stress, a potentially fatal combination of heat and humidity, if temperatures rise by 2C.""The higher the level of warming, the more severe and widespread the risks to people's lives, but it is still possible to avoid these higher risks if we act now,"" said Richard Betts, one of the leaders of the project.The latter had included non-binding language that referenced ""the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius"".Nearly 200 countries signed onto the agreement in Paris, which was adopted in 2015 and took effect in 2016. Under the accord, countries would set their own emission reduction targets and plans to reach those targets, but agreed to the long-term temperature goal to limit ""the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels"".Countries would also pursue ""efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change,"" according to the text.The two targets, one firm and one aspirational, represented a fierce policy debate. Developing countries had been pushing to set a rise of 1.5C as a target for years. Small island nations were often the most vocal in their support, pointing to the existential threat they faced.Around the world, many adopted the slogan ""1.5 to stay alive"".Has there been a movement toward a 1.5C target?The Paris agreement represented a significant shift. More than 100 countries expressed support for a target of 1.5C, including for the first time some major emitters. Notably, the United States got on board, joining a group called the High Ambition Coalition founded by the Marshall Islands in 2014.Scientific pressure played a role in the change. In a paper published during COP21, Nature Geoscience stated that ""no scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the 2C target as a safe level of warming, and indeed, this is not a problem that science alone can address"".But there remained some scepticism, with oil and gas-producing Saudi Arabia among the countries pushing back on the more ambitious targets. Some officials argued that countries should keep to the less ambitious target so that countries were not set up for failure.President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement and promoted the use of fossil fuels. Under President Joe Biden the United States has not only rejoined that agreement but also the group of nations that say that 1.5C should be the standard. What does the science say about the difference between 1.5C and 2C warming? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body responsible for assessing the scientific research on climate change, has warned that even an increase of 1.5C of global warming would result in significant differences, with increased heatwaves and short cold seasons.At 2C, however, the changes will be more profound. ""With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger,"" the IPCC wrote in a report released earlier this year that evaluated more than 14,000 papers. The IPCC has found that an extreme heat event that would have occurred once per decade in a climate without human influence would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5C of warming. It would occur 5.6 times at 2C.Other events such as heavy precipitation or drought would also increase.The IPCC also noted that it was very likely that the relative sea level will continue to rise throughout the 21st century and beyond, and the level it rises will be affected significantly by the level of climate change.If temperatures are confined to an increase of 1.5C, over the next 2,000 years, sea levels could rise by as much as 10 feet.But it could be double that if temperatures grow by 2C, the IPCC research found, and potentially worse if ice sheets in Antarctica become even more destabilised.What are we at now? A Washington Post analysis of multiple data sets has found that Earth has already warmed more than 1C on average over the past century. Some places may already have seen rises of 2C.In their latest report, the IPCC estimated that under the current scenario, the world would be likely to hit the 1.5C threshold by 2040.Under the most optimistic scenario presented in the report, global temperatures would reach 1.5C by the middle of the century and then drop back down as emissions were cut further, potentially averting some of the worst outcomes.But under the worst scenario envisaged by the IPCC, the best estimate was that the world will probably see a rise of 4.4C by the end of the century - with an extremely detrimental impact for life on Earth.

In my view, we need to make people travel less.""A lot of people are making unnecessary journeys in the first place and, as a result of Covid, hybrid working will help with that.

We're in the middle of a climate crisis and we need to be bold in our thinking.""On Wednesday, Ms Mallon signed the Glasgow Declaration, on behalf of the Executive. The declaration involves signatories agreeing that they will work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero-emission vehicles by no later than 2035.With such initiatives requiring investment if they are to be achievable, Ms Mallon said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is bring- ing forward a private member's bill at Westminster that includes measures to help this.The Infrastructure Minister was also asked what she will take away from her time at the conference.""I was at an event yesterday where the Scottish Transport Minister Graeme Dey was saying that sometimes people think that because some places are small, they can't contribute a lot to climate action, but actually they can,"" she said.""In Northern Ireland we have opportunities that don't present themselves in other places, such as our publicly-owned public transport network and water provider.

""All sectors must play their part, but some can go faster than others.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland259","COP26: Failure is not an option","October 30, 2021 Saturday 9:12 AM GMT","RTE News","This weekend, world leaders start a series of intensive meetings - first in Rome, then in Glasgow - to try and limit man-made climate change. The main event is known as COP26, the latest in a series of United Nations meetings which is being held to co-ordinate action against climate change. But what are they trying to agree on?Stopping the planet overheating by stopping so-called greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. It is easy to say - but really difficult to achieve in practice, because of the upheaval in the lives of so many that it entails. Not to mention the cost.But failure is not an option.Our planet is heating up - and we are heading for catastrophe if we don't stop it.Climate change is causing severe weather events, changing habitats, killing off animals and plants, causing environmental degradation and mass migration, as humans leave regions uninhabitable.The big driver of climate change has been human activity - particularly burning fossil fuels for energy. The pollution from all that burning puts carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which causes the temperature to rise. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/Latest climate newsOur challenge is to stop the bad stuff happening without destroying our economies and undermining human progress.It is a monster political headache - but the United Nations has been co-ordinating governments around the world to take action to stop climate change and the environmental damage it is causing. Through a series of UN conferences of the parties - COPs for short - governments have agreed action plans, notably in Kyoto and Paris, to try and limit global warming. This stuff is so difficult that without the public pressure of a massively-hyped conference like the COP, it probably would not get done.In political terms, the governments of the world all hold hands and jump together.Top-level targetsThe whole process is managed by a couple of top-level targets: a temperature change target, a ""net zero"" target, and constantly updated national action plans to hit those targets.Six years ago in Paris, at COP21, the Governments agreed a binding treaty to keep global warming below 2C, and, ideally, at 1.5C by the end of this century.To meet the temperature target, governments made a series of national climate change plans, to cut back on carbon pollution.But when those plans were added up by the UN, they found they would produce a global temperature rise of 2.7C - far from the 1.5C target.So now they have to come back and make a plan to do more - and that's the point of this meeting in Glasgow.The scientific consensus is that a really steep cut in carbon emissions is needed over the remaining years of this decade to keep the 1.5C target alive.Hitting the temperature target by the end of the century effectively means no new emissions of greenhouse gases by the middle of the century - an objective known as net zero.Any slippage means more pollution in the short term, making it harder to catch up later on.UN scientists say a bigger effort this decade will make it easier to hit the target over the long run.How big of an effort? Well last year's Covid lockdowns around the world caused carbon dioxide emissions to fall by just over 5%. However, it has bounced back up again, in l"

It is much bigger than that'; Cop26 is a unique opportunity to reshape humanity's relationship to the ....","November 1, 2021 Monday","The Irish Times","We have left it late. But it is not yet too late. In the first of those truths lies the justification for fear. In the second lies the possibility of hope. The Cop26 summit on climate change crystallises a moment when the fate of humanity hovers between these realities.It is all too easy to be overwhelmed by terror and despair. The first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published in 1990. It laid out very clearly the catastrophic consequences of continuing to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Yet global greenhouse gas emissions are on course to be 16 per cent higher by the end of this decade compared to 2010.Thirty years of failure to heed the warnings raises grim questions. Are our political systems so corrupted and dominated by those who have vested interests in the carbon economy that they cannot act in the collective interest? Are our imaginations so limited that we have to see apocalyptic fires and biblical floods before we truly believe what is happening?There has been an abundance of sheer malignity: Donald Trump's assaults on science and truth; Jair Bolsonaro's savaging of the Amazon rainforest; Rupert Murdoch's systematic support for climate denialism. There has been the more subtle propaganda of the big carbon producers, the false reassurance of greenwashing. And there is the gravitational pull of mere inertia, the million immediacies that obscure the wider canvas of existential necessity.These forces have driven us very close to the edge. The last decade has been the hottest on earth for 125,000 years. It is now, according to the IPCC, a virtual certainty that the world will experience within the next two decades 1.5 degrees of heating over pre-industrial levels. Some of the forces we have set in motion, like rising sea levels and the retreat of glaciers, will not be reversed for centuries to come.We are living in the future we were warned against. There is little doubt that in 2031 we will be looking back on this year's weather-related disasters with a degree of nostalgia.Yet despair is both disabling and unwarranted. Those gathering in Glasgow must not allow themselves to succumb to the two most wistful words in the language: if only. It is sadly true that they can look back over the last 30 years and sigh that if only their governments had acted sooner, humanity would not be at this moment of crisis.But that realisation must galvanise their determination that their successors will not look back in 30 years' time and utter those same words with a much deeper sense of anguish.Seeing the damage as clearly as they do now, they must act to limit it. They must commit themselves - not on paper but in reality - to cuts of at least 50 per cent in carbon emissions over the rest of this decade and their complete elimination by 2050.They have the power to do so: rapid, co-ordinated and transformational action can ensure that heating is kept to 1.5 degrees by the end of this century. The technologies needed for this transformation are already well developed. The science is increasingly difficult even for the worst deceivers to deny. Above all, people the world over now understand that the price of passivity is infinitely higher than the cost of change. Cop26 is not a chance for global leaders to make history. It is much bigger than that. It is their one-off opportunity to reshape humanity's relationship to the natural world. The idea that our species can and should dominate and exploit nature has driven the progress of civilisation. It has now reached its end point: the realisation that if we treat the world as material to be burned we ourselves will be consumed in that fire.In this end must be a beginning. This conference can be the start of a new epoch of interdependence, one in which we finally accept that no country can prosper without the others and that no species - even one as arrogant as ours - can afford to be careless of the fate of all the others.James Connolly, in a very different context, wrote that ""our demands most moderate are, /We only want the earth."" That is all that humanity demands now of those who hold its fate in their hands. \l"

Ruairi Brogan is a climate campaigner with UK Youth Climate Coalition (UKYCC) and works as a policy officer at RSPB NI. He is attending COP28 in Glasgow and shares how we can all make a difference to our environment. How important is an event like COP26? COP28 is huge. It is going to push governments from every corner of the planet to really do more to tackle climate change. The heat is on, particularly here in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK and Ireland without climate legislation. Do we appreciate our environment? What, if anything, gives you hope for the future?I think we do. COVID made a lot of people, like myself, get stuck back into nature. From birdwatching, to close encounters with seals up the North Coast!But a lot of people are unaware of how much their actions impact the climate and natural world. Like how Northern Ireland is the 12th worst country in the world for biodiversity loss and the 13th worst for carbon emissions per person.I hope for a world teeming with wildlife where my children won't have to worry about the land failing to produce any food.We still have a mountain to climb but the momentum coming from youth movements fills me with excitement and hope as well as working with organisations like RSPB and UKYCC. Future leaders like that won't let this continue.What do you hope comes from COP26?The momentum building around COP is inspiring me and will hopefully lead to more people having many great conversations, just like this one, as well as taking action, whether it's making changes at home or attending the Global Day of Action Rally on November 8.But this is only part of the story. Governments must match their words with action, stop committing to new fossil fuel projects and invest in ambitious green recovery plans.Can you give us some information about your role within UKYCC?I am an organiser in the Systems Change Group at UK Youth Climate Coalition. That means I work to change how we operate within our current economic system, which is based on perpetual growth at all costs.In fact, most of our environmental problems and social injustices come from unsustainable growth, and it has to stop. We raise money to get young people from the Global South to COP and call out the hypocrisy of governments and businesses as they try everything to continue making money during these emergencies.What is the one thing we can all do is effect lasting change?Use your voice and your vote! With the NI Assembly elections coming up next year, it's time to start thinking about who best represents a strong positive change for nature and climate action.How can we encourage those who seem less than interested in being more involved in climate change?Absolutely everyone can do something to help revive our world. Climate actions can simply be making small changes to your day that will benefit the planet. Things like eating less but better meat or committing to only using peat-free compost for your garden can reduce your carbon emissions and conserve our countryside.There are a growing number of green jobs out there for young people which can really make a difference.I have started a new role as policy officer for RSPB NI and it's absolutely brilliant getting to work doing what I love - saving nature and the tackling climate change.To get involved and join the Global Day of Action on November 6, 2021 go to bit.ly/GDACTION21'There are a growing number of green jobs which can really make a difference'\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland268","Last seven years have been the hottest on record, experts warn","November 1, 2021 Monday","Irish Independent","THE last seven years have been the hottest on record - with sea levels rising to new highs and climate-related destructive weather extremes in 2021, UN experts have said.In its annual state of the global climate report launched as the UN COP26 summit got under way, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said that 2021 is likely to have been the fifth to seventh hottest year on record.While it is not quite as hot as some recent years, due to a 'La Nina' weather phenomenon in the Pacific - which has a cooling effect on global temperatures - it still averaged 1.09C above preindustrial levels, the WMO said.The last seven years since 2015, when countries secured the Paris Agreement to curb temperature rises to 1.5C or well below 2C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, have been the hottest in records dating back to 1850.And the UK's Met Office warned the world's temperature has reached an average exceeding 1C above pre-industrial levels for the past two decades, the first time a 20-year period has been at that level since the records began.The average global temperature for 2002-2021 was 1.01C above pre-industrial levels, the scientists said.UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called for the COP26 talks, where leaders are under pressure to keep the 1.5C temperature limit within reach with more action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, to be a ""turning point for people and planet"".Communities and natural systems around the world were being devastated, he warned, as he urged leaders to act.""The door is open; the solutions are there. COP26 must be a turning point. We must act now - with ambition and solidarity - to safeguard our future and save humanity,"" he said.And WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said extreme events ""are the new normal"", with mounting evidence that some bear the footprint of human-induced climate change.At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, temperatures by the end of the century would be far in excess of the Paris goals, he said.""COP26COP26 will be essential to protect all of us and the planet.""Among the findings in the WMO assessment are that temperatures from January to September 2021 were around 1.09C above the 1850-1900 period, with a moderate La Nina reducing temperatures early in the year, but with temperatures rising as the La Nina faded.The last seven years, 2015-2021, are on track to be the hottest seven years on record.Sea level rise has increased from an average of 2.1mm a year between 1993-2000 to 4.4mm a year between 2013-2021, mostly due to a speed up in the loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets.And Arctic sea ice cover was below the average for 1981-2010, while Antarctic sea ice was close to the average.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland272","Climate change and Cop26: what are the economic stakes?","October 31, 2021 Sunday 8:36 AM GMT","BreakingNews.ie","Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow starting on Sunday may be the world's last chance to cap global warming at the 1.5-2 degrees Celsius upper limit set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.The stakes for the planet are huge - among them the impact on economic livelihoods the world over and the future stability of the global financial system.Here are 10 climate change-related questions that economic policy-makers are trying to answer:1. How much does climate change cost?From floods and fires to conflict and migration: economic models struggle with the many possible knock-on effects from global warming. The ballpark IMF estimate is that unchecked warming would shave 7 per cent off world output by 2100.The Network for Greening the Financial System (NFGS) group of world central banks puts it even higher - 13 per cent. In a Reuters poll of economists, the median figure for the output loss in that scenario was 18 per cent.Advertisement2. Where is the impact going to be felt the hardest?Clearly, the developing world. Much of the world's poor live in the tropical or low-lying regions already suffering climate change fall-out like droughts or rising sea levels.Moreover their countries rarely have the resources to mitigate such damage. The NFGS report projects overall output losses of above 15 per cent for much of Asia and Africa, rising to 20 per cent in the Sahel countries.Climate change will drive up to 132 million more people into extreme poverty by 2030, a World Bank paper last year concluded.Factors included lost farming income; lower outdoor labour productivity; rising food prices; increased disease; and economic losses from extreme weather.4. How much will it cost to fix?Advocates of early action say the sooner you start the better.The widely used NiGEM macroeconomic forecast model even suggests an early start would offer small net gains for output thanks to the big investments needed in green infrastructure. The same model warns of output losses of up to 3 per cent in last-minute transition scenarios.

Who loses out in a net-zero carbon world?Primarily, anyone with fossil fuel exposure. A report by think tank Carbon Tracker in September estimated that over $1 trillion of business-as-usual investment by the oil and gas sector would no longer be viable in a genuinely low-carbon world.Moreover the IMF has called for the end of all fossil fuel subsidies - which it calculates at $5 trillion annually if defined to include undercharging for supply, environmental and health costs. 6. What should carbon really cost?AdvertisementTax or permit schemes that try to price in the damage done by emissions create incentives to go green. But so far only a fifth of global carbon emissions are covered by such programmes, pricing carbon on average at a mere $3 a tonne.That's well below the $75/tonne the IMF says is needed to cap global warming at well below 2 degrees. The Reuters poll of economists recommended $100/tonne.7. Wouldn't that lead to inflation?Anything which factors in the polluting cost of fossil fuels is likely to lead to price rises in some sectors - aviation for example. That could in turn lead to what central banks define as inflation - broad-based and durable price rises across the whole economy.Yet history shows this hasn't necessarily been the case: carbon taxes introduced in Canada and Europe pushed overall prices lower because they cut into household income and hence consumer demand, a recent study showed.8. Are green advances really decoupling emissions from economic growth?Genuinely sustainable growth implies that economic activity can grow as needed without adding yet more emissions. This is the holy grail of ""absolute decoupling"".But so far, any decoupling has either been largely relative - in the sense of merely achieving higher rates of economic growth than gains in emissions - or achieved by shifting dirty production from one national territory to another. And that is why, for now, global emissions are still rising.

Who bears the brunt of transition?The idea of ""Just Transition"" has been espoused by bodies such as the European Union to acknowledge that the transition to net-zero should happen fairly - for example by ensuring low-income groups are not made worse-off.At a global scale, the rich countries which since their industrial revolutions have generated the bulk of emissions have promised to help developing countries transition via $100 billion of annual transfers - a promise so far not fulfilled.10. Could this spark a financial crisis?The global financial system needs to be insulated against both the physical risks of climate change itself and the upheavals likely to happen during a transition to net-zero.Central banks and national treasuries are calling on banks and other financial players to come clean about the exposure of their books to such risks. The ECB and other regulators have made it clear there is a long way to go on this.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland273","Cop26 has raised expectations but what is required to avoid the climate cliff edge?; 'Will we be seen as a people who knew we had a problem and fixed it for man....","October 30, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","For some, warnings about the cataclysmic climate threat facing the world can sound endlessly repetitive, but scientists' warnings about the dangers that lie ahead are getting more and more stark.As the Cop26Latest indications of ""Code Red for humanity"" - as described by UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres - came this week from the UN Environment Programme (Unep) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).The Unep 2021 ""emissions gap"" report highlighted glaring gaps between countries promises and their emissions, while the WMO measures greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.The promises made to date to cut emissions by 2030 would still leave the world 2.7 degrees hotter by the end of the century, resulting in an irreversible catastrophe and making most of the Earth unliveable, the Unep warns. Despite all of the talk, current pledges would reduce carbon by only about 7.5 per cent by 2030, far less than the 55 per cent needed to keep temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees.Guterres described the findings as a ""thundering wake-up call"" to world leaders as they gather in Glasgow, while climate experts demanded drastic action against fossil fuel companies. Failure, as of now, to get all G20 countries - responsible for 80 per cent of emissions - on board is a bad omen, with the current energy crisis forcing some back to using coal.Previously, the Unep has warned that planned production of oil, coal and gas over the next decade is ""dangerously"" out of sync with climate change targets already made, never mind new ones. Ireland in the shade Ireland has made some of the most ambitious pledges, promising to cut emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 and to hit net zero by 2050 - but ranks a poorly 80th out of 193 countries when it come to rhetoric meeting reality.""If everyone in the world had the same per-capita emissions as Ireland, the planet would already have warmed by a catastrophic 3 degrees,"" noted Dr Hannah Daly of MaREI energy research centre in UCC.Global concentrations of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas, are now 50 per cent higher than before the Industrial Revolution which sparked mass burning of fossil fuels, the WMO bulletin confirmed. Methane levels have more than doubled since 1750. All key greenhouse gasses rose faster in 2020 than the average for the previous decade. Despite coronavirus lockdowns, they hit record levels in 2020.Calling this week for much greater urgency, Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University, a lead author in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report offered a bleak assessment. Humans have pushed the climate system to a state not seen in thousands of years - arguably, not seen since the peak of the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago.All of human development has happened during ""a remarkably quiescent"" climate period on Earth but that is changing and ""all of the warming is down to us. It's not a question of how much; it's all of it,"" said Thorne this week.""Greenhouse gas emissions, sadly, despite of 30 years of negotiations, are still stubbornly going upwards. That is not a good look if we want to stabilise the climate, we have to get down,"" he added. Warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees, but that means half of CO2 now produced annually will have to be taken out of the atmosphere every year from 2050 onwards. ""That is a very risky bet. The longer we continue to emit carbon dioxide, the more we will have to draw down later to limit warming to 1.5."" And it's not just CO2, nitrous oxide must be reduced and methane halved by the middle of this century: ""Each action, every bit of warming matters,"" according to the IPCC - and failure is not an option. Climate action should have started 30 years ago, he suggested. ""We would have had a gentle glide path. The longer we leave it the steeper the cliff is getting and that cliff is already terrifying steep. If we leave it longer it will become impossible . . . We will be committed to expensive solutions to bring us back after a period of overshoot."" However, the ""good news"" is the climate can be stabilised within our lifetimes: ""We can stabilise rainfall; temperature, other aspects - the fast responding aspects of the climate system,"" said Thorne.However, the ""slow-acting"" consequences of climate change - the rise in sea levels, ice sheet collapse, ocean warming - cannot be stopped by humans on the planet today. ""Those are a multigenerational commitment. If we don't act soon, we will be committing on a multigenerational two to 10,000-years basis to tens of metres of sea level rise."" And it is not something that will trouble people living in faraway places, said Thorne: ""Many of this island's great cities would not be viable under that level of sea level rise.""The fundamental question in his view is: ""Will we be seen as a people who knew we had a problem and fixed it quickly to make it liveable for many generations hence? Or will we be the damned?"" Prof Euan Nisbet based in Royal Holloway, London, backs that verdict. ""Greenhouse gas measurements are like skidding into a car crash. You can clearly see the crash ahead, and all you can do is howl."" The ""extreme"" growth in methane emissions is especially worrying, he said - figures are now rising faster than ever suggests the warming [is] feeding the warming. Diplomatic efforts US president Joe Biden desperately wants to lead collective global action on climate in Glasgow, but his domestic agenda is stuttering so he faces credibility issues in Glasgow.

After some last-minute compromises on coal, a revised agreement was reached, which is the most ambitious climate pact since Paris 2015. The deal aims to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.The COP26Companies-large and small -will also need to take steps to ramp up their sustainability efforts to help reduce negative environmental impacts.Building a more sustainable business At Alexion, sustainability is at the forefront of everything we do, not least manufacturing, to minimise negative environmental impacts while conserving energy and natural resources.""We all need to be good stewards of our environment and planet,""says Shane Doyle, Senior Vice President and Head of Operations at Alexion. ""As a pharmaceutical company, we have an obligation to our patients, employees and communities to develop innovative medicines and solutions in the most responsible way.""In late July, Alexion Pharmaceuticals joined AstraZeneca creating Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease, which is the group within AstraZeneca focused on rare diseases. As a leader in rare diseases for nearly 30 years, Alexion's mission is to transform the lives of people affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions through the development and delivery of innovative medicines, as well as through supportive technologies and healthcare services.Building toward a sustainable future ""We have done a lot of great work around sustainability and our carbon footprint. Alexion's recent integration with AstraZeneca will really allow us to take this work to the next level enabling us to achieve our sustainability ambitions,"" says Michael Teehan, Vice President and Head of Integrated Manufacturing for Alexion.In 2020, AstraZeneca launched Ambition Zero Carbon, committing to become zero carbon by 2025 across operations (sites and fleet) without carbon credits and carbon negative in its value chain by 2030. These greenhouse gas targets exceed the science based targets initiative reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which was signed at the 2015 COP meeting.During COP26During the next three years, Alexion will move at an even faster pace in sustainability and has joined Project Energize with AstraZeneca in pursuing a science-based sustainability strategy, Teehan says.""We all have an obligation to the world we live in to give it the best chance for the long term,"" he adds. ""The less we rely on fossil fuels now, the better off we will be in the future.""AstraZeneca is establishing a next-generation active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility for small molecules at the College Park Campus in Dublin.

But the National Ambulance Service, which does tests for government ministers and officials in cases where they are required for official business, administered a second test, which yesterday was revealed to be negative.The HSE said second tests are sometimes administered where the result is deemed ""ambiguous"". It is understood the case for carrying out a second test was added to by Mr Ryan having no symptoms and not being in any way associated with other cases of the virus in his direct contacts.A HSE spokesman said they could not comment on any individual case. But he said there were general criteria for carrying out a second test.""In certain instances, where clinically indicated, a repeat test may be recommended for an individual. This is typically based on a discussion between the testing laboratory and the person requesting the test, and takes into account a number of factors, such as the laboratory result itself, including viral targets detected etc, the reason for the test, and the condition of the person having the test performed,"" the senior HSE official said.Health service sources said that second tests ""happen pretty regularly"" - especially in cases where a person does not have any Covid-19 symptoms. Cases where the first result is deemed to be on the lower end of the infection scale are also a reason for a second test.In a statement issued yesterday, Mr Ryan said that following his initial positive test result for Covid-19 on Saturday, he received notification from the HSE that a second test was recommended. The result of this test showed that Covid-19 was not detected.""The public health advice in this instance is that the case is de-notified, close contacts are informed and the person can continue about their business. Minister Ryan now plans to travel to Glasgow for COP26 tomorrow,"" the statement said..""On receipt of the initial result, he followed all HSE protocols including self-isolation and informing close contacts.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland277","Pledges pave way forward but details to be determined; Big promises bode well as India and China enter into spirit of saving planet","November 3, 2021 Wednesday","The Irish Times","As he prepared to leave Glasgow last night after two apparently successful days at the Cop26 climate summit, Boris Johnson warned against succumbing to false hope. But the meeting had a better start than many predicted, bringing more than 100 countries together behind two important pledges on methane emissions and deforestation. Activists and experts were quick to note correctly that neither of the pledges - to cut global methane emissions by 30 per cent, and to end and reverse deforestation - are binding and the pledge to reverse deforestation is not unlike a promise made in 2014. The difference is that while 40 countries signed the 2014 pledge, more than twice as many have made the commitment this week. Clearing forests The signatories, which include countries like Canada, China, Indonesia and Brazil, account for more than 85 per cent of the world's forests. There will be significant financial incentives to avoid clearing forests and pressure on investors to avoid companies that profit from deforestation. The third big event during the leaders' summit was Narendra Modi's announcement that India would cut its emissions to net zero by 2070, two decades later than the goal set by Cop26. The date may be less important, however, than the fact it is the first time that India has set a target for net zero.India is the fourth-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, although its huge population means its per capita emissions are lower than in other big countries. Modi promises to get half of India's energy from renewable sources by 2030 and to cut carbon emissions by a billion tonnes by the same date. Modi's visibility in Glasgow was more noticeable for the absence of China's President Xi Jinping, who has not left his country since the start of the pandemic. China has promised to bring its emissions to a peak by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2060, 10 years later than the Cop26 goal. As Johnson pointed out in his press conference yesterday evening, China's size and economic power mean that it will make a huge difference if its emissions peak as early as 2025. And its commitment to stop financing coal-fired power projects overseas will impact on the use of coal in parts of Europe as well as Asia. With the leaders gone, negotiators will spend the next two weeks working on the details that will determine the success of and the real value of the politicians' pledges.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland279","Nations vow to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030","November 2, 2021 Tuesday 10:23 PM GMT","RTE News","More than 100 countries have joined an effort led by the United States and the European Union to slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels, an initiative aimed at tackling one of the main causes of climate change.Methane is the main greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. It has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but breaks down in the atmosphere faster - meaning that cutting methane emissions can have a rapid impact in reining in global warming.The Global Methane Pledge, launched at the COP26 summit in Glasgow today after being announced in September, now covers countries representing nearly half of global methane emissions and 70% of global GDP, US President Joe Biden said.""Together, we're committing to collectively reduce our methane by 30% by 2030. And I think we can probably go beyond that,"" Mr Biden said at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.""It's going to boost our economies, saving companies money, reducing methane leaks, capturing methane to turn it into new revenue streams, as well as creating good paying union jobs for our workers.""Among the new signatories was Brazil - one of the world's biggest emitters of methane. The pledge now includes six of the world's 10 biggest methane emitters: the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Mexico.China, Russia, India and Iran, also top-10 methane emitters, have not signed up. Those countries were all included on a list identified as targets to join the pledge, first reported by Reuters. ""Methane is one of the gases we can cut fastest. Doing that will immediately slow down climate change,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.Since it was first announced in September with a handful of signatories, the United States and the European Union have worked to get the world's biggest methane emitters to join the partnership. There were roughly 60 countries signed up only last week, after a final diplomatic push from the United States and EU ahead of the COP26 summit.While it is not part of the formal UN negotiations, the methane pledge could rank among the most significant outcomes from the conference, given its potential impact in holding off disastrous climate change. A UN report in May said steep cuts in methane emissions this decade could avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming by the 2040s. Failing to tackle methane, however, would push out of reach the 2015 Paris Agreement's objective to limit the global rise in temperature to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The 30% methane cut, which is not legally binding, would be jointly achieved by the signatories, and cover all sectors. Key sources of methane emissions include leaky oil and gas infrastructure, old coal mines, agriculture and landfill sites.If fulfilled, the pledge is likely to have the biggest impact on the energy sector, since analysts say fixing leaky oil and gas infrastructure is the fastest and cheapest way to curb methane emissions. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/cop26/Latest COP26 newsThe United States is the world's biggest oil and natural gas producer, while the EU is the biggest importer of gas.Separately, the United States unveiled its own sweeping proposal today to crack down on methane emissions with a focus on the oil and gas sector. The main regulation could take effect as soon as 2023 and slash methane from oil and gas operations by 74% from 2005 levels by 2035, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.The EU and Canada both plan to unveil methane legislation addressing the energy sector later this year.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland280","Major cities will be submerged if we don't act now; Antonio Guterres","April 6, 2022 Wednesday","Irish Independent","THIS week's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a litany of broken climate promises. Together with the IPCC's previous two reports on physical science and adaptation in the past year, it reveals the yawning gap between climate pledges and reality.The reality is that we are speeding toward disastrous global warming of more than double the limit of 1.5C by 2100, as cited in the Paris agreement of 2016.In concrete terms, this means major cities under water, unprecedented heat waves, terrifying storms, widespread water shortages, and the extinction of one million species of plants and animals.So far, high-emitting governments and corporations are not just turning a blind eye; they are adding fuel to the flames by continuing to invest in climate-choking industries. Scientists warn that we are already perilously close to tipping points that could lead to cascading and irreversible climate effects.The new IPCC report arrives in a period of extraordinary global political and economic turbulence that has further jeopardised efforts to address climate change.Energy prices spiked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting several nations to increase fossil-fuel production. In the long run, that will only make matters worse.Leaders who claim to be protecting their people by doubling down on fossil fuels are doing the exact opposite: throwing their people to the wolves of energy insecurity, price volatility and climate chaos.The IPCC report lays out a saner, safer approach, one that would get the world back on track by using renewable solutions that provide green jobs, energy security and greater price stability.This report is a blueprint to bring us back to the 1.5C pledge that nearly 200 nations made in Paris and renewed at the gathering in Glasgow, Scotland, last November.We left Scotland with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments. But the main problem - the enormous, growing emissions gap - was all but ignored.The science is clear. To keep the 1.5C limit within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45pc this decade. But current climate pledges would mean a 14pc increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfil even these inadequate promises.That is why this latest IPCC report is focused on mitigation - cutting emissions. It sets out viable, financially sound options in every sector.First and foremost, we must triple the speed of the shift to renewable energy. That means moving investments and subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables - now. In most cases, renewables are already cheaper.It means governments ending the funding of coal, not just abroad, but at home. The financing of all forms of coal extraction, production and power generation everywhere must be stopped.To support major emerging economies in making this shift, I have been advocating for climate coalitions, made up of developing and developed countries, multilateral development banks, private financial institutions and corporations with the technical know-how to help.All of us have a role to play in the shift to green energy. Young people, civil society and indigenous communities are among those who have stepped up, sounding the alarm and holding leaders accountable. We now need to build on their work to create a worldwide grassroots movement that no one can ignore.I hereby appeal directly to everyone with an interest in our planet and our future: make your voice heard, wherever decisions are taken - in political debates, local authorities, boardrooms and at the ballot box.The decisions governments make today will determine the future of achieving the 1.5C limit. A shift to renewables will mend our broken global energy mix and offer hope to millions of people already suffering from the impact of climate change.Climate promises and plans must be turned into reality and action, now. It is time to stop burning our planet and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us. (\£9 Washington Post) Antonio Guterres is secretarygeneral of the United Nations\l"

Covid, that deserved to be treated like the crisis that it was. Now we have the Ukrainian crisis and that deserves to be treated like the crisis that it is.``But the climate crisis has not gone away throughout all of this.``We are here today to put the climate conversation right back on the map, right back in your face, because we are actually running out of time.''Anya Bazilo, from Kyiv in Ukraine, also spoke to protesters as she waved a Ukrainian flag.She fled from her city to join family in Ireland following the outbreak of war.``You see a smile on my face, because I see your amazing energy and your amazing smiles and your look into the future that you want to live in.``A beautiful, safe environment for all of us - for Ireland, for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world.``Thank you very much for putting a smile on my face for the first time. Thank you.''Protests took place across the island, with climate protesters also gathering in Cork, Galway and Belfast.At the protest in Belfast, Kay Laverty, from Fridays for Future Northern Ireland, challenged Stormont politicians to make good on commitments to reduce emissions legislated for in the recent Climate Change Act.Ms Laverty said activists viewed the measures agreed by global leaders at Cop26 in Glasgow last year as insufficient, branding the event ``Flop26''.Addressing the climate strike protest in Belfast, Green Party NI deputy leader Mal O'Hara said climate deniers were now climate delayers.``They laughed at us when as an environmental movement 40 years ago we started talking about the dangers of climate change and its impact on our natural world and on our people,'' he told the crowd that gathered in the city centre for the demo.``They laughed at us, they ignored us, now those who used to be deniers are only delayers and we will not let them delay us as we demand a more just, fair and greener world.'' end\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland288","Glasgow Climate Pact falls short on human rights; Compensation for countries impacted by climate change caused by industrialised nations remains a topic for dia....","November 20, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","The crisis of climate change risks irrevocably damaging the planet and biodiversity - and all of us will be affected by the challenge of mitigating it. The UN Environment Programme has described what we are facing as a ""triple planetary crisis"", such is the gravity of scientific evidence about global warming, the scale of biodiversity loss and the impact of toxic waste pollution. It's a crisis for humanity, damaging health, claiming lives and livelihoods, and threatening the existence of small island states and coastal communities. According to the World Health Organisation, 24 per cent of global deaths are linked to the environment each year - eight million of which are caused by forms of air pollution. Between 2030 and 2050, an extra 250,000 deaths are anticipated globally directly due to climate-induced risks, such as heat stress, malnutrition and malaria. Climate change is part of a deeper environmental crisis, which has the destruction of human rights and health at its core. Cop26 was not expected to meet the ambition contained in the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rises within 1.5 degrees, with models predicting 1.8-2.4 degrees if existing commitments are delivered. If Cop27 in Egypt next year can definitively close that gap, it will be the most impactful step possible to safeguard human rights. The inclusivity of the language on human rights in the preamble to the Glasgow Climate Pact is striking. It's tempting to dismiss this as not providing anything fresh or substantive. The pact calls on states to ""respect, promote and consider"" their obligations on human rights ""when taking action to address climate change"". The preamble highlights in particular the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities and other vulnerable persons - including migrants, people with disabilities and young people. The importance of ""climate justice"" is noted, a brief acknowledgment in stark contrast with the size of the global movement so effectively raising awareness of social injustice inherent in climate change . Repeated mentions of rights of indigenous peoples and their role in highlighting cultural knowledge to inform action on climate change extends the language on indigenous peoples present in the Paris Agreement. Cop26, when the Norwegian Supreme Court revoked wind-farm licences for violating the Sami reindeer herders' way of life. Pro-climate projects shouldn't get a special pass. Damage There is substantial scope to deliver actions upholding rights, equality, climate justice - and the expansion of this language in the Glasgow Climate Pact shows that demands for such action cannot be ignored. The idea of the international community providing compensation to developing countries for material damage was part of the climate debate three decades ago. Instead of establishing a body to deliver funding, the ""Glasgow Dialogue between Parties"" will discuss the concept over the coming three years. Whatever inspires this ongoing reluctance to take responsibility, the moral imperative to compensate countries impacted by climate change caused by industrialised nations largely remains a topic for dialogue. Adaptation funding pledges at Cop26 could help notwithstanding this - pledges stand at $356 million, one-third pledged by the EU ($116 million). But dealing with climate damage can only be comprehensively done with predictable and formalised funding streams.Cop26 was tasked with finalising the ""Paris rulebook"" to guide countries on how to meet their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Central to this was the regulation of carbon markets - whereby countries which overperform in decarbonisation can sell their credits on, in theory helping other countries to decarbonise more affordably and meet their climate goals. The Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) warned that the models in which the world avoids the risk of failing to limit warming to 1.5 degrees rely on ""near or complete decarbonisation by 2050"". With the international community so far off the goal of 1.5 degrees, and when commitments to the deep decarbonisation needed are set to long time scales, the urgency to proceed with carbon trading mechanisms at Cop26 was unjustified. Sharpening human rights, environmental and social safeguards, enhancing accountability and public engagement, and requiring the consent of indigenous communities for projects are essential measures to prevent polluting states abusing the system.At Cop27, the stakes will be even higher - for the future of our climate and for the rights of people already suffering the consequences of climate change. There is huge energy and optimism outside of the Cop arena that will keep pushing for progress, not least on filling the gaps evident in the Glasgow Climate Pact. The youth climate justice movement sweeping courts around the world reminds us that intergenerational rights risk being defined by the climate crisis. It is in everyone's interest that Cop27 elevates human rights, placing them at the centre of every political decision that makes it into the final text.Noreen O'Meara is senior lecturer in human rights and European law at the University of Surrey\l"

But wait a second: most of those electric cars are made in China, which emerged (along with Russia and Saudi Arabia) as the bogeyman of Cop26: in addition, sourcing the lithium which is an essential component of these emission-free vehicles is causing misery for underpaid and unsafe miners, and threatening environmental damage on an industrial scale.Driving range is another issue of course, as is expense, but then I hear some guy on the radio telling me that I'd be better off sticking with my diesel (which is a modern, low-emission one), which might do less damage in the long run.

""We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe.""""If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5C goodbye,"" he added. ""Even two degrees may be out of reach.""His comments came only hours before the 195-nation IPCC kicks off a two-week meeting to validate a landmark report on options for reducing carbon pollution and extracting CO2 from the air.The report is expected to conclude that CO2 emissions must peak within a few years if the Paris temperature targets are to be met.Mr Guterres described covid recovery spending as ""scandalously uneven"" and a missed opportunity to accelerate the turn toward clean energy.The Russian invasion of Ukraine, he added, could further derail climate action with importers locking in fossil fuel dependence as they scramble to replace Russian oil and gas.'Addiction to fossil fuel'""This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.""A bombshell report last year from the intergovernmental International Energy Agency (IEA) concluded that a 1.5C world was incompatible with any new oil or gas developments, or new coal-fired power plants.Breaking with the usual practice of not singling out countries, Mr Guterres called out Australia and a ""handful of holdouts"" for failing to lay out ""meaningful"" near-term plans to slash emissions.He also said the development needs and economic structures of China, India, Indonesia and other ""emerging economies"" prevent them from making similar commitments, especially on coal.Rich nations should provide money, technology and know how to help these emerging economies purge coal from their energy portfolios, he added, pointing to a pathbreaking deal for South Africa unveiled at the COP26 climate summit last November in Glasgow.""Our planet can't afford a climate blame game,"" he cautioned.""we can't point fingers while the planet burns.""Wealthy nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) must phase-out coal by 2030, and all other countries by 2040, Mr Guterres said.China and India - both heavily reliant on coal - have resisted a full embrace of the 1.5C goal, along with pressure to set more ambitious short-term emissions reduction targets.Both nations, however, have set long-term ""net-zero"" goals for carbon neutrality, 2060 for China and 2070 for India.G20 countries account for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.A landmark IPCC report on climate impact and humanity's capacity to adapt, published last month, details an atlas of human suffering and warned that far worse is to come.Unprecedented floods, heatwaves and wildfires seen across four continents in the last year will all accelerate in coming decades even if the fossil fuel pollution is rapidly brought to heel, the report concluded.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland298","SF can't have it both ways on climate","Irish Examiner"," ","MARY LOU MCDONALD was the keynote speaker at the first national energy summit, convened last Tuesday in Croke Park.The summit was conceived to bring together ""industry experts and thought leaders from both the public and private sectors to find solutions to the issues facing us in securing our energy supply... to reach our 2030 targets and to meet the demands of our growing and decarbonising economy"".No small task, certainly one requiring some vision. And there to show the way into this green, decarbonised future was the Sinn F\'e9in leader.Right now, the planet craves leadership. An existential crisis is already under way with climate change.Parts of the developing world are today suffering the dire effects that are disproportionately attributable to the wealthier countries, including this one.The poorest are getting it in the neck but everybody else will soon enough. Without immediate and transformative action, today's children are en route to a dystopian future.We need leaders to persuade and lead into the necessary transition that is going to be painful and disruptive in order to properly serve those coming after us.Step forward Mary Lou McDonald, putative taoiseach, self-identifying leftwinger, standard bearer for the hopes and dreams of all who feel ill-served by politics as usual.The MC for the energy summit, Ivan Yates, introduced the keynote speaker by saying usually it might be expected that a ""green"" person would be delivering the speech but that politics requires that ""all the stuff you're working on has somebody there to popularise it at every level of society and government"".What exactly is a ""green person"" these days? Yates was presumably referring to a member of the Green Party, but his comment is entirely reflective of a body of opinion in which ""this climate thing"" is a hobby horse for the Greens rather than an existential crisis for mankind.Mary Lou stepped forward to present her vision. ""In the long and winding human story, each generation faces its own unique challenge and today's challenge is how to meet energy needs now and into the future, how we play our part from changing the economic model from extractive to regenerative, and how the energy sector evolves.""The speech went on in this vein, visionary, polished, articulate. ""We stand at a crossroads and the decisions we make today will shape the future. The stakes are very high for our environment, our planet, out future, our survival,"" she said.Then she quoted John F Kennedy. ""Change is the law of life, those who look only to the past are certain to miss the future. Let's not make that mistake.""At the end of it all, the audience was sufficiently appreciative. It had been, by any standards, a fine address, a vision setter.A few hours later, back in the real world, Ms McDonald was addressing the D\'e1il. The subject matter was the issue of people dying through poisoned air quality as a result of the burning of dirty fuel, including turf. Three previous environment ministers shied away from banning the sale of turf. Now Eamon Ryan is attempting to rectify things, in order to save lives and possibly also save bogs that they may continue to be a repository for the carbon that is killing the planet.Perhaps Mr Ryan thought that growing awareness about climate change had engendered a political mood whereby politicians in general might see this as an issue on which to show that they are serious about what lies ahead.So here was Mary Lou at Leader's Questions on Tuesday afternoon, fresh from her Croker call to arms in the name of the planet. ""I invite the Taoiseach again to clarify that there will be no ban and that the proposed ban is officially from today ditched and assurance is given to people living in rural Ireland. This is what we need. We need clarity. The Taoiseach should not talk in riddles. He should tell us that the madcap, half-baked, unfair notion advanced by Eamon Ryan is now officially ditched.""There you have it. Striving for clean air, attempting to retain a sump for the carbon that is killing the planet, is a madcap idea from this green person, Eamon Ryan. Perhaps, on reflection, Ms McDonald in her morning speech should have quoted not JFK, but Danny Healy-Rae. ""Vote for the people, stay with the people, and to hell with the planet and the fellas that say we must save the planet and forget about the people.""Mary Lou McDonald is the most obvious, but by no means the only, example of the kind of leading from the rear that typifies the political approach to tackling climate change. When the choice is to either pander or persuade, she will opt for the former, as the latter might take too much work and is no guarantee of success. Her party is against the carbon tax, the one proven - and minor - instrument designed to tackle carbon emissions with a sense of urgency.Why would a party described by its finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty as ""centre left"" oppose a carbon tax? Because all taxes are nominally unpopular and who wants to be unpopular?So it also goes with wind energy. Earlier this month, Ms McDonald was a keynote speaker at the annual conference of Wind Energy Ireland, the industry body for windfarms. She is all for windfarms offshore, and she told the conference that what was required was an expedited planning process. On that she is correct.Last November though, her party had to withdraw at the last minute a private members' bill that, if successful, would have ended the development of wind energy onshore. Embarrassingly, the bill was scheduled for the same week as COP26 in Glasgow convened.The difference between onshore and offshore windfarms for Sinn F\'e9in? Fish don't vote and there is always bound to be a few first and second preferences from somebody opposing a windfarm onshore. At some point, all of the main parties are going to have to grapple with the crisis.In this respect, Sinn F\'e9in, currently the largest party and in all likelihood the leading component of the next government, has the furthest to travel.Its rise has been largely based on a populist appeal in which difficult problems can be solved without inconveniencing anybody who might vote for the party.Its climate change policy is based on a so-called just transition that promises no disruption or pain for any of its voters.Unfortunately, that won't suffice. Time is not on our side. That may not bother today's leaders, but they will stand indicted by history.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland299","COP26: what to expect from the 'only show in town' on climate action; As the make-or-break UN conference looms in Glasgow, Caroline O'Doherty explains what dele....","October 23, 2021 Saturday","Irish Independent","Binmen and train drivers are planning to strike just as 25,000 delegates descend on a city where health officials are sweating over superspreader scenarios. Accommodation is so scarce that the going rate for a couch in a family living room is (EURO)120 a night.The host of the event comes across at best glib about the very reason for its existence, and his facetious ramblings about those who take it seriously do little to challenge that perception.Big-name guests have announced they're staying home, while many of the regular cast haven't updated their script since the last time they attended. And someone thought it would be a good idea to ask survival expert Bear Grylls to talk to the young folk among the attendees, as if in tacit acknowledgement that the whole thing is doomed to failure.The UN's make-or-break climate summit COP26 kicks off in Glasgow next week, and if it wasn't for the fact that humanity's future on the planet is at stake, the temptation to poke fun at its inauspicious build-up would be irresistible.But it is hard to overstate the importance of the meeting.Even if it does not achieve any substantial new agreement - and the odds are stacked against that happening - the eyes of a burning world are on it, and any repeat of the side-stepping of genuine action that has characterised so many of its predecessors will take place under a spotlight of greater intensity than ever before. That creates the possibility of public pressure for action - a missing ingredient from previous COPs.There have been protests before, and the youth climate movement has grown in numbers and strength. But though they are loud, those clamouring for action are still relatively few.This COP will be revealing, then, for the interest it generates among the public as much as for the conduct of the heads of state present.Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan this week acknowledged that COP negotiations were somewhat removed from ordinary people.He described the event as a ""big circus"" and said he was unsure if the ""trappings"" that surrounded it were helpful.Arguably, that depends on who the ringmaster is. For COP26, British prime minister Boris Johnson is in the big top, and when it comes to diplomacy, he is no acrobat. He has referred to climate action as ""bunny hugging"" and suggested anyone who believes that human action can arrest as climate change is ""blind with conceit and self-love"".""Colourful"" is how Eamon Ryan described him.World in his hands: Boris Johnson has been flippant about climate actionAs for COP26, the Green leader described it as ""the one global structure we have.'How do you get global agreement with 200 countries ranging from Russia and Saudi Arabia to Vanuatu and islands in the Caribbean?'"" he said. ""It's far from ideal but I don't see an alternative. For all its failings, it's the only show in town.""SO WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT? COP stands for Conference of the Parties and this is its 26th annual meeting. The parties are the countries that signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which came into effect in 1995. It was signed by 198 countries, and their leaders or representatives meet every year to review progress and set new goals.The UK is hosting the next meeting in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. WHY IS THIS COP GETTING SO MUCH ATTENTION?It is billed as the ""last best chance"" to prevent runaway climate change. We're fast running out of time to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning oil and gas, and methane from oil, gas and agriculture - that drive global warming.That leaves us moving ever closer to a level of global temperature rise that will gradually make large parts of the earth uninhabitable because of unbearable heat, chronic drought, higher sea level and extreme weather events.HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body that reviews and assesses the science around climate change. Its reports distil the work of thousands of scientists from all over the world.It has been warning with increasing urgency that the global average temperature is rising, that the cause is human activity, and that the impact is going to get worse. Its last report, published in August, warned it was inevitable that temperature rise, which is already more than 1C above pre-industrial or 'normal' levels, would reach 1.5C within 20 years and probably sooner.It says only immediate, dramatic action to reduce emissions will prevent it reaching 2C, when the scale of climate change is expected to be catastrophic and unstoppable.WHY IS 1.5C OR 2C A BIG DEAL?Many plants, crops, insects, bacteria and chemical reactions only activate at a certain temperature or between strict temperature parameters. Mess with that and you upset farming, fishing and food production; you destroy natural habitats and wildlife; you spread diseases that find homes in previously inhospitable regions.Also, the number is only an average. Some regions have much more pronounced temperature increases and some lower.WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO? If the world stopped all emissions by 2030, temperature rise could most likely be maintained at 1.5C. Realistically, that will not happen, so the next best thing is to cut emissions by as much as possible as fast as possible and hope to keep temperature rise below 2C.WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT COP26? Countries will be asked to commit to halving their emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and to finalise how they will account for their performance toward those targets. They will be asked to speed up the phasing-out of fossil fuels, with coal an immediate priority; to stop clear-felling forests, which form the atmosphere; to accelerate investment in renewable energy such as wind, solar, wave and tidal power; and to rapidly electrify transport.They will also be expected to collectively provide at least $100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries. The money is to help low-income countries already suffering the severe impacts of climate change caused by their rich neighbours and to allow them to invest in clean energy and infrastructure.A fresh emphasis will be placed on protecting and restoring the natural world.WHAT ELSE IS ON THE AGENDA? Carbon trading: how countries and companies that fail to meet emission reduction targets can offset their overshoot by buying allowances from others that come in under budget. Adaptation: how to adapt infrastructure, utilities, warning systems, food production and so on to cope with climate change. Previously an issue for developing countries, the fires, floods and heatwaves that hit richer countries in the past few years have moved it up the agenda. Technology: what role it has or might have in tackling emissions and how much faith and finance should be placed in it.Other topics include: gender and climate change; a dedicated 'loss and damage' fund to provide emergency response to climate-driven catastrophes; the heightened challenges for least developed countries and small island developing states; and, possibly, the challenges for international aviation and shipping. WHO IS ATTENDING?Delegations from all COP countries take part, and the leaders or relevant ministers come for at least a few days. The leaders of two of the top four carbon-polluting countries, China and Russia, have said they will not attend, and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, whose country is the third biggest polluter, is wavering.Hundreds of non-governmental organisations have a standing invitation to attend as observers and to hold side events in the official 'Blue Zone' area. A further 520 sought permission to attend as observers for the first time.Dozens of other organisations, institutions and state and non-state bodies are accredited to hold events in the 'Green Zone' area, which is open to the general public with bookable tickets.WHAT WILL IT ACHIEVE? China and Russia have indicated they are not ready to bring forward their net zero ambitions from 2060, so agreeing a 2050 target will be a struggle. Tying down the details of how the 2050 target will be met by many other countries that have made the pledge but not backed it up with concrete plans will also be difficult.The climate finance goal should be met, and commitments to pull back from investing in new coal mines, and on methane emission cuts, are also expected.'How do you get global agreement with 200 countries ranging from Russia and Saudi Arabia to Vanuatu and islands in the Caribbean?'\l"

But I'm convinced that climate change is an existential crisis. I worry for our younger generations, for children yet to be born, what kind of planet they will be born into if there are very severe weather events, such as droughts and floods.""Climate change is the most serious challenge in our lifetime, without question. This affects the whole food production chain, and I link it with biodiversity. The plus side of it is, if we meet it head-on, we can create a better life for people, safer and healthier.""For example, if we took out all the fossil fuels from our cities, we'd have a remarkable urban environment in terms of health. I think this can happen rapidly, there is nothing worse than going down Patrick Street in Cork and seeing a bus belch out diesel fumes. EV buses can be transformative,"" he said.Cop26 must be a seminal event in the fight against climate change, Mr Mar tin said.Ireland will more than double its commitment to vulnerable countries to combat climate change, he said.Some $ 100bn a year from 2020 was committed at Cop15 in 2009 to support developing countries to cut their carbon emissions and adapt their economies to deal with climate change.However, that target has fallen well short in the intervening years.Mr Martin said: ""Climate finance is a significant area and we'll be signalling on Tuesday that we'll be upping our commitments in respect of that.""The Government has committed to a doubling of our global finance commitments by 2025, and we aim to go above that.

This is despite warnings that the fossil fue must be phased out in more advanced economies by 2030 and globally by 2040.The Glasgow talks have seen a slew of announcements on sectors such as cutting methane and halting deforestation, which the analysis says supports important action, but must go beyond existing national targets to have an impact.Climate Analytics chief executive Bill Hare, who is one of the partners in the analysis, said: ""The vast majority of 2030 actions and targets are inconsistent with net zero goals: there's a nearly 1C gap between government current policies and their net zero goals.""It's all very well for leaders to claim they have a net zero target, but if they have no plans as to how to get there, and their 2030 targets are as low as so many of them are, then frankly, these net zero targets are just lip service to real climate action.""Glasgow has a serious credibility gap,"" he said.And he warned: ""If the massive 2030 gap cannot be narrowed in Glasgow, governments must agree to come back next year, by Cop27, with new and stronger targets.""Today's leaders need to be held to account for this massive 2030 gap.""\l"

They will give the UN climate group an insight into how reducing their families' carbon footprints can impact the electricity system.Engineer Deirdre de Bhail\'eds, one of the group's participants, has a keen interest in sustainable rural development and runs the Dingle Creativity and Innovation Hub.As part of the project, she swapped her petrol people carrier for an EV for a year.A charging point was installed at her home and the costs, amounting to around (EURO)15,000, were covered by ESB Networks.Ms de Bhail\'eds's car use and charging pattern have been monitored and logged to assess in part how overnight charging of higher numbers of EVs will impact the electricity network in the future.'There is nothing but advantages for me in using an electric car. I am travelling for far less than it costs to get petrol. It is a dramatic reduction,' she said.The people carrier had been costing her (EURO)50 per week to fill with petrol, while the cost of charging her EV over the week comes in at less than (EURO)10. Once the Dingle project comes to an end in December, she intends to use the money she saved over the year of driving the loaned EV to buy her own.But for now she will be driving her Hyundai Kona electric car from Dingle to the Glasgow conference, via Belfast, to prove the viability of EVs to others.Ms de Bhail\'eds said: 'People wonder how they can use an electric vehicle in Dingle when we live so far away from everything.'I understand that there are challenges with extended journeys. I have driven to Dublin and back in the day without any issues, but when we travel to Glasgow [today, Monday] it will be a good test to prove it can work.And Ms de Bhail\'eds's has news for those attending COP26, saying: 'The message we want to bring is that rural communities are very dependent on transport and agriculture. Here in the Dingle Peninsula we are preparing and getting organised with solutions to address the impact on the climate of both of these, but we would really like the right policy support to help us find the way to address and to implement this.'In her passenger seat on the way to Glasgow will be dairy farmer Dinny Galvin, 51, whose farm overlooks Dingle Bay at Aglish.Mr Galvin milks 50 cows and tends to around 150 sheep, and has been a farmer since the age of 16.He is one of the project's ambassadors and has made a wide range of changes to the home he shares with wife Nicola and their five children. Mr Galvin wants the savings he has got from the work to their house to be extended to farms all over the country.He is already using a heat exchanger in his dairy farm and wants to put solar PV panels on the roofs of the sheds he uses for the cows and the milking parlour.He set up the West Kerry Dairy Farmers' Sustainable Energy Community, with 100 members, to share ideas on energy saving, and they are dedicated to change.Mr Galvin said: 'Farmers don't want to be in the spotlight and be attacked about all these emissions. Yes, we are contributing to them. But farmers are not the villains we are made out to be.'We can take control of our own destiny and use solar panel PVs and small low-sight wind turbines to create the energy we need and give the rest to the grid to offset our carbon footprint.'The ESB Networks Dingle Project has installed a range of new technologies across the peninsula since its launch in 2018. There have been full retrofits in three of the five project ambassadors' homes, while 15 EVs were given out to members of the project for a year with an additional two cars made available to some members of the wider community.They have also installed 20 solarPV panels on various properties.The ESB said trialling these technologies and monitoring their use will help them increase reliability of their electrical network and therefore enable faster restoration times during power outages.The project's community engagement manager, Claire McElligott, said: 'It has demonstrated what can be achieved by working closely in collaboration with local communities as we transition to a lowcarbon energy system. What we have seen is a real willingness from the community to change their behaviour and adopt these renewable technologies which, in turn, is reducing their costs and their carbon footprint.'We wish a safe journey to our two ambassadors who are travelling to COP26 in Glasgow and hope they can share some of their learnings from the Dingle Project with a worldwide audience.'The results of the research gathered over the past three years will be collated by ESB Networks when the project ends. They hope that the lessons learned in west Kerry can be applied throughout the country.The ESB project is part of Dingle Peninsula 2030, an initiative to transform the 'beautiful peninsula into a low-carbon society' by reducing energy demand and using local renewable resources, which could save the area (EURO)8million.Provisional figures from the Environmental Protection Agency showed that last year's emissions reduction was far off the 7% annual target set out in the Government's Climate Action Plan to secure a 51% decrease by 2030.It will also reduce emissions from the residential sector and improve air quality.While (EURO)10million is going towards solar PV panel schemes in the country and a new low-cost loan scheme for residential retrofitting is also being introduced.Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan said: 'Budget 2022 is about supporting our citizens as we begin the transition to a climate-neutral, circular and connected economy and society.'More than half of our retrofitting grants will go to free energy upgrades for low-income households - helping them save on bills.' HYPERLINK mailto:news@dailymail.ienews@dailymail.ieThere are no more rows over showers and the immersion.I really feel like I have won the lotteryDINNY GALVIN Dairy farmer Mr Galvin, 51, had a heat pump and PV solar panels installed at his home, while also being provided with an electric car during the Dingle Project.Mr Galvin has used a heat pump since 2013, and with wife Nicola and their five children, he said it only costs around (EURO)650 a year to heat the house and water. One of his big recommendations from the Dingle Project is to get an electric car: 'We are getting over 500km for around (EURO)7 instead of (EURO)70-(EURO)80,' he said.He is also saving through solar panel PVs that cut his costs by around (EURO)100 a month.His home was built in 2006, so it was 'pretty well insulated' and did not need retrofitting but the work on their house cost around (EURO)40,000 and was paid for by ESB Networks as part of the project.Mr Galvin thinks farmers should be acting to offset their carbon impact and give back to the environment.He said that farmers may have the key to dealing with crucial environmental issues.He added that many farmers are open to installing small wind turbines, but not bigger ones.'We are in a very scenic part of the world here and big wind turbines will never happen,' Mr Galvin said.'The electricity grid in west Kerry is going to come under fierce pressure in the future - there are going to be more electric cars on the road, houses are going to be heated with heat pumps, and there will be a big pull on the grid.'Carol Leary Primary school teacher Ms Leary, 51, heard about the project on the radio and thought that it sounded £mazing'.She shares her home with husband Se\'e1n and their six daughters, and said: 'There was always a constant argument from the oldest to the youngest over hot water.'They would turn on the immersion and then never turn it off. They'd have hair straighteners, hairdryers plugged in at all times - you name it, they were burning through it.'Now, the Dingle Project and ESB Networks have completed about (EURO)100,000 of work on their home (around half of which was refunded in grants), which was built to specification in 1992.'There's no more rows over immersion and electric showers, it is great. The house is so cosy. It is constantly warm. It is like I have won the lottery,' Ms Leary said. However, she said the retrofit 'was not without its ups and downs' as they had to move out because of issues with the roof.'In hindsight, if we had to pay for everything ourselves it would be a lot of money,' Ms Leary recognised.But having seen the benefits and financial returns, she said she would have invested her own money in the PV panels and battery storage.And having the electric vehicle (EV) has been £mazing', she said, adding that 'it is clear that it has produced some of the biggest savings'.Ms Leary stores solar power throughout the day - to charge the car - and changed to a nightrate whereby she is now saving anything up to (EURO)100 a week.On a really sunny day, three quarters of the energy the solar panels produce is being stored.She has an app which shows exactly how much is coming through the solar panels, how much is being used, what is being stored and what is the best time to use it.While they have only been given access to the electric vehicle for a year, she 'found it so good that I have already changed my own diesel car for an electric'.'I would never go back, I'm electric all the way now. I would highly recommend it. The savings are astronomical,' Ms Leary added.She also said she can do a month in the electric car on just (EURO)50 compared with eight times that - (EURO)400 - in the old car.But she said there are serious problems in the country with charging points and that Dingle has only very recently got a single fast-charging point for electric vehicles.'It is time for the Government to provide a really good incentive', she added.Rory McKeown World Health Organisation consultant Mr McKeown, 42, said that making the changes to his carbon footprint through the Dingle Project had been £ huge learning curve'.The work that has been done on his home was completed in phases - starting with solar PVs and then a full, deep retrofit to the house.'We have a '90s bungalow, which wasn't ideal for energy efficiency,' he said.He continued: 'Our building energy rating was at D1 when we moved in, which is on the lower end of the scale.'All of the house's windows and doors were replaced, the walls were cavity-filled, new radiators were fitted and they had the loft space insulated.Mr McKeown said: 'We originally had oil-burner central heating and we could not get rid of it soon enough. I was very happy to see the back of that.'The oil burner was not great with our kids running around, it didn't feel too safe.'He has two children, Lugh\'e1n, aged five, and Art, aged seven, with his wife Bl\'e1ith\'edn.Before the changes were made, he said, 'everyone would be arguing' over the heating'.Mr McKeown said: 'Simple things that we have done have saved us money.'We used to use flat-rate electricity but - now we have an electric car - it is much more economical while also reducing our carbon footprint to use a night rate, which eliminates significant costs.'It is about (EURO)6-(EURO)12 for a charge versus (EURO)60-(EURO)70 for fuel for our two-litre Honda.'Often carbon footprint can be linked to spending.'The McKeown family are now looking at making the permanent switch to an electric car, but recognise some of the downsides and might keep a petrol car for longer trips 'because the infrastructure for charging just isn't there'.They had only been in their home for six months before the work from the Dingle Project started, and Mr McKeown admitted that they would not have been able to afford to do it themselves.'The retrofit was a lot easier than what we were expecting. But that was partially down to luck of the draw which allowed them to stay in the home while work was being done,' he said.For average homeowners, he recommended that solar panels and a battery management system to store energy would be most cost-effective, especially for those where retrofitting would be a price stretch.'The battery management system is brilliant. It stops 50%-70% of the energy produced from solar panels on a sunny day from just spilling back out into the grid', he said.He added that 'before that our behaviour was a bit mad', explaining: 'We were looking at the weather forecasts to see when to put the dishwasher on to use the energy as it was being produced in real time the battery management makes it much easier.'I've started realising how to run things more efficiently.''Will create jobs and cut emissions' 'It has shown what can be achieved' 'I'm on a mission to prove we can do it'\l"

A significant potential positive has emerged in the text of a draft G20 communique in circulation among world leaders gathering for talks in Rome, which commits to taking urgent steps to reach that key target of the Paris agreement. G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions. The communique, which is subject to negotiation and changes during today's talks, indicates that the world's 20 richest countries are on track to commit to tackling the existential threat of climate change.

The 196-nation summit aimed to keep alive the commitment to halt global warming at 1.5C, compared to pre-industrial levels, set in Paris six years ago.So, is 1.5C alive? Yes. Just. As COP president Alok Sharma said in his closing remarks: 'I think today we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C within reach.' But the pledges on the table at COP26 mean global warming could rise to 2.4C, although more optimistic readings put it as low as 1.8C. The Glasgow Climate Pact asked governments to strengthen those pledges next year. But 1.5C is an unsafe level of global warming - with scientists estimating that around 70% of the world's coral reefs will die if the earth warms this much.And what about coal? For the first time, the pact asks countries to 'phase down' coal - signalling the beginning of the end for coal power, the biggest source of greenhouse gases.A draft said coal should be 'phased out', but this was vetoed by India and China - to the dismay of campaigners.What else does the deal say? It urges countries to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. Many states such as Saudi Arabia and India keep fuel costs artificially low, encouraging people to use them.For the first time, the deal also raises the topic of 'loss and damage' - which would mean that the rich countries who have heated up the planet with greenhouse gases for years will have to pay compensation to the poorer countries that are now suffering from the impacts.\l"

While there is little chance of that gap being closed in Glasgow, Sharma said he hoped the final Cop26 deal would pave the way for deeper cuts.Wait and seeUS climate envoy John Kerry struck a positive note when asked late Friday whether he agreed with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg that Cop26 was a ""festival for 'business as usual'"".""Obviously I don't agree,"" he replied, ""and I think you will see that when you see what happens.""AdvertisementKerry helped to revive flagging hopes for the conference when he and Chinese negotiator Xie Zhenhua on Thursday announced the countries would ramp up efforts to preserve forests, needed to soak up and hold in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and to cut output of the second-most important greenhouse gas, methane.The US-China agreement requires both countries to set aside mutual tensions over other political differences.The White House said on Friday that US president Joe Biden, who has succeeded in pushing $555 billion ((EURO)485 billion) in climate measures through Congress in a post-pandemic recovery programme, will hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday night, US time.Ambition and financeThe newest draft of what many hope will be the final Glasgow agreement also retained a significant demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than doing so every five years as they are currently required.Money remains one of the thorniest issues to resolve, with developing countries pushing for tougher rules to ensure that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, offer more cash to help them adapt to its consequences.Rich countries have failed to meet a 12-year-old goal to provide $100 billion a year in so-called ""climate finance"" by 2020, undermining trust and making some developing countries more reluctant to curb their emissions.The latest draft said rich countries should double the funding set aside for adaptation by 2025, from 2019 levels.\l"

It also includes enough financial incentives to almost satisfy poorer nations that anticipate harms from climate change out of proportion with their roles in causing it.Most importantly, negotiators said, it preserves the overarching goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.Ahead of the talks in Scotland, the United Nations had set three criteria for success - and none of them were achieved. Those criteria included pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030, $100bn ((EURO)87bn) in financial aid from rich nations to poor, and ensuring half of the money went to helping the developing world adapt to the worst effects of climate change.The draft agreement says big carbon polluting nations have to come back and submit stronger emission cutting pledges by the end of 2022.A rich-poor divide widened at the summit in recent days, with developing nations complaining about not being heard. But when the representative from Guinea, speaking for 77 poorer nations and China, said his group could live with the general results, negotiators applauded.The Chinese delegation also said it was fine with the positions that would come out of a Glasgow in a final conference agreement. But Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav potentially threw a spanner in the works when he argued against a provision on phasing out coal, saying developing countries were ""entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels.""Mr Yadav blamed ""unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns"" in rich countries for causing global warming. Iran said it supported India on not being so tough on fossil fuels. A frustrated European Union Vice President Frans Timmermans, the EU's climate envoy, begged negotiators to be united for future generations.""For heaven's sake, don't kill this moment,"" Mr Timmermans pleaded. ""Please embrace this text so that we bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren."" US climate envoy John Kerry expressed support for the most recent provisions, calling the early draft a ""powerful statement.""

Not everyone gets to make choices that actually affect an entire planet.""We here are privileged today to do exactly that,"" he said.Gabon's delegation indicated it couldn't leave Glasgow without ""scaled up"" and predictable assurances for more money to help poorer nations adapt to the worst effects of global warming. Mr Kerry tried to assure Gabon's representatives the United States would redouble its efforts on adaptation finance.Small island nations that are vulnerable to catastrophic effects of climate change and had pushed for bolder actions in Glasgow said they were satisfied with the spirit of compromise, if not outcome of the talks.""I'd like to note that this progress is not in l"

More of more of the young are beginning to point the finger at capitalism [sic].""Just after 5am yesterday, Cop26 organisers warned attendees that protests would disrupt their plans for the weekend, including those planning to fly in and out of 10 UK airports, including Glasgow.On a day themed around youth action, Cop26 organisers said that, inside the Scottish Event Campus (which has locked out activists and campaigners all week),"" young climate leaders came together in Glasgow today with negotiators, officials and ministers from across the world, making their voices heard and demanding the action needed to prevent catastrophic climate change in our life times"".The day was co-chaired by Youngo, the official children's and youth constidtuency of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Youngo presented the Coy16 global youth position statement, representing the views of more than 40,000 young climate leaders worldwide.Youngo's Heeta Lakhani and Marie-Claire Graf said: ""We successfully profiled global youth voices through the Coy16 global youth statement and brought together four generations to share best-practice examples of achieving climate justice collectively.""Rather than acknowledging the burgeoning anger of young people from all over the world, Nadhim Zahawi, the UK's education secretary, suggested those taking part in the protests could face fines for missing school.The response from Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, to the young marchers echoed the education secretary.A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said young people missing school to attend the demonstration was ""extremely disruptive at a time when the pandemic has already had a huge impact on their learning"".""We do understand why young people feel so strongly about climate change, and we want to see them use that passion and turn it into action. That's exactly why we're empowering them through our new virtual national education park, climate leaders awards, and giving teachers the tools to put climate change at the heart of the curriculum, and we're backing this up with our continued pledge to cut the carbon foot print of school buildings as well,"" the spokesperson said.Yesterday's protest comes ahead of today's marches, where tens of thousands of people are again expected in Glasgow, with other marches in Dublin, and cities across the world.Climate activist Greta Thunberg speaks during the march.

A report by global recruiterRobert Walters found there was a record 1,600 new jobs in ESG and sustainability in Ireland in 2021, with the trend expected to accelerate this year.The biggest recruiters are the professional services, financial services, and technology firms.Suzanne Feeney, country manager for Robert Walters Ireland, said: ""The volume of recruitment in the first quarter of this year was far ahead of this time last year. The skills and expertise in this area are very much in demand and in short supply so that means candidates with experience are attracting counter offers.""There's also a greater focus on attracting candidates from other sectors and countries.""Trayc Keevans, from recruiter Morgan McKinley, says sustainability analysts with at least five years' experience are now commanding salaries of between (EURO)80,000 and (EURO)100,000, while portfolio managers with ESG experience can earn anything from (EURO)90,000 to (EURO)170,000 at investment management, wealth management and stockbroking firms.There has been a 25pc increase in the number of sustainability analysts working in Ireland in the last 18 months but the plethora of job offers on the table means more of them are moving for better pay and conditions.""A lot of people are trying to get into this space. But this is more hearts than minds. We're seeing a lot of people transition from different areas, having done qualifications in environmental studies, energy management systems and even philosophy.""A boom in ESG investing has also created a surge in demand for talent at asset managers, pension funds, investment and retail banks, private equity firms, and international insurance firms, according to Judith Kelly, the director of business development and operations at financial recruiter FK International.Karen O'Regan, strategy lead at Accenture, says: ""Investors are increasingly looking at ESG performance and investing in ESG assets.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland321","Women demanding to be empowered in climate fight","Irish Examiner"," ","Climate change is not gender neutral and its impacts amplify existing inequality, writes Rhoda Jennings in her diaryCop26. It is a mild, sunny day in Glasgow and the queues to get into the Scottish Event Centre, locally christened the Armadillo, show no signs of slowing. The world leaders have left but the ministers are on site, negotiating the finer points of the promises made last week. This is where the work really gets done.The mood has changed. Last week ended on an optimistic note. We were on target for a reduction in global warming of 1.8C by 2100 if all countries abided by the commitments made in the summit.This week, after a more careful analysis of the promises, this has been re-estimated at a 2.4C increase to temperatures by 2100, far from the 2C reduction target, not to mention the aspirational 1.5C. Some of the promises were double-counted, already contained in national plans submitted to the UN.The detail in the plans is also lacking. Cop26 president Alok Sharma gives a warning to delegates that there is a lot of work to do before the conference ends today, adding that there is ""still too far between us"".Laurence Tubiana, architect of the Paris Agreement, which lays down the targets we are now trying to meet, was unequivocal: ""Greenwashing is the new climate denial. We need to be honest and truthful to make these commitments a reality.""To add to the woes, the climate finance target is also predicted to be missed by several million.Funding under this target can assist the implementation of mitigation measures (ways to reduce emissions) or assist adaptation (ways to cope with the impact of climate change).The funding of mitigation measures is being favoured, instead of splitting the funding between the two areas.There is also a growing tension around the position on 'loss and damage'. This is a fund and a mechanism to cover damage caused by climate change, or as one minister from the Dominican Republic succinctly put it, ""death and destruction"".There is a fear that to contribute to this fund is an admission of liability. The nuances and conditions attached to the funding are frustrating developing nations and small island developing states. To highlight the very real threat to his home, the foreign minister of Tuvalu, a Pacific Island nation, recorded a speech while standing knee-deep in water.""We are sinking,"" he said. ""So is everyone else.""To raise awareness of the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and girls around the world, a 3.5m puppet of a young Syrian refugee named Little Amal arrived at Cop26 after walking 8000km from the Syrian border. She shook hands with attendees and took centre stage alongside politicians and campaigners.Climate change is not gender neutral and its impacts amplify existing inequality. Women are often tasked with household and caring duties and in developing nations it is the women who work the land in order to support the family.Extreme weather events caused by climate change disproportionately affect their lives. Failing crops and the burden of household duties means that there is less time and money for girls to attend school, excluding them at an early stage from the education system. Armed conflict and farmer herder conflict (conflict over contested land use) are both exacerbated by climate change. Figures from a UN report indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women.With a focus on liberating women to play more of a role in the economy, Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, rechristened the 'Build Back Better Bill' currently being deliberated in Congress as the 'Build Back Better with Women Bill'.She reaffirmed the US' commitment to climate change and the need to recognise the centrality of women in the climate fight, finishing her speech with ""when women succeed, the world succeeds"".Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, opened her speech by stating that climate change must be seen as a feminist issue, but it was Tarcila Rivera Xea, a Quechua activist and advocate for indigenous rights, who cut through the sweeping soundbites and captured true sentiment, by stating: ""Women are not pleading to be supported, they are demanding to be empowered.""

The report from UN Climate Change has been produced so countries have the most up-to-date information before Cop26, and includes extra plans put forward since a full analysis on the issue in September.AdvertisementMs Espinosa said the update confirmed what the earlier report showed: ""That we are nowhere near where science says we should be.""Incoming Cop26 President Alok Sharma said the latest report made clear that ""to protect the world from the most devastating impacts of climate change, countries must take more ambitious action on emissions, and they must act now"".He said that if countries delivered on their 2030 promises and on their commitments to cut emissions to net-zero, it could limit temperature rises to just over 2C, compared to below 4C under the original Paris plans.\l"

It was a wholly enjoyable experience.While not quite a cynic about mass adaptation of public transport back home in Ireland, I have believed that getting the public at large (myself included) out of their cars and onto trains, trams, and buses is going to be the tallest of orders.What Cop26It would be naive, and arrogant, to think that citizens living outside of urban congregations should just get on with it, and just get on board with the changes.Their fears are real and founded.It won't be easy to convince them otherwise, but mass investment in public transport of all kinds, and in all areas, should be a centrepiece of any climate mitigation vision for an island like Ireland.In July, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin described the (EURO)185m plan as a ""game-changer"" for Cork when it was announced in June as part of the (EURO)1bn recovery plan, with a commuter l"

His intention then was saving western civilisation, as opposed to today's efforts to save the planet (""Young protesters in Glasgow for will have much to fight against"", Another Life, October 30th).At that time, the painful memory of the tragedy of Nagasaki and Hiroshima was all too recent and in the years since then, nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima have meant a reluctance by many countries to embrace nuclear power. As fossil fuels are being phased out, the less than fully effective wind and solar energy are the only established global alternatives until other renewable energy sources become proven. It appears essential that nuclear energy, whose generation and use is cheap and independent of weather, will have to be considered as a high-priority interim option to supply the ever-increasing demand for electricity and maintain the living standards that people have become accustomed to.In dealing with the human future, Viney says that ""resignation is not the business of the young"".

That means quickly reducing methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry and agriculture could have a big impact in the short term.But big methane emitters Russia, China and India have not yet signed up, while Australia has rejected the idea of joining.Net-zero emissions goalCOP26 aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels to avert the most dire climate change impacts.So far, the world is far off track. A UN report released days before the Glasgow talks said current pledges to cut climate-warming emissions put the planet on course for a 2.7C temperature rise this century.Scientists say the world must halve emissions by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050, to avert the worst impacts of global warming.India's prime minister on Monday said the country, one of the world's biggest carbon emitters, after China and the United States, aimed to reach net zero.FinancingFor years, finance has been a major sticking point at the UN talks, with rich nations having failed to meet a 2020 deadl"

While Mr Carney initially predicted the total market could reach $100bn ((EURO)91bn) by the end of this decade, the sector remains mired in confusion over the integrity of carbon removal projects and a lack of clarity over how global trading of them should function. The slimmer version, with about 90 members, is dubbed the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market and will instead focus on assuring the quality of offsets sold, according to Annette Nazareth, co-chair of the governance body and a former head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Targets to increase the size of the market have been ditched, and Mr Carney's promise of a pilot market early this year has also been scrapped, she said.Mr Carney and Mr Winters still sit on the board, but are no longer involved in the day-today running of the project. The 400-members of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, as it was known, included academics, traders and environmental groups, and they soon squabbled over the path through the maze of exchanges and standards.At COP26Voluntary carbon offsets represent a metric ton of reduced, removed or avoided greenhouse gas emissions, and are bought by companies and individuals to subtract emissions from their own accounts in order to declare improved environmental performance.Projects generating carbon offsets span from planting trees and protecting forests to building wind farms and cleaner-energy cooking stoves. Renewables and naturebased projects in particular have been criticised for carbon accounting issues, their longevity and for negative impacts on local communities.The group has also delayed delivering on its key objective: to come up with a ""core carbon principle"" (CCP) label that could be used to mark offsets that meet its standards. Members spent months arguing over the criteria for inclusion, with sharp divides over how high to set the bar.""Some people wanted to start early but, frankly, that would have been guessing what the CCPs would say,"" Ms Nazareth said. ""You want to encourage voluntary carbon trading, but only the high-integrity, CCPaligned trading.""The council intends to consult on a set of CCPs in May, with a decision expected in September, Ms Nazareth said. In the meantime, offset trading is taking off. She admits that even when those CCPs are confirmed, the group will be toothless to enforce them.""I'd love to have regulatory authority and be able to do all those wonderful things I got to do with the SEC,"" Ms Nazareth said. ""Unfortunately, nobody gave us that power. But we do have the power to name and shame. We have the power to be very public and noisy about what's going on in this area.""The International Energy Agency said earlier this month that global greenhouse-gas emissions rebounded in 2021 to their highest-ever level after the pandemic.BloombergTargets to increase the size of the market have been ditched\l"

Land Rover has used celebrities such as Brian O'Driscoll and Diarmuid Gavin in sponsored content to promote its SUVs as being better for the environment, and AppleGreen, the fossil fuel retailer, introduced ""carbon-neutral driving"" at its diesel pumps and a biodiversity initiative for schools.Consumers, investors and businesses themselves often struggle to determine which corporate green initiatives are simply marketing practices and which ones are truly environmental. A survey published last week by the Compliance Institute suggests that as the fight against climate change steps up, greenwashing efforts by some Irish firms have gone into overdrive: 43pc of businesses have seen evidence of greenwashing by companies, with the institute likening the practice to ""the virtue signalling of the corporate world"".Last year, the European Commission and consumer protection authorities across the EU revealed that at least 42pc of firms had made exaggerated or false claims about their green credentials on their corporate websites. In November, Gabriel Makhlouf, the governor of the Central Bank, said he was he was ""particularly concerned"" about greenwashing because ""green market practices are currently almost exclusively based on voluntary principles and standards, which leaves a lot of room for different interpretations"".But corporates will face tougher scrutiny than ever on how they are addressing climate change and social issues amid upcoming EU sustainability reporting standards and a new ""taxonomy"" that will offer a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The increasing barrage of complex regulations - with an alphabet soup of acronyms - are designed to direct capital into sustainable activities and to combat greenwashing as the EU seeks to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050.Maura Quinn, chief executive of the Institute of Directors (IoD) in Ireland, whose membership comprises some of the most senior directors and business leaders in the country, noticed environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues soar to the top of the corporate agenda during the pandemic and in the run-up to the UN Climate Change conference (COP26) in November.""None of us was around the last time there was a pandemic and it created an enormous sense that we live in a global community,"" she says. ""So we understood that the decisions we make at a local level have huge implications internationally. During severe lockdowns, we could see clear skies and notice the return of wildlife and birdlife and there was a reduction in environmental pollution. Then Cop26 happened. And we are now seeing the reality of climate change, with three storms in one week in Ireland.""But there are signs that corporate Ireland may be struggling to measure and report on ESG issues. Almost half of business leaders surveyed by the IoD at the end of 2021 said their organisation has found it difficult to set realistic key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure ESG targets. An analysis of Ireland's top 50 listed and privately held companies published in December by KPMG found that 72pc were ""far from ready"" for new EU sustainability reporting requirements.Until recently, non-financial reporting has largely been the preserve of listed entities. But this is all poised to change after the European Commission last year published proposals for sustainability reporting standards in its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The CSRD significantly expands the scope of companies that must provide sustainability-related information as part of their corporate reporting and sets out in great detail the nature and extent of non-financial information that companies will be required to report.The EU estimates that 49,000 companies across the bloc will fall under the scope of the new directive, compared to the 11,600 which currently have reporting obligations.Firms will have to adhere to sustainability reporting in 2024 for the 2023 financial year, with data gathering starting next January. The measure will be mandatory for large companies, defined as having at least 250 employees and having either (EURO)40m in turnover or (EURO)20m in total assets. Small and medium-sized listed companies will have to comply by 2025.Conor Holland, director of ESG reporting and assurance at KPMG, says: ""It's like a whole new set of accounting standards being transposed. The whole genesis of this is that we are moving to a place where there will be an equilibrium between financial and non-financial reporting. They'll also be assured, so an independent third party - most likely an auditor - will have to provide a limited assurance opinion on the reporting to combat greenwashing.""Alongside the introduction of the CSRD is the EU taxonomy regulation, which will require companies to report specific metrics - called the Taxonomy KPIs - including the proportion of turnover, capital expenditure and operational expenditure that qualify as sustainable economic activities.Irish organisations are also being encouraged to adhere to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global framework that provides companies with recommendations on disclosing climate-related topics in their financial reporting and one that has become a basis of regulation in the EU.A TCFD support campaign launched in 2020 by Finance MinisterPaschal Donohoe to improve the level of climate-related reporting among Irish corporates now has 35 Irish supporters, according to Colette Coogan from Sustainable Finance Ireland. These include AIB, Bank of Ireland, CRH, Glenveagh, Hibernia Reit, Ryanair, and Smurfit Kappa.""The TCFD is a voluntary framework but from a reputational standpoint, it's important to be adhering to global benchmark in this area,"" Coogan says.Most of all, boardrooms are under pressure from investors to adopt such reporting measures and fully sustainable practices.Earlier this month, for instance, it emerged that activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns just 200 shares of McDonald's stock, launched a board fight at the fast-food retailer to demand changes to the way its pork suppliers treat pigs. Icahn, who nominated two board directors to McDonald's, asked the corporation to require that all its US pork suppliers end the practice of keeping pregnant sows confined in small crates or ""gestation stalls"".Indeed, ""investor sentiment is potentially moving faster than the regulations,"" says Laura Wadding, a partner in risk advisory and sustainability at Deloitte. ""There are investor lobbying groups actively encouraging corporates to make additional disclosures, such as additional data on their carbon footprint, their emissions, their use of fossil fuels, or their employment practices.""Quinn says: ""There is a push-pull at play here. The push piece is the regulatory side, but the pull factor is people really looking more closely at companies and how they operate. Historically, companies were there to make money and return shareholder value. Now they have to make the world a better place.""HISTORICALLY, COMPANIES WERE THERE TO MAKE MONEY.

For the first time a Cop agreement targets fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming. The tone is much different to the usual arcane language of UN climate summit outcomes. The 2015 Paris Agreement is finally moving to gearing-up stage. There is no doubt now keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees is the priority of the 197 signatory countries, who can no longer put vague commitments on the table in the hope the world might warm by less than two degrees. Emerging into the Glasgow daylight probably provided a far greater shock for negotiating teams, especially political leaders heading up delegations, as the reaction was marked by a wave of deep disappointment. Reaction in climate-vulnerable states can be summed up by one word - despair. Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan admitted that dramatic twist was ""gut- wrenching"" as India - the world's third biggest emitter - pushed for ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" of coal. This prompted a rushed manoeuvre by the EU, China and United States to amend the text in the interests of holding ""what we've got"", though it was against protocols and the final political, rather than legal, decision was already agreed going into the final plenary. The critical target of keeping global warming to within 1.5 degrees was still alive, Cop26 president Alok Sharma insisted; a view backed by those big players. ""What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity,"" Ryan said.Unfinished business Much unfinished business, however, is confirmed by definitive analysis published in Glasgow showing all promises made before and at the UN summit make for a 2.4 degree rise in temperatures, where already dangerous climate impacts would become catastrophic. ""For many countries, two degrees is a death sentence,"" executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said.The deal backs ""best available science"" to inform actions. Applying that framework, there is no sugar-coating the standout failure of ambition on actions to curb emissions, leaving our fragile planet still hanging by a thread. That said, there is enough to suggest the world is facing into a decade of scaled-up action. In that scenario the request that parties ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022"" becomes the key enabler. A request in ""UN speak"" is close to a demand.The temperature issue aside, this was the most productive Cop since Paris. Decisions on doubling adaptation finance and setting up a body to assist countries most impacted by climate disruption represents progress, but more is needed. When it comes to hard money, the long-awaited $100 billion a year for developing countries under climate finance will be realised, while adaptation funding to help vulnerable countries adjust for inevitable climate impacts is set to be in excess of $1 trillion a year by 2025.While Cop26A historic proposal to ""phase out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" was watered down; part of the compromise needed to agree a deal by inserting ""phase down"". It has left a bad aftertaste, especially for the EU. The reality, however, is the economics of coal-powered electricity generation no longer add up in face of cheap solar and wind energy. The coal industry that once brought wealth to the developed world is coming to a rapid end, probably by 2030. Developing countries are predicted to follow the same course over the following decade. Outside the Cop process, groups of countries committed to ending fossil fuel extraction, to accelerating the phasing out of coal, to tackling methane and to ending deforestation. If all of this is delivered, acceleration of decarbonisation over the coming decade is realisable. New alliances between public and private sectors have been forged, especially on switching to green energy. There was also a strong indication the financial world is gearing up for transitioning to a world of net-zero emissions.Analysis by Climate Action Tracker and the International Energy Agency indicate fresh pledges made over the past fortnight have the potential to reduce global warming by 0.5 degrees - a significant stride toward the 1.5 target. Delivery reinforced by meaningful near-term commitments is critical. Being unable to bend the emissions curve downwards this decade will put huge pressure on the remaining carbon budget for ""keeping 1.5 degrees alive"". The Cop26 As climate scientist Prof John Sweeney has highlighted, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has four out of five possible scenarios which indicate the world will exceed 1.5 degrees over the next 20 years. The one that keeps us to within 1.5 degrees is a trajectory the world is nowhere near at present. It will be some years before we know if Cop26 has helped bridge the gap.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland341","Biden fights to salvage his ambitious climate agenda ahead of Cop26 summit; Some of the most progressive items likely to be stripped from US policies","October 27, 2021 Wednesday","The Irish Times","and in New York Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, huddled with a group of top climate activists in Washington on Monday to reassure them of the Biden administration's mettle in the fight against a warming planet.With a week to go before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, and in the middle of tense negotiations with politicians to pass emissions-cutting legislation through Congress, Harris suggested the US would no longer bring half-measures to the global stage.The battle against the climate crisis was a leitmotif of Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign and a constant focus of his administration since taking office in January. This marked a sharp U-turn from Donald Trump's time in the White House, but also an uptick in attention on the problem compared with Democratic predecessors including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as it emerged as an increasingly salient issue for many voters.Yet even so, Biden will be heading to Scotland - and before then, this weekend's G20 in Rome - facing questions about his ability to enact meaningful change in climate policy in the world's largest economy.If it is approved, the White House's flagship spending package - worth up to $2 trillion - is expected to include more than $500 billion (EUR 430 billion) in climate measures, including an array of clean-energy tax credits. But some of the most aggressive steps, such as a scheme called the Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP) that would force power companies away from fossil fuels, are likely to be stripped out after opposition from politicians including Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator of West Virginia.A carbon tax has been periodically floated in the negotiations but was also ruled out. Some analysts say this would make it much harder for the US to meet its own goal of halving its 2005 greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2030.Transformation Sanjay Patnaik, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a fellow for the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy at Johns Hopkins University, said it was very unlikely that ""only carrots, without a stick"" would succeed in cutting US emissions sufficiently.""International partners are going to look and say: 'Okay, it's great that Americans are back at least at the negotiating table, they are trying diplomatically to take a leading role. But ... why should I reduce emissions if the US is not willing to seriously reduce emissions?'"" he added. Some climate experts say the transformation in Washington's approach under Biden should not be underestimated. Aside from re-entering the Paris climate accord, his administration has signed on to a global deal to reduce methane emissions, designated climate change a ""systemic risk"" to the US financial system, and labelled it a threat to national security and global stability.""With every IPCC [Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change] report that comes out, we are hearing that we have almost no time left to really address the climate crisis. And the Biden administration is taking that to heart,"" said Anne Christianson, director of international climate policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank.Still, in recent days Democrats have been scrambling to bolster the bill's climate provisions before the president arrives in Glasgow. ""Especially in light of not having something like the CEPP, it's essential that we really lock in and solidify the tax credit portion of this, because that is going to be one of the most important pieces of this entire puzzle,"" said Lindsey Walter, deputy director of the Climate and Energy Program at think-tank Third Way.Environmentalists are also pushing policymakers to find an alternative to the CEPP that would be acceptable to moderates. After proposals to put a price on carbon were shot down, the focus has shifted to a system of grants for states to support efforts to go green.Democratic politicians are turning up the pressure as well, amid fears of a repeat of the experience of the first two years of Obama's administration, when climate legislation was blocked by the Senate after passing the House. No Republicans are expected to back Biden's Bill.""If the US doesn't have a strong commitment to carbon reduction in this legislation, we're not only weakening our position in these climate negotiations, we're weakening the entire opportunity to reduce carbon for the entire planet,"" said Melanie Stansbury, a Democratic member of the US House of Representatives from New Mexico. 'Political action' ""I don't think that the problem is a lack of grassroots political action by Americans, I think the problem is a lack of willingness by politicians to be brave in policymaking and do what they know is right,"" she said.Sean Casten, a House Democrat from Illinois, said he would like to see the US in a ""position of leadership"" in Glasgow.""If we pass [strong climate legislation] we are in a position to set the tone for Cop26,"" hesaid. ""If not, we are basically ceding that leadership role to the Chinese, and I don't want to do that.""Without any action by Congress, the US is on track to achieve a reduction of 17-25 per cent in emissions by the end of the decade. But a report released last week by the Rhodium Group suggested that the 2030 target could still be within reach without the CEPP, provided the tax credits were pushed through and accompanied by new measures taken by federal agencies, states and companies.Even so, in Glasgow Biden will be unable to pledge what the world may be wanting to hear most: that climate legislation is gaining bipartisan support in the US and won't be undone.""I think one problem with US policy has been its unpredictability,"" said Patnaik at the Brookings Institution. ""We have these big pendulum swings between Republican and Democratic administrations."" - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021\l"

There has been a 76 per cent drop in the number of new coal plants planned globally over the past six years since the Paris Agreement was adopted.The ""powering past coal"" pact was endorsed by more than 40 countries including Poland, Indonesia and Vietnam. Developing countries vowed to quit coal in the 2030s ""or as soon as possible thereafter"" a significant change to the original 2030 goal.Major international banks, however, committed to effectively end all international public financing of new unabated coal power by the end of 2021. Meanwhile, at least 25 countries and public finance institutions committed to ending international public support for the unabated fossil-fuel energy sector by the end of 2022. Collectively, this could shift an estimated $17.8 billion a year in public support out of fossil fuels and into the clean-energy transition. In a new ""Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement"", countries also committed to scaling up clean power and ensuring a just transition away from coal. This follows recent announcements from China, Japan and South Korea to end overseas coal financing which now means all significant public international financing for coal power has effectively ended.Cop26 president Alok Sharma said: ""We have been clear that Cop26 must be the Cop that consigns coal to history. With these ambitious commitments we are seeing today, the end of coal power is now within sight."" About half of the world's fossil-fuel assets will be worthless by 2036 under a net-zero transition, according to research published yesterday. Countries that are slow to change will suffer but early movers will profit, it predicts. Renewables and freed-up investment will more than make up for the losses to the global economy.Demand The risk of producing far more oil and gas than required for future demand, which is estimated to leave $11 trillion-$14 trillion in so-called stranded assets - infrastructure, property and investments where the value has fallen so steeply they must be written off.Lead author Jean-Francois Mercure of the University of Exeter said the shift to clean energy would benefit the world economy overall but needed to be handled carefully to prevent regional pockets of misery and possible global instability.""In a worst-case scenario, people will keep investing in fossil fuels until suddenly the demand they expected does not materialise and they realise that what they own is worthless. Then we could see a financial crisis on the scale of 2008,"" he warned.The challenge is evident at the ongoing Cop26 where some of the states most at risk of being left with stranded assets - such as the oil and gas exporters Russia and Brazil - are likely to try to slow down the transition as they have done at previous climate meetings, while those most likely to gain - such as the fuel-importing European Union - are pushing for faster action.The study published in Nature Energy, illustrates how a drop in demand for oil and gas before 2036 will reshape the geopolitical landscape. Current investment flows and government commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 will make renewable energy more efficient, cheaper and stable, while fossil fuels will be hit by more price volatility. - Additional reporting: Guardian\l"

The time to act is now and to do nothing would be catastrophic and a dereliction of our responsibilities as political leaders.""We have all witnessed the impact of climate change in our lives and if we are to make a difference, then we must all work together. The climate crisis is no respecter of different political views and the Executive stands ready to play its part in this global response.""For us, that means taking action locally and our Green Growth strategy sets out a holistic approach to tackling the climate crisis. It provides an opportunity to embed environmental considerations into all our decision making.""Environment Minister Edwin Poots is also attending the summit, and said climate change was the defining crisis of our time.""It must be recognised that we cannot continue with a 'business as usual' approach, we must act now before it is too late,"" he added. ""We have all seen first-hand the effects of climate change and there are other numerous challenges ahead - reducing our emissions, improving air quality, tackling plastic pollution, achieving zero waste, and the development of a circular economy.""The next decade must be one of urgent action, there is still time to make a difference, but we must act now and we must do it together.""Mr Poots said the draft Green Growth Strategy was ""a solid framework"", balancing climate action with the need for a clean, resilient environment and economy. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who is also travelling to Glasgow, said ""a radical plan"" was needed.He said there was clear evidence from rising temperatures and climate events around the world that the crisis was worsening. ""The conference in Glasgow is a pivotal moment in our bid to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said.""This is no time for tinkering around the edges of the Paris Agreement. We need to get more than lip service from Cop26, we need firm commitments from those with the power to enact change that they are ready to do what's necessary to protect our environment.""Mr Eastwood said ambitious targets are needed to bring down emissions and safeguard our planet for future generations.""Anything less will be catastrophic for humanity,"" he warned.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland353","A time for radical action; UN climate summit","October 30, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","'How long are we to watch them die of thirst in the droughts? And gasp for air in the floods? What is the state of the hearts of the world leaders who watched this happen and allow it to continue? Our leaders are lost and the planet is damaged.""That is the unacceptable reality of parts of Africa today, expressed by the young Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate. That reality should concentrate all minds at the UN's Cop26, which opens in Glasgow tomorrow. But will it?The world's grotesque wealth and power imbalance is clearly reflected at this conference. Single delegations from the richest states outnumber those of the poorest, most vulnerable countries many times over.The richer countries, including Ireland, are also responsible for most of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet the cost of the crisis is currently borne most sharply by those least responsible, and least able to withstand its impacts. Back in 2009, $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 was promised to redress this injustice. Shamefully, much less has been delivered. Cop26 must honour, and increase, this commitment. That said, the consequences of global heating are also already affecting many rich countries, much more rapidly and severely than even experts expected. This has been most visible in extreme weather events. The image of a German mayor breaking down in tears before the cameras of the world, after last July's floods devastated his region, epitomises this development.Less obvious, but even more menacing, are the tipping points we are approaching as ice sheets melt, the oceans rise, and thawing tundra emits more methane into the lethal mix of heating gases which we continue to pump into the atmosphere. However, there are now some slim grounds for hope that we may avert the worst of the crisis, following the recent pre-Cop26 surge in emission-cutting promises from many countries, Ireland included. Before the landmark Paris Cop21 in 2015, we were on course to heat the planet by four degrees at the end of this century, making most of it uninhabitable for our species. The latest commitments, if both feasible and implemented - and neither can be taken for granted - could bend the curve towards two degrees. But even that shift will still have catastrophic consequences. If we push heating down half a degree more, we could probably manage the crisis.That would demand unprecedented shifts in behaviour, locally and globally. But the alternative, already so starkly manifest, should surely galvanise us to radical, innovative action. The question to be answered in Glasgow is whether our leaders, and their peoples, can find the heart to make the necessary changes, and the ingenuity to make them work.\l"

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland355","How finance can help tackle climate change","Irish Examiner"," ","Never confuse movement with action.COP26 has finished, one could wonder where we are heading in the fight against climate change. Many may understandably feel we are still struggling to combat this existential crisis. However, there are significant grounds for hope and Cop26 has provided Ireland with a unique opportunity.Ireland's recent Climate Finance Week demonstrated not only that the financial services sector is committed to playing its part in the climate action agenda, but that we can help Ireland lead the global charge on this vital issue. As Stephen Nolan, Climate Finance Week's chairperson, said ""addressing the climate emergency will be hard, but it can be done as long as multiple partners get stuck-in... only through Government investment and private capital can we address the major challenges we face"".It is through the responsible, sustainable investment of private money that our sector plays its part. In lending money to companies and households transitioning from 'brown' to 'green' we are helping re-engineer and future-proof the economy. By investing in green infrastructure, carbon-neutral businesses and companies with Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) at their core, we amplify what good investing looks like.Our ambition though is not linked solely to supporting Ireland meet its 2050 net-zero emissions targets. Just as the Government has sought to broaden our global diplomatic footprint via its Global Ireland policy, we must be bold and ambitious to use our existing financial services strengths to become global leaders in sustainable finance.The opportunities to show international capabilities in this area are numerous. Ireland can lead on how sustainable finance is raised, deployed, controlled and reported, through the creation of a sizeable sustainable finance industry serving both Ireland and our global peers.While a small economy cannot ever hope to be the source of all the necessary funding to green the global economy, we can offer the expertise and administrative experience to get the money where it needs to be.A specific example is in the issuance of green bonds. Green bonds are financial instruments specially designed to facilitate climate change mitigation projects. With a bond issuance marketplace that is flexible and knowledgeable, Ireland has a community of experts with a world-class offering to anyone who wants to avail of its services. From a German motor manufacturer seeking to issue a green bond for its next range of electric vehicles, or a US fossil fuels company moving into renewables, Ireland and its financial services sector can be there for them.As with many sectors of our economy, there are multiple large-scale international financial services organisations with a substantial presence in Ireland. Many of these companies are leading the way in climate change mitigation and often have sustainable finance divisions based here - global roles that see the best and brightest help money flow to the kinds of projects improving our world.Government and business should now share the objective to bring more of these roles to Ireland, using the existing multinational ecosystem we have, together with indigenous company growth in the sustainable finance sector. Building on the efforts of State Agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Skillnet Ireland, this is eminently possible. In fact, as part of Climate Finance Week's talent and innovation session, Skillnet Ireland launched funding for a unique public-private sector programme to train compliance professionals in climate-related financial reporting and disclosures.The recent move by the Department of Finance to create a new Climate and Sustainable Finance Group to help shape its thinking on climate change issues is also a hugely positive step. In addition, Ireland will soon be home to the new International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence, in partnership with the UN - an early action of Ireland's inaugural Sustainable Finance Roadmap.It is against this backdrop that the world gathered in Glasgow. Cop26 set itself four goals, one of which centred solely on sustainable finance, and clear progress was made. Having committed over $500bn in climate finance since 2013, developed countries will aim to mobilise at least $100bn per year to 2025. International financial companies, through the Mark Carney-led coalition, pledged to deliver a staggering $130tn to secure global net zero.The financial services sector is already playing its part and stands ready to do even more.Significantly, Ireland has the chance to be at the centre of global sustainable finance and thus the climate change solutions.

Canadian glaciers suffered rapid melting. A heatwave in Canada and adjacent parts of the USA pushed temperatures to nearly 50 degrees in a village in British Columbia. ""Death Valley, California, reached 54.4 degrees during one of multiple heatwaves, whilst many parts of the Mediterranean experienced record temperatures. Exceptional heat was often accompanied by devastating fires."" ""A second successive year of drought in sub-tropical South America reduced the flow of mighty river basins and hit agriculture, transport and energy production,"" Prof Taalas added. ""Extreme events are the new norm. There is mounting scientific evidence that some of these bear the footprint of human-induced climate change.""He said at the current rate of emissions' increase we will see a temperature rise by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""Cop26 is a make-or-break opportunity to put us back on track.""Snapshot The provisional report provides a snapshot of climate indicators such as greenhouse gas concentrations, temperatures, extreme weather, sea level, ocean warming and ocean acidification, glacier retreat and ice melt, as well as socio-economic impacts. It is one of the flagship scientific reports that will inform negotiations by almost 200 states in the coming days.Reacting to the WMO data, Prof Hannah Cloke of the University of Reading said: ""As a scientist primarily studying floods and heatwaves, I believe 2021 should stand out as something of an annus horribilis. Devastating floods in Europe, China and South America, and killer heatwaves and fires in North America and southern Europe, for example, ought to serve as a canary in the coal mine to spur faster action to adapt society to the reality of a changing climate.""

This postponement was understandable, but makes it even more important now for heads of state and ministers to act with real urgency.We are standing on the precipice of a climate catastrophe.Unless Cop26Crucially, the world's leading industrialised countries - including the United Kingdom as Cop president - need to repair the trust deficit that has been worsened by the lack of solidarity and vaccine inequity that been accepted by richer nations.Inaction and insularity in the face of the climate crisis risk wreaking even greater damage on our planet and the multilateral system.Even at this late hour, there are still worrying signs that rich countries have not grasped the seriousness of what is at stake.The failure to honour the promise of $100bn made to developing countries made more than a decade ago bodes ill for the talks ahead.The Elders fully support the approach of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, who are calling for a package of $600bn by 2025 to make up for this missed target.We need a change of mindset across the board in international politics, finance, business and civil society - one that enables us to ""keep 1.5 alive"".This is a matter of climate justice. Those who have contributed the least to global warming are suffering the direst consequences, while the rich polluters are still failing to take seriously their responsibilities at a political and financial level. We have wasted too much time in the six years since Paris.The policies we need to cut emissions have been fitful, inconsistent and uncoordinated.The big question leaders must reckon with in Glasgow is whether their national plans add up to what is needed - and if not, how they will close the remaining gap.The difference between 1.5C and 2C of global heating is huge - it would mean 420 million more people exposed to extreme, potentially lethal heatwaves, and tens, if not hundreds of millions more people will be thrown into poverty. As Cop26 host, the UK has a particular responsibility to lead by example and galvanise all delegations into radical ambition, but this demands consistency, coherence and credibility.Reports that the UK is classifying its allocation of special drawing rights from the IMF as overseas aid, rather than using this money to increase its overall aid budget, have further damaged trust. Reversing this step would make a crucial difference to the political dynamics in Glasgow as negotiations get under way.I hope that the UK's leaders, and all others gathered in Glasgow in the weeks ahead, will not shirk this moment.They should heed the words of Nelson Mandela, the founder of The Elders: ""It always seems impossible until it is done.""Mary Robinson is a former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders independent group of global leaders \£9 THE INDEPENDENT'The policies we need to cut emissions have been fitful, inconsistent and uncoordinated.

Key investment in innovative projects is delivering new vehicle and infrastructure technologies.""These projects are providing economic benefits such as job creation and are unlocking private investment to support new technologies to come to market.""Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will begin to be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by mid-century, but countries' plans for this decade leave the world well off track.The draft deal was published after analysis warned that existing plans for this decade put the world on track for 2.4C of warming - well above the goals internationally agreed in the Paris accord to curb temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and to try and limit them to 1.5C.Cop26 president Alok Sharma has made it clear that there is no attempt to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, but the draft document says the impact of climate change will be much lower with 1.5C of warming than 2C.It ""resolves to pursue efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C"", which will require more action this decade.The draft urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" the targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans to align them with the Paris temperature goal, which still covers both numbers, by the end of 2022.The document published yesterday also urged countries to set out their long-term strategies by the end of next year to reach net-zero emissions by about mid-century.\l"

It's so important. We are literally talking about having a safe future. You can't negotiate with science. You can't talk about a glass being half-full. We have to get it down. We have to be on track to 1.5 degrees, and it is doable.""Speaking to The Irish Times, she identified Saudi Arabia, Russia, Brazil, China and Australia as having not made sufficient commitments, and often being the main blockers to progress - though she accepted China often under-promised but over-performed, which was the opposite to many countries in the western world including Ireland.Mrs Robinson accused Saudi Arabia of ""playing dirty games"" in taking language out of a lot of texts, which included ""the language of youth, human rights, gender, equality, sustainability"", because not enough countries were in the negotiating room.Crisis mode ""Australia, a wealthy country, is still in fossil fuels mode, not in crisis mode,"" she said.She added countries who were members of the High Ambition Coalition, which includes the EU and now the US, should highlight shortcomings in the draft text, ""which is not actually aligning us with 1.5 [degrees].""In other developments, Ireland has backed international declarations on transport which will facilitate accelerated decarbonisation of road transport, shipping and aviation over the next 20 years. The endorsements at Cop26 - to make commitments on zero-emission cars, reducing fossil fuels in aviation and ""green shipping lanes"" - are all consistent with Ireland's ambitions across these modes of transport as set out in the Government's new climate action plan, Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said.

Possible projects might include community EV charging points, small renewable energy projects, community EVs, cycle parking, repair hubs and community biodiversity gardens, he said.The Minister also launched a new national dialogue on climate action.

'This is I think very important, because we usually talk about these abstract quantities of emissions, or global temperatures, which we know about, but we can't really feel,' she said.The researchers found the biggest impact in terms of the frequency of extremely hot years in tropical Africa.However, the authors of the study also stressed that the prediction for the frequency of extreme years could be changed if countries significantly step up efforts to cut pollution.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland371","We're not too small to make a difference in the fight for our planet; NI needs to be positioned as part of the solution to climate crisis","November 4, 2021 Thursday","Belfast Telegraph","BOTH expectations and emotions were running high at the beginning of Cop26 this week, and understandably so. The stakes are stacked for world leaders gathered in Glasgow. In days leading up to the climate conference, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry commented that the Glasgow summit represented the ""last best hope for the world to get its act together"".World leaders will not only set the agenda for national and international climate commitments, but also the direction of our futures.While many were highly sceptical of Cop26 before the conference had even began, as a young climate activist I have engaged in these climate negotiations as a stubborn Coptimist.#COPtimism is a hashtag trending on social media, spreading a message of hope while driving a desire for engagement, contribution, and commitment from world leaders at Cop26. Let me assure you that this is not a blind hope. #COPtimism represents both an acknowledgement of the monumental challenge we face in Glasgow, and a gritty determination to meet that challenge. In some ways, small wins over the past few days at Cop26 have given many reasons for Coptimists to remain hopeful.We have seen a global commitment to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, and to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. This is no small feat. Nature is our most powerful ally, and the 100-plus countries who have committed to ending deforestation represent 85% of our global forests.First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon also came forward with a \£31m pledge to help developing countries affected by ""loss and damage"" from climate change.The First Minister commented that this money will come from the Scottish Government's \£36m-a-year Climate Justice Fund. The Climate Justice Fund supports decarbonisation projects outside Scotland, in countries like Malawi and Zambia.Scotland is the first nation to pledge funding for vulnerable communities to repair and rebuild from climate-related incidents, such as wild fires and severe floods.Despite some raised eyebrows at the amount which has been pledged, this financial commitment is highly relevant. Some impacts caused by the climate crisis are already unavoidable. Unfortunately, we need to think about mitigation and adaption strategies, as well as how to continue to build resilience. While climate finance is a major theme for this Cop, we are still waiting for other richer nations to come forward with higher levels of both ambition and action. There is clearly a cost of this inaction. As Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley explained in her opening address: ""The failure to create financial loss and damage is measured by [ ] lives and livelihoods of our communities. This is immoral and it is unjust."" Notably, this same question of justice has been inextricably woven into climate negotiations this week. In his address to world leaders, Sir David Attenborough declared that ""this story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today those who have done the least to cause this problem have been the hardest hit"". Ms Sturgeon echoed Sir David's sentiment, commenting that: ""Scotland continues to proudly support nations which - despite having done the least to cause climate change - are already suffering its impact.""What strikes me about the First Minister's words, as well as the conference itself, is this sense of national purpose and pride.In an interview before the conference, Ms Sturgeon talks about wanting Scotland to ""lead by example"", positing this idea of ""small countries"" harnessing ""big vision"". Although we must recognise that we cannot solve this crisis without contributions from bigger countries too, small countries can clearly be entrepreneurial and creative in finding solutions and opportunities.On both an individual and corporate level, there is often a problem of people feeling ""too small"" to make a difference in the face of climate crisis. However, we can still play an important role - however small - in our collective efforts to address this global challenge. There is undoubtedly an exciting role for small countries to play as pioneers of innovation.Northern Ireland has an opportunity to show the rest of the world that we are not too small to make a difference.We talk a lot about the race to net zero emissions by 2050, and Northern Ireland is losing this race. We do not have a Climate Bill with legally binding emission targets, and we have the least protected environment in the UK and Ireland.We need to flex our muscles in Northern Ireland, and position ourselves as part of the solution to the climate crisis, rather than part of the problem. Our political leaders need to dramatically raise our ambition, and come together through strong, meaningful partnerships to restore our planet.What better national narrative for our leaders to unite around than solving the climate crisis? What better political mission for our leaders to push than securing a better future for humanity? What better legacy for our leaders to leave than the creation of a fairer, more sustainable world?As Sir David points out, the solutions are already there. We know how to stop climate change, and how to reverse it. This is a question of political will.Some groups in Northern Ireland underestimate whether we can achieve net zero at the same time as the rest of the UK.I would argue that we do not have a choice. We need to act as if the future of humanity depended on it. Because it does.Rosalind Skillen is a climate activist from Belfast and member of the Future Leaders Network delegation\l"

""It is so good that they mobilise people but it also creates false expectations that each year something fantastic and new can be delivered, and that is unfortunately not the way the UN system works.""Ms Hedegaard proposed that every second year should be a smaller-scale event, focused on a single issue such as adaption, loss and damage, or financing, which are problems so ""big and complicated that they do not get the attention that they deserve at each Cop"".Sin\'e9ad Walsh, climate director with the Department of Foreign Affairs, agreed that ""maybe we don't need to have the big hullabaloo every year"".She pointed out the extensive resources needed to prepare Ireland's heads of State for annual speeches and negotiations.However, Dr Walsh said the annual pressure to appear at Cop is often what pushes states to ""go further"" than they would otherwise.Dr Walsh also highlighted that the visibility of Cop as a meeting of world leaders is a huge driver of domestic climate action.""We have to remember that a big benefit of Cop is the conversation that it generates back home,"" she said. ""Climate action will take place in domestic contexts in domestic political arenas and that's a 12-month challenge for all of us, it doesn't just happen in the two weeks of Cop.""Alicia O'Sullivan, a law student and Quercus scholar in University College Cork who represented UCC and World YMCA at , also supported the idea of a variation on the ""chaotic"" and ""unfocused"" climate summit. ""Trying to do everything at once can lead to confusion and people leaving Cop with 600 different variations of what happened,"" she said.""I think public participation, and civil society being there in some respect physically, absolutely has to happen, but I also think that to focus and to create solutions to the real hard-hitting problems you do have to have a scale back.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland382","Advertisers need to keep Facebook in check - or else; MEDIA & MARKETING","November 21, 2021","Sunday Independent","As COP26 got under way in Glasgow earlier this month, the global advertising community took stock of what it could do to help mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Given that the advertising industry was one of the engines that powered consumerism and consumption in the past, it also has a very important role to play in the future.While various professional advertising and marketing trade bodies around the world organised their own conferences and webinars to coincide with COP26, the UK-based but pan-European organisation called the Conscious Advertising Network (CAN) fired off a petition to the leading social media companies calling on them to stamp out climate misinformation which, it alleged, is rampant on their platforms.While some of this misinformation was being spread by the usual crackpot climate deniers, it has become increasingly clear that more sophisticated actors have started to use these platforms to advertise and peddle their views, most of which start with the premise that climate change is one big fat hoax.Research carried out by Stop Funding Heat, a group which is concerned about how some media outlets, wittingly or unwittingly, reinforce these views, shows that many of these ads had appeared on Facebook in the months leading up to COP26.Now, where have we heard this before? If we re-wind a few weeks to early October, Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager-turned-whistleblower, opened-up a can of worms for the platform when she claimed the company put profits before public good. She also claimed ""the version of Facebook that exists today is tearing our societies apart and causing ethnic violence around the world"". Possibly the most damaging allegation she made, however, was that the company was aware of the damage Instagram was causing to teen mental health and wellbeing yet did nothing to rectify it.Haugen is by no means the first person to have a go at Facebook and she certainly won't be the last. Cyber-psychologists, former founders and investors, politicians and presidents, suicide prevention experts, data protection authorities and civil rights organisations have all had reason to complain about Facebook at some stage over the last 10 years. One voice that has been conspicuously absent from the debate is the advertising industry. Apart from the recent petition by CAN and two separate and temporary boycotts - in 2020 to coincide with the Stop Funding Hate initiative and in 2019 after it livestreamed the Christchurch mass-murder - the advertising industry has largely refrained from passing any kind of judgment on Facebook. This is quite extraordinary for an industry that constantly dines out on social purpose and talks a lot about authenticity and transparency. Could it be that the two are co-dependent on each other to such an extent that both have a lot to lose?On the one hand Facebook is almost wholly dependent on advertising. In 2020, for example, it generated $84.2bn ((EURO)74.2bn) from advertising alone. That's a lot of advertisers and advertising agencies which it is beholden to. Indeed many of the large international advertising networks, consultancies and their subsidiaries are also beholden to the digital platforms like Facebook and Google. In fact, it would be hard to find an international network or consultancy group that doesn't count Facebook, Google or one of the other digital platforms or their subsidiaries as a client.So, not only are these digital giants the recipients of the substantial investment that is made in advertising, but they are also big spenders when it comes to marketing and advertising their own wares. Knowing which side its bread is buttered on, is it any wonder that the advertising industry has kept relatively schtum for so long?Frances Haugen's recent revelations about Facebook, however, have been likened by many to a Big Tobacco moment. It's an apt analogy. Surely the advertising industry must know what comes next?\l"

""Countries with historically high per capita emissions, such as in North America and Europe, need to achieve much larger generational reductions than countries with historically low per capita emissions, such as India.""In our net zero emissions by 2050 scenario, the lifetime CO2 footprints of individuals born in the US or EU in the 1950s will be around 15 times greater than the footprints of their descendants born in the 2020s,"" it said.Encouragingly, today's generations are far more active in tackling the climate crisis, the authors said -- but that requires current governments and leaders to accelerate action to match the enthusiasm of young people.""Clean energy technologies require years of research and development to reach market.""Sweeping systemic decarbonisation is necessary, not only to allow younger generations more flexibility in their lifestyle choices but also to safeguard the future for younger generations.""This makes it imperative that today's leaders set in motion the necessary policies and investments right now,"" the authors said.The stark findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in the summer led to a range of new commitments at the UN climate change summit Cop26 in Glasgow in November.The IPCC report said the global temperature in 2020 was nearly 1.1C warmer than 19th-century levels, and that the evidence was clear and incontrovertible that people are driving global warming. \l"

Lead author Dr Jean O'Dwyer said: ""This research highlights the somewhat hidden impacts of the climate crisis and emphasises that this global challenge comes with very local and personal consequences.""Whether you're in Ireland or Indonesia, if an extreme weather event threatens your home, your livelihood or your physical health, it will almost certainly impact your mental health too.""Prof \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir said there not only needed to be physical protections against extreme weather, such as flood barriers, but also a complete rethink of how society operated.""We talk about the technical fixes - switching to an electric vehicle rather than not driving - when so much of the transformation that's required in consumption is one that we haven't started to grapple with.UCC has a think-tank project with political scientists, engineers, philosophers, historians and other experts all focused on the issue of system change.Prof \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir said it was looking at ""the deep underlying inbuilt institutional system flaws that we have"".""The systems, not just in terms of climate but in other areas - think of Covid - are not fit for purpose for the world in which we are living.

The two-day meeting of almost 120 heads of state comes at the start of a fortnight of intensive negotiations between 192 nations that ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement with the aim of achieving sufficient cuts to greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C. The collective effort has been inadequate and more dramatic cuts are now needed to keep the goal within sights.Speaking in advance of his appearance, Mr Martin said it was time for ""action matching the rhetoric"".He said he drew hope from the scale of involvement by world leaders in COP26 that real change was possible.But he also acknowledged that, on the home front, momentum was in danger of being stymied by scepticism around the relative costs and benefits of climate action.He launched a firm defence of the carbon tax which was raised again in the Budget, drawing criticism from the opposition and rumblings of discontent within his own backbench.Mr Martin said it was opposed by some ""for electoral reasons"" and stressed it was important for disincentivising fossil fuels while boosting revenues for spending on climate action programmes.""It gives valuable resources to Government to invest in retrofitting, for example, to invest in more environmentally friendly farming,"" he said.""We want to create income systems that reward farmers for protecting biodiversity, for protecting our water ways and for creating food production systems that will be less harmful in terms of emissions.""Facing down the agrifood sector is a major challenge for the Government which is due to publish the revised climate action plan with a range of emission limits for individual sectors of society on Thursday.Ireland is signing up to an EU-US-led pact launched at COP26 to reduce global methane emissions by 30pc by 2030.That puts further pressure on Irish farming, which produces a third of the country's total emissions. There is not full agreement within Fianna F\'e1il on some of the higher emission limits proposed for agriculture, even though they are lower than the average of 45pc-50pc cuts set to be imposed on other sectors.Mr Martin said no economic activity would be untouched by the climate crisis.""It will not be economically sustainable to carry on the way we are carrying on, either nationally or globally,"" he said.He said, however, that there was work to be done to win over the public to this view.""We have to work with people and bring people with us.There is a significant communications campaign required.""Mr Martin spent much of yesterday in informal meetings with other heads of state, including US President Joe Biden, who reaffirmed his support for the Good Friday Agreement as tensions continue over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol.He also attended a world leaders £ction and solidarity' event at which he confirmed the Government's pledge to more than double Ireland's contribution to climate finance for developing countries from (EURO)93m a year currently to (EURO)225m by 2025.""In acting as a global community, climate justice must be at the centre of our efforts. Countries and communities struggling to cope already must have our support,"" he told the round-table event hosted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.He said: ""We must have the courage to take action now and collectively secure a safe and sustainable planet for generations to come.""We have a unique opportunity before us to step up our ambition to turn the tide on climate change.""\l"

Teachers who participate in the training will also be well placed to deliver a new Open College Network accredited GCSE entitled \' Reducing Carbon Footprints Through Environmental Action\' .The initiative follows the first ever Carbon Literacy Day, organised by the Carbon Literacy Project, which coincided with the first day of the UN COP26 negotiations in Glasgow last month. The Carbon Literacy training is designed to build confidence, knowledge, skills and motivation to empower individuals and organisations to play a critical role in responding to the climate crisis. KNIB aims to help embed Carbon Literacy education into schools across Northern Ireland, to change lifestyles and promote behaviour that leads to positive, individual action in reducing carbon emissions.The programmes, which include \' Carbon Literacy for Teachers,\' \' Carbon Smart Students,\' \' Carbon Literacy for Youth Leaders,\' and \' Carbon Smart Youth Groups,\' will deliver targeted training to teachers, youth leaders and young people in a variety of settings.Commenting on the new programme, Environment Minister Edwin Poots said:  My department is investing in Carbon Literacy programmes to help educate this and future generations about the threat of climate change and the impact their day-to-day behaviour has on our climate. Delivered by Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, the project will help people improve their knowledge and understanding of carbon and how their daily activities like travel, energy use and food consumption impact on emissions. They can then better understand the positive changes they need to make in terms of how they live, study and work, both as individuals and organisations, to help in the fight against climate change. Research has shown that 75% of teachers say they feel they have not received adequate training to educate students about climate change, while 69% of teachers feel there should be more teaching about climate change in schools. Meanwhile 68% of pupils want to learn more about the environment and climate change.Dr Ian Humphreys, Chief Executive of Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful said:  Having recently returned from the conference, it is clear that more and more young people are demanding information and action in response to the climate emergency. We need to see environmental education becoming a formalised part of the Northern Ireland curriculum and we can\' t afford to wait years to see this happen. In the mean-time the carbon literacy programmes will provide vital training for educators and young people and our hope is that they will then go on to influence others. Lorraine McCool, a teacher from Loreto College in Coleraine, who has already taken part in the training, said;  My Carbon Literacy Programme training was extremely useful and interesting, with excellent support offered both during and after the course. I\' m now much more confident in discussing climate issues with my students, and excited for the changes that I can make in my own life from what I\' ve learned. I highly recommend Carbon Literacy training to anyone who works with young people. The Carbon Literacy Programmes are delivered in partnership with the registered charity, the Carbon Literacy Trust, which was founded in 2009 and operates in 14 countries worldwide.

President Alok Sharma has urged delegates to make this UN climate summit the one where rich nations ""consign coal power to history"".Banks and other financial institutions including the ADB, Citi and HSBC are also expected to step up to the call, announcing financial mechanisms to help countries quit coal.Earlier this week, countries including the United States revealed plans to crack down on emissions of methane, the second-biggest cause of climate change after CO2 emissions.More than 100 nations pledged to slash methane emissions by 2030 from 2020 levels.But as the world ditches dirty fuels, there is urgent need to boost renewable energy sources.Solar and wind power, along with clean-burning green hydrogen, will come into the conversation, as well as projects aimed at capturing and keeping carbon emissions from the atmosphere.For industries unable to decarbonise immediately, some of these developing technologies are seen as key. HYPERLINK Latest COP26 Major companies have been asked to join the ""Race to Zero"" pledge to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.UN climate envoy Mark Carney said yesterday that private finance was set to help with that goal through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, whose members control assets worth $130 trillion. Delegates are also still wrangling over the rules around Article 6, the section of the UN Convention on Climate Change that deals with markets for trading carbon emissions that continue to be emitted.One of the toughest tasks will be in synchronising global rules around these markets, as well as in agreeing on a global price for carbon.Set too low, the price would offer little incentive for companies to rein in emissions; but a price set too high could end up stymieing industry.Yesterday, banks and finance companies promised to channel ""trillions"" of dollars towards meeting climate change goals by 2050.There is cautious optimism that progress can be made at the summit with Mr Sharma saying the energy brought by world leaders at the outset is being replicated in the negotiating rooms.Additional reporting Reuters\l"

Still you have to admire the chutzpah of the Executive.Stand aside Sir David Attenborough, make way Greta Thunberg - the planet may be at risk but Stormont is on the ball.Flying into the conference were our two top caped crusaders, Super-DUPer Man, Paul Givan and Wonder Woman, Michelle O'Neill.""The Executive stands ready to play its part in this global response,"" declared Michelle.Given that this is the same Executive which can't even deliver a shopping voucher scheme without messing up, poor old Mother Nature may not see that offer as the sturdiest of straws to be clutched at.The hypocrisy in Glasgow this week was eye-watering. Somewhere in the region of 400 private jets flew in for a conference on how to curtail harmful emissions.There were thousands of attendees, billionaires, politicians and their enormous retinues of spads and specialists, plus business leaders and the world's media (the American section of which, strangely, chose to hang out in Edinburgh).Anybody who was anybody was there - along with everybody who has everything.Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates were centre stage. Prince Charles. Leonardo DiCaprio.Joe Biden was ferried to the gig in a limo that does a mere eight miles to the gallon (petrol). Outside, an unusually cheery-looking Greta Thunberg was thrilling fans with her trademark ""blaa, blaa, blaa"" chant and some bad words.Boris Johnston said it was one minute to midnight. If even half conference attendees had stayed at home we could maybe have squeaked another minute out of it.How much will COP26 actually achieve in the long run?China's Xi Jingping and Russia's Mr Putin, representing two of the world's major polluters, stayed away however.And for many of the world's poorer developing nations, while zero emissions is seen as a fine aim, there's the small question of how their already meagre economies stretch to the changes required. Big business has jumped on the sustainable bandwagon but is accused of rampant ""greenraised washing"" i.e. posing as environmentally sound whilst being nothing of the sort. In much of the world of commerce, ""green"" is a marketing strategy not a principle.Outside the conference Greta Thunberg - who dismissed whatever the eff (her word) world leaders were doing in there - suggested that she and her over-excited followers might be able to effect change without intergovernmental assistance.

Every sector of our society will have to contribute to the reduction of emissions but the parallel side of that is, it will create opportunities, it will create jobs, it will create a healthier world, and a healthier country in Ireland, he said.

The scale of the challenge is such that everyone across society has their part to play, he said.He said there was  much to do if commitments on building a more sustainable society were to be met.Mr Poots, who tabled his department\' s climate change legislation in June, said  creating green jobs and nurturing opportunities through investment and innovation needed to be the focus of the executive.He described climate change as the  defining crisis of our time on a global scale . It must be recognised that we cannot continue with a business as usual approach, we must act now before it is too late, he said. We have all seen first-hand the effects of climate change and there are other numerous challenges ahead - reducing our emissions, improving air quality, tackling plastic pollution, achieving zero waste, and the development of a circular economy. The next decade must be one of urgent action, there is still time to make a difference, but we must act now and we must do it together.:Mr Poots said the Green Growth strategy was an  over-arching multi-decade strategy that sets out a  long-term vision and a solid framework for tackling the climate crisis by balancing climate action with the need for a clean, resilient environment and economy .\l"

The (2015) Paris agreement talked a lot about goals [to keep the mean global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius] but it didn\' t offer strategies on how to achieve them, she said. Ideally stronger, grounded commitments would come out of this that are binding. Ms Hamley set up Climate Craic - Northern Ireland\' s first climate festival - which was held in September.She wants to see governments, including the executive, give strong financial support to help citizens buy greener technologies, including home heating pumps.However, she said people also need to alter their behaviour. I\' m not saying that everyone has to be vegan but if you eat meat three times a day you really need to re-think that, she said.She said the north needs to do its part to meet the UK\' s climate commitments. I find it challenging living in Northern Ireland and navigating this landscape between what Britain says and does and what Northern Ireland does, she said.She added:  Sometimes Northern Ireland can get away with not doing as much.

Global emissions fell 5.4 per cent in 2020 amid strict lockdowns and restrictions, but a report from the Global Carbon Project forecasts an increase of 4.9 per cent to 36.4 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent this year.The research team - including scientists from the University of Exeter and University of East Anglia - says a further rise in emissions next year ""cannot be ruled out if road transport and aviation return to pre-pandemic levels and coal use is stable"".""The rapid rebound in emissions as economies recover from the pandemic reinforces the need for immediate global action on climate change,"" said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein of University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute. Delegates at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow are attempting to forge a global agreement to halve emissions by 2030. Reaching net zero by 2050 entails cutting global emissions by 1.4 billion tonnes each year on average, Prof Friedlingstein said. ""This highlights the scale of action now required, and hence the importance of Cop26 discussions.""For China, a major manufacturing hub, the response to the pandemic sparked further growth in emissions, pushed by the energy and industry sectors, the report says. Emissions in the US and EU should rise above last year's reduced totals but will stay some 4 per cent below those seen in 2019. China is this year projected to emit 11.1 billion tonnes of CO2 - 31 per cent of global emissions, the analysis says. The US is projected to emit 5.1 billion tonnes of CO2 - 14 per cent of the total - and EU states are forecast to emit a combined 2.8 billion tonnes (7 per cent), a similar percentage to India.

Heat stress is defined as a wet bulb globe temperature - a measurement taking into account temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation - of above 32C.It can induce heat exhaustion, with symptoms including heavy sweating and a rapid pulse, which can in turn put a strain on the heart and other organs.The elderly, those with pre-existing health conditions and those with physical, outdoor jobs are at the greatest risk. According to analysis, the earth was on course for 2.7C of warming under countries' carbon emissions reduction pledges going into the Cop26 climate negotiations.US climate envoy John Kerry said if the pledges made so far during the summit are kept, it would put humanity on course for 1.8C, the International Energy Agency has said.The Met Office warned that in a future where runaway global warming reaches 4C, half of the world's population would be living with heat stress.The heat stress maps are part of research projecting the future impacts of different consequences of climate change under 2C and at 4C, and also look at river flooding, wildfire risk, drought and food insecurity. It was conducted by an international team of scientists in the EU-funded Helix project, and led by the University of Exeter.Dr Andy Hartley, climate impacts lead at the Met Office, said: ""Currently, the (heat stress) metric is met in several locations, such as parts of India, but our analysis shows that with a rise of 4C, extreme heat risk could affect people in large swathes of most of the world's continents.""Prof Richard Betts, of the University of Exeter and Met Office, who led the Helix project, said: ""It is still possible to avoid these higher risks if we act now.""\l"

She lays out the stakes for me: how the world needs to keep within the 1.5 degree temperature increase aspired to five years ago in Paris; how scientific advances have made things far more measurable; and how young activists deserve ""action"" not ""blah, blah, blah"". But she also worries because countries like China aren't in attendance and that poorer countries are underrepresented. ""We're not going to have enough of the real voices, because they can't get to the Cop. It's a bit too white and elite, frankly, because of Covid and [because] they didn't manage the security and the prices."" She's still optimistic. ""I have to be a prisoner of hope.""The Action Hub, in zone B of the Scottish Event Campus, is the bit with the aforementioned globe. There's a Forest of Promises, which is an artificial tree covered with leaves on which children have written things such as ""I promise to use public transport"" and ""I will use les electrisity"". And there's an LED tickertape circling the venue to remind everyone where they are and who the partners/sponsors are. The furniture is from Ikea and the television networks have set up studios here. I see Ed Miliband and the actor Mark Strong.Most people I speak to on my first day at Cop26 have Robinson's feeling of worried hope. There are an estimated 30,000 attendees, although several thousand of those spend the morning outside queueing in the icy Glasgow cold. That group included Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir and his colleagues from UCC's Environmental Research Institute, who are here as observers. Like Robinson, he's conscious of the failure to meet the goals set in Paris, but he also stresses how much good collaborative work gets done in the connections that are made here.We've been watching Cop26's people's advocate, David Attenborough, deliver his speech on a big screen. \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir notes something Attenborough said about how the countries suffering most from climate change aren't the ones causing it. His colleague, philosophy lecturer Kian Mintz-Woo, concurs. ""Both morally and practically, it's really important for the western world [to fund] the developing countries to mitigate and adapt. At a symbolic or moral level, it shows that we're in this together.""In zone D there is a huge room full of ""delegation pavilions"" at which various countries, NGOs and companies have demonstrations and talks and, sometimes, free coffee. Prime minister Stefan L\'f6fven is speaking at the Swedish pavilion. The Environmental Defense Fund is promoting a satellite it is launching to monitor methane emissions. Many smaller countries argue for climate justice. At the pavilion of the endangered archipelago of Tuvalu, people are getting selfies with sculptures of polar bears in life jackets and a penguin hanging from a noose.These are the work of Taiwanese artist Vincent JF Huang. ""Sea level is rising. We predict that [there's] only 20 or 30 more years the Tuvaluans can continue staying on their island. This is quite an urgent situation.

The Dublin Declaration also calls for a global commitment to phasing out coal power generation by 2025; a quadrupling of installed renewable energy every year over the coming decade and rapid electrification of the global economy.It puts ""just transition at its core, recognising the need of the poorest and most vulnerable"" and calls for strong public policy, support for developing countries in making the investments they require to embrace renewable energy and measures ""to incentivise a shift from carbon technology"".The document was produced following the convening of the Dublin Climate Dialogues, a two-day virtual conference. It sought to prompt greater climate ambitions at the critical UN COP26 summit in Glasgow in November, which is being hosted by the UK government. ""Globally, nationally, locally, corporately, collectively, and individually it is not too late to choose,"" the declaration states. ""We each have a voice, a duty of care to act and a moral responsibility to make our world a better place to hand on to our children and future generations."" COP26 requires global leaders, it notes, ""to make their policy ambitions commensurate with and reflective of the promised aim of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees, and given the grave risks, to strive for 1.5 degrees"". The call was endorsed by US climate envoy John Kerry in his address to participants at the conference, hosted by University College Dublin. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney welcomed the thrust of the declaration before it was handed over to the UK government representative and COP26 envoy John Murton in a virtual exchange.The contributions ""remind us again that climate change has implications across all aspects of our society as well as our financial, economic and political systems"", Mr Coveney said.He highlighted the daily challenges and fears of climate change in vulnerable countries including small island states. ""This is why the transition must be a just one,"" he said. Dialogues chairman Pat Cox said the declaration ""does not purport to represent the official position of any governmental or non-governmental participants or their organisations"", but accurately reflects the views of participants including representatives of major carbon emitting countries - the US, the EU, China and Japan - who account for 58 per cent of global emissions.It came with the message that the world has to immediately face up to ""the drastic urgency of dealing with climate change"" underpinned by climate justice, he added. This required admitting ""real delivery did not happen since Paris"" - a reference to landmark climate agreement signed by 197 countries in 2015.""To succeed, collaborative engagement at every level of governance, public and private, has to be at the heart of this transformative transition,"" he added.Speaking at the handover, Mr Cox said COP26 ""is truly a date with destiny, globally and locally. The stakes are too high to contemplate anything other than a firm collective resolve to act with a sense of urgency and acceleration"".\l"

So what have we learnt from two weeks of leaders' statements, massive protests and side deals on coal, stopping fossil fuel finance and deforestation, plus the final signed Glasgow Climate Pact?From phasing out coal to carbon market loopholes, here is what you need to know:The Glasgow Climate Pact is incremental progress and not the breakthrough moment needed to curb the worst impacts of climate change. The UK government as host and therefore president of COP26 wanted to ""keep 1.5C alive"", the stronger goal of the Paris Agreement. But at best they can say the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C is on life support \- it has a pulse but it's nearly dead.The Paris Agreement says temperatures should be limited to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels, and countries should ""pursue efforts"" to limit warming to 1.5C. Before COP26, the world was on track for 2.7C of warming, based on commitments by countries, and expectation of the changes in technology. Announcements at COP26, including new pledges to cut emissions this decade, by some key countries, have reduced this to a best estimate of 2.4C.More countries also announced long-term net zero goals. One of the most important was India's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2070. Critically, the country said it would get off to a quick start with a massive expansion of renewable energy in the next ten years so that it accounts for 50% of its total usage, reducing its emissions in 2030 by 1 billion tonnes (from a current total of around 2.5 billion).Fast-growing Nigeria also pledged net zero emissions by 2060. Countries accounting for 90% of the world's GDP have now pledged to go net zero by the middle of this century.A world warming by 2.4C is still clearly very far from 1.5C. What remains is a near-term emissions gap, as global emissions look likely to flatl"

Who among us, after a trans- Atlantic flight, a bevy of conference events and multiple, doubtless pro forma speeches, wouldn't be tempted to rest one's eyes? (And besides, the entire world now knows that it was Britain's Boris Johnson - maskless, rumpled, unserious - who was really asleep.)The snoozy snapshots might have been amusing, but they also seemed symbolic of the approach much of the US leadership has taken to climate issues: eyes closed.By the end of the week, Biden was pushed out of the climate-related spotlight by images of Democrat West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin - taken not at the conference, but in Washington - pushing young climate protesters aside with his silver Maserati, on his way out of his yacht club's garage.Biden does actually seem to care about climate. Hours after being sworn in as president, he announced that the US would rejoin the Paris climate accord - an agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius and ideally below 1.5 - reversing his predecessor's abrupt withdrawal.And Biden's Build Back Better plan contains a historic $555bn ((EURO)479bn) in climate change mitigation investments, even if the overall infrastructure package has shrunk significantly in size due to congressional objections to the multi-trillion-dollar price tag.And Manchin? Does he care? Absolutely not. In fact, Manchin has almost single-handedly been holding up parts of Build Back Better, with particular animus toward the bill's clean energy measures. (Manchin is the top Senate recipient of campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry this election cycle and has personal financial stakes in fossil fuel companies.)It was reportedly for fear of alienating Manchin that the US decl"

Deadly heatwaves that kill millions in a week, devastating acts of eco-terrorism, acute water shortages and accelerating extinction rates. The book can be read as ""a vast scenario exercise showing how the transformation of finance becomes part of the solution to the climate crisis,"" according to Nick Robins, professor of sustainable finance at the London School of Economics. In the book, the Ministry for the Future, a fictional body set up under the Paris Agreement, issues a new currency called the Carbon Coin, in support of projects that sequester carbon from the atmosphere such as forestry. In the novel, the world of finance takes this shift in its stride and the carbon coin becomes just like every other commodity, in the process ""hedging the apocalypse"". If only. So far there is little evidence that international emissions trading mechanisms have delivered meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. There has been much talk of the huge potential for trading in carbon credits to incentivise and reward mitigation. But is this just a euphemism for the creation of a new class of assets for speculators? Does trading really benefit the global atmosphere?We are about to find out. When delegates from the world's nations reconvene at the end of this month in Glasgow for they will resume consideration of the last section of the Paris Agreement rulebook that has not yet been finalised - article 6. The purpose of emissions trading under article 6 is to allow parties to co-operate in pursuit of higher ambition. So far so good. Article 6.2 makes it clear that transfers of what are called ""mitigation outcomes"", such achieved emissions reductions, must be subject to robust accounting to avoid double counting of emissions reductions. Nationally determined contributions Basically this means that if country A overachieves its nationally determined contribution (NDC) it could ""sell' the surplus to country B, but the emissions reductions can only be recorded on one party's inventory, not both. The Paris text tries to circumvent the potential for ""hot air"" by requiring ""environmental integrity"" and an ""overall mitigation in global emissions"", but there is no agreement yet on how to operationalise these aspirations in the draft rules. The Paris decision makes it clear that a corresponding adjustment must be made to the host country's inventory if mitigation outcomes are transferred. It should be noted that this principle may also apply to transactions under article 6.4 under the sustainable development mechanism, depending on what is agreed in Glasgow.

Read More Meanwhile, it is believed that 400 private jets will be utilised to transport politicians and business executives in and out of the UK for the climate event, emitting an estimated 2t of carbon for every hour in the air. And yet fuel for planes, as well as ships, seems to be escaping from the carbon tax.In the lead up to COP26 I was very interested to hear the views of Dr Marguerite Nyhan, senior lecturer in future sustainability at UCC in one particular interview.She noted that half of the world's 4 billion population live in cities; and this figure is set to grow to almost 70% by 2050.As it stands, about two thirds of people live in urban areas in Ireland.But while cities only represent 3% of land cover globally, they account for 70% of global energy consumption and 75% of global CO2 emissions, the UCC lecturer outl"

That means strengthening links between cities like Cork and Coventry, and nurturing new academic and research links between Leeside and Plymouth in the southwest of England.For a career diplomat that has seen postings in the likes of Bosnia, Kosovo, the UN, Nato, and Sweden, the posting in Ireland brings a whole new diplomatic challenge, with climate change high on the agenda.""Whatever the short-term differences between the governments over certain aspects of important political issues, the more we create networks between people, businesses, institutions, activists, you strengthen that underlying web of relationships, which is the real resilience of the overall relationship,"" said Mr Johnston.""When I arrived in Sweden, I immediately started going to Gothenberg and Malmo and to the north of the country.""When I came here, Cork was going to be my first visit outside of Dublin, and I was going to go to Limerick, Galway, Donegal, Belfast.""I couldn't do that for most of my first year, effectively - although it has been a pleasure delayed - I think this visit to Cork is going to be one of the first of many, because as someone who comes from a place a long, long way from London, I'm strongly of the view that relationships are not just about capital cities,"" Mr Johnston told the Irish Examiner.""My hope is to be able to foster new-age partnerships between Cork and cities in the UK,"" he said.""My predecessor came here some years ago to inaugurate the Joining The Dots programme, and the whole idea of that was to get away from the exclusive focus on London and Dublin, and think about different parts of Ireland and different parts of the UK.""Coming here to Cork is sort of opening a new chapter on that. You look at the potential, whether it is in business or academia, or culture, for how we can create new networks and connections between Cork and different parts of the UK.""The two-week UN climate change summit in his native city means partnerships and good relations between Ireland and Britain are more important than ever, according to Mr Johnston.""At an event in the embassy soon after I arrived looking at renewable energy, offshore wind, one of the things I heard about was that UCC has a big emphasis on sustainability, ranked one of the highest universities in the world in terms of its sustainable impacts,"" he said. ""In a way, there can be no more suitable days in coming to Cork than on the day Cop26 is looking at the role of cities and regions in the longer-term sustainability.""We are looking in cultural terms at building up the connections between Cork and Coventry, which is the UK City of Culture next year. We are also keen to build in the areas of science and innovation. I think that renewable energy, offshore wind, sustainability more generally means I am really keen on meeting so many colleagues here. It's a timely visit.""The UK has become a world leader in the offshore wind energy sector, and there is ""enormous potential"" for working in partnership with Ireland in the ever-burgeoning sector, he said.""One of the things I did when ambassador in Sweden was encourage Swedish investment in the UK renewable energy sector,"" he said.""The big Swedish energy companies were some of those in the early stage offshore wind in the UK.""Even the last 10 or 15 years, it's interesting - back in the early days, we had to as a government put a lot of money into subsidising that investment, because the technology was a bit unpredictable, the market wasn't very clear.""Some overseas investors really needed to be persuaded that there would be a guaranteed level of price for their electricity.""Now the technology is advanced, the whole transition towards electric vehicles and decarbonising the economy has meant the market situation is very different and now, your renewable energy, while not selling itself, has become much more marketable as a proposition.""There is no getting away from the current political tension, he conceded. But it is solvable, the career diplomat is keen to stress.""I think the two governments want to have a really strong relationship,"" he said.""The societies, economies, and their people are so intertwined, that I think we see very common agendas.""If you look at the emphasis on the Irish Government's National Development Plan, so much of it overlaps with what our government is trying to do in its Levelling Up agenda - spreading wealth and opportunity, connectivity across the countries.""Clearly we are having an important discussion at the moment with the EU on the protocol, Britain and Ireland have very shared interests and objectives in terms of peace and stability in Northern Ireland, and to make sure the balances in the Good Friday Agreement for a really strong north-south connection, and east-west connection, are developed.""It is not a great secret that there are differences of approaches between the British and Irish governments in terms of aspects of the details, but as the Taoiseach has said in the D\'e1il, and our minister has said in the House of Lords, we both want to focus on trying to get a negotiated solution, because that would be the best and most sustainable way forward.""The good thing about having a really strong established set of relationships, as between Britain and Ireland, is that you can have honest, candid conversations, you can have differences of opinion ... I am confident we have shared medium and long-term objectives, we sometimes differ over the short-term strategy or tactics.""If you stand back a bit and look at the wider world, we as European democracies have so much in common, obviously in terms of Northern Ireland and preserving the gains in the Good Friday Agreement. ""But if you look at some of the challenges that liberal democracies face in other parts of the world, from state and non-state actors, it is really important that countries like Ireland and the UK work together, as we do on the UN Security Council, as we're doing this week in climate change negotiations, and some of the agendas of the future, such as renewable energy, digital health - there are tremendous possibilities.""Cop26 must be a turning point for the world when it comes to forging lasting partnerships for sustainable living, economies, and societies, Mr Johnston said.""If we have learned anything in the last few years, it's the value of a more healthy lifestyle, walking, trying to use more public transport, trying to innovate in how we live. If you look at what we have been trying to do at , taking carbon out of our economy, getting people into more healthy lifestyles, breathing more life into city centres, I think this needs to be a turning point for the planet.""I was reflecting on Armistice Day at Glasnevin Cemetery, and one of the former soldiers read out the famous words: 'For your tomorrow, we gave our today.'""What everyone at Cop26 should be doing is something today and the day after for the whole planet.""\l"

Read what people have signed up to. It is a global pledge.``So globally, collectively, in different ways and through different mechanisms, countries who sign up will contribute to that overall 30% global reduction in methane.''Mr Martin said the Government's climate action plan will ``deal with every sector'', including energy, transport, agriculture, land use and deforestation.Ms Shorthall also asked the Taoiseach for clarity on plans to cull the national herd as part of Ireland's climate goals.She noted that the Green Party has called for a reduction in size, while members of the other coalition parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, have ``mysteriously started to use the phrase ''stabilisation``.Mr Martin did not respond to the question despite repeated requests from Ms Shorthall.Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin said the recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows we are facing a ``code red for humanity''.``The carbon budgets proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council (was published) last week and that's what we're looking at in the Climate Action Plan - that hasn't come to government,'' she added.``I'm going to be in the climate committee, so it hasn't been agreed yet but I think everything we do, we have to remember that we're in an existential crisis here.``Every thing has a benefit and there are co-benefits and whatever targets - when it comes to emission reductions - you have to look at cleaner air and public transport increasing, and less traffic congestion and more jobs.``So I'll be in that climate committee this afternoon and that's when things will be agreed.''She said the Green Party is ``making a change'' in its time in Government. Ms Martin added that the public has to remember the benefits of reducing emissions.``Instead of them and us, we must try and approach this in a more together atmosphere and look at the benefits of cleaner (air), less traffic congestion, and more public transport,'' the minister added. end\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland424","LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","Irish Examiner"," ","Cop26: We must not forget millions in global southNow that the Cop26Whilst there has been progress, with the critical climate change crisis placed firmly on the global agenda, we are still on course for 2.4 degrees warming. And there is deep disappointment that powerful states did not flex all their muscles to go that extra step to steer current and future generations to safety.For example, Tr\'f3caire was particularly disappointed at the omission of Loss and Damage financing from the final agreement. This was a missed opportunity by powerful nations, who have contributed most to climate change, to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. However, it is vital that we don't lose heart. And now that the focus will move to other issues it is critical that momentum created by Cop26 is not lost. It is up to all of us to build on the achievements secured, to bridge the gaps, and to pressure decision-makers at home and abroad to continue to act with urgency. It is easy to label Cop26 a cop-out. But a lot can and must be achieved before nations reconvene in Egypt for Cop27.Ireland can play its part. We must not forget the millions in the global south who are most impacted by the climate crisis, and whose young people are now mobilising to demand change. They have done least to cause this crisis. This is a matter of climate justice.Caoimhe de BarraCEO, Tr\'f3caireMaynoothCo KildareLet's treat addicts as patients, not criminalsOf course ordinary citizens wish that the forces of law and order would put an end to the scourge; lock up the miscreants, confiscate their ill gotten wealth and be relieved of all of the burdens that the trade imposes on our societies. However virtuous, such an approach is not going to succeed.Why? Because of the unimaginable amount of monetary gain it offers to the criminals involved.Our conception of the shady characters on street corners and back alleys being the drug pushers is wrong. Most are just sad misfits operating as powerless retailers. We clog our court systems and expensive jails with them with very little hope of rehabilitation, because they know no other life. For every one we deprive of liberty, there are dozens of replacements. Some amongst them are more dangerous, prone to violence, and with ambition to move up the gang ladder. That is still not a full picture, but a nicely sanitised one that can be attributed to the supposed low life who live in the inner cities. Meanwhile, the drug lords are swimming in an ocean of cash of such volumes that it cannot be dealt with without large numbers of bankers, financiers and accountants. Even the wealthy, who can afford recreational use of cocaine, are guilty of supporting a rancid industry.Because of the hurricane of illicit wealth being produced by the trade the one possibility of ending the plague lies in choking off the money supply, and the only hope of achieving that aim is to legalise and nationalise the entire industry.We can begin to treat our addicts as patients, not as criminals. Vast sums of money will start to re-enter the visible economy. Gun crime will reduce in many parts of the world as drug gangs' wealth is reduced.Frank KennanMountrathCo LaoisHats off to those protecting our healthVery few have the skill and composure to manage a major crisis. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, and Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan and others are doing an amazing job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances with constant pressure on themselves and their families. Meanwhile, the ""hurlers on the ditch"" can focus on finding fault without almost any fear of vigorous questioning of their propositions or motives.For instance, nightclub owners can rush to the media looking for ""clarity"". The notion that Miche\'e1l and Tony et al should spend time working out how nightclubs should be run safely in a pandemic is preposterous.Nightclub owners have had 18 months to do scenario planning, as good managers should do, rather than looking for specifics from Miche\'e1l, Tony and others who are hardly nightclub boppers, but are expected to solve all their woes.Pat O'MahonyWestport,Co MayoWe need to give the Government a breakI wonder if I am the only one sick and tired of having people demand a plan from the Government to get us out of this pandemic?It is asking the impossible. You can't plan for the completely unpredictable.We'd all love for it to end and go back to 'normal'.In the meantime we need to make the best of it and be grateful we have a reasonably sensible and stable government who are trying their best.Patrick BrowneSkehard RdCorkRestricting nightclubs a no-brainerIt's infuriating that a few bad apples have refused to assume social awareness and responsibility during Covid. Not even I can blame the government for anything!Dr Florence CravenBracknaghCo OffalyNo sympathy for drinking den ownersI haven't much sympathy for anybody who owns and operates what are ostensibly glorified drinking dens charging exorbitant prices to clients to achieve blotto-ness, sooner rather than later, so that they can count their extortionate profits while it's still dark.The government has now performed so many U-turns on any subject you care to mention, that it is now in lockstep on an ever decreasing circle, which is only going to end when it disappears up its own commodious backside.DundalkCo LouthEmployers' approach to recruitment poorI write regarding the current difficulties employers are having in recruiting staff.So far, all of the emphasis in this debate has been on the attitudes of workers and potential workers; but I submit that employers in all industries need to have a long hard look at themselves and their approach to recruitment. For example, employers' representative groups often talk about the need to 'think outside the box' (in order to find new ways to attract staff); I suggest employers stop 'thinking outside the box' and start using their common sense instead.An example of this common sense would be if employers and the State agencies set up programmes of training for the long-term unemployed, in various industries; these programmes would have to be accompanied by tangible (paid) work experience during the training and good rates of pay and proper working conditions, when trainees are fully qualified and gainfully employed.Participation in such programmes would have to be entirely voluntary, from the point of view of the unemployed person, with no compulsion of any kind. The long-term unemployed have, for a long time, been fobbed off with £ctivation' schemes which are utterly futile and waste an awful lot of taxpayers money every year.Another area where employers need to have a long hard look at themselves, is in their approach to job interviews. Over the last number of years, I have found the standard of interviewing skills within recruitment agencies and company interviewing panels to be very poor, as a rule. This is my experience of both multinationals and Irish-based companies. Interviewers and agency representatives don't prepare sufficiently (for the interview), they don't read CVs properly and there is a total lack of focus on the 'business at hand', for example finding the right person. It will come as a surprise to many employers, but a small bit of common decency, common courtesy and basic professionalism would go a long way towards attracting workers into any reputable industry.Tim BuckleyWhite StCork City\l"

Several police officers escorted her away from the throng.""Finally in Glasgow for the Cop26! And thank you for the very warm welcome,"" tweeted the 18-year-old, who included a picture of her giving a thumbsup to the assembled crowd.Scotland's Sunday Mail newspaper dubbed the scene 'Greta Mania'.Thunberg travelled by train to Glasgow from London, where she had taken part in a protest demanding that financial institutions stop funding fossil fuel extraction.In the BBC interview, Thunberg said that sometimes anger was the right response as part of environmental demonstrations.She was asked about the protest tactics of campaigners in the UK who in recent weeks have been blocking roads.""To make clear, as long as no one gets hurt... then I think sometimes you need to anger some people,"" she said.""Like, for instance, the school strike movement would never have become so big if there wasn't friction, if some people didn't get ped off.""Thunberg is expected to take part in a demonstration on November 5 organised by the Scottish arm of Fridays For Future, the student movement Thunberg founded in 2018.She is also scheduled to speak at a demonstration the following day.In the BBC interview, Thunberg said she hadn't ""officially"" been invited to speak at the conference.""I think that many people might be scared that if they invite too many radical young people, then that might make them look bad,"" she told Marr.She raised her fingers to make air quotes when she said the word ""radical"".She told Marr that the conference needed ""more representation from the so-called global south, from the most affected people and areas"".""It's not fair, when, for example, one country sends lots and lots of delegates, and then another country is very under-represented. That already creates an imbalance, and climate justice is at the very heart of this crisis.""The Cop26They said that people have been kept from getting to Glasgow by a range of obstacles, including lack of access to vaccines and travel and sky-high accommodation costs.About 25,000 international guests from nearly 200 countries are expected to attend the 12-day summit - Downing Street said it was one of the largest events the UK has ever hosted - and prices for some shortterm rental rooms have soared.

Mr Johnson and the French president met alone for half an hour yesterday morning on the fringes of the G20 summit in Rome, where they discussed next week's Cop26 climate summit, as well as tensions over Northern Ireland and fishing. French officials said, after the meeting, that there had been agreement over a path towards de-escalating the fishing dispute, in which Paris has raised the threat of trade barriers over what it says is the unfair allocation of post-Brexit licences to fish in UK waters.The two countries had agreed to work on ""practical and operational measures"" to resolve the dispute in the coming days, Mr Macron's officials said, adding: ""We are giving ourselves the space for de-escalation in the coming hours.""When asked about this, however, Mr Johnson's spokesman denied any agreement had been reached, or that there were even formal plans for more talks to discuss the situation. ""I've seen some of the same reporting following that meeting,"" he said.

The loss of four-year-old Bianca Antunes Henriques Nunes was the cruellest blow.She died in the terrible fire that tore through the central Portuguese region of Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande on June 17, 2017. It killed 66 people, injured 254, destroyed more than 500 homes and 50 businesses and incinerated 530 sq km of farms, forest and landscape.Eleven died in Nodeirinho, almost a third of its population, and reminders of their loss are everywhere: in the ruins of buildings, the still-blackened hills and the suffering of the bereaved. A child's laughter would be like a flower in the debris.From her home in the village, Duarte, president of the Association of Victims of the Pedr\'f3g\'e3o Grande Fire, tells of the immense sorrow that hangs over the region.""Most of the victims, they want to suffer their pain in solitude. They do not open their hearts so easy,"" she says.""They could not say goodbye to their dear ones. They do not understand how their children died, how their mother and father died. It's still very difficult to accept their loss.""There were many contributory causes of the fire. The region's small farms and native forests of fire-resistant cork oaks and chestnut had been replaced with commercial plantations of eucalyptus and pine.Fast-growing eucalyptus does well in the climate and produces not only timber but oil, which increases its flammability.The plantations supply the international paper market, providing the raw material for everything from office paper to toilet roll.Duarte despairs of how the land is used, but the social and economic reasons behind it are complex. Small farmers cannot make a living in an agrifood industry dominated by multinationals.""In the past, everybody made terraces on the hills to plant the crops. It's hard work, fixing the terraces, catching the water, growing the crops.

Much of the rest came from the combustion of fossil fuels.Mitigation measures in those sectors - including protecting forests from clear-cutting, sequestering carbon in agricultural soils, and more sustainable diets - can provide as much as 20%-30% of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.Scientists say that is the threshhold at which climate change risks spinning out of control.""Indigenous Peoples, private forest owners, local farmers and communities manage a significant share of global forests and agricultural land and play a central role in land-based mitigation options,"" the report said.While the changes required in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors - dubbed AFOLU by climate specialists - would not cost much to implement, there is little momentum so far to trigger them, the report said.A lack of institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term tradeoffs of how land is managed, and the dispersed nature of private land holdings have hindered implementation so far, it said.""Land provides us with so much, for example, food, nature, and our livelihoods,"" said Di\'e1na \'dcrge-Vorsatz, vice chair of the IPCC working group that authored the report. ""These competing demands have to be carefully managed.""One major obstacle is that dictating diet is divisive.The IPCC panel's initial report summary included a recommendation that consumers shift to plant-based diets and reduce their intake of meat, according to a draft seen by Reuters.But the final version of the summary included a recommendation instead for balanced diets that include sustainably produced animal products alongside plants like grains and legumes.Asked about the changes, Joanna House, an expert on land use at the University of Bristol and an author of the report, said she could not comment on why the changes were made but said the issue of dietary changes is complex.""If meat is produced sustainably, it can be low carbon and support soil carbon and nutrients,"" she said. ""If produced unsustainably, particularly in intense systems requiring large amounts of animal feed that result in deforestation, it can cause large net emissions."" Global demand for livestock products is growing, a headwind to cutting agriculture's emissions, the report said.The reaction to the report has been one of considerable concern.""We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said with the report's release.""But current climate pledges would [still] mean a 14% increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfill even these inadequate promises.""At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says.Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity.""It's now or never,"" IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said on the report - the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years.While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday's tackled ways of curbing emissions - making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments.Some scientists described the process as ""excruciating"", and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday.Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording. ""Different countries have different interests,"" IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx. ""Everyone wants to make sure that their concerns are addressed ... but scientists have the last word.""Upon the report's release, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans urged European policymakers to redouble efforts to end reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil.""The war in Ukraine has only increased our sense of urgency because now nobody can find an excuse, in my view, to not speed up the end of the overuse of fossil fuels,"" Timmermans told the European Parliament.""We cannot continue to import massive amounts of fossil fuels.""Cutting demandWhile past IPCC reports on mitigating carbon emissions tended to focus on the promise of sustainable fuel alternatives, such as solar and wind power, the new report uniquely highlights a need to cut consumer demand.Without shrinking energy demand, the report notes, reducing emissions rapidly by the end of this decade to keep warming below 1.5C will be almost impossible.""Accepting a lower consumption lifestyle is almost the only fast-acting policy move we have left to prevent the disastrous impacts of climate change,"" said Daniel Quiggin, an environmental researcher at the UK policy institute Chatham House.This ""demand-side mitigation"", as the report puts it, places the onus on governments to pass policies that incentivize sustainable choices. One example would be investing in bike lanes and public transport while blocking cars from city centres to sway public choice. Such action may slow economic growth by a few percentage points in the short term, the report said, but those losses would be outweighed by economic benefits from preventing extreme climate change.A decade ago, demand reduction was ""politically unpalatable,"" Quiggin said.""But now, with both the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis, we're seeing ... the beginning of political willingness.""When people truly appreciate the scale of a crisis and the problems it can create, they are willing to reduce consumption.""The report lays out several paths for greenhouse gas emissions that could limit climate change or, alternatively, see it spiral out of control.Grouping 1,600 potential path ways within eight broad categories, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes how different government policies and industrial activities would influence the rise in global temperatures up to 2100.Only two categories of pathways - dubbed ""C1"" and ""C2"" in the report - could keep the world to its 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to within 1.5C of preindustrial temperatures.C1 pathways would mostly hold temperatures at that threshold, whereas C2 pathways envision a temporary overshoot up to about 1.7C before dropping back down to about 1.4C by century's end, a situation that could still unleash irreversible impacts such as dead coral reefs.The world would need to invest big in renewable energy and make dramatic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in this decade, including a massive scale back in use of coal, oil and gas.But that alone wouldn't be enough. Some carbon dioxide (CO2) would also need to be removed from the atmosphere through increasing global forest cover as well as with nascent technologies such as direct air capture.\l"

Some in Glasgow think a rat would be an appropriate mascot for their city, which saw its rodent population grow alarmingly during the coronavirus lockdowns.Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken this week played down the scale of the problem, along with reports that council workers had been hospitalised after being bitten by rats.""There was I think one, possibly two, small incidents where an employee... where there was a health and safety incident and they were taken as a precaution to hospital for a very minor contact with a rat,"" she said. ""It's not something that is unique to Glasgow. It is something that is happening right across the UK. All cities have rats.""All these controversies will be forgotten if Johnson can persuade his fellow leaders to make binding commitments to take the steps necessary to reach the goals they agreed on in Paris in 2015. Chief among these was to limit global warming to between 1.5C and 2C by the middle of this century.Success depends on all countries reaching net-zero emissions - ensuring that the amount of greenhouse gases produced is no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere - as soon as possible. Each country has to produce its own national plan to reach the target and Johnson hopes that the ambition of Britain's strategy will give him the credibility to persuade others to take similar steps.Published last week, the 368-page plan is among the most ambitious and detailed of any major industrialised country, setting out how Britain will reach net-zero by 2050.""The UK is among the most ambitious countries in the world in terms of its net-zero by 2050 target. And it's a legally binding goal, which is not the case for the majority of countries with net-zero goals. There are some countries, such as Germany which has a 2045 target that is slightly more ambitious, and some smaller Nordics have got even earlier goals. But in terms of major economies, the UK's right up there,"" says Simon Evans, policy editor of Carbon Brief (carbonbrief.org), a British website covering climate science and policy.Serious ambition ""This net-zero strategy means the UK now has a quite serious set of ambitions, phasing out combustion cars by 2030, sales of new ones, an ambition to end the sale of gas boilers by 2035, and an ambition for the electricity system to be fully decarbonised also by 2035. ""Those are serious ambitions. We shouldn't pretend otherwise. As to whether there are credible policies to get us there, I think there are definitely gaps and some of the proposals aren't yet fully fleshed out.""Heat pumps work like a reverse air conditioner, absorbing heat from the air outside into a liquid refrigerant which is then compressed to increase the temperature and condensed to release heat for radiators and hot water tanks. They cost about \£310,000 each and the government will offer \£35,000 to households who switch from gas boilers.Britain has dramatically cut its dependence on fossil fuels for electricity in recent decades and the net-zero plan says that all electricity should come from low-carbon sources. Apart from investing in offshore wind, Britain will explore new nuclear power options.Planting more trees will help to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere but Britain is also banking on carbon capture and storage to offset emissions. This involves separating and capturing carbon dioxide from other gases before it enters the atmosphere and converting it into liquid to be transported and pumped deep underground for permanent storage.The net-zero strategy includes five-yearly targets and an independent Climate Change Commission monitors the government's progress. But Tom Sasse, associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, warns that delivering policies involving huge numbers of actors across different departments will be very difficult.""Essentially, you need a kind of powerful mechanism in government to bring together lots of different policies in different sectors and make sure they l"

Widely seen as a climate laggard, Australia is one of the world's largest coal and gas exporters and has long resisted adopting a carbon-neutral target.While Mr Morrison has inched toward setting a target date of 2050 for that goal, he has refused to make the target binding and has yet to commit to more meaningful 2030 emissions reduction targets.

It will increase woodland cover in the area from 17% to 20%.The motion tabled by the five Cork City councillors said setting such an ambitious target here would signal the city's commitment to climate action.However, in a written response to the motion tabled last year and before council last week, David Joyce, director of services in the council's roads and environment operations directorate, said a 1m tree planting target by 2028 would mean the planting of 125,000 trees every year from 2021 to 2028.""Planting 1m trees over a period of eight years has major resource implications in terms of land availability, cost of trees, preparation and planting and maintenance of the street trees and woodlands into the future,"" said Mr Joyce.""The preparation of a 'tree strategy' for the city is currently under way, and it is hoped to have a draft ready at the end of quarter one, 2022 for consideration by members.

Approximately 500,000 Bangladeshis are annually forced by rising sea levels and flooding to leave their homes in low-lying coastal areas to move inland into overcrowded cities. The impact of climate change is very real and immediate today.The climate crisis is a key driver of world hunger. Climate models project higher average temperatures in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes in the majority of inhabited regions, and heavy precipitation and ever-greater probability of drought in some areas.The implications of these projections are much greater in South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara - regions currently with high concentrations of poverty and hunger- where agriculture is highly dependent on rainfall and susceptible to even small changes in temperature.Large populations (up to 80% of rural households in some countries) depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.The 2021 Global Hunger Index, published earlier this month, shows that hunger levels are significantly higher in countries that are most sensitive to rainfall and temperature extremes characteristic of climate change.Unless urgent action is taken to help mitigate the impact of these changes and help communities adapt, the crisis will only get worse. A recent analysis showed that climate change could see the number of chronically hungry people increase by 78m by 2050 unless action is taken.There is an urgent need for proper investment in climate mitigation and climate adaptation measures and funding to address the losses and damages from climate impacts already being felt today. All eyes will be on global leaders at Cop26 to see if they deliver on the key issue of climate finance and then subsequently deliver on commitments made.Delivery will be key. In 2009, high-income countries made a commitment to allocate $ 100bn annually by 2020 to help developing countries address the impacts of climate change. However, this commitment has never been met.An analysis by the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance in 2020 found that, not only was there insufficient investment provided to enable lower-income countries prepare for the impacts of climate change, but funding that was provided was not going to the countries and people that need it most.The longer that adaptation and risk-reduction efforts are put off by chronic underfunding, the more difficult and expensive it will be to manage adaptation and the harder it will be to save lives and mitigate suffering.Inequality is at the heart of this issue. Many of the countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis are currently paying the highest price. They also do not have the financial resources to address the issue and protect their populations.Their needs and the issue of climate justice must be top of the priority list of global leaders.

This is no time for tinkering around the edges of the ParisAgreement, Mr Eastwood said. We need to get more than lip service from COP26, we need firm commitments from those with the power to enact change that they are ready to do what\' s necessary to protect our environment. People need to get their heads out of the sand \- the evidence of the worsening climate crisis is right before our eyes. We have seen temperatures rise and climate events across the world, including in our own backyard. Nowhere is exempt from the effects of the climate crisis. Meanwhile, Sinn F\'e9in deputy first minister Michelle O\' Neill attended the summit with party colleagues including North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan, who made the journey to Glasgow by bicycle in order to raise awareness of the need to reduce carbon emissions. Sinn F\'e9in will launch a document on green energy and tackling the climate emergency, Ms O\' Neill said. Just like the coronavirus pandemic, climate change does not recognise borders and we need an all-Ireland approach. We must secure a fair transition to a low carbon economy, and provide increased support for rural communities.

Launching the report before world leaders head to Glasgow for crucial Cop26 climate talks, UNEP's executive director Inger Andersen warned: ""The world has to wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species.""Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a now problem,"" she said.And UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said that less than a week before the talks, ""we are still on track for climate catastrophe"", warning there was a gap in leadership on tackling the crisis.It is the latest warning over the climate crisis, as emissions of the gases that drive global warming are set to bounce back after the pandemic, and reached record concentrations in the atmosphere in 2020.Countries at Cop26 are under pressure to deliver on promises made in the global Paris Agreement to hold global temperature rises to ""well below"" 2 degrees and to try to keep warming to 1.5 degrees, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.But the national plans countries previously put forward for the Paris deal left the world well off-track for the 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees limits, so they have had to submit new or updated plans for action up to 2030, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs,) by Cop26.It finds the impact of the new and updated plans will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by just 2.9 billion tonnes in 2030 compared to the old NDCs, while including pledges announced by China, Japan and South Korea will reduce emissions by four billion tonnes.Pollution Emissions need to be reduced by another 28 billion tonnes in 2030 to keep the world on a path to keeping temperature rises to 1.5 degrees - equivalent to nearly halving current levels of pollution of just under 60 billion tonnes a year - on top of cuts already planned, the report said.To limit temperature rises to 2 degrees, emissions must be cut by an additional 13 billion tonnes in 2030.The analysis also found that just under half of the new and updated plans submitted by countries will lead to lower 2030 emissions than their previous NDCs, while nearly a fifth (18 per cent) will lead to the same or higher levels of emissions.Tackling methane emissions using low-cost or money-saving technology, for example capturing methane released in fossil fuel extraction, could reduce emissions of the gas by around 20 per cent a year, helping curb warming in the near term. - PA\l"

On the other side of the river is the Green Zone, where the activists who have pushed climate change into the centre of the global debate have a parallel programme of events to keep up the pressure on the negotiators. But many delegates, activists and journalists were struggling to get to Glasgow yesterday as storms disrupted rail services from London, prompting some to travel by car or plane instead. Britain's president of Cop26, Alok Sharma, sounded downbeat yesterday morning ahead of the official opening, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr that it would be ""very, very tough"" to agree action to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees, before identifying the guilty parties in the event of failure.

This time the row is over licences for a few dozen French boats to fish off Jersey and Guernsey, which Britain has been refusing to grant on the grounds of insufficient evidence of a history of fishing in those waters. Downing Street's threats might be more credible were it not for the fact that the only action more disruptive to the British economy than France hitting British exports would be Britain hitting European imports.

But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. ""Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality.

Miche\'e1l Martin was back for Leaders' Questions after his big trip to Scotland, where he hobnobbed with world leaders and global billionaires. After one of the Cop26 sessions Joe Biden, no less, came looking for a chinwag.""He called me over,"" confided Miche\'e1l yesterday and ""reiterated to me in the strongest possible terms how the Good Friday agreement matters very deeply"" to him and his administration and how ""he had made this unequivocally clear to the British government"".The US president and Miche\'e1l met on the margins on Monday. Then Joe fell asleep in the conference hall. Having rubbed shoulders with political and business giants at the start of the week the Taoiseach suffered the indignity of a return to Dublin to face the usual wretched cast of thankless minnows in the D\'e1il. No wonder he was a bit tetchy. He nearly bit the head off socialist Mick Barry, who interrupted his dissertation on the nature of emissions. ""And methane emanates, as we know, from a range of human activities, including oil and gas extraction, which we have taken steps in this House to limit . . .""""Bizarre,"" harrumphed Mick. ""Deputy Barry, it's not your turn,"" snapped the Taoiseach, mid-sentence. Mick shut up sharpish, because it's not like Miche\'e1l to be so venomous. Eyebrows raised all round.R\'f3is\'edn Shortall, co-leader of the Social Democrats, got under his skin too. She niggled away at the ""ambitious"" commitments made at the UN climate conference and wondered if his Government's action on climate change would match his ""climate rhetoric"". ""Will the kudos you got be short-lived, Taoiseach?""""Why are you making agreements at Cop that you cop out of as soon as the ink is dry on an agreement?"" she wondered. Miche\'e1l was disappointed in her and all the others who criticised his noble intentions. ""I just have to say that you suffer, at times, from an abundance of negativity,"" he sniffily informed R\'f3is\'edn.

Targets will be set and will have to be met because ""we don't have time, as a race, to hang around any longer without dealing with climate change"".

The changes will be ""significant"" and will be unveiled in today's long-awaited Climate Action Plan.Deputy Shortall, unmoved by Miche\'e1l's stirring version of The Commitments, harried him for specific examples of how these targets will be reached. She also demanded a straight answer on the vexed question of reducing cattle numbers. Presumably the answers will come with the new plan, because they didn't come from the Taoiseach.

Absolutely"" he cried. ""And I would prefer if you were a bit more engaging and more of an advocate for change as opposed to nitpicking all the time.""Earlier, he took a swipe at Sinn F\'e9in's whatever-way-the-wind-blows attitude to a carbon tax. ""It's about time you got off the fence,"" he told party leader Mary Lou McDonald. ""You're having an each-way bet, every week, every month in this House for the last number of years on the issue."" Meanwhile, Mick Barry got his chance to speak on behalf of People Before Profit/Solidarity. He rose to his feet, still smarting from that earlier slap-down. ""So. It is my turn now, Taoiseach.""The glory in Glasgow didn't inspire him and he said it certainly doesn't impress young people. Mick wouldn't have much time for the bigwigs at Cop26. A shower of Bs in his eyes: Biden, Boris and Bezos. No, he certainly doesn't have any time for Joe Biden. And as for Boris Johnson, he may have opened the conference dressed in green but the young people know ""this is a man who slashed tax on domestic flights and supports subsidies for the fossil fuel industry"".They have seen Jeff Bezos, ""the rocket man"", pledge $2 billion to protect the environment while Amazon emitted more CO2 this year than the annual emissions of two-thirds of the countries in the world. And he is typical member of a global corporate elite pulling the strings of capitalist politicians at the climate summit. ""Why on earth should the young generation place one iota of faith in these politicians to solve the crisis?""Mick is off to join them. ""Tonight, I will pack my waterproofs, set my alarm and get ready to travel to Glasgow in the morning,"" he announced. ""Myself and a busload of young Socialist Party colleagues will join the International Socialist Alternative contingent, which will be part of the 100,000-strong protests on the streets of Glasgow this weekend."" Old Doc Martens You couldn't begrudge him. He'll be happy out, digging out his old Doc Martens and reliving his young student firebrand days when he sold the Socialist Worker on the streets of Dublin. Had nobody a good word to say to the Taoiseach after his efforts on his country's behalf at Cop26?""Taoiseach, I have to take the opportunity to thank you and to congratulate you on your performance and your contribution to Cop26 in Glasgow. While it's been met with a lot of cynicism from Opposition, I firmly believe that it was, by far, the best contribution by any Irish leader at any Conference of the Parties held to date.""Fair play. Miche\'e1l must have been feeling a little bruised. He hadn't even been hanging out with the billionaires. ""In fact, I met with a farmer. I didn't meet the Jeff Bezoses of this world at all.

In the meantime, Irish farmers are very worried about agriculture and do not have any great guidance about their future, in an industry employing more than a quarter-of-a-million people on-farm alone, as well as producing the best quality food in the world.A few approximate statistics on climate change may be useful.Ireland produces about 0.1pc of world greenhouse gases. That's one thousandth of the world production. Agricultural activities are responsible for just over one-third of this, with the remaining two-thirds attributed to industry, fossil fuel burning, transportation and other causes.China produces about 30pc of the world's greenhouse gases, the United States about 15pc, followed by India, Russia and Japan.If Ireland ceased agricultural activities next year, the effect on world climate change would be almost negligible.While improved farm management to play our part in the control of harmful emissions would be welcome, it should not unduly interrupt our agricultural sector or cause undue stress on farm families and should be in proportion to the climate change that can be achieved.Peter Tiernan Strandhill, Sligo\l"

This will include reductions in nitrous oxide emissions which like methane emanate from the agriculture sector.The climate action plan, which will detail the measures to be taken in various sectors to reduce emissions for the rest of the decade, is likely to be signed off at a Cabinet committee meeting today and approved by the full Cabinet tomorrow. Sources say that an agreement on agriculture emission reductions - politically the most sensitive part of the plan - has largely been reached between Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan.It is expected that the reduction in agriculture emissions will be in the range of 22-30 per cent down from 2018 levels. In total, this means a reduction from 23 MtCO2eq (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) to 16-18 MtCO2eq. It is expected that half of emission reductions will be achieved through carbon capture and storage.The emissions reduction from land use changes and afforestation will be not be linked to the agriculture targets but is expected to be of the order of 2.4 MtCO2eq. Some of this, however, will be ""borrowed from future savings"", it is understood.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland457","Acting on climate change now is cheaper than doing nothing; UN report paints a grim picture, but disaster can still be averted","March 9, 2022 Wednesday","Belfast Telegraph","THE latest IPCC report makes for heavy reading. The report was released last week, but with public attention understandably focused on the acute geopolitical crisis in Ukraine, this IPCC report received less media attention than normal.Given the highly technical nature of IPCC reports, they often do not reach mainstream audiences. This is a huge problem because these reports reveal important information about the climate and nature crises. It is therefore vital that the findings contained in the IPCC reports are communicated to the public in digestible and readable ways.To begin, it is important to understand what 'IPCC' refers to. IPCC stands for 'Intergovernmental panel on climate change', and this panel was first established by the United Nations in 1988.The panel is composed of a group of climate scientists who assess published research on the state of climate breakdown, subsequently outlining actions we should take.Before Cop26 One could therefore consider this report as a projection. A projection of what would the world look like if we continued to operate in 'code red', as UN Secretary General formerly put it.It was worth noting the tremendous effort and expertise underpinning this report. 270 scientists reviewed over 34,000 research publications, assessing 127 risks that we currently face. The following question therefore arises: what did they find?In accordance with previous IPCC reports, we are once again reminded that if humanity breaches 1.5 degrees of warming, we will no longer be able to adapt to harmful impacts of climate change. This is very frightening.Africa is responsible for just 3% global greenhouse gas emissions, but feels severe climate impacts, including droughts, storms and floods which impact food security and urban development.However, in contrast to previous reports, this report highlights how climate impacts have become increasingly widespread.Scientists cite that 3.3 to 3.6 billion people currently live in contexts highly vulnerable to climate change.Indeed, the unpredictable weather patterns and storms that we have recently witnessed reveal how the UK is already experiencing what other countries have experienced for years. Clearly, climate change affects all of us.Adaptation certainly seems like a more attractive alternative to death, but what does it really mean to £dapt' to climate change?Adaptation means changing our lifestyles and infrastructure to cope with the changing climate. It refers to how we produce our food, how we build our cities, and crucially, how we invest our money. In contrast to previous reports, this IPCC report makes much stronger reference to the economic case for investing in adaptation. The report highlights how investing in climate resilience and development makes sense for the economy, as well as our health and that of the planet.The message is clear: the economic impact of inaction far outweighs the economic implications of action. The cost of inaction is expensive. The cost of keeping to 1.5 degrees of warming will be far lower than the cost of loss and damage.With a return of investment ratio of 4:1, Patrick Verkooijen explains how investing in climate adaptation is not charity. It is what he calls 'smart economics'. There are therefore compelling market reasons to address the climate crisis. The strong economic argument which shone through in this report may be considered a narrow approach to some. However, in many ways, this argument may represent the next step in the adaptation agenda. Every 10% of carbon increase makes adaptation more difficult, and is therefore vital that we act at scale and with speed. The economic support of multinationals, finance ministers and corporations will help accelerate this.However, we would be entirely misguided to believe that the climate as we know it today will be the climate that we know tomorrow. Indeed, the report refuses to let us ignore the terrifying question: how far can we adapt to the climate emergency?Depending on levels of temperature increase, by 2040 we will still face many of the 127 risks outl"

For the unfamiliar, events around the climate change conference in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12 can seem like an alphabet soup of acronyms and jargon.COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and the ""parties"" bit refers to the countries that are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Some 150 countries signed the framework at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. There are now 197 signatories.The UNFCC set up a decision-making system involving a climate conference - a COP - every year. These take place in November or December, and are preceded by a flurry of diplomatic activity by the UN and by the host country to sound out members as to what is achievable.Much depends on the drive and ambition of the president of the COP, who is appointed by the host country. In the case of Glasgow, the president is Alok Sharma, a rather anonymous British MP and formerly business secretary in Boris Johnson's cabinet.Sharma deliberately cultivates a boring image, but was drawn into controversy for flying to more than 30 countries in recent months without observing Covid regulations. Environmental campaigners were also dismayed when he continued with his day job in addition to his COP duties. Eventually, he moved full-time into the climate role.Another key figure is the UN's climate chief (officially called executive secretary of the UNFCCC), who also chivvies and chases countries to increase the ambition of their climate policies in advance of the COP. The post is currently held by Mexican diplomat Patricia Espinosa.These two - the COP president and UN climate boss - need to work well together. Observers read much into their appointment: getting a heavy-hitter as COP president is seen as a sign of commitment by the host. Johnson's choice of Sharma did not inspire confidence initially, but his quiet application may produce results.Once the conference starts, things soon get interesting. Countries form alliances and pool their influence. The list of coalitions can seem bewildering, but the tension usually centres on countries pushing for more radicalJohnson's the British president (and necessary) climate action versus those in favour of a more incremental approach.The African Group (54 countries) will push for more finance for developing countries, while the Umbrella Group, which includes some heavily fossil-fuel dependent countries such as the Russian Federation, Australia, Norway and Ukraine, are often seen as more conservative. This group also includes the US, which has become more ambitious on climate under president Joe Biden.Some of the most impactful contributions to the debates come from the Small Island Developing States (Sids), a grouping of 40 low-lying islands, mostly in the Pacific, whose existence is threatened by climate change. It was the intervention by this group that led to the strengthening of the language of the agreement reached at the Paris COP in 2015.The BASIC grouping (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) is also influential, and much diplomatic effort is expended in getting them to move towards more meaningful action.Ireland negotiates as part of the EU group, and is a signatory of the three main international climate agreements, the original UNFCCC (1992), the Kyoto Protocol (1997), and the Paris Agreement (2015).HEAVY LIFTING Under the terms of the agreement reached in Paris in 2015, countries must submit their emissions reduction commitments in advance - these are called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - and are expected to ratchet up over time.In advance of the Glasgow conference, countries will be under pressure to increase the ambition of these NDCs. Some will already be at the level necessary to keep global warming below 2C and to aim for 1.5C, while others will be some way off.The heavy lifting at the COP involves drafting and redrafting the text of a potential agreement. Some items get dropped from the text because agreement cannot be reached. For example, the regulation of emissions from planes and ships was omitted from the Paris Agreement. Some COPs end in relative failure, producing a very weak and place-holding text at the end, as happened in Copenhagen in 2009.But this year, when the impacts of climate change have been so evident, and with the words of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report ringing in their ears, delegates are expected to agree on a document that will be equal to the moment.Alok Sharma, appointed of the COP\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland466","What happens at the poles affects all life","Irish Examiner"," ","AT nearly 14m sq km in area, Antarctica is a gigantic land mass, around one and a half times the size of the continental US. The ice shelves perched on top of this vast southern continent contain an almost unimaginable 26m cu km of frozen water. A single cubic kilometre of ice weights 1bn tonnes.This frozen giant has lain dormant for at least the last 15m years. Now, there are worrying signs that it is beginning to stir from its deep slumber.In recent days, scientists have reported that temperatures in parts of eastern Antarctica have risen by 40C above normal for three consecutive days. The Vostok research station, located close to the south pole at an elevation of nearly 3,500 metres, is the coldest place on the planet, having recorded a temperature of -89.2C in 1983.However, in recent days, Vostok experienced an almost balmy -17.7C, an astonishing 15C warmer than ever recorded at that location. Computer simulations and observations across Antarctica indicate that in some locations, temperatures may have risen by up to 50C above normal.To visualise how dramatic a shift this is, consider that in Ireland, the average March temperature range is from 5.2C to 10.7C. Now, try to imagine a March heatwave in Ireland with temperatures above 50C.""I have never seen anything like this in Antarctica,"" said Ted Scrampos, ice scientist at the University of Colorado, who has recently returned from a research expedition to the region.Isolated from the world's continental landmasses by oceans and in continuous darkness for its four- to five-month winter, Antarctica to a large extent generates its own weather systems.Except for its vulnerable western Antarctic peninsula, which has shown worrying signs of ice shelf collapse, the main continental shelf hasn't been considered to be at significant risk of warming. In fact, it has been warming more slowly than the world as a whole.Polar scientists believe the recent heatwave event is linked to a giant atmospheric 'river' that has drawn in masses of warm, wet air from the Pacific ocean.""The moist air has trapped heat over the continent, resulting in the warm surface temperatures... this is an extraordinary event,"" said Australian climatologist Julie Arblaster.Reliable long-term temperature records in the Antarctic only go back as far as the late 1950s, making it difficult to assess just how unusual the current heatwave really is. Weather systems on the frozen continent are notoriously fickle; in 2021, the south pole recorded its coldest ever April-September, yet last month, the level of sea ice surrounding Antarctica fell to its lowest on record.While attributing a specific meteorological event to climate change is especially challenging in Antarctica, the warming global climate is ""loading the dice"" to make extreme instances like this ever more likely, according to Jonathan Wille, a French polar meteorology researcher. Temperatures like this, he added, ""are never supposed to happen"".As scientists pinch themselves in disbelief at the extreme and unprecedented heatwave racking Antarctica, at the other end of the world, weather stations in Greenland and Norway recorded temperature spikes in the Arctic region 27C higher than normal for this time of year.Overall, the Arctic is heating three times faster than the global average, with temperatures in the region having increased by a full 1C in just the last decade. This in turn is leading to a sharp rise in extreme events. Temperatures deep in the Russian Arctic hit 38C during the summer 2020 heatwave.Unlike the Antarctic, almost all the Arctic ice cap is floating on open ocean, but sea ice has been thinning precipitously as temperatures in the region increase.A phenomenon known as the 'ice albedo effect' explains why Arctic temperatures are rising so quickly. An intact ice sheet reflects almost all incoming sunlight back into space. However, as soon as it begins to thin and expose the ocean beneath, up to 90% of incoming solar energy is absorbed by the dark waters, causing ocean temperature to begin to rise. As this happens, more ice melts, and so the cycle of warming accelerates.A so-called 'blue ocean event' is where the Arctic ocean is virtually ice-free during the summer, something that has not occurred in at least 2.5m years. Scientists now believe this could happen within the next 10-12 years, with profound consequences for the climatic system in the entire northern hemisphere.The loss of polar ice cover across the entire Arctic region would be the equivalent of suddenly shutting down a gigantic air conditioning system that helps regulate both temperatures and weather patterns across the northern hemisphere, with profound consequences that scientists are only beginning to fully grasp.Former Nasa chief scientist James Hansen and his colleagues have researched the likely effects of ice melt on ocean currents and weather systems. The giant Greenland ice shelf is losing an average of 1m tonnes of ice per minute. In 2019, this amounted to 600bn tonnes of ice melt.This massive influx of cold fresh water into the north Atlantic could trigger the shut-down of the Gulf Stream, the warm current that transfers huge amounts of heat energy from the tropics and keeps north-western Europe several degrees warmer than its latitude would suggest.Such an event would have catastrophic consequences for Ireland, causing our temperatures to plummet and our grass-based agricultural system to fail.In addition, a sudden increase in the temperature gradient between the tropics and the northern hemisphere would, according to Prof Hansen, ""fuel super-storms stronger than any seen in modern times"".""All hell would break loose in the north Atlantic,"" he added.The profound energy imbalance that is causing these seismic events at both poles is driven by the annual emission of around 40bn tonnes of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the global atmosphere, mainly as a result of fossil fuel burning.To understand just how dramatic these changes are, scientists estimate that the world's oceans are heating at the rate equivalent to the energy released by five Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs per second, or nearly 160m Hiroshimas a year.A small reminder of just how rapidly the Arctic system is changing occurred in November 2020, when a time capsule was washed up on the coastl"

With most national leaders having left Glasgow after pledging to reduce methane emissions and halt deforestation, yesterday's talks were dominated by climate finance issues.The most significant announcement was $130 trillion in funding over three decades through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero (GFANZ).Banks and asset managers representing 40 per cent of the world's financial assets, involving 450 firms across 45 countries, pledged to meet the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement, said UN special envoy on climate Mark Carney, who is co-chairing the initiative with US businessman Michael Bloomberg. ""Ramping up adoption of clean energy and other sustainable infrastructure fast enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change will require trillions of dollars in new investment - likely in the ballpark of $100 trillion,"" the GFANZ co-chairs said.

That is a judgment not of me, or President Biden or of anybody in politics. It's the judgment of the best science and mathematics.""That's what this is about, not ideology, not politics, it's about mathematics and physics,"" he said, adding scientists had warned of the ""devastating consequences"" if global temperatures rise more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.The world was already at around 1.2C of warming, and ""we're no longer talking about impacts in the future, we no longer need scientists to tell us what will happen because we're seeing it happen now already"", he said, pointing to heat waves, superstorms and floods this year.He said the world faced destruction of crops at coral reefs, the melting of glaciers that provide water for millions, migration destabilised regions, and collapsing economies beyond 1.5C of warming.

Under the latest push, major banks including NatWest have committed to ending finance for coal, in a move coming after commitments from China, Japan and South Korea and the G20 to end overseas finance for coal generation.

But a further rise in emissions in 2022 to new highs cannot be ruled out if road transport and aviation return to pre-pandemic levels and coal use does not drop back again after the ""over-correction"" of pandemic stimulus, they said.\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland470","Ireland can come out on the right side of history by leading the way on climate issues","November 11, 2021 Thursday","Irish Independent","WHILE COP26 undoubtedly plays a vital role in bringing world leaders together, and hopefully pushing global climate ambition closer to agreeing that 1.5-degree ceiling that scientists tell us is our best bet at a safe future, the lessons of past COPs must also be heeded.For each of the previous 25 years of pledges, the world is still hurtling towards a catastrophic future. Decades of inaction now mean that this generation must deliver the most ambitious reductions in emissions, in the shortest timeframe, that we have ever attempted.While this burden will weigh heavy on our shoulders, it is a privilege to have the certainty of the science and the power to do something about it.In Ireland, our plan for climate action is becoming clearer. We are now committed to a 51pc reduction pathway to 2030. The Climate Action Plan provides more sectoral detail, and we have carbon budgets that provide us with annual targets.Unlike typical budgets, we cannot overdraw on carbon budgets and pay them back. Carbon budgets reflect planetary limit thresholds. Once we exceed those thresholds, we take the risk of pushing our planet beyond climate tipping points we cannot come back from. That is a risk our children will not thank us for taking.While a more positive landscape for change is emerging, and undoubtedly has been hard-won, it is not going to be enough. If we are going to bridge the gap from intention to implementation, we must learn from the past and get ahead of the barriers.Everything from siloed decision-making, unaligned initiatives, short-term thinking, unintended consequences, and lack of accountability must be addressed. Most difficult may be breaking our dependence on the excuses of old and being bound by business-as-usual concepts that have no place in this transition. Nothing about this transition will be usual.While not having the same gloss as the big announcements, now is the time to lean into the seemingly mundane, but necessary, details. The governance, the methodologies, the sanctions, the rulebooks will all need to be forthcoming. Less of the waffle, more of the specifics.But to get there, we very quickly need to move the conversation on from emphasising the costs and challenges of climate action. Delaying climate action is not a neutral decision and there is a growing cost to pay for each day we hesitate to act.Any debate that looks to delay action, or minimise a sector's contribution, needs now to be countered with an analysis of the costs of not taking action. And there are many.While the costs of the physical impacts of climate change may be more obvious, there are also the costs of not responding to shifting market demands, the risks of being exposed to growing climate litigation, our lack of preparedness for supply chain disruption, our inability to attract talent and finance, and the negative impacts to our reputation.That's before we even address the moral argument that it is our responsibility, as a wealthy nation, to do all we can to lessen any further impacts on those least responsible for climate change but who are paying the highest price.We're also going to need to stop the whataboutery. What about China?What about Brazil? These arguments neglect to account for our own contribution to emissions, fail to understand that any delay to engage in climate action and become more resilient will be to our own detriment, and neglect to take account of the wider global shifts that are occurring.While COP26There is likely to be a growing anger as we begin to understand the scale of what we are going to be asked to do. We will need more honesty and humility from our leaders. An emissions reduction of 51pc by 2030 is not just ""a little bit greener"". It is a complete transformation.While our leaders will rightly play a vital role in creating the policies and landscape for ambitious change, it will be up to all of us to make this happen. Are we going to stand up and support ambitious climate action, and are we going to challenge any call for slower or lesser action?It is yet to be seen where Ireland will fall in terms of the climate ambition scale. We may continue to try and give the perception that action is being taken without the numbers adding up. Or we could go big and see a dogged commitment to climate action.We have never let our size restrict ambition when it comes to our global influence, our trade goals, or our reputation. To go small on climate would assign us to the wrong side of history, and we will get left behind.Graphic Solutions: Campaigners in George Square, Glasgow, yesterday, during the COP26 summit.

Women\' s liberation can free us all.In Ireland, Britain, the US, across Europe and the wider world, the trades union movement is stirring again. Rank and file groups are pushing union leaderships into action.The docks strike in Derry, the actions throughout the public sector, the Debenhams stoppage and many more examples show that workers are full of fight when their power is let loose.The brilliant campaigns in the US for union rights at Starbucks, Amazon and beyond show the way forward.Pressure for change from below is as strong as ever.The possibility of a New Ireland has been widely discussed in 2021. But only a strong socialist presence can ensure that it\' s the content of society which must be transformed, not just the constitutional arrangements.It\' s easy in the face of the multitude of problems that assail us to conclude that the world is going to hell in a handcart and there\' s nothing much we can do about it.That\' s wrong.

There is this idea that you need to be an expert to be involved in the movement.""Seeing the crisis as a human rights issue, Rosalind's interest was sparked in learning about the harmful nature of fast fashion on garment workers and their rights.""Then looking at a lot of environmental degradation and damage and how that was affecting people and continues to affect people every day and people living in poverty, it's a social justice issue,"" she explains.It can be difficult for those living here to adequately understand the climate crisis considering many impacts are almost imperceptible.""When it comes to language, I think it's to do with speaking to people in a language they understand, but also understanding how you can deliver value for them. So Tearfund [NGO Rosalind volunteers for], for example, is a Christian organisation, and if I were to go into a church or faith community and talk about the climate crisis and why churches should begin to address it more, we're talking to them in terms of language like creation care, stewardship, we're not talking necessarily of climate change science.""If you go into a business corporate context, we talk about it in terms of economic opportunity and great growth. The overall collective goal is the same: you're wanting to engage that group of people or that organisation in the climate crisis. But you're angling it in a way that resonates with them. That's what people need to do more - understand their audience.""Having worked on a mural to unite communities into backing significant climate change legislation, Rosalind sees the benefit of engaging creative and cultural sectors.She will be speaking in""It's just so important for people from different cultures and communities to be together. Also, even from a language perspective, so much of this is in English and I know there's a new movement of people talking about how it's really inaccessible to people who don't speak English as their first language. That's also something we don't always bear in mind either."" Dakota Reid Follow on twitter @ThisisDakota The Environmental Management postgraduate at Queen's has always been interested in nature and became more involved in activism at the beginning of the pandemic.Given the swift reaction that countries had to Covid, she is optimistic change in terms of the climate crisis can occur.""Yes, it does make me feel optimistic that I can see how we can really change and treat something like a crisis when we want to,"" says the 22-year-old.""Obviously we don't want to have to be dealing with either a global health emergency, nor climate emergency, nor nature emergency.""But at the end of the day, I think it is possible to react to these things quickly and ultimately we are investing in the measures we need to be taking now and we save ourselves a lot of economic and social environmental damage in the long-term.""I think it does give me hope that we can act urgently and we can act radically, but obviously we're yet to see governments really adopt that thinking and urgency to the environmental crises.""Like Rosalind, Dakota is keen to use language that conveys the situation's urgency and also that we understand the words we're using.""A lot of the words and phrases in the media, there's a broad understanding. The phrase 'greenwashing' is something I've heard people use and people look blankly. It's not a word that people necessarily understand yet it's a really important word to convey the challenges we're facing right now.""It is important that people are aware of some of the jargon around these things. It's also important that the language reflects the urgency. Instead of talking about climate change, which sounds quite incremental or not necessarily that concerning, going for things like climate crisis or climate emergency.""Compassion for others, she says, is important and goes a long way.""I think it's as important to act for the other people as opposed to the people in Northern Ireland.""I think it is important that we lower our emissions for the people in Bangladesh, people in Fiji and other places that are being affected now. But we will be affected.""We see the projected levels of sea level rise. It's going to affect a lot of people in Belfast. It's going to affect the city centre. It's going to affect a lot of low income communities in north and east Belfast.Ciara Henry Follow on twitter @CiaraHenry_1995 The Green Party representative for Bangor East/Donaghadee has had a lifelong love for animals which gradually saw her move into conservation projects and issues of species loss and biodiversity.""Slowly but surely that branched off into greater interest in green economy and green politics and environmentalism as a whole, and transition politics,"" says the 26-year-old.She has been involved with the Greens since she was 18 and studying for a B.Tech in Animal Management.""It wasn't a mainstream ideology, but with such heavy coverage of things like Cop26, the IPCC report, I definitely think people are more aware, and not just people, specifically young people,"" she says when we chat about how the issues put forward by her party since its inception are gaining traction.Again, like many interviewees, she sees the benefit of collective campaign, but says: ""You don't need campaign groups and you don't need young people on the street shouting and screaming if the things that are happening are working.""Ciara worked with Ulster Wildlife's Our Bright Future programme, a focus of which was outdoor education in secondary schools.""There's such a heavy push obviously in the early years to get kids outside, especially in nurseries and creches, and even at the start of primary school, but it seems to be once you get to key stage three and onwards, and certainly into secondary school, that completely falls by the wayside,"" she says.""How can you expect people to love, respect and want to learn about nature if you don't get them outside and get them involved in it?""Teaching climate education in schools is also important, she says.""With a much heavier push on green education, green politics and politics as a whole,"" she explains.""Bringing the A-level Politics class up to Stormont to tell them how the political system works is great, but they're the students who already know how to do it. We want to be telling kids in Citizenship in third year how to contact a councillor, what a councillor does, what a MLA does, what's the difference in those jobs.""Ciara also stresses the importance of getting more women in political roles and getting more men involved in campaign work, given that environmental campaigning is often viewed as women's work.

The text reiterated the aim of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement in that it ""reaffirms the long-term global goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C"".It increased the ambition of previous agreements by stressing the need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 45pc by 2030 relative to 2010, and to net zero by ""around mid-century"".But despite the new emphasis at the talks over the last week and a half on urgently reducing methane emissions, the text only ""invites"" countries to ""consider further opportunities to reduce non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions"".Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan, who is leading the Irish delegation at the talks in Glasgow, said there was some strong language in the text but added: ""It's not enough and we need to go further and do more.Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, who attended the talks yesterday, said there was disappointment among EU countries that no formal mechanism was included in the text to provide for a 'loss and damage' fund to ensure ready access to emergency funds for countries suffering climate-related disasters.Countries met separately and in group sessions from early yesterday morning to assess the text and deliver responses. By late afternoon, it was clear there was opposition to parts of it.British Prime Minister Boris""There is a huge amount to do,"" he said.He warned failure to secure an ambitious agreement would cause public anger.""The backlash will be immense and it will be long-lasting and we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium,"" he said.The talks were boosted last night by a joint statement between the US and China announcing their joint commitment to enhanced action on emissions.COP26 president Alok Sharma said his team would revise the draft text overnight and call all countries together this morning.

"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland478","WHAT CAN THE COP26 SUMMIT ACHIEVE?; What should be on the table? Is this the last chance to get it right?","May 15, 2021 Saturday","The Irish Times","Climate change experts and campaigners, including participants in the Dublin Climate Dialogues, were asked what their COP26 expectations are, and whether they are optimistic about the summit's ability to meet the climate threat.Lorna Gold Climate justice campaigner As COP26 is taking place in my home city, I have a particular interest in seeing it succeed. All COPs are billed as ""the most important yet"", but this one in my eyes is hugely significant because unlike the last few, it offers real hope. Trump is gone, and whilst Biden faces an uphill struggle on climate, there is no shortage of goodwill and ambition. The pandemic, moreover, is teaching humanity some sobering lessons regarding the consequences of science, as well as the need to work collectively to tackle threats to human survival. This COP has to seal the rule book on how the Paris Agreement will be delivered and address the thorny issue of ""loss and damage"" - historic claims on climate harms inflicted by wealthy nations. The single most important issue, however, I believe is money. Wealthy countries have utterly failed to deliver on their promise of $100 billion per year to support poorer countries, which are already feeling the brunt of climate breakdown. New finance mechanisms to tackle climate change are emerging but these are largely through private sector initiatives. Can real progress be made? The pandemic has blown a massive hole in public finances globally and it is hard to see how new public resources to support global climate action will emerge. This could yet derail the whole process.P\'e1draic Fogarty Irish Wildlife Trust ecologist & biodiversity champion Loss of biodiversity must be a central concern at , all those ""net zero"" targets implicitly need some means to take carbon dioxide from the air. Why pin our hopes on a technological breakthrough when nature has been sequestering carbon for aeons? While land use and forests are already accounted for in national greenhouse gas emissions inventories there is no accounting for the enormous role played by our oceans. Bottom trawling was recently shown to release as much carbon dioxide as the aviation industry while it's also a highly destructive way to catch fish. Bringing it to an end while establishing marine protected areas will help store and draw down carbon while reviving marine life. Globally, forests need to be better protected (and restored) but there is no differentiating between natural, biodiversity-rich forests and monoculture plantations which are not as effective in storing carbon. In Ireland, our peatlands could be climate heroes but only emissions from ""managed"" peatlands are counted, so emissions from fires and overgrazing by sheep get a pass. This must change. Rewilding our land and oceans, while regenerating agricultural soils, are among the cheapest, easiest and most effective forms of climate action. I hope COP26 will recognise this. Can real progress be made? We are fortunate in that we know what needs to be done and we have the tools to do it . . . I feel there is progress but the pace is way too slow. Saoi O'Connor Climate activist & FridaysForFuture leader Many governments bemoaned the loss of COP last year, but have not taken any steps towards real climate action during the 25 previous COPs. Many governments have appropriated the radical language of peoples' movements for climate justice in saying the COP is urgently needed because ""we need action now"". This is not untrue, but the lack of action from leaders in the Global North is not down to a lack of conferences, it is due to a lack of willingness to act. No amount of COPs will change this, because the people who hold the power in those negotiations do not want it to change. In addition, due to vaccine inequity and the Covid-19 pandemic, this COP will most likely be excluding those people who need to be heard most around these tables - civil society, and those from the peoples and areas most impacted by climate change. Can real progress be made? It won't come from those sitting around the decision-making table. The potential for climate solutions and for dismantling the systems that created this crisis comes from the people; it always has.Prof John Sweeney Maynooth University climate scientist & COP veteran The choreography leading up to COP26 has been remarkably similar to that which preceded the ill-fated COP15 Copenhagen event in 2009. Once again we see efforts to reach a pre-meeting agreement by the world's two largest polluters: China and the US. Once again the EU has increased its emissions reduction target, now at least 55 per cent by 2030. But will the Glasgow COP overcome the five-year logjam that has occurred since the 2015 Paris Agreement? Agreeing the rules for carbon trading, and transparency in reporting, remain the main stumbling blocks. Countries such as Brazil, Australia and China were identified at the last COP as actively blocking agreement. Tied to this will be the running sore of whether rich countries will implement their commitment to supplying the finance necessary to assist transition in developing countries, and easing debt repayments to aid their post-Covid green recovery. Can real progress be made? Experience suggests we should temper our expectations of success. Negotiators' briefs prioritise national self-interest over global community good. The best we can hope for is further incremental progress, but not enough to turn around the climate and biodiversity emergency.

We need our government to actually act on climate change and the climate crisis, not just keep talking and not just keep making plans.``It's really important for us to use our voices and march on these streets so we're heard.''Among those to address a rally at Belfast City Hall was acclaimed teenage author and naturalist from Co Fermanagh Dara McAnulty.``We are at a junction as a species and there are two paths in front of us,'' he told the crowds.``One - we change our future, we make a difference, we go on the road to restorative justice and climate action.``Or we can go down the path of further destruction and inevitably the demise of our species.''The events on the island were part of a global day of action aimed at increasing pressure on world leaders attending the Cop26 conference on climate change in Glasgow.Catherine O'Rourke from Liverpool was in Dublin to visit her daughter. She said she felt compelled to come down and join in the protest.``I am very concerned about the future for my grandchildren and my great grandchildren and we've got to make a difference,'' she said.``We can't just hope for it, we've got to do it. We've got to make our governments wake up before it's too late. It's already nearly too late. I had to come - I'd no choice.''Susan Rossney from Dublin credited the Irish government with making ``good progress'' on climate action.But she added: ``It still bears repeating every day and in every possible format that everyone has to take action on the climate crisis.``It's for us now, it's for the entire world and it's so unjust that so much pollution is being created by the developed world and the developing world is bearing the brunt of this.''Daithi McKay, the vice chair of the NI Climate Coalition, helped organise the event in Belfast.``We've heard a lot of promises, we've heard a lot of pledges,'' he said of Cop26.``But we need much more than that - we need immediate action.''Chloe Ferguson, the chair of Queen's University Students' Union Climate Action Group, said street protests could have a ``massive impact''.``When we look at what politicians and what our leaders respond to, they listen to what's going to cause them the most bother publicly,'' she said. end\l"
"COP26","Ireland","COP26_Ireland481","Fossil fuels subsidised at EUR 9.5m a minute   IMF","October 7, 2021 Thursday","The Irish Times","The fossil fuel industry benefits from subsidies of $11 million (EUR 9.5 million) every minute, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The IMF found the production and burning of coal, oil and gas was subsidised by $5.9 trillion in 2020, with not a single country pricing all its fuels sufficiently to reflect their full supply and environmental costs. Experts said the subsidies were ""adding fuel to the fire"" of the climate crisis, at a time when rapid reductions in carbon emissions were urgently needed.Explicit subsidies that cut fuel prices accounted for 8 per cent of the total and tax breaks another 6 per cent. The biggest factors were failing to make polluters pay for the deaths and poor health caused by air pollution (42 per cent) and for the heatwaves and other impacts of global heating (29 per cent).Setting fossil fuel prices that reflect their true cost would cut global CO2 emissions by over a third, the IMF analysts said. This would be a big step towards meeting the internationally agreed 1.5 degree target. Keeping this target within reach is a key goal of the UN Cop26 climate summit in November.Pricing of pollution Agreeing rules for carbon markets, which enable the proper pricing of pollution, is another Cop26 goal. ""Fossil fuel price reform could not be timelier,"" the IMF researchers said. The ending of fossil fuel subsidies would also prevent nearly a million deaths a year from dirty air and raise trillions of dollars for governments, they said.""There would be enormous benefits from reform, so there's an enormous amount at stake,"" said Ian Parry, the lead author of the IMF report. ""Some countries are reluctant to raise energy prices because they think it will harm the poor. But holding down fossil fuel prices is a highly inefficient way to help the poor, because most of the benefits accrue to wealthier households. It would be better to target resources towards helping poor and vulnerable people directly."" - The Guardian\l"

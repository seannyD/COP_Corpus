"COP22","India","COP22_India2","Morocco : Secretary-General Welcomes Marrakech Action Proclamation, Adopted at United Nations Climate Change Conference in Morocco","November 19, 2016 Saturday","TendersInfo","The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: The Secretary-General welcomes the outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) that concluded today in Marrakech, Morocco. At the Conference, Governments, many represented at the highest level, issued the Marrakech Action Proclamation. This, as well as decisions adopted in Marrakech, powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all Governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible. The Secretary-General notes that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In Marrakech, parties advanced on the rule book for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The agreement entered into force on 4 November, years ahead of expectations. As of today, 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, have ratified the agreement. The Secretary-General applauds the bold leadership shown by many of the worlds most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible towards a 100 per cent clean energy, climate-resilient future. As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. He also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India3","Canada : Minister of Environment to Attend United Nations Climate Change Conference","November 11, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","Environment Minister Scott Moe will represent the Government of Saskatchewan at the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Moe will attend from November 14-18 and take part in sessions on agriculture carbon offsets and carbon capture and storage, advancing the themes of climate mitigation, adaptation and technology. The conference will allow us to promote how Saskatchewans approach can deliver real global results in addressing climate change, Moe said. We will share success stories showing how environmental stewardship can be achieved while protecting economic prosperity, such as our commitment to zero tillage, which has transformed our agricultural lands into tremendous soil sinks, absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. Our commitment to carbon capture and storage technology and our aggressive move toward renewable electrical generation technologies are two other key planks in our strategy. With an estimated 2,400 coal plants in development around the world, Saskatchewan maintains that carbon capture and storage technology has the potential to be a global climate change solution. As well, Saskatchewan continues to move toward 50 per cent renewable capacity in its electricity generation mix by 2030, through the addition of wind and solar power, amongst other sources. Moe will also be meeting with Moroccan pulse importers and a durum wheat processor. Morocco is a key market for these Saskatchewan crops, with more than $190 million worth of durum and $5 million worth of lentils exported in 2015. Saskatchewan accounted for 66 per cent of Canadas total exports to Morocco in 2015. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India4","FICCI at COP 22 in Marrakesh","January 31, 2017","FICCI Business Digest","FICCI led a high-level Climate Change Business Delegation to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakesh from November 14-18, 2016. A landmark new climate deal was forged at COP 21 in Paris marking a turning point in the fight against climate change. While COP 21 in Paris (2015) was a COP of Agreement, COP 22 in Morocco was dubbed as the 'COP of Implementation'. Given that COP 22 was a key milestone for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, it was important that Indian industry and businesses were fully on board, demonstrating leadership in implementation of climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives. FICCI Side Events @ COP 22 FICCI in collaboration with organised a side event on 'Scope of India-Africa Cooperation to Achieve Energy & Climate Goals' at the COP 22 Africa Pavilion on November 14, 2016. The side event explored synergies between India and Africa on decentralised renewable energy solutions and discussed how Indian and African private sector could collaborate to propel Africa's climate smart growth. Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General, TERI, moderated the event and was addressed by Santosh Vaidya, Joint Secretary, Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India. Vaidya emphasized that affordability of off-grid renewable energy solutions could be explored through economies of scale-as has been shown by the Indian example of massive uptake of LEDs. Both India and Africa face the daunting task of defining right to power and ensuring energy access. The FICCI side event highlighted that India and Africa can explore collaborative partnerships in three areas for upscaling off-grid clean energy-first, in development and adoption of standard for off-grid products/systems; second, in skilling; and third, in building innovation, both in terms of technology and business models. FICCI organized a side event on 'Climate Finance-Present Landscape & Opportunities' at the COP 22 India Pavilion. The side event highlighted the role of India's financial institutions (Fls) towards meeting the climate change and sustainability agenda; building preparedness of domestic financial institutions; and the role of International Climate Finance in addressing India's Climate Change Agenda. Anil Dave, Minister of State (IC) for Environment, Forest & Climate Change, emphasized that the discussion on climate finance needs to move from conference rooms to the streets, it needs to be mainstreamed, needs to touch rural markets, small towns and percolate down to the micro level. Anil Kumar Jha, Secretary, Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, highlighted the need to address key challenges such as (i) The missions under the NAPCC not having separate sources of funding; (ii) No commitments from private finance and international finance inputs; (iii) Weak communication-for example, the National Adaptation Fund has not been tapped very well; (iv) Level of intervention being small and not at a scale that can bring visible change, because of a lack of capacity to meet the criteria of project funding; and (v) Lack of convergence among various entities. Extending climate finance beyond renewable energy to areas such as water, sanitation, green buildings and introducing risk mitigation instruments for banks investing in 'green' projects was deemed important. The discussion on climate finance needs to move beyond green bonds and into the entire financial system including banks, insurance sector, pension funds and mutual funds. Considering that of the 65 million of the green jobs in India, renewables are projected account for only 10% of the share, green finance needs to extend to green businesses. Other key engagements of FICCI Climate Change Business Delegation @ COP 22 The FICCI delegation participated in the signing ceremony of the framework agreement on International Solar Alliance (ISA), on November 15, 2016. The framework agreement of International Solar Alliance (ISA) was opened for signature in Marrakech on the sidelines of the COP 22 . This will make ISA an innovative, action oriented and sui generis international and intergovernmental treaty-based organization that will be registered under Article 102 of the UN charter. FICCI presented the position statement in COP 22 , entitled 'FICCI Perspective on the Paris Agreement and Expectations from UNFCCC COP 22 ', to Anil Madhav Dave in a meeting on November 16, 2016, ahead of the FICCI COP 22 India pavilion side event. FICCI Exhibition Booth at COP 22 FICCI being an Observer Organization was provided an Exhibit Booth 27 C from November 14-18, 2016. The FICCI Exhibit theme was Corporate Initiatives in Mitigation and Adaptation. The FICCI exhibit showcased important videos such as CEOs Pledge on Climate Responsibility; and a brief documentary on 'Successful Case Study of Solar Water Pumps in Rajasthan' by FICCI Climate Change Business Delegation Member-Rotosol. Key Outcomes of COP 22 -From Agreement to Action  Finance: Countries were urged to continue scaling up their financial contributions towards the pre-agreed ""$100 bn a year by 2020"" goal, and to achieve a greater balance between adaptation and mitigation.  Climate Vulnerable Forum: COP 22 brought together 48 countries disproportionately affected by climate change which pledged to go 100% renewable by 2050.  Rulebook for Transparency: A key theme of COP22 was debating how best to create a fair rulebook that all countries could share and have confidence in when assessing each other's climate pledges. The technicalities of the rulebook-baselines, methodologies, etc-will be discussed in 2018. A new fund to encourage transparency efforts was established and given a $50 million injection of cash from countries including Australia, Canada and Germany.  Loss and damage: Countries also approved a five-year work plan on ""loss and damage"", which will start in 2017 and will see countries start to formally address climate impacts that are beyond adaptation (e.g., non-economic losses of culture and identity and migration).  Private Sector and COP 22 : The Paris Climate Change Agreement established that private sector participation will be facilitated in greenhouse gas emissions mitigation and implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in coordination with the public sector. COP 22 saw the launch of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action to provide a stable basis for governments and non-state actors such as businesses to align their efforts in 2017-2020. The purpose of this partnership is to increase cooperative efforts in which businesses, sub-national, local governments and civil society collaborate with national governments to promote low-emission and resilient development with the purpose to accelerate climate action. On November 16, 2016 more than 365 businesses, including global brands such as Nike and Starbucks urged US President-elect Donald Trump to power the US economy with low-carbon energy. \"

Addressing mediapersons here, Mr Dave said India would protect the interests and strongly present the viewpoint of the developing countries at the upcoming COP22 at Marrakech in Morocco. Last year at COP21, India led from the front to ensure the inclusion of climate justice and sustainable lifestyles in the Paris agreement and launched the International Alliance. At the COP 22 ""The developed countries should ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol and at Morocco we must agree to set up an action roadmap for 2016-2020 for raising ambition and achieving pre 2020 goals,"" he said. The Minister added that the 100 billion dollars per year climate finance goal had also not been met and at Morocco they will insist for a concrete roadmap from developed countries. The 10.3 billion dollars committed to the green climate fund does not match the enormous finance and technology requirements indicated by developing countries in their INDCs. He said India would put across its views based on Indian, or Gandhian lifestyle in Morocco. He also showed concern that no headway had been made on technology and capacity building front. Ratification by India will help generate the political momentum necessary to bring the Amendment in force. COP22 , India would set up an exclusive pavilion and sessions that would showcase the country's action on climate change and would be an opportunity for a global audience and invited experts to engage in discussion and generate new solutions.

The International Symposium of the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the United Nations 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), held during COP 22 , discussed how to advance Sustainable Tourism in a Changing Climate. The Symposium aimed at increasing awareness on tourism and climate change-related issues and encourage the sector to engage in actions that reinforce national commitments to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The tourism sector is both a vector and a victim of climate change and we are fully committed to contribute to reach the objectives set by the Paris Agreement. This event was essential to advance this agenda, especially the discussion on measurement and reporting requirements as a basis for identifying and prioritizing climate action in tourism, said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai. ""Sustainable tourism creates opportunities and assembles partners to help transform the industry towards low emissions and more efficient and less polluting operations. We must make tourism and every other industry contributor to our climate change action and a sustainable future"", said Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, in her video address to the event. The event focused in particular in the need for partnerships with the private sector and the role of sustainable transportation to accelerate climate action in tourism. Climate change can only be addressed if actors from all parts of society - governments, businesses, NGOs and consumers - make a global and broad shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. Accounting for 10% of GDP, 7% of the world's exports and one in 11 jobs, tourism is one of the main economic sectors in the world, and as such has to be at the core of this essential transition, said Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of the 10YFP Secretariat. The International Symposium was part of the 3-day COP22 Tourism Side Events organized by the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme and hosted by the Ministry of Tourism of Morocco. The Programme is a partnership led by UNWTO with the Governments of France, Morocco and the Republic of Korea as co-leads, with support of the 10YFP Secretariat at UN Environment, aimed at accelerating the shift towards more sustainable consumption and production. It was followed by a networking event involving financial institutions on sustainable tourism as well as by the Annual Conference on Saturday 12 November, where members of the network exchanged experiences and discussed priorities and next steps in the 10YFP Sustainable Tourism Programme. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India17","New UN initiative aims to save lives and cut climate change by protecting peatlands","November 18, 2016 Friday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 18 (Just Earth News): A new global initiative was launched on Thursday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 22 ) under way in Marrakech, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and save thousands of live by protecting peatlands - the largest terrestrial organic soil carbon stock. According to the UN environment Programme (UNEP), the Global Peatlands Initiative seeks mobilize governments, international organizations and academia in an effort to protect peatlands, which contain almost 100 times more carbon than tropical forests. If global temperatures continue to rise, this could lead to thawing permafrost, switching boreal and Arctic peatlands from carbon sinks to sources, resulting in huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and potentially causing climate change to spiral out of control. Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment stressed that despite the Paris Agreement, global temperatures will rise over 3 degrees Celsius this century. This will cause misery and chaos for millions of vulnerable people, so we cannot afford to let any opportunity to reduce emissions slip by, he added. Solheim also urged taking action through the Global Peatlands Initiative, as it is critical we do not reach the tipping point that will see peatlands stop sinking carbon and start spewing it into the atmosphere, destroying any hope we have of controlling climate change. UNEP said that peatlands are coming under increased threat from conversion for palm oil and pulp wood production, which may result in environmental problems such as enormous fires in Indonesia and Russia in recent years. In recent years, Indonesia has suffered from peat forest fires, resulting in greater emissions than the daily ones from the entire United States economy. However, emission is not the only negative impact of peatland degradation. The 2015 peat fires in Indonesia may have indirectly killed up to 100,000 people through the toxic haze, in addition to causing $16.1 billion in economic damage, according to recent studies. Therefore, with support from over a dozen partners, a UN Environment team launched the largest effort on peat so far, called the Global Peatlands Initiative, which aims to increase the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of peatlands in countries with significant peat deposits. The initiative was launched at the Global Landscapes Forum, the leading side event of the UNs COP22 climate change talks in Marrakech, Morocco. The Global Peatlands Initiative was founded by the governments of Indonesia, Peru, the Republic of Congo, UNEP, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, CIFOR, Wetlands International, UNEP-WCMC, GRID-Arendal, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, European Space Agency, WRI, Greifswald Mire Centre and StarVision/Sateligence.

It is one of a number of initiatives launched in Marrakech to promote sustainability and green development. The initiative aims to promote sustainable transportation and encourage city inhabitants to use non-motorized vehicles by setting up 10 automatic bike rental stations in key areas around the city and equipping them with a total of 300 bicycles. One such station was set up at the site of COP22 to make bike-sharing available to participants of the Conference, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of the event. Today Marrakech becomes the first city in Africa to launch a bike-sharing scheme and we hope to replicate this activity in other Moroccan cities. It was rendered possible thanks to the leadership of the citys management and the fruitful cooperation between the city, UNIDO and the GEF, said Hakima El-Haite, the delegate Minister of Environment of Morocco at the launch ceremony. The initiative also serves as an example of how public-private partnerships can address sustainability at the city level. In this scheme, the bike supplier and local advertising company were selected through a competitive process, and then UNIDO and the Ministry of Environment facilitated the dialogue with the Municipality of Marrakech, who ultimately granted the license to the operation system. The bikes and rental systems were then procured and deployed in less than four months. \"

Amin, IRENA Director-General, speaking before the start of Energy Day at COP22 on November 11. Transitioning rapidly to a future fuelled by renewable energy, combined with improving energy efficiency, is the single most effective way to stave off catastrophic climate change while providing citizens with a better quality of life. But the pace and scale of change needs to dramatically increase if we are to fulfil the promise of the Paris Agreement. Governments need to create the necessary policy and finance frameworks to catalyse a groundswell of initiatives, as the private sector develops its own decarbonisation strategies. This is well within our reach, the Director-General said. Energy Day was jointly organized by IRENA and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), in cooperation with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) and the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency. It was one of a series of thematic days hosted by Climate Champions Minister Hakima El Haite (Morocco) and Laurence Tubiana (France), held under the auspices of the COP22 Presidency. The full programme and speakers lineup can be found here. With COP22 Announcements and commitments on renewable energy over the course of the day included: Dalmia Cement and Helvetia publicly committed to use 100% renewable power across their operations, and announced they were joining the RE100 Together, RE100 companies are collectively creating over 100TWh of demand for renewable electricity more than enough to power Morocco three times over. Kevin Rabinovitch, Global Sustainability Director for Mars, announced that they had signed a contract to power their operations in Mexico with 100% renewables, to be completed in mid-2017. Bill Weihl, Director of Sustainability at Facebook talked about a new private-sector led initiative the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA). REBA helps make the connections between corporate electricity demand and renewable energy supply. He pointed out that corporate demand for renewable energy was going to play an increasingly important role in the energy transition. Under the auspices of IRENAs SIDS Lighthouses Initiative, it was announced that 19 renewable energy projects in the Caribbean had been registered on the Sustainable Energy Marketplace web platform, representing an investment volume of $1 billion. Two island States, Antigua and Barbuda and Cabo Verde, had been selected to receive funding from the IRENA/ ADFD Project Facility and other co-financiers for a total of $45 million. In addition the UAE had recently announced $50 million for renewable energy projects in the Caribbean States. The African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) launched in Paris last year, announced that 240 projects had been identified for funding, and that the next step is to bring in public and private investors to support the realization of those projects. Perhaps the key take away from the day can be summed up in a comment from Bill Weihl of Facebook: We are reaching the point where we shouldnt be asking why am I doing this but why am I not doing this? \"

Only two of the 11 are government lawyers; others including me are volunteers, with our organizations paying for all our expenses, Lavia, who also serves as Dean of the Ateneo School of Government, wrote on his Facebook Page. The Paris Agreement aims at holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. It aims to accomplish this by requiring countries who sign it to reach global peaking of greenhouse emissions as soon as possible. The Philippines will be required to decarbonize and reduce greenhouse gasses to 70 percent by 2030. Signatories, however, will be able to access the Green Climate Fund designed to help nations vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

The meeting aimed to present the stakes for Africa at COP22 , to prepare countries participation and to support existing efforts to coordinate the African participation at the UN climate talks. The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), taking place in Marrakech, Morocco, from November 7-18, 2016, is the third Climate Change Conference taking place on African soil, after COP7 (2001) and COP17 (2011), which were held in Marrakech and Durban, South Africa, respectively. This will be a key moment for Africans to push for global commitments towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 and a shift towards resilient, low carbon development. AfDB and ECA are both members of the ClimDev-Africa Committee, which manages the Africa Pavilion during COP. This year, the Africa Pavilion will be an important space for delegations to discuss common development issues, defend their interests, network and showcase efforts undertaken to build more resilient economies. Africa will also be at the heart of various initiatives featured in the COP22 village, especially in the areas dedicated to innovation and solutions, and civil society. The COP22 Civil Society team recently visited 14 African countries to mobilize the continents community networks. We are also raising awareness among the African press through a second press trip to Morocco including 60 journalists this time. All this to say how important mobilizing the continent of Africa is for Morocco, said Driss El Yazami, COP22 Chef of Civil Society Activities. COP22 is an African COP and we encourage your strong participation in Marrakech to defend the continents interests, added Abdeslam Bekrate, Head of Logistics and Security, COP22 Steering Committee. According to ECA research, a global temperature increase of 2C by 2050 could cause Africas GDP to decline by 4.7%. However, Africa can still turn the tide in its favour and achieve more resilient and inclusive development by taking advantage of its late industrial development to leapfrog towards green industrialization, said Omar Abdourahman, Acting Director of the ECA Office for North Africa, ahead of the meeting.

"COP22","India","COP22_India36","United Kingdom : COP22: from Paris to Marrakesh","October 21, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","After close to 200 countries signed up to a historic Climate Agreement in Paris at the end of 2015, the focus this year is firmly on the follow-up meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco in November, the 22nd Conference of the Parties, or COP22 . This remains a challenging task, as it means that industrialised countries will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by mid-century and become carbon-neutral thereafter. And climate change will continue, so adaptation will grow as well. Both climate change mitigation and adaptation will need climate finance investments. If 2015 was about the principle that finally something had to be done, 2016 is about how to achieve this new set of ambitious environmental goals and make them a concrete reality. COP22 is currently referenced as the implementation COP, explained Jan-Willem van de Ven, Associate Director and Head of Carbon Market Development at the EBRDs Energy Efficiency and Climate Change department, who is coordinating the Banks work at the meeting. This years Marrakesh session, from 7-18 November, wont be just for diplomats and political leaders. Morocco will host a simultaneous meeting for engineers, researchers, scientists, and policy-makers to devise actionable pathways for meeting the goals of the treaty. 2016 has already been dubbed the Year of Green Finance, with a spotlight on how to deliver the trillions of dollars worth of investments needed to make a decisive difference on global warming. Now when the 2015 Paris Agreement ratification threshold has been reached, the priorities this November will be strengthening the steps to deal with both climate change itself and its effects, so-called climate change mitigation and adaptation. A key focus for negotiators will be to further develop the regulations and decisions to implement the Paris Agreement. As an example, in Paris it was agreed to schedule every five years a global stock-take that would help countries determine how to increase and accelerate their emission reduction targets. The rules and procedures on monitoring these processes are yet to be agreed. Due to the complexity of issues and number of parties involved these will remain slow negotiations, but the process is moving forward. The responses will be strengthened by developing collaborative initiatives and there will be sessions on how to mobilise the finance, technology and skills to deliver the climate goals. The EBRD through its new Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, an initiative that places even more emphasis on climate finance stands ready to support the countries where it works in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. By 2020, the EBRD aims to be dedicating 40 per cent of its annual investments to green economy projects, doubling the pace of financing in this sector compared with the last five years. As in 2015, the EBRD will play an active role in the COP22 conference and it is organising a number of events itself as well as participating in other meetings. The planned EBRD-led activities will focus on capacity building in relation to the NDCs, energy efficiency, carbon market policies, adaptation and technology transfer. As this COP is in Morocco, an EBRD country of operations, the Bank will profile its work in the country and the region. As part of the climate finance day organised around COP22 , the Bank will showcase the Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility. Through SEFFs, the EBRD indirectly lends to local banks for on-lending for energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy projects. Moroccos MorSEFF has been extended to two commercial banks in Morocco, BMCE and BCP. \"

Seasons seem to be inverting in the Himalayas where you see snow in summer and entire villages that have existed for generations have had to relocate because of water-pattern changes That is the wisdom on offer from Buddhist leader and active environmentalist -- the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa -- the spiritual head of the 800-year-old Drukpa Order based in the Himalayas with around 1,000 monastic centres. On the ongoing high-level United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech in Morocco, he candidly admitted he didn't know the scientific answer to studies that strongly indicate the Hindu Kush, a mountain range extending west of the Himalayas, would be warmer. The spiritual leader said: ""The community that I represent has extensive anecdotal evidence on climate change."" ""For example, in Ladakh, we are seeing unprecedented weather phenomenon like cloudbursts. Seasons seem to be inverting -- where you see snow in summer, and entire villages that have existed for countless generations have had to relocate because water-pattern changes,"" he observed. ""One glimmer of hope that I have is that the local communities in the Himalayas are taking action,"" said the Buddhist leader, also known as the ""Guardian of the Himalayas"". ""Many villages are participating in my joint initiative with the Waterkeeper Alliance, the Himalayan Glacier Waterkeepers, where communities monitor the quality of water with an aim to protect the waters of Ladakh and the Himalayas."" Advocating the need to revisit the traditional way of life, the maroon-robed monk said: ""There is a lot of green wisdom in traditional lifestyles. For example, the Druk Padma Karpo School (near Leh) incorporated both cutting-edge modern technology and traditional know-how to create one of the greenest schools in Asia. ""This is a great time to marry modern technology with ancient wisdom to tackle today's challenges,"" he advocated. The Buddhist leader admitted the ongoing climate talks are of particular importance for both the developing and developed countries. ""I often think that climate change is an opportunity for countries to build bridges and to collaborate,"" said the 54-year-old Gyalwang Drukpa, who heads the 17th century Hemis monastery, some 40 km from Leh town in Jammu and Kashmir. Gyalwang Drukpa, recipient of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Award, in a message to the global leaders said: ""Despite all of our differences, we all share the same values of wanting a clean, green and economically thriving world."" ""I would encourage the participants to view their differences as strength and not something that divides them. Diversity of thought and background only makes problem-solving more robust and dynamic."" Gyalwang Drukpa, who is associated with the Earth Awards Selection Committee that recognises viable innovations that improve the quality of life, said the Paris Climate Change Agreement that entered into force on November 4 is important to every country. Just two months after the flash floods that devastated Ladakh in 2010, the Drukpa Order, with around 9,000 volunteers, planted 50,033 willow saplings in 33 minutes and 25 seconds over 112,000 square yards. According to the spiritual leader, planting trees is not only impactful but also an important gesture. In a message, he said: ""I hope that countries that are home to the Himalayas will collaborate on protecting the water sources of the Himalayas. This is a trans-boundary problem that affects several different religious groups, ethnic groups, countries and terrain."" The twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) and the 12th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 12) will be held in Marrakech till November 18.

""We are confident in the interest and well being of all humanity. Withdrawal of one party from the agreement doesn't mean anything. There is absolutely no threat to COP22 . You have to keep trust and confidence,"" Mezouar told the media here. He also said that everyone is confident that the US will keep the trust and the momentum will continue as American people are strongly determined. He urged the world to be patient. Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa, said the Paris agreement carries an enormous amount of credibility and that she looks forward to working with the Trump administration. ""Paris agreement carries an enormous amount of credibility. We in the secretariat have a very clear responsibility in helping the parties to bring the process further. At the same time, we are ready to build a very strong and constructive relationship with President-elect Trump, in order to bring this agenda that is in interest of the world,"" Espinosa said. Being hailed as the COP of action, COP22 is building up on the negotiations in terms of finance and mitigation processes of Paris Agreement, under which rich countries have pledged about 100 billion dollars in financial support to the developing countries a year starting 2020 to help them cut down the emissions. Of that $100 billion, about $63 billion will be mobilised through public funding. Trump had pledged to roll out of the Paris agreement, which means that the threshold achieved for the Paris Agreement would be jeopardised as America alone accounts for 17 per cent of the global emissions, the biggest chunk after China. Mezouar also said the conference is ""going well"" and negotiations are unfolding in the right spirit. He said there is need to increase the public funding. Mexican Minister Espinosa said that there is need to speed up the work, adding, ""we need a fully operational Paris agreement.""

Before the Conference wraps up on 18 November, State Parties hope to define the rules for the accord and to lay out a viable plan for providing at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to support climate action. Adopted by 196 States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) last December, the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It entered into force in record time on 4 November 2016. The Marrakech Conference includes a number of meetings and high-level events, including the high-level segment to be attended by dozens of heads of State and Government, on Tuesday 15 November. During the first week of COP 22 , in parallel with the negotiations between the Parties, a series of thematic days on forests, water, cities, energy and transport highlighted the crucial role of non-state actors, including businesses, cities and non-governmental organizations, to implement the Agreement. On Saturday, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, co-host of COP 22 , welcomed the fact that 105 countries have now ratified the Paris Agreement. It gives the Agreement a lot of weight and a lot of credibility, she said at a press conference. It has happened in record time, she added. So we really hit the ground with this unexpected success in many ways of the entry into force of the Agreement much earlier than expected. But now at the same time we have more urgency to get to work and finalize the elements we need in order to have a fully operational Paris Agreement. The President of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, underscored an extremely positive state of mind, a commitment of everyone to maintain the momentum and help COP 22 be the one we all wanted, a COP of action, a COP of commitment, a COP that confirms the determination of all Parties, the international community as a whole, to continue climate action. Mezouar stressed that the main priorities of the Moroccan Presidency of COP 22 are to create a bridge between the world of negotiations and the world of action, to get Parties to increase their national commitments, to focus on climate finance and to transform climate initiatives launched at COP 21 into concrete projects. Asked about the uncertainties raised by the US presidential election, Mezouar said that the participants of the Marrakech Conference remained confident and that it was necessary to stay the course and keep this extraordinary momentum.

They conveyed their appreciation to the Kingdom of Morocco for hosting the conference and for the warm hospitality. The Ministers reiterated their unwavering commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and noted the enduring relevance of the Convention's principles and provisions, such as equity and CBDR & RC to successfully tackling one of the most serious challenges of our times. The Convention and its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement provides the primary platform for inclusive and fair collective action by the international community to urgently address climate change, informed by the latest science. In this regard, the Ministers welcomed the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which represents the best contract possible in balancing the circumstances of all countries and thereby the best opportunity for the international community to reverse the disruption of the Earth's climate systems caused by human activities. This is the time for urgent action. The direction of travel from Paris is irreversible. There can be no backtracking on commitments by developed Parties, and no attempts to renegotiate the terms of the pact reached in Paris. Parties must live up to their responsibilities. Ministers vowed to continue and strengthen the leadership role their countries have demonstrated - both in negotiations in the UNFCCC and in terms of concrete action on the ground, to reduce emissions, and to adapt to climate change impacts. The Ministers therefore stressed the urgency of enhancing pre-2020 action and ambition, and they emphasized the importance of the Doha Agreement entering into force without further delay and also the realization of the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020. The Marrakech Climate Change Conference is an implementation and action-oriented COP and has provided the BASIC countries and many others, with a useful platform for launching action initiatives. The Ministers expressed full confidence that a direct and legally sound way would be found at the Conference to progress with the technical work required to operationalize the Paris Agreement in a balanced and comprehensive manner, including anchoring the Adaptation Fund under the Paris Agreement and ensuring that all mandates are allocated to specific bodies. The BASIC Ministers will continue to advance the legitimate interests of all fellow developing countries, with emphasis on the needs of developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, but who are historically least responsible for causing it. In this context, the Ministers stressed that adequate means of implementation support, in the form of new and additional climate finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, for all developing countries that require it, is indispensable if we are to meet the temperature reduction goals and adaptation goal set out in the Paris Agreement. \"

During the first session on ""Afforestation and REDD+"", experts highlighted that forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, particularly in India, where nearly 25 per cent of the area has tree cover. The Government has asked the forestry sector to help the country meet its goal of creation of 2.5-3.0 billion tonnes of additional carbon sinks, as per the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This target will be met using a variety of means, including afforestation, reforestation, and agro-forestry, conducted through community participation and mechanisms like REDD+. India has begun implementing REDD+ pilot projects, developing protocols for improving measurement, reporting, and verification and safeguard information systems. Emphasis was also placed on promoting the exchange of information and present potential collaborations among South Asian countries that share Himalayan and tropical ecologies. In the second session on ecosystem and climate change, discussions were held on the role of forest in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Climate change alters existing biome types and can cause forest dieback with consequent loss of biodiversity. Various forest conservation oriented acts and policies in India are contributing to a reduction in CO2 emissions, stabilisation and improvement of carbon stocks in forests, and conservation of biodiversity. India's forests serve as a major sink of CO2, offsetting around 12 per cent of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the country. Showcasing India's efforts on sustainable transport solutions, the country's Ministry of Railways, with its technical partner, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, hosted the third session on ""Sustainable Transport Solutions"". Special Secretary, MoEFCC, R R Rashmi, pointed out that India is on the road to managing its transport sector emissions. ""In addition, there have been efforts to decrease fossil-fuel dependence in the transport sector, which have been incorporated by moving towards cleaner sources of energy and increasing the share of renewables in driving mobility,"" she added. India has focused its low carbon initiatives on the development of railways, waterways, Mass Rapid Transport System and other forms of public transport. Initiatives such as the Dedicated Freight Corridors and the Sagarmala projects on development of waterwayswere discussed by Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Shipping. The initiatives are aimed at increasing the share and volume of freight traffic on the more energy efficient rail and water based transport modes. The representative from Council on Energy, Environment and Water highlighted that the Indian Railways has taken a leadership role by planning to substitute its petroleum use with alternatives like bio-fuels, and consistently pursuing a policy of railway electrification through renewable sources of energy, with potential reduction of 138 MT of CO2 by 2030.

Morocco in November 2016 marks an important milestone for the global economy. The Paris Agreement, which has now entered into force, is a landmark global agreement setting a course for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through 162 nationally determined contributions (NDCs), representing 189 countries. Now that the Agreement is in place, our global focus must be to establish the plans and actions for implementation, and COP 22 is a critical forum for doing that. Johnson Controls is pleased to join this COP as a private sector participant, as we have for many years. A key element of realizing our vision for ""a safe, comfortable and sustainable world"" is global action on climate change. The International Energy Agency estimates that investment of $1 trillion annually into low-carbon energy solutions by 2030 is needed to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change and make our global building and transportation infrastructure more resilient. The transition to lower-carbon, more sustainable and resilient technologies has already begun. According to the Business Council on Sustainable Energy and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in 2015, global investment in clean energy reached a record high of S329 billion. It is critical to maintain momentum in business innovation, public and private investment, and policy frameworks that support this transition. To achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement and also the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13 (SDG7 and SDG13), the public and private sectors must collaborate. In addition to our own commitment to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 energy and emissions, and delivering technologies that help our customers reduce their energy and emissions. Johnson Controls partners with many other organizations for collective action on climate change. For example. Johnson Controls collaborates with members of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the Alliance to Save Energy, The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, the European Partnership for Energy and the Environment, the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, the European Alliance of Companies for Energy Efficiency in Buildings, the UN Sustainable Energy for All Initiative, The Climate Group as a founding member of the Energy Productivity 100 (EP100) coalition, the U.S. Department of Energy Better Plants Challenge, U.S. Business Act on Climate Pledge, and many other coalitions to motivate and accelerate action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \"

In this regard, the Ministers welcomed the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which represents the best contract possible in balancing the circumstances of all countries and thereby the best opportunity for the international community to reverse the disruption of the Earths climate systems caused by human activities. This is the time for urgent action. The direction of travel from Paris is irreversible. There can be no backtracking on commitments by developed Parties, and no attempts to renegotiate the terms of the pact reached in Paris. Parties must live up to their responsibilities. Ministers vowed to continue and strengthen the leadership role their countries have demonstrated both in negotiations in the UNFCCC and in terms of concrete action on the ground, to reduce emissions, and to adapt to climate change impacts. The Ministers therefore stressed the urgency of enhancing pre-2020 action and ambition, and they emphasized the importance of the Doha Agreement entering into force without further delay and also the realization of the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020. The Marrakech Climate Change Conference is an implementation and action-oriented COP and has provided the BASIC countries and many others, with a useful platform for launching action initiatives. The Ministers expressed full confidence that a direct and legally sound way would be found at the Conference to progress with the technical work required to operationalize the Paris Agreement in a balanced and comprehensive manner, including anchoring the Adaptation Fund under the Paris Agreement and ensuring that all mandates are allocated to specific bodies. The BASIC Ministers will continue to advance the legitimate interests of all fellow developing countries, with emphasis on the needs of developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, but who are historically least responsible for causing it. In this context, the Ministers stressed that adequate means of implementation support, in the form of new and additional climate finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, for all developing countries that require it, is indispensable if we are to meet the temperature reduction goals and adaptation goal set out in the Paris Agreement. \"

Leaders from around the world met in Marrakech, Morocco to chart a course for collective action on climate change. The conference focused on translating the blueprint agreement into key deliverables and measurable outcomes for international climate action. In The Marrakech Action Proclamation for Climate and Sustainable Development, States Parties to the UNFCCC, affirmed their commitment to full implementation of the Paris Agreement. Countries must submit their detailed future climate action plans in accordance with the Paris Agreement by mid-2017. Climate change is becoming one of the biggest threats to the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) and integrity of sites on UNESCOs World Heritage List, and to the communities and economies that rely on their resources. One of the most visible impacts is the widespread bleaching of coral reefs affecting marine World Heritage sites around the world. For coral reefs and many other World Heritage marine ecosystems, keeping climatic warming to the Paris Agreements long-term goal of 1.5C is essential. UNESCO has been working for years to track climate impacts and World Heritage marine sites are working to increase climate resilience by managing other stressors. Many marine World Heritage sites are also making strides to reduce their CO2 emissions. For example, in Everglades National Park (United States of America) tour buses run on biofuel, and lights and hot water are powered by the sun. Facilities on Aldabra Atoll (Seychelles) run nearly 100 per cent carbon free. Glacier Bay (United States of America) has reduced pollution substantially through the establishment of a market-based approach for cruise concession contracts. In recognition of the oceans vital role as a climate regulatorand its vulnerability to climate impactsa day was dedicated to the ocean at COP22 . The event focused on the requirements for implementing the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals with regards to the worlds ocean. Saving the planets irreplaceable ocean assets requires both local and global action. The COP22 commitments are only the start of the journey to map more clearly the vulnerability of marine World Heritage sites so that more comprehensive mitigation and adaptation measures can be established. \"

Working with business leaders, governments at all levels and civil society are developing solutions to climate change, which will not only ensure a sustainable planet but also grow a clean economy. This transition driven by market forces is unstoppable, and Canada intends to be at the forefront. The Paris Agreement was the first step on the road to a cleaner, more prosperous future for families and businesses around the world. The next steps are just as important, as Canada takes bold action to meet our 2030 emission-reduction target, to build a clean economy, and to create more opportunities for middle-class Canadians. Today, Minister McKenna heads to Marrakech, Morocco, to lead Canadas delegation at the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. She will be joined by provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous leaders, Opposition Members of Parliament, businesses, youth, and civil society. At this years climate-change conference, Minister McKenna will continue to provide the leadership Canada has shown internationally on climate change. Canada will build on the momentum of this year, including the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in refrigerants and air conditioners, and the International Civil Aviation Organizations historic agreement to mitigate emissions from airplanes. COP22 will put the Paris Agreement into action, with a focus on swift implementation. Canada will highlight the role of businesses; provincial, territorial, and municipal governments; and Indigenous groups as key to address climate change. As the countries that contribute the least to the causes of climate change are often the most affected by it, COP22 will also facilitate continued collaboration between developed and developing countries to address climate change. Addressing climate change is not only vital for communities around the world but also vital to the global economy. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord committed the developed world to mobilize $100 billion per year to support green growth and climate resilience in developing countries. This commitment will create tremendous opportunities for business growth and innovation as companies invest in and market clean technology. Minister McKenna will work with the Canadian business delegation and with her international counterparts to connect our innovators with those who need them. Minister McKenna will deliver Canadas national statement, and she will participate in several high-level meetings on issues including carbon pricing, clean-technology growth, support for developing countries, short-lived climate pollutants, gender and climate policy, as well as health and the role of Indigenous communities in climate solutions. \"

This means that catastrophic events such as cyclones, heatwaves, floods and droughts have become frequent at 10 year cycle rather than 100 year cycles. Informing the Parties, non-Parties (of the COP) and the members of scientific community here, WMO official Omar Baddour presented findings of a report -- Global Climate in 2011-2015 -- at a COP22 discussion, Earth Information Day. The detailed report for 2016 trends would be released here on November 14 at the high-level delegation meeting of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP22 . ""The primary impact of the 2015-2016 El Ni\'f1o on annual global temperatures is expected to be in 2016 rather than 2015,"" the report said at the discussion, which featured speakers from the heads of UN and international science organizations. The report further said that in 2015, average carbon dioxide (CO2) levels reached 400 parts per million (ppm) globally. ""This year, 2016, will be the first year in which CO2 at the Mauna Loa Observatory remains above 400 ppm all year, and for many generations to come,"" report said. Pointing out the socio-economic loss due to extreme events, Baddour said that over 4,100 deaths were attributed to heat wave in India and Pakistan in 2015, about 2,5000 people died of draught and famine in west Africa between 2011-12, over 7,000 people died in the Philippines, while Hurrican Sandy led to an economic loss of $67 billion in the US. The WHO report came as a major challenge ahead of the major goal of the landmark Paris climate change agreement (COP21), that aims at keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It further warned that the global ocean temperatures and sea-leave rise is at unprecedented levels, concentration of long lived greenhouse gases continues to increase and mountain glaciers also continued their decline in the period 2011-2015 at alarming levels. According to the 2015 Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, approximately 44 per cent of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activity from 2004 to 2015 remained in the atmosphere, with the remaining 56 per cent removed by oceans and the terrestrial biosphere .

The ISA 's objective is to bring together solar rich countries on a common platform to make joint efforts through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity building measures and financial instruments to increase solar energy capacity. Its future, however, had become uncertain following differences between India and the US over its precise nature. While India wanted it to be ratified through a treaty which all member countries would sign and which would be registered with the UN, the US wanted an organisation of a more informal nature without any such treaty . The differences have since been ironed out, though precisely what will be ratified at COP22 has not been spelt out.  It has the US's full support, a senior government official said. Industry watchers were delighted with the development.  It is remarkable that what was announced at COP21is being ratified within a single year, said Jean Pascal Pham Ba, spokesperson for The Terrawatt Initiative, a global non-profit aimed at furthering the goals of the ISA. Meanwhile, NTPC has decided to contribute $1 million to the corpus '100 crore) that fund of $15 million (.India is providing to the ISA. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), both of them arms of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) have already committed $1million each, but NTPC is the first independent company to do so. Coal India and NALCO are also likely to announce similar contributions soon. India has also set aside five acres of land in Gurgaon, next to the National Institute of Solar Energy, to house the headquarters of the ISA. An informal target of the ISA is to have 1 terawatt (1 million MW) of global solar power by 2030, which will require an investment of around $1 trillion. (Current global capacity is around 230,000 MW).  For that there will have to be access to low cost of capital, credit enhance ment mechanisms, and also standardized regulation on quality control, said Jean Pascal Pham Ba,  We will unveil a standard template for solar project documents which will be acceptable to all finance institutions at the forthcoming COP22 .

"COP22","India","COP22_India70","India Pavilion at COP22 inaugurated","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 9 -- The India pavilion at the COP22 was inaugurated today (November 8) at the Bab Ighli village, the venue of the summit. The Pavilion was inaugurated by the Minister of State for Environment Anil Madhav Dave in the presence of additional secretary R R Rashmi, director of Climate Change Division S Satpathy and joint secretary for climate change Ravi Shankar Prasad. With moving LED displays, several synchronised large screens displays, water curtains and a revolving globe as the centerpiece, The India Pavilion is the biggest ever set up by the government at any COP event so far. The pavilion has been set up as the staging area for activities and events undertaken by the Indian government and other Indian participants at the summits. It is an attempt at building a technology-intensive interactive stage for information on India's climate initiative. Despite the extravagant set up, the pavilion was inaugurated under the theme of ""Sustainable Living"". The environment minister upheld the Indian view of environmental conservatism and the sustainability of the Indian lifestyle as an extension of Gandhian philosophy and more broadly as an inherent part of the Indian way of life. He further underlined the need to spread climate change awareness and the importance of collective action. The minister further highlighted the responsibility of youth in tackling climate change. ""Climate action needs to happen beyond the walls of this five star conference set up. What happens here is fine but what matters is how much we can incorporate suitable practices on the ground, in our daily lives. Climate change must be a topic among the common people, not just among the privileged and the highly educated. I hope the youth take charge in this endeavour. In future, the Indian Pavilions should not only be bigger but full of youngsters who can take the Indian agenda for climate awareness and action forward."" The minister also, somewhat obtusely, referred to an Indian fable and stressed the need to tweak and ease out any inadequacies instead of doing away with the process altogether. The minister made a fleeting mention of Delhi's air pollution woes in recent weeks to illustrate his involvement at all levels in India's fight against climate change. He further solicited Indian scientists from premier research and scientific institutes to engage more deeply in the process of climate negotiations. ""I call on scientists and policy influencers to get more involved in this process and I assure you that all obstacles in the path to this will be cleared by me.""

At least 50% will come from Welsh sources, with a goal to increase this to 100%. COP22 builds on the success of last years event in Paris, during which an agreement to keep global warming below 2C was reached. This years conference is a chance for the Cabinet Secretary to highlight Wales progress and the impact Wales is making. Wales is leading the way in sustainable development, becoming one of the first countries in the world to enshrine in law a reference to the UKs Sustainable Development Goals, through the Well-being of Future Generations Act.Speaking ahead of her departure to Marrakesh, the Environment Secretary said: Although Wales is a small country it still has a global responsibility to reduce carbon emissions and tackle climate change. We recognise this responsibility and continue to strengthen our commitments, setting legally binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a minimum of 80% per cent by 2050 in our Environment Act. We have also placed sustainable development at the heart of our public services and I am delighted to announce that all electricity bought for public services in Wales by NPS will be from 100 per cent renewable sources by next year. This sends a clear message on our commitment to move towards cleaner energy use in Wales and encourage others to follow suit. Im proud that in Wales we are securing in law actions to achieve the Wales we want. I look forward to the opportunities COP22 presents to highlight Wales achievements and learn from others. Wales stands ready to play its part in the Paris Agreement. Welcoming the announcement on renewable energy for public sector NPS customers, Cabinet Secretary for Finance Mark Drakeford, said: At a time of increasing budget pressures, the National Procurement Service offers a great opportunity for the Welsh public sector to do things differently; to work collaboratively and generate efficiencies. Sustainability and the wellbeing of future generations are at the heart of the services it procures. I am therefore delighted that its energy customers will receive electricity generated from 100% renewable sources half of which will be from Wales. By working together across the public sector, we can continue to reduce our carbon footprint across Wales. \"

Following the European Parliaments ratification and the entry into force of the 2015 Paris agreement, these will focus on how to finance and share the efforts needed to keep climate warming well below 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. During their visit, MEPs will discuss issues with key negotiators and meet counterparts from other parliaments, as well as local and international NGO and industry representatives. In Marrakesh, we will have to work on the implementation of the Paris agreement. We helped to make it become binding, but it is evident that the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions currently on the table are not sufficient to achieve the objective of limiting climate change to well below 2 degrees, said delegation Chair Giovanni La Via (EPP, IT). We shall also work to consolidate the trust between developed and developing countries. We must and we can hand over to future generations a world that is more stable and prosperous: a healthier and cleaner planet, he added. The path chosen in Paris is irreversible ""Marrakesh should send out the signal that the path chosen in Paris is irreversible, said delegation vice-Chair Jo Leinen (S&D, DE). The climate targets need to be achieved step by step in the coming years. The European Union must be an engaged player in this process and act as a broker between the partners of the North and the South"", he said. The existing climate targets will not be sufficient to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the EU needs to bring its climate policy into line with the Paris Agreement.

Leo, is being hosted by Royal Air Maroc, Moroccos national carrier. Leo will be on display in the main COP22 convention centre in Bab Ighli from 7-16 November before moving to Marrakech Manara Airport and Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport this week where the robot will assist delegates flying Royal Air Maroc to check-in their bags. SITAs baggage robot will remain in Morocco until November 27 where the national airline will conduct numerous airport trials using Leo. Abdelhamid Addou, Chairman & CEO of Royal Air Maroc, said: The smart use of new technologies is undoubtedly the key to improving the passenger experience while helping airlines better manage a growing number of travelers in a more sustainable way. This requires out-of-the-box thinking and Leo is exactly the sort of innovative exploration that will help airlines and airports manage the new challenges we as an industry will face in the next decade. Leo is a fully autonomous, self-propelling baggage robot that has the capacity to check in, print bag tags and transport up to two suitcases with a maximum weight of 32kg. It also has an obstacle avoidance capability and can navigate in a high-traffic environment such as an airport. Leo provides a glimpse into the future of baggage handling being explored by SITA Lab and is the first step to automating the baggage process from the moment passengers drop their bags to when they collect them. Using robotics and artificial intelligence, bags will be collected, checked in, transported and loaded onto the correct flight without ever having to enter the terminal building or be directly handled by anyone other than by the passengers themselves. Hani El-Assaad, SITA President, Middle East, India and Africa said: Through the innovative work of the SITA Lab we are able to tackle some of the key challenges that face airlines and airports today. Leo demonstrates that technologies such as robotics can help the air transport industry manage the growth in traffic in a more sustainable way while offering passengers an unencumbered journey through the airport and onto the aircraft. Leo comes to the assistance of passengers as they approach the terminal building. Touching Leos Scan&Fly bag drop interface opens the baggage compartment doors to allow passengers to place their bags inside. After the passengers have scanned their boarding passes, the tags are printed and can be attached to the bag. With the bags loaded and tagged, the compartment door closes and Leo displays the boarding gate and departure time. Leo then takes the bags directly to the baggage handling area where they are sorted and connected to the correct flight. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India76","Morocco Summit - COP 22 - India to raise issue of finances under Green Climate Fund and transfer of technology","October 2, 2016 Sunday 6:30 AM EST","Tax India Online","NEW DELHI, OCT 02, 2016: INDIA has claimed that it will protect the interests and strongly present the viewpoint of the developing countries at the upcoming COP 22 at Marrakech, Morocco. In his opening remarks at an interaction with the media on various issues related to Climate Change here yesterday, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge), Mr Anil Madhav Dave, said that India will put across its views based on Indian, or Gandhian lifestyle in Morocco. The Environment Minister said that issues related to raising finance under Green Climate Fund (GCF) and technology transfer will also be raised at COP22 . Mr Dave said that a Pavilion will be set up at Marrakech to showcase the steps taken by India on climate change. The upcoming negotiations at COP 22 are very crucial to advance on key issues. Following will be the key priorities: (i) Enhancing Ambition and promoting action between 2016-2020: Paris Agreement is for post-2020 period. Currently, we are operating under the pre-2020 action framework and must not wait any further to take action. The developed countries should ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. At Morocco, we must agree to set up an action roadmap for 2016-2020 for raising ambition and achieving pre-2020 goals. (ii) Mobilising means of implementation i.e finance, technology and capacity-building support before and after 2020: USD 11 billion per year climate finance goal has not been met. At Morocco, India will insist for a concrete roadmap from developed countries. USD 10.3 billion committed to the Green Climate Fund does not match the enormous finance and technology requirements indicated by developing countries in their INDCs. On the technology and capacity-building front also, not much headway has been made. The new Technology Framework under the Paris Agreement should help to remove barriers to technology access and provide finance for meeting higher technological costs. (iii) Furthering the cause of Adaption and loss and damage: India is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The first review of the loss and damage mechanism at COP 22 is an opportunity for India to ensure that this mechanism provides tangible and concrete solutions. Most important of these would be to ensure that there are tools to address adaptation, financial risk management and finance needs for dealing with extreme and slow onset events. (iv) Detailing rule and modalities under Paris Agreement: Paris Agreement has laid a broad framework, but guidelines and rules need to be detailed for the Agreement to be operational. Pending task such as modalities for market mechanism, transparency arrangements, features of NDCs, facilitative dialogue, must be expedited, starting from Morocco COP. Several new bodies such as the Paris Committee on capacity-building, the Technology Framework etc must also be ready before 2020. (v) Furthering the agenda on sustainable lifestyles and climate justice: it is important that apart from emission cuts, we also focus on measures that involve broader participation. People in developed countries live extravagant lifestyles with high carbon footprint. Simple everyday changes in lifestyles, when practiced by a large number of people around the globe, collectively will make a huge impact. The power of choices that each one of us makes every day like the food we eat, the way we travel, the things we buy etc are not realised. When choices that 7 billion world citizens make are put together, it impacts our planet in a major way. Therefore, each choice counts. India has made a commitment in its INDC, on sustainable lifestyles and will continue to push this agenda forward in Morocco. India is strongly committed to fight climate change and assures that it will make every possible effort within its capacity to achieve a significant outcome in Marrakech, Morocco. India will set up an exclusive Pavilion at COP 22 , hosting various sessions in the form of panel discussions, presentations and documentaries. These will showcase India's actions on climate change and will be an opportunity for a global audience and invited experts to engage in discussion and generate new solutions. India will ratify the Paris Agreement (on Climate Change) on October 2, 2016, the day of Gandhi Jayanti. Ratification by India will help generate the political momentum necessary to bring the Amendment in force. India's decision to ratify the Paris agreement has come after ensuring compliance of domestic legal requirements, internal discussions and after obtaining clarity from UNFCCC with regard to transparency and participation of Parties in the future processes. Countries have been assured by UNFCCC that other Parties will be given sufficient time to ratify the Paris Agreement, at least till 2018, so that future decision-making is as inclusive as possible. India through its participation in the Paris Agreement, under the UNFCCC process, will articulate the interests of the poor and vulnerable groups. India led from the front at COP 21 last year, to ensure the inclusion of climate justice and sustainable lifestyles in the Paris Agreement and launched the International Solar Alliance. India will continue to champion such action-oriented initiatives and joint ventures. \"

Several events were held throughout this Water Action Day, including a high level panel organized by the host country of this global summit on climate change in the United Nations blue zone. The African Development Bank (AfDB) was represented by its Director for Water Supply and Sanitation, Mohamed El Azizi in the discussions panel. The Moroccan Junior Minister for Water, Charafat Afilal; Water Ministers Barmou Salifou, Niouga Ambroise Ouedraogo and Sidick Abdelkerim Haggar from Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, respectively, as well as the Director of the Moroccan Office of Electricity and Potable Water (ONEE), Ali Fassi El Fihri, took part in this roundtable's lively discussions. Water mentioned in 85% of INDCs Water is at the heart of many challenges posed by climate change, and calls for as many solutions. Even a slight increase in the earth's temperature will have serious consequences: climate variability is increasing and its impacts are more numerous, more serious and longer lasting, particularly extreme climate events (floods and droughts, for example). Such phenomena lead to increased water pollution, higher incidence of malnutrition, more migration and more significant losses, particularly in infrastructure and agricultural production. More than 85% of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) presented by countries participating in the Paris Agreement cite water as a key adaptation issue, the UNFCCC noted during COP22 . ""Water insecurity leads to heightened conflicts, tension among populations, and causes migrations that threaten global stability,"" stated Minister Charafat Afilal. ""Africa is the continent that is most vulnerable to climate change,"" said Mohamed El Azizi, Director of the AfDB's Water Supply and Sanitation Department. He added, ""It's about providing justice, in the context of climate financing, to this continent, which has suffered the consequences of climate change without having been responsible for it. African countries are concerned with the complex and difficult access to climate financing, particularly for fragile countries."" Large water adaptation projects financed by AfDB in Morocco The Bank has financed large projects for climate change adaptation in Morocco. Among these are the water transfer project between the Rabat and Casablanca watersheds that impacts the daily lives of 5 million people, the Marrakech region water supply project, benefitting 2 million people, and the Tetouan region potable water supply security project via the transfer of water from the Tangier Med port facilities to the Moulay El Hassan Bel Mehdi dam. ""I would like to congratulate the Bank for its ability to react, responding quickly to our financing needs for this project,"" stated ONEE Director Ali Fassi Fihri. ""[It] has ensured service continuity for potable water in the area, because without supplementary service prior to the end of 2016, the entire Tetouan area would be confronted with a catastrophic water shortage."" On the Water Action Day, Morocco used the opportunity to officially launch a new initiative, ""Water for Africa "". This initiative began prior to COP22 , in July 2016 in Rabat, during the International Conference on Water and Climate, organized by the country in partnership with the World Water Council. The goal is to mobilise the international community to develop an emergency action plan on water to confront climate change in Africa and thereby mobilise the necessary financial resources. The Blue Book on Water and Climate was also released today, the result of reports and recommendations formulated during the conference held in Rabat last July.

They also expect the COP22 to result in concrete policy, technical and financial measures to make the Paris deal operational. We need to build on the Paris Agreement which was historic but is not enough. Local and regional governments are taking action and are ready to help but they need sustainable smart investment and a stronger role in the global governance on climate action, Markku Markkula, President of the European Committee of the Regions said. The President of the European Committee of the Regions the EUs assembly of local and regional representatives - was speaking during the COP22 Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders which gathered over 1,500 local and regional leaders from across the globe. During his speech, President Markkula said that though the Paris climate agreement set a 2C warming limit, current commitments will see global temperatures increase by more than 3C by the turn of the century. ""Climate change is a matter that goes beyond politics, across borders and is not something you can bargain with. All nations must uphold their climate commitments, take the necessary steps to ensure the sustainable transition of territories worldwide and go further, faster. We must aim to have a carbon-neutral world by 2050"", added President Markkula. Local and regional authorities have a central role in delivering climate action, being responsible for executing around 70% of climate change reduction measures and up to 90% of climate adaptation actions. Climate initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors will soon be the largest coalition of cities and regions, demonstrate that local governments surpass national government targets. This is critical in reaching the Paris objectives. ""Cities and regions are key in bridging the gap between climate commitments and objectives"", said Francesco Pigliaru, President of Sardinia who led the Committees report 'Delivering the global climate agreement a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakech '. ""We expect the climate talks to result in a global climate governance that formalises a permanent dialogue between cities and regions, national governments and UN bodies. It needs to show how binding targets will be monitored while closely tracking progress through common assessment mechanisms. We urgently need to integrate cities and regions cuts in greenhouse gas emissions within National Determined Contributions (NDCs)"", concluded Pigliaru. Half of the worlds population live in urban areas with cities emitting as much as half of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. According to the World Bank, adapting to climate change could cost $80 to $100 billion per year, 80% of which needs to be invested in cities in order to keep global warming under 2C. Yet todays financing landscape does not provide local and regional authorities with suitable financial opportunities and the right technical support to develop climate projects. During the Summit, cities and regions set out recommendations to mobilise financial flows for locally-tailored climate projects: from increasing the volume of climate-compatible assets to further channelling direct-access to finance through public-private partnerships, creating financial hubs and supporting carbon pricing to boost low-carbon projects. \"

Nuclear techniques can be used to both mitigate and help adapt to the consequences of climate change. The 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), taking place from 7 to 18 November in Marrakech, provides a platform for countries to present their climate change strategies. ""Nuclear power has already made a significant contribution to avoiding carbon dioxide emissions and it will continue to do so,"" said IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano on 4 November in a statement marking the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, which was concluded last year. In order to assess the impact of climate change on the environment and ecosystems, a precise understanding of what is happening to species at an atomic scale is required. Nuclear science can enable Parties to the UNFCCC to evaluate changes in the carbon cycle and observe the impacts of ocean acidification caused by increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and other stressors on sensitive marine ecosystems and species. ""Nuclear and isotopic techniques make an important contribution to tackling serious environmental challenges such as desertification, soil erosion, pollution and deteriorating water quality,"" Mr Amano said. At COP22 , the IAEA will participate with other United Nations Agencies in side events related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These will include Meeting the 2oC Challenge: Nexus of Innovation and Clean Energy (focusing on SDG7 on affordable and clean energy), Science for informed mitigation and adaptation choices (focusing on SDG17 on partnerships for the goals), and Oceans: Science based solutions for achieving adaptation and mitigation goals (focusing on SDG14 on life below water). An IAEA exhibit will provide information on the Agencys work related to climate change, highlighting recent publications such as Nuclear Power and the Paris Agreement, Nuclear Power and Sustainable Development and Climate Change and Nuclear Power. The IAEA is committed to helping interested Member States to use nuclear science and technology to generate low-carbon electricity for development, and to counter the effects of climate change, Mr Amano said. \"

Among the most significant challenges facing society today is the impacts that global climate change can have on our economies, livelihoods, and lifestyles. The COP21 Agreement coming out of Paris in 2015 calls for all countries to work together towards greenhouse gas reduction commitments that ultimately result in no more than 2 0C, and ideally 1.5 0C warming above preindustrial levels by the end of this century. This is the goal that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established to avoid catastrophic impacts from climate change. However, the current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC's) that form a part of this agreement are an important yet insufficient step to be taken by national governments to achieve this goal. A decarbonized energy sector must be achieved within the next few decades in order to meet this climate challenge. The renewable technologies represented by the REN-Alliance are ready to meet the challenges of the Paris accord, and are already in a position with cost effective and mature technologies to achieve a carbon-free energy system within the necessary time frame called for by the IPCC and as adopted in the Paris agreement to be achieved latest by the year 2050.

Through the presentation of case studies and best practices being undertaken by localities, regions, and communities throughout the world, and the promotion of favorable policies, the REN-Alliance is demonstrating that renewables working together can result in a decarbonized energy systems based on a global 100% renewable energy well before the end of this century, leading to the mitigation of the major environmental challenge of our time. The REN Alliance underlines that a renewable energy supply is not only good for the climate, but offers manifold economic and social benefits, for developing and for industrialized countries alike. Renewable energy technologies are today's cheapest options when comparing new investment - this has been stated by independent organizations like IRENA. Hence, the global transition to a renewable energy future is not any more a financial burden but will enhance economic growth and prosperity in addition to mitigation of climate change. Stefan Gsanger, secretary general of the World Wind Energy Association, said: ""Communities in rural areas especially can benefit tremendously from the global shift towards 100% renewable energy: They may not only cover their own energy needs from local renewable resources, but also become suppliers of urban areas, hence creating new income opportunities for themselves. This will boost rural areas in industrialized and in particular in the so-called developing countries."" Dr David Renne, president of the International Solar Energy Society (ISES), said: ""Renewables working together in island settings can achieve complete energy independence and security for these communities by eliminating the need for expensive imported diesel fuel."" Remigijus Lapinskas, president of the World Bioenergy Association (WBA), said: ""Bioenergy enables us to create jobs in rural areas, improve the ecological situation in the cities, strengthen the security of supply, national energy independence and could be developed in the regional level leading to cooperation in science, technology and business."" Richard Taylor, chief executive of the International Hydropower association, said: ""The information presented at today's event demonstrates the power of renewable technologies working together. Depending on the available renewable resources, we need to combine the positive characteristics of each technology to deliver robust and reliable systems, including renewable storage. Governments, investors and lenders need to take a systems approach to increase the rate of progress."" Marietta Sander, executive director of the International Geothermal Association, said: ""The regional geothermal development approach through the African Rift Geothermal Facility, the African Regional Geothermal Association and a regional technical assistance project through UNEP works really well in the East African countries.""

She disclosed that the Mount Coffee Hydro Power Plant will be commissioned on December 2016 - follow by electricity supply. According to a dispatch, the Liberian leader was speaking at the Africa Action Summit, held on the side lines of COP22hosted in the Royal Palace in Marrakech with over 40 African heads of state and Governments including Ministers in attendance at the invitation of King Mohammed VI of Morocco. She told the Summit that Liberia, like most of West Africa is not only threatened by climate change but now feel the effects of climate change because according to her excessive rainfall, draught, erosion from raising seas, flood and danger to animals, changing farming systems, displacement of population, particularly women farmers are disadvantaged She added that: Liberia has developed a climate change policy with the view to creating resilience while equally addressing national development priorities in a sustainable way. President Sirleaf told the gathering that Liberia is one of the major forest countries in Africa and as such Liberias contributions to addressing climate change is critical. She said threat to Liberias coastline, with serious risks to coastal cities, displacement of populations and loss of major economic benefits must be addressed. Despite these challenges, Liberia has made progress in combating climate change at the national level as manifested through Liberias draft Climate Change Policy, which seeks to strengthen national institutions, communities and initiatives that have a strong capacity for adaptation, mitigation and disaster President Sirleaf underscored. She however, commended King Mohammed VI of Morocco under whose dynamic leadership the Africa Action Summit is being held on the margins of COP22 and acknowledged the crucial role of African leaders in navigating Africa towards the adoption of the milestone Paris Climate Change Agreement. Earlier, in his opening remarks, King Mohammed VI said the Kingdom of Morocco is a committed actor in the task of consolidating regional security and stability. He said Morocco is determined to enhance its contribution to defending the vital interests of the continent, alongside sister nations and, soon, within the African Union. As it implements its ambitious program in the field of renewable energy, Morocco is making its expertise available to its partners he said. King Mohammed said the Kingdom of Morocco is, today, contributing to bringing new partners on board public and private, as well as the structuring governance mechanisms. My country will also lead an African climate expertise network, through the Climate Change Competence Center based in Morocco King Mohammed assert. Touching on the funding provided for in the Paris Agreement as of 2020, he said the Moroccan Presidency is keen to see public funding mobilized, financial arrangements diversified and access to climate funds facilitated. The Africa Action Summit aims to examine the opportunities to achieve a strategy of common influence to the countries of the continent and to counteract the threat of climate change on the planet, which brought together the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ), the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, and the Parties to the Paris Agreement to make the roadmap for the implementation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.

"COP22","India","COP22_India84","Trump as President-elect: World counts on US' moral obligation at COP22","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","IANS-English","Marrakech, Nov 9 -- As the way has been cleared for Republican Donald Trump to become the next US President, delegates attending the COP22 here are counting on the ""moral obligation"" of the new American administration and its commitment to honour the Paris Climate Agreement Trump -- a climate change sceptic -- has threatened to cancel the Paris deal if he cames to power. This would mean the threshold achieved for the Paris Agreement would be jeopardised as America accounts for 17 per cent of the global emissions, the biggest chunk after China. ""Trump will soon be the most powerful person on the earth, but he doesn't have powers to change the physics of climate change, emission or the global warming. If he will not honor the Paris Climate Agreement then it would have a negative impact on his credibility in the world leadership,"" Alden Meyer, Director of Washington's Union of Concerned Scientists, told IANS on the sidelines of a US Climate Action Network event. He further said that the US has a moral responsibility and obligation towards the world. Like it or not, Trump has to honour that anyway, he added. ""The US has a moral responsibility to cope with climate change. Evangelists, religious leaders and many members of the Republican Party are concerned. So, Trump can't simply do as he likes,"" Meyers contended. However, even if Trump opts out of the Paris Climate agreement -- which entered into force on November 4 and became a law at Marrakech -- it would take at least four years for the process, the expert said. ""For years, the US has been accusing China for the climate change. It would be hypocritical if it pulls out the of the Paris agreement action,"" Li Shuo, an observer at COP22 and Policy Advisor of Greenpeace-China, told the media here. He further stated that the Climate Change action plans would not be impacted by the US stand and that Beijing would continue its commitment nonetheless. ""The world shouldn't wait for anyone and it should move on, no matter what. It's important that countries like India and China remain committed to combat global climate change,"" Li told IANS. Katherine Egland of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAAC) ""demanded"" that the Paris agreement be honoured. The experts said Trump has more reasons to ""honor"" the Paris Climate Agreement, not just because of the US obligation to the world but because of his promises to the American people. ""Trump has promised a lot of jobs in the US through clean energy programmes, which means that the private investment has to continue. The President-elect has to recognise this. If he has to grow, he has to grow with the system,"" Meyer said. Clementive Renevia, from the French Ministry of Environment, also said that Trump becoming President would not have any impact on the Paris Climate Agreement. ""Our minster and COP21 President, Segolene Royal, has already said that Trump's becoming the US President will not change anything. I feel that we should keep moving on,"" Renevia told IANS. Shigeru Ushio, a senior official at the Japan's Foreign Minister, told IANS, ""I don't see any dark clouds over Paris Climate Agreement due to Trump becoming the new President, as the US simply can't avoid this treaty.""

"COP22","India","COP22_India85","World must move to scale up actions on climate change, says FAO chief","November 18, 2016","Food & Beverages News","New Delhi, Nov 18 -- The world must rapidly move to scale up actions and ambitions on climate change. This was stated by Jose Graziano da Silva, director general, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), at the United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP22 ) in Marrakech. Speaking at the high-level action day on agriculture and food security, he added that climate change impacts on agriculture (including crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, land and water) were already undermining global efforts to assure food security and nutrition. And the rural poor are the most affected. With over 90 per cent of countries referring to the important role of agriculture in their national plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change, Graziano da Silva said, ""It is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution."" Last year's conference in Paris led to the world's first legally-binding global climate deal. The current summit in Marrakech is geared to implementation of the pledges all signatory countries made. Echoing the prevalent spirit at the COP, the Paris Agreement is irreversible and inaction would be a disaster for the world. Transforming agriculture - Maximising benefits Although agriculture contributes to nearly 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fundamental part of the solution to boost resilience and combat climate change impacts, especially in developing countries where agriculture is often the backbone of the economy. Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities and generate faster, fairer growth, especially for young people. Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services; and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. ""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" said Graziano da Silva, adding, ""Countries are recognising this potential with unprecedented commitments."" ""Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action,"" he added. A concerted push to put agriculture at the centre of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, the event, co-organised by FAO and Morocco's agriculture ministry, is a part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana of France and Hakima El Haite of Morocco, and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals. In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" said Graziano da Silva, adding, ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative."" At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favour for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. ""That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particular,"" Graziano da Silva said, noting that currently only two per cent of climate finance was being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he added. Cost of inaction far outweighs action The world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change. ""For millions of people, our actions can make a difference between poverty and prosperity, and between hunger and food security,"" Graziano da Silva said. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India86","Cabinet gives nod to ratify Doha amendment of Kyoto Protocol","January 24, 2017 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Jan. 24 -- The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval to ratify the Second Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol (the Doha amendment). The second commitment is for enhancing pre-2020 actions till the Paris Agreement comes into operation. The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 2012 and the ratification period began in the beginning of year 2013. So far, 75 countries have ratified the Second Commitment Period. Of the total 192 parties to Kyoto Protocol, 144 ratifications are needed for the amendment to come into force. The Doha amendment was to determine the course of climate action from 2013 (when the First Commitment Period ended) to 2020 after which the Paris Agreement will come into force. The Kyoto Protocol was the first legal treatise to address climate change by cutting down of greenhouse gas emissions. It laid out quantified targets for developed countries to cut down their emissions and asked their developing counterparts to adopt national climate plans, funded by finance and technology transfer from developed countries. Pre-2020 action is one of the most neglected agendas in climate talks. Historical polluters like US, European Union, Canada, Russia, among others, have not yet ratified the second commitment period despite sharp criticism. This shows their lack of seriousness to take up clearly defined climate targets and assume greater responsibility to address climate change, while shifting the focus instead to the implementation of Paris Agreement. What the ratification means for India Although the Paris Agreement is set to come into force soon, ratification of the Doha amendment will give an advantage to India in international climate negotiations. Some months ago, at the COP 22 climate conference, India came under heavy criticism for pushing others to ratify the second commitment period and scale up pre-2020 actions when it had not done so. It even suggested a deadline of April 2017 for all countries to ratify the second commitment period. Implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under the commitment period can attract some investments in India. The country has also been pushing for scaled-up financial and technological commitments from developed countries. Of late, India has been projecting the image of a serious and committed player in climate negotiations. It also ratified the Paris Agreement weeks before COP22 , becoming one of the nations to do it early. This move allowed India to assume a bigger role in framing the rule book of implementation of various elements of the Paris Agreement. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

The Paris Agreement entered into force earlier this month and has so far been ratified by about 110 countries accounting for over three-quarters of the world's carbon emissions. The opening session, though, is only ceremonial in its significance considering that over 80 nations that have signed the agreement are yet to ratify the agreement and the rule book for the functioning of the CMA is yet to be put together or adopted. The symbolic session was convened by the current COP president Salaheddine Mezouar and will conclude on November 16. The CMA is likely to be functional only by 2018 by when all remaining countries should have ratified the agreement and would be able to give inputs to be included in the pending rulebook. The opening ceremony saw addresses from the COP President, the king of Morocco Mohammed VI, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, UN General Assembly president Peter Thompson, the UNFCCC executive secretary Patricia Espinoza, French president Francoise Hollande and philanthropist Laurene Jobs (wife of the late Steve Jobs). Speakers expressed desire to see swift implementation of the agreement and hoped that climate action will be done on the basis of equity keeping in mind humanity's responsibility towards the most vulnerable and the poor who are disproportionately affected by climate impacts. ""We must see that the least developed countries and the small island nations with the most vulnerable populations are provided with the financial and technical resources required by them to tackle climate change impacts,""said Mohammed VI while listing his hopes for the current COP summit. This wish was reiterated by Ban Ki-moon as he hoped that climate action will be implemented with swiftness and special focus on equity and justice. This will be Moon's final COP as the UN Secretary General as he is due to retire before the next summit in 2017. ""I hope that my successor Antonio Guiterrez will support and protect the most vulnerable and poor,"" he said as he announced his absence from the forum next year onwards after 10 years of attendance. But even as the hope for a quick and swift implementation of the agreement was expressed by all speakers, the fear of withdrawal from the agreement of the US was palpable in the addresses. ""The outcome of the Paris agreement will be the true test of the commitments and the credibility of parties,"" said Mohammed VI. Hollande was much more direct. The French president first praised the Obama administration for its effort in bringing the agreement to fruition before hinting that the US will be held accountable in case the incoming administration decides to withdraw from the agreement as the US president-elect Donald Trump has said in the past. ""The agreement is irreversible by law, by fact and in our minds. The US must respect the commitments they have made. It is their duty and responsibility to do so as no country can be sheltered from climate change. France will hold dialogues with the US with openness and respect but also with demands and determination,"" he said. Over the past few days speculation about a possible US withdrawal from the agreement under Trump has been growing louder. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

According to a dispatch from Marrakech, Morocco, President Sirleaf made the remarks on Tuesday, November 15, 2016 in Marrakech, Morocco - when she delivered statement when she address the Twenty Second Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ), the 12th Conference of the Parties Serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 12) and The 1st Conference of The Parties Serving As The Meeting of The Parties to The Paris Agreement (CMA 1). The Liberian leader said: If nothing is done to mitigate the negative impact and its vulnerability, the gains made by mankind could be seriously undermined if not reversed. Liberia, she said continues to experience severe impacts of climate change due to erratic rainfall, flooding and sea erosion. She told the gathering that more than 70% of Liberias population relies on agriculture for subsistence livelihood while the sector also contributes almost 39% to the countrys GDP. Recent predictions she noted indicate that the sector will be heavily impacted thus posing a risk to the economy and livelihood of the population. 2 President Sirleaf said coastal erosion represents a significant threat to Liberias shoreline, with serious risks to coastal cities, displacement of populations and loss of major economic assets. Despite these challenges, we have made progress in combating climate change at the national level as manifested through Liberias draft Climate Change Policy, which intends to strengthen national institutions, communities and initiatives that have a strong capacity for adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction, she indicated. On the mitigation front, she said: We have set aside almost 20% of our national forest as protected area. This serves as a hub for carbon sequestration and protection of our biodiversity which includes threatened and endangered species. She expressed Liberias commitment through its Nationally Determined Contribution - to increase the share of renewable energy through hydro-electricity and solar power. There is still a need to do more, to address Goals One and Two of the SDGs. Touching the regional level, she said the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established a Climate Change Unit within the Agriculture, Environment and Water Resources Department to oversee the implementation of a robust Climate Change Action Program, which aims at reducing vulnerability and the adaptation to climate change in the sub-region. The ECOWAS Authority Chairperson said study shows that large parts of West Africa will be seriously affected by the negative impact of climate change with a strong variability of rainfall, the disappearance of animal and tree species and the recurrence of calamities such as flood, storms and drought. President Sirleaf stressed that athe key priority of our sub-region is the strengthening of capacities to mobilize the much needed resources to implement Member States commitment in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). She said it was pleasing to note that one year after the signing of the Paris Agreement, 11 of the 15 countries in ECOWAS have ratified the Agreement; Liberia being the 12th. President Sirleaf observed that pledges made so far under the Paris Agreement are insufficient to achieve targets for reducing global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius. We therefore call for speedy actions to implement the Paris Agreement to address global environmental challenges, to support developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national adaptation plans, the development of gender action plans in the agriculture sector and the acquisition of climate change technology, she added. She called on delegates to go forward from Marrakesh with renewed determination and collective will to harmonize our approaches for implementation of the Paris Agreement in order to respond to the challenges of climate change and make this world a better place for current and future generations. Earlier, President Sirleaf thanked, His Majesty and the people of the Kingdom of Morocco for graciously hosting the first historic UN Climate Conference after the coming into force of the Paris Agreement especially the warm reception and courtesies accorded the Liberian delegation. She also congratulated the President of UN Climate Change on his election as President of COP 22 and expressed confidence and optimism in his leadership that the outcomes of Marrakech will provide a comprehensive plan of action for implementation of the Paris Agreement. She however thanked the outgoing President of COP 21 under whose stewardship the Paris Agreement was consummated and acknowledged the pivotal role of the UN Secretary General, BAN Ki-moon in steering the world towards the adoption of the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement. \"

Kirill Komarov, First Deputy CEO for Corporate Development and International Business of ROSATOM State Corporation spoke about the role of nuclear power in achieving objectives of Paris Agreements and its benefits that prevent emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere. ""We promote in Russia and abroad NPPs based of VVER technology which is safe, mature and one of the most referenced globally. Our recent project is the 6th unit of Novovoronezh NPP that was put into operation in August this year in Russia. We are proud that today it is the first and the only successfully implemented project of NPP of so called Generation 3+ . So, thanks to VVER designed NPPs built in the world 15 Gt. of CO2 hadnt been emitted globally. Such volume of ??2 could be emitted by 40 coal TPPs of 1 GWe (each) during 60 years. The current contribution of nuclear to low carbon electricity generation in Russia is 48%. It is our contribution to the low-carbon future of the planet"". He also noted that nuclear industry bears heavy responsibility: ""We must have safe NPPs and effective system of management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. ROSATOMs latest innovations including closed nuclear fuel cycle on fast-neutrons technologies, REMIX fuel and Gen. 3+ reactors with the first reactor of this type put in operation in Russia allow to cope with these tasks successfully. The event was attended by H.E. Dr. Hakima El Haite, Minister Delegate in Charge of Environment at the Ministry of Energy, Mining, Water and Environment of Morocco.

Earlier this day a press-conference with Kirill Komarov and Agneta Rising, Director General of the World Nuclear Association took place on the sidelines of COP22 . The press-conference focused on the role of nuclear energy in achieving objectives of Paris Agreements and global reduction of CO2 emissions. In particular, Mrs. Rising noted: ""Because the Paris Agreement calls on countries to have greater ambition we believe it is vital that we aim to decarbonise the electricity generation sector by 2050, with nuclear energy working in harmony with other low carbon forms of generation. Parties should follow Russias example today and give an equal emphasis to nuclear as a solution as they do to other mitigation options - she added. Mr. Komarov emphasized that atomic energy and renewables can't be set against each other. ""We are sure that the future of the energy industry is in diversified balance of low-carbon technologies that provide price affordability, safety of deliveries and minimum impact on the environment"". In proof of his words Mr. Komarov told about current ROSATOM projects in wind power generation. The total amount of investments made by ROSATOM here exceeds 1 billion Euro. \"

UNESCO will showcase education for climate change awareness and resilience through side-events and two new publications. The top feature of the day will be a high-level panel debate entitled EducationA key driver to scale-up climate action (1.15pm to 2.45pm, Pacific Room, Blue Zone), in which UNESCOs Director-General Irina Bokova, HRH Princess Lalla Hasnaa of Morocco, President of the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection, Rachid Benmokhtar Benabdallah, Minister of National Education and Vocational Training of Morocco, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Patricia Espinosa and a number of education ministers, will examine ways for education to enhance the implementation of the climate agenda and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs, which describe greenhouse gas emissions reductions agreed under the UNFCCC). At this occasion, UNESCO will launch Action for Climate Empowerment, new guidelines for policy makers developed in partnership with UNFCCC on ways to mobilize education, training and public awareness to combat climate change,. Responding to climate change must start with each of us, with the ways we think and act, our attitudes and behaviour, said Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO. This begins on the benches of schools and calls for new approaches to learning, driven by political will and resources to reorient education systems towards sustainability. The panel discussion will be preceded by a press conference from 12.30pm to 1pm (Rabat Room, Blue Zone) to launch the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Reports new publication, PLANET: Education for environmental sustainability and green growth. The publication shows how education can help shift peoples behaviour to a more sustainable way of living. Curricula could better support this change as in half the countries of the world fail to contain clear mention of climate change or environmental sustainability. We can all learn from the environmental lessons embedded within indigenous cultures, said Aaron Benavot, Director of the GEM Report. School curricula need to be rethought and redesigned to nurture critical and empowered citizens. This means reconsidering the way we teach, renewed focus on training teachers to ensure they understand climate change and its implications before they stand in front of a classroom. PLANET shows that lifelong learning in the workplace and in communities has a crucial role to play in changing attitudes and finding new solutions to environmental problems as many of todays adults were educated before climate change became an issue. Other UNESCO-supported events on 14 November include a roundtable on the role of educators (5pm to 6.30pm, Room 7, Green Zone) and an event on the specific needs of vulnerable groups in climate change education (6.30pm to 8pm, Pacific Room, Blue Zone). UNESCO will also organize a series of thematic discussions in a dedicated exhibition space (UNESCO Pavilion), on, for example, water education, green skills and initiatives from UNESCOs Associated Schools Project Network (ASPnet). It will provide information and publications in the One UN exhibition booth for Sustainable Development Goal 4 (UN Exhibition Hall, Island 13C, Blue Zone). \"

This years climate negotiations followed a year of historic progress: more than 175 nations signing the Paris Agreement on Earth Day 2016, the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, the Paris Agreements entry into force on November 4 -- which was years ahead of schedule -- the U.S. electric sector already meeting the Clean Power Plans 2024 goal for reducing carbon emissions and 2030 target for reducing coal use, and 47 countries from the Climate Vulnerable Forum announcing their commitment to 100 percent clean energy between 2030 and 2050. In response, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune released the following statement: The world came together in Paris to take unprecedented action to tackle the climate crisis, and in Marrakech, we came together to affirm that no individual country or leader has the power to derail that momentum. The Sierra Club is heartened by the committed resolve and continued dedication leaders around the world have shown to meaningful and lasting climate action. Climate leaders, activists, businesses, labor leaders, faith groups, environmental justice advocates, and youth leaders from across the globe convened in Marrakech with the goal of working to avert the worst effects of the climate crisis. In fact, nations are reaffirming their commitments, nearly 50 nations committed to going to 100 percent clean energy, and new research shows the U.S. is already on the path to meet key carbon reduction goals before they are even implemented. It is clear that this progress will not be stopped, even in the face of threats by President-elect Trump. If history has taught us anything, it is that it is the people who have the power to make change possible. We know that it was the power of grassroots activists and everyday citizens that brought us the historic Paris Agreement last December and it is that same power that will move the world forward toward a just and equitable clean energy economy. The Sierra Club and our 2.4 million members and supporters are proud to be a part of that movement, and were as committed as ever to continuing to work with our friends and allies to ensure a safe and stable climate for our communities, our families, and our planet. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India97","MARRAKECH: 'The eyes of the world are upon us,' chair of UN conference says as new round of climate talks opens","November 8, 2016 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 8 (Just Earth News): The United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as ' COP 22 ,' opened on Monday in Marrakech, Morocco, just days after the entry into force of the landmark Paris Agreement which has now been ratified by 100 countries. This conference comes within a climate of hope and of legitimate aspirations for all of humanity, said the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, Salaheddine Mezouar, who was elected on Monday by acclamation as President of COP 22 , formally the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The unprecedented mobilization of the international community and its political will, expressed at the highest levels, have been crowned by the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement. This is unrivaled progress [] and now we must build on this momentum, give tangible meaning to this major step forward through decisions geared towards implementation, he stated. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on 15 November. Before the meeting wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. In his remarks on Monday, Mezouar urged participants to be more ambitious, and stressed that the eyes of the world are on us [] We have a huge responsibility before humanity and we must join forces in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations. We must provide them with the resources to adapt to the disastrous consequences of climate change. Meanwhile, in her remarks, Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, told the opening of the Conference that the rapid entry into force of the Paris accord is a clear cause for celebration, but it is also a timely reminder of the high expectations that are now placed upon us all Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given, she continued, underscoring that: Marrakech is our moment to take forward climate action at the international and national levels as a central pillar of the successful realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is our opportunity to take the next steps towards an inclusive, sustainable path for every man, woman and child. Espinosa underlined key areas in which work needs to be taken forward. She stressed that finance is flowing, but it is not enough. Moreover, nationally determined contributions now need to be integrated into national policies and investment plans. She said support for adaptation needs to be given higher priority, and progress on the loss and damage mechanism has to be ensured to safeguard development gains in the most vulnerable communities. The President of COP 21, which agreed the Paris accord last year, Sgolne Royal, French Minister of Environment, Energy and the Sea, who has passed the baton to Mezouar, welcomed the ratification of the Paris Agreement by 100 countries as of this past Sunday. Its an historic event, she said at a press conference just before the official opening of the COP 22 , where she urged all countries that have not ratified the Paris Agreement to do so, if possible, during the Marrakech Conference and beyond that, by the end of this year. Royal said that the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in December 1997 and aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, took seven years to enter into force. [The clock is ticking] because the year that just ended was the warmest, because the melting of glaciers is accelerating, because desertification is devastating, because the massive urban concentrations call for a new model urban development, she continued. Royal stressed the importance of climate justice, particularly for Africa. Africa is the great challenge of [this Conference]. COP 22 is an African COP, and that is where the priority and hope are, she said. In Africa, climate change is cruel and unfair. The continent suffers the most through no fault of its own. Among the 50 countries which are the most [affected] by global warming, 36 are located in sub-Saharan Africa. Non-governmental organizations present at COP 22 , including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Climate Action Network, also welcomed the entry into force of the Paris Agreement but said at press conferences that there was still a long way to go, particularly in terms of funding and concrete implementation of commitments.

The meeting was convened for parties to articulate their stance regarding climate action within the agriculture sector. Agriculture has by and large only been addressed fleetingly so far by the UNFCCC, but it is slated to take a more central position in climate negotiations in the near future. The agriculture sector in several developing and vulnerable nations around the world has already been affected deeply due to erratic climate and extreme weather events. The opening meeting of the SBSTA commenced with a statement by Egypt on behalf of the G77 group of countries and China. The representative from Egypt highlighted the objectives of strengthening food security and ending hunger as the top priority followed by a need to look at agriculture from a context of adaptation and adaptation co-benefits. The stance of the G77 and China received full support from the Africa group of countries (represented by Malawi), Least Developed Countries (LDCs represented by Gambia) and other nations from Africa and Asia. Developing countries, especially from Africa which has largely been under drought conditions over the past decade, voiced the need to mobilise finance from developed countries, technology transfer and to build capacity and resilience within agriculture to cope with climate change impacts on food security and livelihoods. Developed countries, including the US, too, recognised the need to move towards implementation but a difference in opinion on the specifics was palpable in the stances forwarded. While the EU representative expressed the need to keep adaptation and mitigation in agriculture on equal footing as opposed to focusing more deeply on adaptation, the representatives from Switzerland and Canada stressed on the fact that increasing food productivity should be the main priority. The US highlighted the Climate Technology Centre and Network as a promising initiative in the context of agriculture adaptation and mitigation of climate impacts. As suggested by the US to try and ""achieve some decision or conclusion in Marrakesh"", informal/formal interactions tomorrow onwards will further give shape to negotiations. It is expected that several African countries and other developing nations from Asia and South America will push for strong measures to pursue adaptation with a focus on technology transfer, finance and capacity building within agriculture at the 45th SBSTA meeting during this year's summit.

The event was attended by several African leaders, including Alpha Conde, President of Guinea and African Union Coordinator for Renewable Energy; Faure Gnassingb, President of Togo; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia; Seretse Khama Ian Khama, President of Botswana; and a broad range of stakeholders and partners to give political momentum to Africas needs to implement its commitments. The event took place at the Africa Pavilion an area dedicated entirely to the continent where climate change issues specific to Africa will be showcased. The AfDB, the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the African Union and NEPAD are hosting the Africa Pavilion at COP22 . Adesina stressed that the African Development Bank is doing its part. The Bank has committed to invest US $12 billion in support of accelerating electricity supply in Africa and leverage between $45-50 billion from the private sector. The Bank will work with the African Union and other partners to fast-track the Africa we want: an Africa with universal access to electricity in the next ten years, said Adesina. The Delivery Unit of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative hosted by the Bank is now fully operational. The Bank is also rapidly building up its institutional capacity to deliver on its agenda for Africa. A new Vice-Presidency for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth has been created. Adesina also noted that the lack of electricity drags down Africas growth and development. For decades, Africa has continued to export raw materials. The reason why Africa exports raw unprocessed materials is simple: Africa does not have electricity. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India109","Canada : Governor Brown issues Statement on California Air Resources Board's Draft Plan to achieve 2030 Climate Goals","December 3, 2016 Saturday","TendersInfo","Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today issued the following statement on the California Air Resources Board's initial draft plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 - the most ambitious target in North America. The initial draft plan, released today, builds on the state's successful efforts to reach its more immediate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and outlines the most effective ways to reach the new 2030 goal, including continuing California's Cap-and-Trade program. ""This plan lays out a road map for California - and the rest of the world - to achieve climate goals that were inconceivable only a decade ago,"" said Governor Brown, who established this 2030 target by Executive Order in April 2015 and signed SB 32 in September to codify it. ""There are steep hills ahead, but we'll scale them by continuing to take a series of bold actions, including extending California's Cap-and-Trade Program."" California is playing a world-leading role in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants. In recent weeks, Governor Brown issued a joint release with the governors of Oregon and Washington and the premier of British Columbia reaffirming their commitment to climate action at the close of COP22 . The Governor also announced 29 new members to the Under2 Coalition, an international climate pact formed by California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. A total of 165 jurisdictions have now joined the coalition representing more than a billion people and $25.7 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy. In September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. Over the past year and a half, the Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations. \"

The UAE delegation aims to enhance cooperation with the international community, to find solutions to climate change, in adherence with the international agreement made at COP21 in Paris last year. The UAE delegation is composed of HE Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Waleed Salman, Chairman of the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence (Dubai Carbon), Dr. Yousef Al Akraf, Executive Vice President of Business Support and Human Resources at DEWA, Khawla Al Mehairi, VP of Marketing and Corporate Communications at DEWA, and Mohammed Abdulkarim Al Shamsi, Acting Executive Director of the UAE Water Aid Foundation. Al Tayer noted that the UAEs participation in COP22 adheres to the vision of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to enhance sustainable development and support international efforts, following the agreement made during COP21. This included keeping the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and to limit it to 1.5 C. Our participation in COP22 , and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakesh, has a special importance. We will show the UAEs support for the international communitys efforts to enhance sustainability and green economy, while limiting the increasing effects of climate change. Dubai has a comprehensive vision for a sustainable future which is pivotal to the success of building a green economy. The Dubai Supreme Council of Energy has participated in a number of international events. The UAE delegation played a vital role in the negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement in 2015, and the Dubai Declaration 2016. Through COP22 , we are continuing our efforts to highlight our means of dealing with climate change, through leading clean and renewable energy projects and initiatives, said Al Tayer. DEWA has become a role model in the UAE, and in the eyes of the international community, as a result of its excellence in efficiency, corporate performance, and initiatives that contribute towards achieving the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, to provide 7% of Dubais energy from clean sources by 2020, 25% by 2030 and 75% by 2050, and the Demand Side Management Strategy, to decrease energy and water demand by 30% by 2030. Dubai is the only city in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to launch such a promising strategy, with specific targets and deadlines that outline the future of energy up to 2050. Through the Dubai Carbon Abatement Strategy 2021 to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021, Dubai strives to become the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world. One of the major projects that we will highlight during COP22 , is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is the largest single-site solar park in the world with a planned capacity to produce 5,000 megawatts (MW) by 2030. It will help achieve a reduction of approximately 6.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, added Al Tayer. DEWA has launched a number of initiatives to support the Smart Dubai initiative, which was launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to make Dubai the smartest and the happiest city in the world. This includes the Shams Dubai initiative, which encourages building owners to install photovoltaic panels on their rooftops to generate electricity form solar power. The electricity is used onsite and the surplus is exported to DEWAs network. The Green Charger to establish the infrastructure and build electric vehicle charging stations in Dubai. As part of Dubais efforts to support the international community, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched during the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) 2016, as well as the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO), with the support of the Government of Dubai, and in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The organisation will also serve as a platform for climate change mitigation solutions, sustainable energy, and other water-related and environmental resources around the world, continued Al Tayer. We will continue our efforts to enhance sustainable development in the UAE and the world, to find the best solutions to energy uses, to sustain our resources, and manage the increasing demand for energy, concluded Al Tayer. The UAE was one of the first countries in the international community to support tackling the growing issue of climate change. The UAE is also one of the first nations to have endorsed the extension of the Kyoto protocol in 2005, to limit greenhouse gases in industrial countries, in addition to being the first country in the region to sign the Copenhagen Accord to limit emissions, at COP15. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India113","Morocco : Morocco hosts First African Forum on Housing and Urban Development, ahead of Habitat III and COP22","July 14, 2016 Thursday","TendersInfo","The Kingdom of Morocco, represented by the Ministry of Habitat and City Policy organised the first African Ministerial Forum on Housing and Urban Development (AMFHUD) on 11-12 May 2016, in Rabat under the theme: City Policies and Sustainable Development. Jointly organized with UN-Habitat, the Forum aimed at complementing, on a global scale, the preparatory process leading to Habitat III: The third UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development to be held in Quito, Ecuador (17-21 October 2016). It was also meant to contribute, on a regional scale, in addressing the issue of cities and their development and sustainability in Africa. The Forum gave Morocco and the African continent, represented by 17 ministerial delegations, an opportunity to showcase their approach towards the New Urban Agenda, to be adopted by the international community at Habitat III, and to promote the post-2015 Agenda spelt out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 11: Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable . The event also tackled the issue of city sustainability, while keeping an eye on climate change, as per the recommendations of COP21 (Paris, December 2015) and in preparation of COP22 , which Morocco will be hosting in November 2016. The inauguration of the event was presided over by H.E the Prime Minister of Morocco, Abdelihah Benkiran; the Moroccan Minister of Housing and Urban Policy, Hon. Nabil Ben Abdallah; the Mayor of the City of Dakar, Khalifa Sall and Dr. Joan Clos, United Nations Under-Secretary-General/UN-Habitat Executive Director and Secretary General of Habitat III. In his opening remarks, Dr. Clos thanked His Majesty the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, for organising and hosting a crucial event for the future of Morocco, Africa and the world. He also said that This forum, five months ahead of Habitat III and COP22 , is a great opportunity to enrich the current global debate over sustainable urban development and climate change, in an unprecedented moment for urbanisation. For the first time in the history of development, the international community has understood that urbanisation is a source and engine for growth and a driving force for development. Dr. Clos also highlighted Moroccos experience of the cement tax used for financing public housing to be encouraged worldwide and showcased in Habitat III as an excellent example in Urban Economy. Discussions revolved around rapid urbanisation of the African continent. Africa is now experiencing an accelerated urban transformation, with over a billion inhabitants in 2009, 400 million of whom are living in cities. By 2030, 50% of Africans will be living in urban areas.With 12 additional cities of more than 3 million inhabitants, and 2 cities of over 10 million, Africa is now facing poverty urbanization. Indeed, 60% of urban population are living in informal housing, which is the main component of major habitats in most cities and megacities like Cairo, Lagos, Kinshasa, Luanda and Abidjan. Two thirds of the total population of Africa (2.5 billion) will be living in cities fifty years from now. In other words, the urban population will have increased four-fold by then. During the opening ceremony, Dr. Clos and Hon. Nabil Benabdallah signed the Host Country Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and UN-Habitat. This was the culmination of 20 years of effective partnership between Morocco and UN-Habitat. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India114","COP 22: Now begins the fun","October 12, 2016 Wednesday","Business Line","Chennai, Oct. 12 -- The global movement for climate change mitigation crossed a key milestone on October 7. The Paris Agreement formally 'entered into force', after 55 countries with cumulative emissions accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions ratified the Agreement, whose text was agreed upon at the Conference of Parties-21 meeting at Paris last December. All parties and observers have noted with glee that this 'entry into force' has happened a lot quicker than earlier expected, an indication that there is political will to do something about climate change. As this paper has pointed out earlier, the 'Agreement' is more a consensus that increase in global warming has to be limited to 2 degrees (above circa 1850 levels). Towards this end, countries voluntarily committed to doing what they put on the table as 'intended nationally determined contributions', or INDCs. For instance, India has said it would bring down emission intensity of GDP by 30 per cent over 2005 levels and 40 per cent of India's electricity generating capacity in the year 2030 will be non-fossil fuel based. Other countries said they would do other things. While many have hailed the Paris Agreement as ""historic"", others have laughed at it. Prof James E Hansen of Columbia University, a former NASA scientist, has described it as ""worthless words"". Because, if a country does not do what it said it would, there is no provision to enforce due performance, except shaming it in public. But even that is not possible, because many countries have allowed themselves sufficient wriggle room in their INDC promises. India, for example, has said that its aim to have 40 per cent of installed power capacity based on non-fossil fuels would take place ""with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance."" Furthermore, even assuming all countries do everything they promised, earth's temperature will still rise by 2.7 degrees-a significant deviation from the target. The food on the table is not enough to satisfy hunger. Anyway, the Paris Agreement was like the birth of a baby, and now, a year down the line, the baby has to begin to walk. The first baby-steps are expected to be taken at COP-22 , which will be held in November in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. And that's where the real fight begins. The Marrakech meeting will be more important than Paris. Here is where 'modalities, procedures, guidelines' - MPG - will be evolved for countries to meet their 'nationally determined contributions' (the word 'intended' has been dropped after the agreement at Paris.) Discussions will revolve around mobilising finance, technology transfers, developing carbon markets, global stock-take (of a five-yearly review of progress) and so on, each of which is contentious. Jo Tyndall of New Zealand, who co-chairs the Ad-hoc working group on Paris Agreement (APA), cautions that ""while political heat has been turned down, the fault lines that existed before Paris have not gone away."" Since Marrakech conference is 'getting down to business', these fault lines will be even starkly visible. ""The hardest work is ahead to turn the transformational promise of the Paris Agreement into reality,"" say experts at the World Resources Institute, in a recent article. Funds is the key For COP-22 COP-22 , and one might expect considerable heat when that happens. The Paris Agreement (Article 15) speaks of a ""facilitative"" compliance mechanism. (""We don't know what that means,"" says Jo Tyndall.) The mechanism shall also be ""non-adversarial and non-punitive"". At the heart of 'compliance' is a system that measures, verifies and reports whether each country has been as good as its word. COP-22 will begin the process of evolution of such a mechanism - not an easy task, because countries (including India) baulk at outsiders checking out on them. The COP-22 India flexing its muscles India, for one, has made it clear that it is not in a mood to take things lying down at Marrakech. In a statement issued on October 1, a day before it would ratify the Paris Agreement, the Indian government forthrightly expressed its disappointment over the flow of climate funds. The statement notes that the $ 10.3 billion committed to the Green Climate Fund cumulatively in the last six years, (in contrast with the aim of reaching annual commitments of $ 100 billion by 2020,) ""does not match the enormous finance and technology requirements indicated by developed countries in their INDCs."" The statement further stressed the need to remove barriers to access green technology and provision of finance to meet the costs of cutting-edge technology. The message is simple. If, for example, India wants access to a technology of a superconducting wind turbine generator, which GE has developed, to help it ramp up its renewable energy roll-out, GE should give the technology, and the developed countries should pay for it. Regardless of whether India is justified or not, only a simpleton would expect developed countries to play ball. India is bent on holding developed countries to account, at COP-22 . ""People in developed countries live extravagant lifestyles with high carbon footprint,"" the statement says - something that is likely to resonate with the thinking in many other developing countries. Thus, some tough negotiations are ahead at the African city. Don't forget that any country can still walk out of the Agreement after three years. So, if President Donald Trump dislikes the deal, he only needs to wait out the period. Delivering the Paris baby might have been without much labour pain. But raising it to adulthood is not likely to be easy. \"

Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, Excellency's, Distinguished delegates,Ladies and gentlemen  At the outset, let me convey my delegation's appreciation to the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Morocco for hosting this important Conference and for the warm hospitality extended to us. Let me also convey the best wishes of my President H.E. Maithripala Sirisena.  This Conference is significant as it takes place just days after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on the 4th of November.  As an island nation, Sri Lanka is deeply conscious of the impacts of Climate Change. In fact, we are facing its adverse impacts already in the form of droughts, unprecedented and rising temperature, floods, unseasonal rain, and coastal erosion. Mr. President,  Sri Lanka became party to the Paris Climate Agreement in September this year, and we are pleased that the world's largest economies have become party to this historic Agreement. Their support is needed more than ever for countries around the world to be able to address the threat of climate change which threatens life on this ONE Planet that all of us, rich, poor, small or large, have, to share, and call home.  Our commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement is our best hope to limit rising temperatures that would otherwise have devastating consequences for future generations.  Sri Lanka, for its part, has taken several initiatives. A National Climate ChangePolicy, and aNational Climate Change Adaptation Strategyhave been formulated; and a high-level coordination body led by the President has been setup to align our policies with our international commitments on environmental issues. The portfolio of Environment is held by the President himself to ensure commitment, action and guidance at the highest level of Government, in fact Sri Lanka has launched several climate smart initiatives including implementing sound sustainable energy development programs and reduction of GhG emissions in five main sectors. I.E. Energy, Transport, Industry, Forest and Waste. We have also recently launched a project to conserve mangrove forests which are seen as vital resources for mitigating the effects of climate change. The President of Sri Lanka, even prior to the ratification of the Paris agreement launched the ""Sri Lanka next - Blue Green Era"" program last December to demonstrate our commitment to the agreement.  Technology transfer from the developed to developing countries is vital in the quest to combat Climate Change. Sri Lanka therefore adds its voice to those of other developing nations to urge greater access to finance including from the Green Climate Fund. Mitigation and adaptation financing and capacity building are essential and urgent.  Moreover, higher GHG emitters must assist developing countries struggling to meet development needs.  The world today is more conscious than ever that collective action is required to combat Climate Change and meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.  I hope that we sustain the momentum and commitment achieved last year through the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, to stay the course required to address the challenges before us collectively with due diligence and responsibility. \"

Finland and the Netherlands were welcomed as the most recent members to join this global effort to double clean energy R&D. In addition, a number of innovation challenges were launched to target development of energy technologies that will accelerate the clean energy transition. Finland and the Netherlands joined Mission Innovation, increasing the total member country count to 23, including the European Union. The member governments represent more than 80 percent of global clean energy investment, and have pledged to double their clean energy research and development funding over five years to around $30 billion (USD) per year in 2021. This commitment to clean energy R&D will help drive steep cost reductions in clean energy, expand job creation for member countries, and deliver breakthrough technologies that will allow for increased global ambition to reduce carbon emissions that keep temperature rise below the dangerous level of 2 degrees Celsius. Mission Innovation participants are signaling their understanding that our global energy economy is going to be a low-carbon energy economy, said U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. Commitment to Mission Innovation means that these countries want to create jobs for their people, and also build more low-cost, broadly deployable clean energy options. Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete welcomed Finland and The Netherlands to the initiative, adding ""Through its partnership, Mission Innovation represents an unprecedented acceleration of research and development of clean energy technologies, which will bring sustainable energy to people all over the world.

"COP22","India","COP22_India120","MARRAKECH: Countries at UN conference pledge to press ahead with implementation of Paris Agreement","November 19, 2016 Saturday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 19 (Just Earth News): As they wrapped up their work on Friday in Marrakech, Morocco, countries gathered at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 22 ), pledged on Friday to move forward on the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which entered into force two weeks ago. In the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development, State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), affirmed their commitment to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. They welcomed the extraordinary momentum on climate change worldwide. As of Friday 19 November, 111 countries have ratified the Agreement. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. This momentum is irreversible it is being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels, adds the Proclamation. Our task now is to rapidly build on that momentum, together, moving forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Negotiations between State-Parties were continuing on Friday afternoon on aspects of the implementation of the Agreement. We continue to negotiate on a number of things, said the President of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, at a press conference. Welcoming the outcome of the Conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, he noted, saying that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. In a statement issued by his spokesperson in New York, Ban applauded the bold leadership shown by many of the worlds most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. As the global thermostat continues to rise, the Secretary-General renewed his call for all countries and all sectors of society to significantly increase their ambition and redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said the statement, adding that the UN chief also called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. The Marrakech Proclamation calls for the highest political commitment to combat climate change and calls for strong solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, underscoring the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability. State-Parties also call for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries. In the Marrakech Proclamation, developed country reaffirmed their $100 billion mobilization goal per year by 2020 to support climate action by developing countries. All countries also called on all non-state actors to join them for immediate and ambitious action and mobilization, building on their important achievements. Alongside the negotiations, the two-week Marrakech Conference focused on various actions and initiatives taken by Governments and non-state actors to address climate change. On Thursday, the Conference launched the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action Agenda to further scale up cooperative efforts in which businesses, sub-national and local governments and civil society team up with national governments to promote low-emission and resilient development. We need everyone, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday, urging society-wide engagement in implementation of Paris climate accord.

"COP22","India","COP22_India121","United Arab Emirates : Coalition for advancing low carbon fuels launched at COP22","November 21, 2016 Monday","TendersInfo","A massive scale-up in renewable energy deployment is vital to fully decarbonize the global energy system by 2050, which is required to meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and keep global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius. At the COP22 Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Morocco, a 20-country coalition launched a new initiative to help decarbonize the transport and industry sectors through modern, sustainable low-carbon biofuels as alternatives to fossil fuels. The Biofuture Platform aims to contribute to the global fight against climate change, nurturing solutions that can help countries reach their Nationally Determined Contribution, as well as to contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The 20-country coalition comprises of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Netherlands, Morocco, Mozambique, Paraguay, Philippines, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States of America and Uruguay. The platform aims to address the challenges of scaling up a sustainable bioeconomy by promoting international collaboration in policy dialogue; research and development; and by facilitating an enabling environment for advanced low-carbon fuel and bioeconomy-related investments. The Launch Statement endorsed by the countries states that the initiative will also involve the private sector, other stakeholders and initiatives in a flexible operating model. As we move to meet our goals for climate action and sustainable development, international cooperation, as exemplified by this platform, will only grow further in importance, said IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin at the launch event hosted by the government of Brazil. By working together through the Biofuture Platform, we can build a world where biofuels make a strong contribution to meeting these goals, bringing us closer to a sustainable energy future, said Mr. Amin. The initiative stems from the urgent need for sustainable, immediately scalable solutions to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. While the energy transition is well underway in the power sector, the greatest challenge we face now is to address end-use sectors like carbon-intensive industries and transportation, said Dolf Gielen, Director of IRENAs Innovation and Technology Centre in Bonn. Transportation is the sector that has so far been one of the most challenging for mitigation and low carbon fuels are proving to be a viable alternative to reduce carbon intensity in the sector. In face of the urgency of fighting climate change, countries cannot afford to ignore the largely underestimated potential of bioenergy, especially in face of new technological developments which are opening the door to a whole new low-carbon bioeconomy as an alternative to fossil-based fuels, chemicals and materials, said the Minister of Environment of Brazil, Mr. Sarney Filho, who opened the launch event. IRENA has recently released the Innovation Outlook: Advanced Liquid Biofuels which shows pathways to enhance the economics and market potentials. The second in the Innovation Outlook series reveals a global outlook for advanced liquid biofuel technology. It provides a detailed overview of the promising technological developments for commercialised advanced biofuel production to the year 2045. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India122","Farmer groups raise concerns about solutions proposed at COP 22","December 2, 2016 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 2 -- Participants from more than 196 countries attended the recently concluded 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakech, Morocco. COP 22 was projected as ""Action COP"" and there were expectations that significant progress will take place on issues related to agriculture. However, there was shadow of Donald Trump's victory on COP 22 and concrete actions remained elusive. Climate negotiators acknowledged serious concerns related to food security and agriculture Almost no progress was made on issues related to agriculture at the COP 22 . However, all parties in Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) meetings prior to COP 22 had noted that agriculture and food production are highly vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change, particularly in developing countries. The parties have different national circumstances but all face various impacts of a changing climate. They have also reported specific climate change impacts on agriculture observed in their countries, particularly the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, including temperature stress (increasing day/night temperature, heat stress, extreme cold) and changes in rainfall patterns (fluctuating average annual precipitation, short and heavy rainfall leading to flooding and landslides, erratic rainfall leading to droughts and progressive drying of land, and periodical water shortages). Recognising that the national-level information is often incomplete, the parties mentioned that the impacts of climate change on agriculture will continue to have significant implications for rural development, sustainable development and food security. It can lead to reduction of the GDP. There is also uncertainty over dearth of information on the impact of climate change on animal production segment and fisheries. Farmer groups not happy Under these circumstances, several civil society protests took place in Marrakech, parallel to the COP 22 . Besides slow progress of climate negotiation, farmer groups and activists were seriously concerned about the solution being proposed for agriculture sector and farming communities. They strongly advocated that farmers' voices should be taken into consideration, while taking any decision on issues related to agriculture and farmers. Concerns raised by farmer activists Fisherfolk in Indonesia are being impacted adversely by the changing climate. They mostly depend on traditional knowledge to forecast weather and making correct prediction has become difficult now. The change in weather is unpredictable but the government does not provide an access to the weather information data easily, says Marthin Hadiwinata of Traditional Fisherfolk Union of Indonesia. He further adds that climate adaptation measures, which need to be taken urgently by the government, are not being implemented seriously. The small-scale fisherfolk, who form the majority, cannot provide stable income to their families and have become poorer. Jean Baptiste Roux, a farmer and member of Confederation Paysanne, a farmer union in France, opposes industrialisation of agriculture and wants to promote small farmers. According to him, climate negotiators at COP 22 don't hear their voice and they propose false solutions of climate change, which promote industries and corporations instead of small farmers. Roux also raises serious doubts about the effectiveness of proposed solutions like climate smart agriculture. Demanding climate justice, Dharmendra Malik of Bhartiya Kisan Union, a farmer organisation in India, says that farmers in India are among the worst impacted by climate change. ""We are now dealing with unseasonal rainfall, droughts and floods more often. However, we have to still see some concrete action for farming communities from recently concluded climate negotiations,"" adds Malik. ""Farmers in Palestine are facing serious water shortage and not allowed to use most of the water resources as these are not in control of farmers in Palestine,"" says Aghsan Barghoulthi of Unio of agricultural work committees (UAWC), Palestine. She further adds that rivers are becoming dry as water availability is being impacted by climate change and also being taken away by big corporations of Israel. Political conflicts in Palestine have adversely impacted agriculture and farmers. Farmers are not able to fight changing climate and meet water requirements for agriculture. Jaron Browne, National Organizer at Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, calls for returning powers to small-scale farmers and rejecting bio-fuels, climate smart agriculture concept and other false solutions pushed by people with vested interests. ""Food sovereignty is the way forward. We have to put the power of food producers back into the hands of food producers, farmers, workers, indigenous people and communities,"" concludes Browne.

The Director of the Company and Climate Foundation, Elvira Carles, explained the conclusions reached at the COP22 in Marrakesh from a political point of view. She also reviewed the status of the Paris Agreement ratifications undertaken by each country and the preparation of specific National Mitigation Plans. The physicist from the Complutense University of Madrid and Member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of 2013, Jesus Fidel Gonzalez Rouco, presented scientific evidence of global warming and explained that the first six months of 2016 were the warmest on record since 1880. He also said that the concentrations of greenhouse gases are now higher than those seen in the last 800,000 years. Jesus Fidel Gonzalez Rouco explained that, in order to mitigate these effects, greenhouse gas emissions will need to be reduced substantially. The Director-General of the Spanish Climate Change Bureau, Valvanera Ulargui, spoke about the economic issues present in the climate change negotiations and, more specifically, the problems in financing climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in poorer countries. She also spoke about the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) and its future. The Director of the Centre for Sustainability Studies at BNP Paribas Asset Management, Helena Vines, explained how the climate agreements affect business investment. Specifically, she provided the recent examples of investment projects in various parts of the world that are considering their impact on action against climate change as a key factor for their acceptance or rejection. The Assistant Secretary-General of the Union for the Mediterranean, Jorge Borrego, focused his presentation on the importance of regional cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean region for tackling climate change. The countries of Africa are among the most vulnerable to climate change, but are also the poorest. Jorge Borrego explained that the intergovernmental organisation Union for the Mediterranean, which encompasses 43 countries in the region, could play an important role in supporting the global climate programme. Finally, the Director for Sustainability, Technology and Outlooks of the International Energy Agency, Kamel Ben Naceur, spoke about the technology development and implementation strategy in the field of energy; technologies that are necessary to enable the targets set by the United Nations against climate change to be reached.

The historic event comes less than a year after the landmark agreement was adopted and just days ahead of the UN climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco. The Vice-President in charge of the Energy Union, Maro ef?ovi? said: ""Today's entry into force of the Paris Agreement, less than a year after its adoption, shows one thing: that the entire world shares a pressing sense of urgency when it comes to fighting climate change. Inaction is not an option; slowing down is not our course of action. We are ready to seize this momentum to speed up work on the clean energy transition, in our Union and globally. We are ready to work at all levels, including the local level, to bring the benefits of this transition to our citizens."" Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Caete said: ""This is a great day for Europe and for the planet. I am delighted that the EU's ratification has enabled the Paris Agreement to enter into force in time for our meeting in Marrakech. We must maintain this extraordinary momentum by encouraging countries to continue ratifying the deal, and by moving full steam ahead with our preparations to put it into action across the world. Marrakech will be about action and implementation. It's time for results."" The annual United Nations climate change conference will take place from 7 to 18 November 2016 in Bab Ighli, Marrakech. Following the rapid entry into force of the global climate deal, the first meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1) will also open during the conference. The Marrakech conference aims to demonstrate that the shift to a global low-carbon economy is underway, and act as a catalyst for further action. As the global climate agreement has entered into force much earlier than expected, the EU is keen to move rapidly on the international framework to help countries put in place the policies and measures to deliver on their Paris pledges. This means that the work programme established in Paris, and started in Bonn earlier this year, must advance as swiftly as possible, while keeping participation open to all countries regardless of whether they are still ratifying the Agreement. The EU expects to see tangible progress on key elements of the Paris package, including on access to finance for developing countries and on developing and strengthening the skills and processes needed in developing countries to implement their domestic climate plans. The EU and its Member States are the biggest contributors of public climate finance to developing countries. Together they provide around a third of public funding available for action to tackle climate change and account for almost half of the pledges in the Green Climate Fund. COP 22 will have a strong focus on strengthening climate action before 2020, when most of the national climate action plans put forward by countries in the run up to Paris start. The high-level event on global climate action on 17 November and the thematic action days being held throughout the conference offer an opportunity to reflect on progress made on existing initiatives as well as for announcements of new initiatives. The EU will be represented in Marrakech by Lszl Slymos, Minister of Environment for Slovakia, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, and Miguel Arias Caete, EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy. Events during COP 22 The EU strongly supports the Global Climate Action Agenda aimed at catalysing multi-stakeholder action. A series of events has been organised around themes, for example, the role of forests, transport, buildings and renewable energy in the fight against climate change. The EU will host more than 100 events at the EU Pavilion (see link below). These events, organised by a wide variety of organisations from Europe and the rest of the world, will address a broad range of climate-related issues from the energy transition and long term strategies to deforestation and innovative climate finance. \"

The 12-day 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) will be held at Marrakech in Morocco, which begins on November 7. At the COP 21 in Paris, Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reached an agreement to combat climate change and accelerate and intensify actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. As for Botswana it can be highlighted that, 'Over the years, the country has experienced significant increases in GHGs emissions from 3292 Giga grams (Gg) Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) to 8303 Gg CO2 eq. between 1990 and 2010. Most of the emissions are mainly due to an accelerated growth in private vehicles ownership from the UK and Asian markets and expansion of the transformation facility (Morupule Power Station) for electricity generation.' The former minister of Minerals Energy and Water Resources (MMEWR), Kitso Mokaila, recently appealed to the European Union Ambassador for Botswana and SADC, Alexander Baum for developed countries to play a part and assist developing countries by capacitating them through technology exchange and capacity building in order to reduce emission of Green House Gases. Prior to this, Ambassador Baum had explained that, 'We can't sit back now that Paris is over. Our EU Commissioner for Climate and Energy, Miguel Arias Canete said on the day the Agreement was reached that we already had to start acting. And we also have to step-up the action we take before 2020 - reducing emissions, maintaining finance flows consistent with low-emissions economies, and working with non-state actors - local governments, businesses, and civil society.'

The landmark Paris Agreement became effective from November 4, 2016, after more than 55 Parties to the convention, accounting for more than estimated 55 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ratified the same. There was a great sense of relief and enthusiasm that here it was comparatively smooth landing than that of Kyoto Protocol's attainment of threshold. Across this historic threshold, we imagined our best chance for greener, cleaner, and low-carbon growth for the planet. This was not only a time to celebrate but also was a moment to look forward with an assessment and renewed will over the task ahead. Within a few short years, ideally no later than 2018, governments and parties will have to complete the details of a rulebook that would measure, account for, and review global climate action. This would ensure transparency on all sides needed to accelerate stronger climate action by making sure that everyone is involved in the efforts and is delivering to the best of their abilities. Immediately after ratification, the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) was held at Marrakech in Morocco from November 7-18, 2016, where the rules for the implementation of the Agreement could be debated. There was an immense work to be done on how to make the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) a reality and to agree the rules by which the agreement would be fairly governed. That is why COP22 was equally important to COP21. Nations were required to place a low carbon economic development strategy that would open the avenue to work for climate change mitigation and adaptation, for which NDCs would be in fact, requiring new institutions, capacity building, and appropriate coordination and facilitation mechanism in place. Some nations were also expected to go for enacting a new climate change law to facilitate faster climate actions. The Kigali Amendment to the UN Environment-hosted Montreal Protocol, also agreed in October 2016, aims to slash the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which could cut another 0.5 degree C, if fully implemented, although emissions would not begin to be reduced at any significant rate until 2025. Under the Paris agreement, all countries are committed to implement their NDCs, driven by their capability and sustainable development goals (SDGs). India is committed to reduce its emission intensity of its gross domestic product (GDP) by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from its 2005 level and protect its population from the adverse impacts of climate change. It has also submitted a $2.5 trillion climate action plan that will be executed over the period by 2030. In addition, in a big push for renewable energy, India plans to install 175 GW, including 100 GW for solar and 60 GW for wind energy of capacity by 2022, creating one of the world's largest renewable energy markets. India along with France, has also established the International Solar Alliance (ISA) backed by 1 trillion investments in COP21, which will be instrumental in promoting solar energy technologies and drive down the cost of solar power, making it affordable for a growing number of communities in 121 solar rich tropical countries, lying between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. This reflects India's aggressive commitments for global leadership in centre staging cleaner energy options. The journey from Paris to Marrakech looks simple and straightforward, but after a tough negotiation at COP22 , finally we arrived at the Marrakech Action Proclamation for Climate Change and Sustainable Development. The Deliberations at COP22 On November 17, 2016, at Marrakech, a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate change and sustainable development was signalled by the Heads of State, Heads of Government, and Delegations from all over the world through the Marrakech Action Proclamation. The Proclamation celebrates the unstoppable global momentum on climate change and sustainable development action by governments, businesses, investors, sub-regional government, and cities. It calls for the highest political commitment to build on that momentum so that climate action can fully support the achievement of the sustainable development goals for the benefit of people and the planet. The Marrakech Action Proclamation was read out to a full plenary at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech. Central Outcomes at Marrakech In her speech, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Ms Patricia Espinosa summed up the central outcomes of the COP22 , along with outlining the next steps for international, national, and local climate action, and addressed the issue of what specifically Norway can do to help implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement. First, she saw an unparalleled political will to act on climate change. Secondly, Marrakech featured close cooperation to advance critical issues, which can be seen in the conference outcomes. Governments took a crucial step towards writing the rules of the Paris Agreement. They outlined the finance, technology, and capacity building support that enables the developing world to move to low-emission development and build resilience. Marrakech featured long term de-carbonization plans from major emitters and medium-income countries. The Marrakech Action Proclamation unites nations in the determination to implement the Paris Agreement and SDGs. This is all very positive and shows that governments are willing to work together. It also sends a strong signal that we have unstoppable global momentum on climate change and sustainable development. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from TerraGreen.

"COP22","India","COP22_India133","World Energy Council Brings 7 New Realities in Energy to COP22 Negotiations in Marrakech","November 24, 2016 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","India Energy News","Nov. 24 -- As a UN accredited body since 1953, the World Energy Council is recognised as a reliable source of thought leadership and information to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, negotiating teams and stakeholders. To keep the momentum of the World Energy Congress and the Council's thought leadership on embracing the new energy frontiers, the World Energy Council brought their 7 new realities messages launched during its World Energy Congress to the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) negotiations in Marrakech. The World Energy Council focused the discussions on the Grand Energy Transition and what these new realities mean in a post COP21 world. How can the energy sector contribute to the activation of innovative policies, technologies and business models that will secure a sustainable energy future? The conclusions from our World Energy Scenarios to 2060 shows that we haven't done enough to decarbonise our economies: the world will have to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global GDP to a rate of 6%/yr in order to remain within the carbon budget associated with 2oC global warming. This will take considerable effort since with current trends we could reach and surpass the carbon budget between 2045 and 2055, even with optimistic assumptions on energy intensity reductions. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) agreed at COP21 provide about 1/3rd of the required ambition level. Rapid and successful transitioning of global transport to low carbon solutions presents the biggest obstacle or opportunity in achieving climate goals. Current market signals alone are not enough to improve critical areas such as energy efficiency, improved electrical storage, penetration of clean transport and much needed adoption of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). Clear, focused and unambiguous policies and institutional frameworks are required to reinforce a wider deployment of solutions that accelerate the transition and drive consumer choice towards the most carbon and cost effective solutions. These messages were brought by a delegation of the Council that took part into several official UN and other side events across the 2 weeks. Engagement started on the 11th of November, the UN official ""Energy"" and ""Business"" day, where Stuart Neil, Senior Director World Energy Council led a panel discussion about ""New energy realities: Building a resilient and low-carbon future."" Co-organised with the International Chamber of Commerce, the session set the context of the new energy realities in a post-COP21 world and explored what it takes for companies, investors and governments to innovate and build tomorrow's sustainable energy future. Key contributions were made by energy companies such as Marcus Thill, President of Bosch Africa, Tanya Morrison from Shell and Gilbert Vermot Desroches from Schneider Electric whom explained that solutions to secure sustainable energy compared to ""blueberries"" - small, agile, efficient, delocalised - business model solutions against the current ""watermelon"" on the grid systems we currently rely heavily upon. Abyd Karmali, Managing Director, Climate Finance from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Michael Wilkins, Managing Director, Infrastructure Finance Ratings at S&P Global Ratings, brought the finance perspective with Mr Karmaly explaining how ""Green bonds are helping to accelerate decarbonisation of the power sector and electrification of road transport as well as improvements in energy productivity"". Luis Miguel Galindo from ECLAC highlighted the policymaker point of view with concrete examples from Latin America. This discussion was continued and focused on resilience in a more private setting, during a breakfast briefing co-organised by World Energy Council, BDI (Germany) and the ICC on Tuesday the 15th November where Didier Sire, Senior Director, World Energy Council, looked at what Modern Jazz, Unfinished Symphony and Hard Rock energy scenarios meant for the Climate agreement. The Council also led the discussions at both the World Climate Summit 2016 on the 13th of November with a session on how Low Carbon Solutions can be Growth Catalysts for the 21st Century with specific examples being brought by key actors from Burkina Faso, Uganda as well as UNEP and Bertrand Piccard from Solar Impulse and at the Sustainable Innovation Forum 2016. Organised by UNEP and Climate Action on the 15th and 16th of November, the event welcomed over 800 high level delegates at the largest business focused side event taking place at COP22 , where our new Vice Chair for Africa, Commissioner Ibrahim, explained the value of the Energy Trilemma to catalyse policy, innovation and projects. On the 17th of November, the World Energy Council, together with project partner ADEME, launched the latest Energy Efficiency Policies report at an official UN side event in the Francophonie pavilion. Francois Moisan, Executive Chair of the report and Didier Sire, World Energy Council's Senior Director, as well as top level speakers from ADEME, ENERDATA, Lebanon, Senegal and Tunisia united in an expert conversation about how energy efficiency provides a straight path towards energy sustainability. Key Findings of the report where highlighted including the fact that over the last 15 years' energy efficiency improvements have saved the world 3.1 gigatonnes (Gtoe) of primary energy consumption and 7Gt of Co2, in 2014 equating to 23% of global energy consumption and 21% of global Co2 emissions in 2014. It was also discussed that industrial electric motors and electric motor driven systems consume almost half the world's total electricity, and account for 70% of total electricity consumption within industry world-wide. The cost-effective potential to improve the energy efficiency of motor systems representing roughly 20%-30%.

The parties -- 196 nations and the European Union bloc -- set a rapid deadline of 2018 to complete the rule book for operationalizing the Paris Agreement to ensure confidence, cooperation and its success over the years and decades to come. Businesses, investors, cities and local governments also issued new climate change commitments, adding to the thousands announced in the run up to the Paris climate conference last year, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said. ""The landmark Paris Agreement set the course and the destination for global climate action. Here in Marrakech, governments underlined that this shift is now urgent, irreversible and unstoppable,"" an official statement quoting UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said. "" COP22 COP22 President Salaheddine Mezouar said: ""It will be necessary to respect the commitment of $100 billion dollars from now until 2020. Faced with the magnitude of what is required for dealing with the impacts of climate change, turning billions into trillions is indispensable."" ""2017 must be the year of large-scale projects, of mobilising finance, and accessing financial facilities that will be necessary for adaptation,"" he said. Espinosa added: ""During COP22 , the strength, the support for and the robustness of the Paris Agreement was furthered underlined, with nine more ratifications received at the UN in New York and the promise of many more to come."" COP 22 At the close, Fiji was announced as the host of the next year's UN climate conference, with Germany assisting the Pacific island nation by holding it in Bonn. Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid, which monitors the climate negotiations on behalf of poor countries, said in a statement that the sticking point in Marrakech has been the issue of finance to help poor countries leapfrog dirty energy and help them adapt to a changed climate. ""The $100 billion a year promised by rich countries as part of the Paris deal must be delivered if the atmosphere of trust essential for progress is to continue,"" he said. However, a ray of green development has emerged at the Marrakesh summit. A club of sub-national governments, the Under2 Coalition, which have committed to reduce their emissions by at least 80 percent by 2020, announced their membership has grown to 165. The combined GDP of these 165 members is close to $26 trillion -- a third of the global economy -- and cover a population of around one billion people living in North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of more than 40 vulnerable nations, released a declaration that strengthens the call to limit global temperature rise to as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible. Several countries -- Canada, Germany, Mexico and the US -- announced ambitious climate strategies out to 2050, reflecting the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement to achieve climate neutrality and a low-emission world in the second half of the century. ""At the end of these two weeks we just want to express our extreme disappointment that no clear and concrete increases in climate finance pledges have been put forward by developed country governments,"" Lidy Nacpil of the Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development said. Referring to speculation that the US will drop from the Paris Agreement or even the Convention itself, Meena Raman of Third World Network said: ""If the US leaves the climate change convention, the world will leave the US behind.""

"COP22","India","COP22_India135","Notable agriculture initiatives discussed at COP 22","November 21, 2016 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 21 -- Agriculture is part of the solution in the fight against climate change-this was the sentiment echoed by various stakeholders gathered at COP 22 in Marrakech. This is established by their respective climate action plans or Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Almost 95 per cent of countries covered agriculture, and 89 per cent discussed water management in their plans. Most of the countries have considered agriculture among their adaptation or mitigation priorities to help limit global temperature rise, in line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Working towards sustainable agriculture also addresses other global challenges: fighting hunger and malnutrition and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems. However, the progress made at COP 22 related on agriculture was very slow and the issues related to agriculture will now be discussed in May 2017. Three new initiatives discussed at COP 22 highlight the potential in agricultural adaptation: Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA), Global Framework on Water Scarcity and Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. These initiatives are designed to assist small scale farmers in building their adaptive capacity, to help urban citizens in dealing with the impacts of climate change and to support countries in fulfilling their climate commitments. These action events are part of global climate action agenda, led by France and Morocco. African Adaptation initiative The African continent is responsible for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, agriculture in the continent has been impacted adversely by climate change. According to a 2014 report by the European Commission, climate change is reducing Africa's GDP by 1.4 per cent. This GDP value loss is largely attributed to the degradation of the agricultural sector under the effects of climate change (temperature rise, droughts and floods) This initiative estimates that with smart, climate-sensitive agricultural practices, African annual agricultural production could increase from US $280 billion to $880 billion by 2030. The major focus of this initiative is on soil management (soil fertility and crop fertilisation, fruit farming, rangeland management, and agroforestry, agro-ecological innovations and carbon sequestration), agricultural water control and climate risk management. AAA already has the active support of 28 African countries, several national and private sector entities as well as of the FAO. ""In many countries, adapting to climate change and finding ways to ensure food security and nutrition are part of the same challenge,"" said FAO director general, Jose Graziano da Silva, noting that the widespread adoption of climate resilient practices would boost productivity and farmers' incomes and lower food prices. Global Framework on Water scarcity The Global Framework on Water Scarcity supports countries in integrating climate action and sustainable water use into policies for their agricultural sectors and cross-sectoral dialogue, implement their national climate action plans, enhance the development of capacity in the climate-water-food-energy nexus, and shares knowledge and experiences with other countries. ""Higher temperatures, increasing variability of rainfall, more frequent droughts and floods, and sea level rise are all disrupting the amount of water available for crops, livestock, forests and fisheries, seriously affecting livelihoods,"" said Maria Helena Semedo, FAO deputy director-general. She emphasised that agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of global water withdrawals, and more water will be needed to produce nutritious and sufficient food for a growing population. Several governments and knowledge and investment-related organizations have recently joined this rapidly growing multi-stakeholder platform. The Global Framework on Water Scarcity will support the implementation of the agricultural water management component of the AAA initiative. Milan Urban Food Policy Pact In October 2015, 132 mayors from across the world committed to the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact (MUFPP), calling for sustainable food systems in cities and adapting urban food systems against climate change. About one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year-approximately 1.3 billion tonnes-gets lost or wasted. Food losses and waste amounts to roughly $ 680 billion in industrialised countries and $310 billion in developing countries. FAO estimates that, without accounting for greenhouse gas emissions from land-use change, this is equivalent to an estimated carbon footprint of 3.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. This international pact is for sustainable food systems that foster the accessibility of healthy food to urban citizens, biodiversity protection and food waste reduction. The MUFPP is building a monitoring framework process to assess the progress made by cities in achieving more sustainable food systems, and therefore in the implementation of the Pact. The initiative explores measures that would facilitate the transition to and invest in sustainable, climate-resilient and more productive agriculture.

"COP22","India","COP22_India137","First week at COP 22: discussions on crucial issues stalled due to lack of consensus","November 12, 2016 Saturday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 12 -- The first week of negotiations at COP 22 Marrakech was underlined by developed countries pushing their agenda of mitigation and making almost no concessions on crucial topics for developing countries, including adaptation, loss and damage and agriculture. There is literally no progress on agriculture and adaptation. One of the casualties of this deadlock has been the near-zero progress also on pre-2020 action as most discussions across the board have gotten stalled over fundamental differences between groups of countries and, at times, even within groups over language, priorities and terms of implementation. The negotiations under COP are carried out within three bodies: Ad-hoc working group on the Paris Agreement (APA), Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body on Technological and Scientific Advice (SBSTA). The APA is tasked with making rules and modalities for elements, including guidance on mitigation actions, global stocktake, new market mechanisms, adaptation communication, matters related to implementation of Paris Agreement and compliance mechanism. The work for each element was carried out under informal consultations convened by the co-facilitators with extremely limited access to observers. The work under APA was more process-based and substantive discussions would take place in successive APA session. Developing countries, including India, however, expressed huge concerns about the mode of work, which they thought was highly mitigation-centric and equity and differentiation was absent from the agenda. Any talks related to the operationalisation of equity and differentiation in the rules of various provisions were conveniently watered down by developed countries. After much discussions, Adaptation Fund was agreed to be included within APA under item 8. The transparency framework, another agenda item of APA, is described as a ""Rubik's Cube"" by one of the co-chairs of the APA, Jo Tyndall, as much of the discussions need to be done on identification of linkages between transparency framework to that of accounting, global stock take and facilitative dialogue. Global stock take is emerging as an increasing area of interest but the Parties need to agree on a number of issues related to the information feeding the stock take, the outcome of the stock take and issues for further consideration. On information related to mitigation, the Parties need to agree on issues like baselines and accounting. The work under the APA has just begun with co-chairs reiterating the same in the Draft conclusions document that it prepared. The discussions and comments are underway through the weekend after which it is expected to be adopted during the closing plenary of the APA on 14 November, Monday. Agriculture, which comes under SBSTA, has been one of the issues showing least progress at Marrakech with no credible outcome coming out of it. At the final meeting held on November 11, there was no final document or decision that was adopted regarding future action or terms for implementation on issues relating to agriculture. A non-paper, on which discussions were taking place, was not allowed by the US and EU to be officially released and the same paper would be taken forward at intersessional in Bonn. The group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Africa Group (AG) expressed utter disappointment at the lack of collective will to come up with a unified document that could inform decisions in Marrakesh even after extended consultations and dialogues between and among the groups of parties. Adaptation, which according to the Paris Agreement has equal parity with mitigation, also suffered on account of any outcome. The Parties did not seem to be prepared for considering adaptation as an equally important component as mitigation and issues related to reporting and reviewing adaptation actions, including global goal on adaptation, have been shifted to next year where there would be a review of the adaptation institutional arrangement. There has not been even informed talks on pre-2020 actions and enhancement of finance and technology transfer and capacity building There was no document adopted by the SBI in its closing plenary. Finance Developed countries happily patted their backs based on the highly contested OECD report that mentions that developed countries are on way to fulfil $100-billion mandate by 2020. Claims of progress on closing some accounting loopholes have been made following informal consultations with observer groups, although without any progress on adopting a consensual working definition of what constitutes climate finance any such progress is bound to be purely academic with little grounding in reality. The Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) expressed pleasure on progress made towards meeting the $100-billion commitment although it admitted to some caveats like difficulty in compilation of financial reports and the poor quality and completeness of data regarding global flows of climate finance which have hindered reporting and cast a shadow on credibility. The committee also noted with some concern that mitigation still constitutes a heavy majority (70 per cent) of public finance towards climate action and that carbon-intensive investment was still too high. The COP informal consultations related to finance witnessed differences between the developed and developing countries over the question of reporting modalities. While the developing countries suggested an expansive approach to identify new modalities on finance, developed countries wanted to continue with the current reporting modalities. Loss and Damage The 45th meeting of the SBSTA, held during the COP22 , deliberated over the Executive Committee report of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with climate change impacts with parties of the WIM. After holding rounds of consultation where issues pertaining to the language and the terms of implementation of the report were brought up, the SBSTA chairs adopted draft conclusions on November 11. While inviting the executive committee to continue with implementation of activities from its ongoing two-year work plan, the chairs approved the indicative framework for the five-year rolling work plan of the executive committee, which shall be used as the starting point for activities from 2017 onwards. The SBSTA chairs have further requested the executive committee to include a ""strategic workstream to guide the implementation of the Warsaw International Mechanism's function of enhancing action and support, including finance, technology and capacity-building, to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change"". On the inclusion of finance, there is a divergence between the stance of developing and developed nations with developing nations pushing for finance to be included within the ambit of the WIM while developed nations stand opposed to this. The conclusions also note that due to a delay in nomination of members by parties, there is still much work to be carried out to finalise the work plan for implementation of the WIM from 2017 onwards. Next week The CMA would be convened on November 15 but expected to be suspended as still not all the Parties have ratified the Paris Agreement and they are likely to be included in the discussions taking place within the CMA which is mandated to adopt decisions related to implementation of Paris Agreement. Major announcements are expected during the high ministerial segment on finance taking place on November 16. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP22","India","COP22_India139","'Exploring Low-emissions Pathways' Event at COP-22","November 18, 2016 Friday 6:30 AM EST","India Energy News","Nov. 18 -- IPIECA launched its new paper Exploring low-emissions pathways during a side event at COP-22 in Marrakech, Morocco. The side-event brought together experts from the oil and gas industry, UN Environment, and other stakeholders to consider the key elements and enablers of low-emissions pathways. IPIECA shared its view, with the highlights from its new paper, including what we see as the three common elements of any transition, along with the critical enablers. IPIECA presented on the current energy system, the significant transformation that will be required to meet the global energy demand whilst addressing climate change and the possible pathways and technologies to achieve this. The panellists then shared their views on:  what is needed from national low-emissions development strategies (Manfredi Caltagirone, UNEP);  the role of gas and carbon markets (Renato De Filippo, Eni), and  the role of technology and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in a low-emissions future (Fareed Al-Asaly, Saudi Aramco). Moderator David Hone (Shell) led the panel discussion which touched on support for carbon pricing, Saudi Aramco's work on mobile (light-duty vehicle) CCS, and the need for better methane emissions management. The audience also quizzed the panellists around the future of oil and gas refineries and biofuels, the speed with which a transition might occur, and what might be needed to influence nations to invest and deploy CCS technologies. The 22nd Conference of the Parties, focused on actions to delivering the technical details which are needed to flesh out the Paris Agreement. Key areas of negotiation include the transparency framework for national commitments, mitigation and adaptation measures, the nature of new market mechanisms (if any), and the details around a global stocktake in 2018. This stocktake is set to inform Parties understanding of the science, achievements of peers, and opportunities to go further, in order for them to consider increasing ambition ahead of the entry into force of the first commitment period in 2020.

India was under pressure to ratify the pact soon since the world's two biggest polluters - China and the US - formally joined the agreement on September 3. There was a lot of consultation on the issue within the government after that, particularly in light of the rapport between Modi and US President Barack Obama, who is keen to seal the deal before he demits office.India's announcement to formally join the agreement could now make it possible for the deal to come into force this year. The Cabinet is expected to give its approval for the ratification at its next meeting on Wednesday .So far, 60 countries have ratified the agreement which was adopted by 195 countries in Paris, last December. The agreement will enter into force 30 days after 55 countries, representing 55% of global emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession with the UN secretary general.Though national ratification has already crossed the threshold of 55 countries, it so far only accounts for 47.76% of global emissions. India, which accounts for 4.1% of global emissions, will bring it closer to the emission threshold of 55%.The magic figure of 55% will be reached this year as 14 countries, accounting for 12.58% of global emissions, had on September 21 committed to join the agreement this year - most probably before the beginning of the next UN conference on climate change ( COP22 ) in Morocco.The Paris Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and intensify actions needed for a sustainable low carbon future. It is meant to limit global warming ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible to increase economic ability to adapt to extreme climate.It mandates regular meetings every five years, starting in 2018, to review progress and to consider how to strengthen the level of ambition as countries recognised that the present level of climate actions, pledged by individual nations, was still not sufficient to save the world from the adverse impact of climate change.Besides India, the other countries who have announced to join the Paris Agreement through formal ratification this year include Austria, Australia, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Poland, and the Republic of Korea.

"COP22","India","COP22_India142","Canada : Governor Brown Discusses Under 2 Climate Coalition with First Minister of Scotland","April 4, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today met with First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon to discuss California and Scotland's ongoing commitment to fight climate change at the subnational level as part of the Under2 Coalition - the global pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. The Under2 Coalition, the collective of governments who have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, has now grown to 167 jurisdictions representing more than one billion people and $25.9 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy. The coalition was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Scotland signed the Under2 MOU in July 2015. Today, Governor Brown and First Minister Sturgeon also signed a letter of cooperation to support Under2 Coalition members in sharing best practices to reduce greenhouse gases, long-term decarbonization planning and other areas. Last month, Governor Brown reaffirmed California's commitment to exceed the targets of the Clean Power Plan and the state's efforts to curb carbon pollution, which include establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor has also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from Australia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations. \"

It initiated work on 'Adaptation Fund' to serve the Paris Agreement. The Pre-2020 action, including mobilization of USD 100 billion per year and other support to developing countries, is a key element of the Proclamation"".On outcome of the COP22 , the official statement said, ""Overall, the outcome represents a forward movement in the climate actions, especially on the implementation front. Procedural discussions and decisions to develop rule book for Paris Agreement were advanced in many ways at this conference. It was agreed that submissions from Parties will be invited and technical workshops will be held to develop clarity and understanding on these issues"".Environmentalists, on the other hand, expressed their disappointment with the outcome of the Marrakech conference.The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said that the COP22 ended without making any breakthroughs under critical agenda items including agriculture, finance, adaptation and pre-2020 actions.""The COP 22 was billed as a 'COP of Action', but ended up being a 'COP of Distraction' -- primarily because of the US election results"", said the CSE.""Parties were not prepared for this meeting as the Paris Agreement entered into force much ahead of what was anticipated. Therefore, there has not been much progress on Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines (MPG) to operationalise the Paris Agreement with discussions being shifted to the next climate talks,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the CSE, who was there in Marrakech to attend the conference as an observer.The think-tank noted that despite the warning of the latest UNEP report which flagged inadequacy of the current pledges, the developed countries have not ratcheted up their ambition on finance or emission cuts for the pre-2020 period.""This shows their total lack of commitment and seriousness as historical emitters in addressing the climate change issue,"" said the CSE which is also quite disappointed with India's position during the Conference.""India did not contribute much to the discussions on the issues that affects its poor and neither the Indian negotiators were willing to openly explain their position on these issues. It publicised sustainable lifestyle and environmental justice. However, it was found wanting and there was no elaboration of what it actually meant by these two concepts,"" said Bhushan.Other green groups and think-tanks too reacted more or less on similar lines.The Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA) welcomed the progress made on technical front but expressed its disappointment on lack of urgency shown by developed countries on delivering their promise of providing necessary funding to developing countries to cope with the incessant impacts of climate change.""The agreement on process for preparing a rule book for implementation of Paris agreement, the infusion of some more money in adaptation fund and the fact that CMA - the implementing body of Paris Agreement - has begun functioning are all good news but the money on the table is way less than required to help the developing countries to implement their conditional nationally determined contribution (NDC)"", said Sanjay Vashist, director of the CANSA.Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid, said, ""In the planet's hottest year ever, when parts of Africa are dealing with their worst drought in decades, rich countries' willingness to leave developing countries in the lurch holds back climate action at a time when we need it most.

Hollande: ""COP22 in Marrakesh must be the COP of solutions.""","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","TendersInfo","I want to begin by thanking His Majesty King Mohammed VI of Morocco for organizing this conference. Barely a year ago, COP21 was taking place in Paris. I wanted it to be organized in France. I was fully aware of the difficulties we faced. I remembered a number of failures but knew what high hopes there were. However, on 12 December 2015, in exceptional, even appalling circumstances, since terrorist attacks had taken place in Paris, many heads of state and government came, worked, and concluded a historic agreement. I still remember the moment when Laurent Fabius, COP President, set the seal on the Paris Agreement. Here we are in Marrakesh, one year on. The agreement was historic, and what we have to say here is that the agreement is irreversible. Its irreversible legally speaking. It came into force on November 4. More than 100 states, accounting for two-thirds of greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified it. I welcome the efforts led by Ban Ki-moon, United Nations Secretary-General, and Sgolne Royal, COP President, to arrive at that result in record time and at an international agreement of that scope. The agreement is also irreversible in practice, because governmentsthe ones youre representing, businesses, non-governmental organizations and citizens of the world are taking initiatives, launching projects and coming up with concrete solutions enabling us to combine the fight against global warming with development. Were going to move inexorably towards a much lower-carbon model. Already 90% of new electricity is produced by renewable energy sources. More than 70 countries and thousands of businesses have committed themselves to a coalition which has set itself the goal of doubling the share of global emissions covered by a carbon price by 2030. Even the world of finance has committed itself to the process: 80 billion-worth of green bonds has been raised and France itself will set an example by being the first country to issue them, at the start of the year 2017 , for investments in the environment and energy transition. Thats why the agreement is irreversible legally and practically speaking. Moreover, it is irreversible in peoples minds. The climate emergency didnt end in Paris on 12 December 2015. The past few months have been the hottest in modern history and the link has been established between global warming caused by manhumansand natural disasters. Everyone now knows that if we dont do anything, rising sea levels will flood islands and coasts, including the most populated on our planet. Doing nothing would be catastrophic for the world, terrible for future generations and dangerous for peace. Millions of people would be displaced, there would be conflictswere already experiencing themlinked to access to water and resources, then in Africa, famine linked to drought, which could affect millions of people who, to survive, would be forced to migrate in the hope of finding adequate resources elsewhere to feed themselves. So, taking action for the climate means ensuring the security and stability of the world. Ive come here to Marrakesh not to go back over Paris, but to call for coherence and perseverance. The Paris Agreement is the work of everyone. It belongs to everyone, it depends on everyone, it is in the interest of everyone. Barack Obamas role in securing an agreement in Paris was crucial, particularly when it came to decisions taken with China and other countries. The United States, the worlds leading economic power and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter, must honor the commitments that were made. Its not only its duty, its in its interestthat of the American people, who are being hit by climate disruption, because no country is immune. Its also in the interest of American businesses, which have invested in the ecological transition. Its also the desire of cities and federal states, which made active efforts to support us in the climate agreement. FranceI assure you of this herewill hold this dialogue with the United States and its new president, openly, with respect, but with insistence and determination and on behalf of the 100 countries that have already ratified the Paris Agreement. I also want to make an appeal for perseverance. Were all gathered with the aim of limiting temperature rises to below 2C and, if possible, 1.5C. But I assure you, we must move faster. Move faster so that we can implement the Paris Agreement more quickly than plannedeven before 2018. Move faster to implement our national contributions. There too, France wants to set an example and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. Likewise, those same emissions will be cut fourfold by 2050. Moving faster, ever faster. Were also going to close coal-fired power stations by 2023, because were conscious that time is needed, a transition is needed, but that we must also have this goal. We want to set a carbon price; 22 in 2016, more in 2030. But we must have the determination to be carbon neutral by 2050. I know that not all countries are ready. But France has decided to take the lead in this carbon neutral coalition by 2050. COP22 in Marrakesh must be the COP of solutions. It must make Africas future among the top priorities. The world owes the African continent an ecological debt. Of the 50 countries worst afflicted by global warming, 36 are in sub-Saharan Africa. Thats why I wanted an Agenda 2020 for Africa to be implemented; the aim is to provide all Africans with access to electricity. An Africa Renewable Energy Initiative was launched in Paris at COP21. 10 billion was promised ; France will provide 2 billion of this over the next five years. But I know this commitment will be exceeded. \"

This initiative contributes to Carrefour' objective to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 40% by 2025 and by 70% by 2050 (compared with 2010 levels). Through this initiative, the impact of greenhouse gases will be incorporated into the investment decision-making processes thus accelerating the implementation of low-carbon technologies throughout the company's store network. Introducing an internal price for carbon is a transformational initiative that Carrefour is voluntarily implementing in order to internalise the cost of greenhouse gas emissions. The aim is to make the overall cost of low-carbon technologies more competitive compared with the cost of more conventional technologies. Carrefour has decided to calculate the price of carbon on a country-by-country basis, factoring in the specific characteristics in terms of energy mix and level of technological development of each country. New technologies, such as bio methane, solar and geothermal power are systematically tested. ""Setting a price for carbon is a very effective means of quantifying and so incentivising all of the company's entities to help tackle climate change. The aim is also to ensure that our approach forms part of Carrefour's investment decision process in the long term, helping to accelerate change,"" said Jerome Bedier, Deputy Chief Executive Officer and General Secretary of the Carrefour Group.

There was a general understanding that lot of work needs to be done to agree on a design and details of the mechanism of global stocktake on which the Paris Agreement does not give enough details. Canada, in its statement, focussed on the facilitative dialogue to be held in 2018, which could serve as a crucial input to the global stocktake process. Iran, on behalf of Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), stated that global stocktake should be comprehensive in its scope and it should strengthen the linkages between actions and gaps. It also remarked that the process should not put any additional burden on Parties and the process should largely be party-driven. It also observed that information sharing among Parties is an important component of stocktake. Slovenia, speaking on behalf of the EU, highlighted different elements of the global stocktake-mitigation, adaptation and finance-and how to balance these elements. It also spoke of how the outcome of the global stocktake would raise ambition among the Parties to scale up their climate targets. According to the EU, while the inputs need to be open-ended and include scientific literature, the output should be in the form of reports and consultations among Parties which would be a political process. It is important, however, to draw synergy between both political and technical processes. Grenada and Marshall Islands put out critical questions related to global stocktake as to who would conduct the global stocktake, how would adaptation communication be assessed for its sufficiency, the timeline of the process and how would learnings from facilitative dialogue of 2018 be incorporated into the global stocktake process. Mali, on behalf of the African Union, reiterated the need to have a balance between all components of the global stocktake. It also advocated that the inputs must be received by June 2022, after which the information can be synthesized. This should be followed by structured expert dialogues and review information to assess collective progress among Parties. China said that questions related to the meaning of ""collective progress"", the sources of information required for conducting global stocktake, identification of potential barriers in the entire process and linking of global stocktake to the transparency mechanism under the Paris Agreement must be addressed before its modalities are discussed and agreed upon. The APA is mandated with formulating rules and modalities of several elements of the Paris Agreement which include global stocktake, new market mechanisms, further guidance on nationally determined contributions and the adaptation communications, compliance mechanism, adaptation fund etc. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

Unveiled at COP22 United Nations Climate Change Conference The landmark online survey spoke to nearly 5,000 Post-Millennials in 20 countries across the Middle East & North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia. Countries were also classified according to their economic development as either developed, emerging or frontier. Carried out earlier this year to coincide with Masdars 10-year anniversary, the survey offers a valuable insight into the thinking of tomorrows decision makers on the critical issues of energy and sustainability. Post-Millennials also made clear their appetite for a stronger say on sustainability, with eight in ten (83%) saying governments need to listen more to young people about the issue. A similar number (80%) believe current leaders have not done enough to protect the environment, and it is up to their generation to build a more sustainable future. They thinkgovernment and the private sector share responsibility for developing clean technology (81%), but they expect more government investment in renewable energy (84%). According to Masdars survey, todays youth also see their own behaviour as particularly important when it comes to supporting clean technology. Half (50 per cent) believe that getting individuals to change their behaviour is one of the main barriers to investing in renewable and clean technology. Encouragingly, almost two in three young people (59%) said they are interested in working or studying in an area related to sustainability. This trend is particularly pronounced in emerging (67%) and frontier (72%) economies. Her Excellency further emphasised the importance of youth research for future policy creation and decision-making. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said: There are marked differences between countries and regions in young peoples views on the environment and climate change, but one thing is clear. There is huge demand among our youth for corporate and public investment in clean technology and renewable energy. The winners in the green economy will be those who can harness this youthful idealism and combine it with regulations, long-term investment, cultural change and political action. The survey found that around half of Generation Z (46%) think they are setting the best example when it comes to environmentally responsible behaviour, and many are prepared to use their consumer power to reward or punish companies over their sustainability record. Almost half (46%) have chosen to spend more money on products from a company that behaves sustainably, and 31% have boycotted a company that they perceived as following unsustainable practices. Young people in developed countries are more concerned about the financial costs of going green than those in less developed nations. But solar power was the preferred future energy source overall. Commenting on the global Gen Z survey, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer of Masdar, said: We are pleased to see the high level of understanding of young people from right across the world of the importance of delivering a more sustainable future. Over the last 10 years, the clean energy industry has become one of the worlds most exciting and dynamic growth markets. As we look ahead, the findings of our global survey provide an important insight into the action required to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and clean technologies. Todays youth are the policymakers, industry leaders, technical experts and consumers of tomorrow an audience with whom we and the wider energy and sustainability community must engage to realise a more sustainable future. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India150","Spotlight: 'RE is a Priority Sector for IFC in India'","February 14, 2017","Power Watch India","Says Shalabh Tandon, India Lead, Climate Business and Infrastructure, International Finance Corporation (IFC), in an interview with Monica Chaturvedi Charna... Global corporate funding to the solar sector fell in 2016 although demand was strong. What reasons can be attributed for this and what are your predictions for funding in 2017? According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, last year's global total investment in cleantech was $287.5 billion, down 18% as compared to 2015. This was partially due to cost improvements, but also due to a slowdown in markets like China and Japan. While this may seem disappointing, it is worth noting that 2015 was a record year spurred by the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris. The commitment by countries to reduce their emissions is expected to shore up renewable installations significantly in the future and the temporary blip in 2016 may not reflect the sentiments about the sector. In fact, renewable installations overtook thermal capacity addition in 2016 indicating the confidence amongst investors, globally. IFC remains optimistic about the sector's potential in increasing the access to clean and affordable energy for all. How is IFC engaging in India's renewable energy capacity plans and how much have you invested in various RE projects? Renewable energy is a priority sector for International Finance Corporation (IFC) in India. We continue to remain optimistic about the sector as we believe that universal access to energy can help in faster development of the country. In India, IFC has been a pioneer in renewables investing in the sector since 2009. Our portfolio companies today have set up over 3.5 GW of different forms of renewable power projects in the country till date. As of December 2016, IFC's accumulated investment in renewable energy including mobilisation, is over $1.1 billion. Is India is on track to achieving the JNNSM target of 175GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2022? Any challenges on the front of disbursement of funds? India's renewable energy capacity additions in the last few years have been impressive. I believe that the increasing interest in India's renewable sector from global players and the enabling policies from the government are playing a key role in promoting the sector. Furthermore, creating the policy frameworks to attract alternate long term financing investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, attracting more overseas developers, will help in rapid growth of the sector. IFC has also invested around $125 million in Hero Future Energies. Could you elaborate on how this fund will be utilised? IFC, together with IFC Global Infrastructure Fund, a private equity fund managed by IFC Asset Management Company, invested $125 million in Hero Future Energies, the announcement of which was made early this year. The said amount will enable the company to set up 1 GW of greenfield solar and wind plants in the next 12 months across India. Besides, the investment will help the company expand its renewable energy capacity, provide jobs and facilitate private sector development in the renewable energy space. With incentives (accelerated depreciation and generation based incentive) set to dip for the wind energy sector, what is your outlook on the investment potential in the sector? The wind sector faced some challenges with respect to the signing of power purchase agreements (PPAs) in a few states. With the introduction of competitive bidding, tariffs are expected to come down and should encourage the wind power sector. Recently, India's first wind power tender offered by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) was oversubscribed, thus showing the continuing interest of developers. As per the norms of this tender, successful bidders will sign 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with power trading company, PTC India. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India151","Canada : Governor Brown welcomes Mexican and Australian States to Under2 Climate Coalition","January 31, 2017 Tuesday","TendersInfo","Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today welcomed the states of Aguascalientes, Mexico and Victoria, Australia to the Under2 Coalition - the global pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. ""California will continue to join with leaders across the globe - including our partners in Mexico - to stop climate pollution,"" said Governor Brown. With the addition of today's signatories, the Under2 Coalition has now grown to 167 jurisdictions representing more than one billion people and $25.9 trillion in combined GDP - more than one-third of the global economy. Victoria is Australia's second most populous state, includes the city of Melbourne and covers nearly 90,000 square miles. Aguascalientes is located in north-central Mexico and is home to more than 1 million people. Aguascalientes Governor Martn Orozco Sandoval signed the pact during a meeting today with Governor Brown. The Under2 Coalition, the collective of governments who have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Later today, the state of Aguascalientes will also sign an agreement with the California Energy Commission to cooperate on clean energy programs and policies, including energy efficiency, renewable energy development and grid integration, low and zero-emission vehicles and clean energy technology. California's Leadership on Climate Change In September, California took bold action to advance its climate goals, establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts to broaden collaboration among subnational leaders build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations. \"

During the drought last year, the country's net water reserve capacity was only 20 per cent; in March, hailstorms destroyed the wheat crop,"" Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia, told IANS. Over 330 million people in India were affected by one of the worst droughts that spilled over to neighbouring Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal as well. Experts like S.K. Sarkar, Director, Water Division, at The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), had cautioned that by 2050, India will be water-scarce. ""Extreme events which are more random now force millions to migrate -- and for Bangladesh and Nepal, India is the destination. India needs to pull up its socks. We just faced cyclone Vardha, Chennai Floods in 2015 were devastating and so on,"" Harjeet Singh, Global lead on Climate Change at Action Aid, told IANS. A study released at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) at Marrakech, Morocco, says that natural disasters annually force about 26 million people into poverty. Both the economic and human cost due to such disasters are underestimated by 60 per cent. ""The impact of extreme natural disasters is equivalent to a $520-billion global loss in annual consumption,"" a World Bank report said at COP22 . It also noted that poor people pay the heaviest price. According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the global temperature is 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, making 2016 the warmest year followed by 2015 and 2014. The Island Nations now fear of their existence. ""We have to start worrying about such trends. India need to focus on mitigation or adaptation if the environmental damage is irreversible... our solution will depend on resources and we have other priorities like food security,"" said Karan Mangotra, from TERI's Centre for Global Environment Research. According to Mangotra, to avoid such dangerous trends, India needs to streamline all regulatory aspects for collective efforts, strengthen research capabilities and evolve a business model for affordable technology. ""What we saw at Marrakech has to be operationalised, but embracing Paris Agreement under Trump's administration is highly unlikely, especially given the key people he is appointing to his office like the CEO of ExxonMobile,"" Harjeet Singh said. A UN report has estimated the requirements of developing countries at between $140 billion and $300 billions by 2030 and between $280 billion and $500 billion by 2050 to make up for the climate change. The report also held lack of funds as a major stumbling block in meeting goals under the Paris Agreement and said that developed countries have failed to undertake the measures required to achieve the global temperature goals. ""For India, clearly finance remains an important issue... most of the economic sectors in India depends on weather. If the US does pull out of the Paris deal, a huge financial burden will be created; India has to be ready,"" Singh said. India at COP22 The Government also approved the negotiating position adopted by India at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol held last year in October at Kigali in Rwanda. The Montreal protocol aims to phase out the ozone depleting substances (ODS). Meanwhile, Union Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave also hinted at India's preparedness as 2016 ended. ""If Bengaluru wants to save itself from 2017 monsoon floods then it will have to unclog the drains,"" the minister, who had listed the Bengaluru crisis as a ""preferred task"" while taking office in July 2016, said in a tweet on New Year's Eve.

""Words of comfort are not enough to pay Africa's rising bills for adapting to climate change,"" said Adesina, who was addressing the African Heads of State and dignitaries attending the Africa Action Summit hosted by the King of Morocco on the sidelines of the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakech. The Africa Action Summit brought together 50 Heads of State and Government, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as well as representatives of international organizations. Addressing the Summit, Adesina specifically called on global finance mechanisms to pay for the premiums of African countries to the African Risk Capacity, the mechanism developed by African countries to help them cope with extreme weather events, through insurance for catastrophic events. He observed that ""the insurance premiums are not cheap and this has continued to discourage African countries from insuring themselves against the rising catastrophic risks."" A balanced energy mix for industrialization Adesina stressed the urgency of the situation to African Leaders. The decline in commodity prices is already taking a toll on several countries, constricting their fiscal space. Economic growth is projected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2016 from 3.6 percent in 2015. ""Africa has a very limited scope to adjust to and cope with more exogenous shocks,"" he said. The recent effects of climate change are further worsening the fiscal environment for African countries. Unless urgent action is taken, governments run the risk of diverting more of the resources needed to boost growth to deal with climate risks. Africa receives only 4% of all global finance funds. Only about 14% of global climate finance goes into adaptation. Looking ahead, Adesina said that Africa must ""power up"" itself to ""add value to what it produces, speed up industrialization and move to the top of global value chains."" He observed that this must start with unlocking the huge amounts of energy potential on the continent. ""Potential is important, yes, but potential alone cannot light up homes or power industries,"" he told the Opening Panel of Africa Day. ""We must ensure that Africa develops a balanced energy mix that will allow it to industrialize. Grid, mini-grid and off-grid systems will play a major role,"" Adesina reiterated. The event was attended by several African leaders, including Alpha Conde, President of Guinea and African Union Coordinator for Renewable Energy; Faure Gnassingbe, President of Togo; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of Liberia; and Seretse Khama Ian Khama, President of Botswana. The African Development Bank has committed itself to invest US $12 billion in support of accelerating electricity supply in Africa to fast-track universal access to electricity in the next 10 years. The Bank's investment is expected to leverage between US $45-50 billion from the private sector.

"COP22","India","COP22_India155","COP 22, as it turned out","November 20, 2016 Sunday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 20 -- The twenty-second session of the Conference of Parties at Marrakech ( COP 22 ) was important in the sense that it heralds a new phase meant to implement the Paris Agreement, as opposed to past 10 years that went into crafting of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015, striking a delicate balance of decisions agreed by 196 Parties to the Convention. For operationalisation of the Agreement, 55 countries responsible for 55 per cent of the global emissions had to formally deposit their instrument of accession with the UN, after which, the Agreement was supposed to be operationalised. This was achieved on October 4, 2016 with US hurriedly ratifying the Agreement along with China and many other countries, including India following suit. The Agreement, thus, came into force on November 4, just ahead of the COP 22 (November 7-18). The Parties arrived in Marrakech, rather ill-prepared with unanticipated ratification of Paris Agreement, which was actually expected to be 2-3 years later down the line. The US election result further changed the mood of the COP throwing open the vital question-will the Paris Agreement survive as Donald Trump, the Republican nominee of the world's largest historical polluter, had vowed to opt out of the Paris Agreement ""quickly"" during his election campaign? Ratification of the Paris Agreement Despite scepticism, both the developed and developing countries kept on reassuring themselves and others that the commitments to fight climate change are irreversible and the efforts would continue in the right direction under the Paris Agreement goals. This is reflected in the Marrakech Action Proclamation for Our Climate and Sustainable Development Call. It stated that ""the momentum to address climate change is irreversible"" and called for the ""highest political commitment to combat climate change as a matter of urgent priority"". The Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action further mentioned that ""nothing can stop climate action"" and the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), composed of 48 vulnerable countries, pledged to go 100 per cent renewable by mid-century, setting an example for the developed countries. Much of the implementation work of the Paris Agreement is mandated to be under the Adhoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) that became functional at Bonn intersessional climate talks in May 2016. The other two entities-the Subsidiary body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). The decisions taken under the negotiating bodies would be adopted by the CMA, a body created by the Paris Agreement which convened in Marrakech but got suspended only to be resumed in 2018. By then, the Parties are required to make crucial decisions centred on several elements of the Paris Agreement, including further information on nationally determined contributions (NDC), transparency framework, new market mechanisms and global stocktake. It is true that no real breakthrough was expected as far as formulation of Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines (MPGs) were concerned as the discussions around these themes have only started. However, same old divide regarding differentiation clearly emerged on nearly all issues. While developing countries pressed for equity and differentiation to be clearly reflected in the MPGs and stated that the principles of equity and CBDR must reflect in the implementation of Paris Agreement, developed countries argued that the bifurcated approach no longer exists in the same way as in Kyoto period. Such differences are expected to prevail in future climate talks as well. For the issues under APA, the Parties are invited to make submissions under each item to be compiled by the Secretariat for further discussions. No progress on discussions pertaining to agriculture The issues of agriculture, adaptation and pre-2020 actions suffered the most as no major outcome came out on them. For all these issues, developed countries showed minimal interest with sessions on these issues, ending each time much before scheduled. In a way, the fate of agriculture was do or die at the COP but at the end of negotiations on agriculture, the merged paper of G-77 and China and the EU which formed the basis of negotiations, was blocked by the US and supported by the EU to be even released as official non-paper. The heated debate largely centred on treatment of agriculture issue as mitigation or adaptation issue, with developed countries opting for former and developing countries pushing for the latter. The EU's proposal to include bio-fuels under this issue was fought vehemently by developing countries. Regarding adaptation, discussions started on how adaptation communication by countries should be reported and assessed, how it should be linked to other issues of linkage such as transparency and global stocktake and what should be the global goal on adaptation. Adaptation Fund Developed countries were not prepared to treat this issue at par with mitigation, as mandated by the Paris Agreement. Another closely related issue in this regard was the future of the Adaptation Fund created in 2001 and if and how it should continue within the Paris Agreement. It was decided that Adaptation Fund would serve the Paris Agreement and much of the discussions related to the structure, governance and modalities of the Fund are scheduled for the Bonn climate talks in 2017. On both these issues as with loss and damage, though developing countries fought hard and put forward their positions, India had no stand on such critical issues and most of the time there was no representation either. On pre-2020, nothing tangible was achieved with only reiterations that pre-2020 actions must be enhanced to close the emission gap. The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is yet not into force. The discussions on facilitative dialogue, which was supposed to be held in 2018 to assess collective progress, have been shifted to COP 23 in 2017. Finance, as always, remained a critical issue where developing countries wanted a roadmap for developed countries' US$100-billion mandate by 2020. Instead, developed countries relied on the OECD report to insist that they are well on path to $67 billion by 2020 by public finances alone-a figure highly contested by the developing countries which questioned the methodology and calculations used in the report. Apart from the pledge of $81 million made for adaptation fund (the target was $80 million), several other pledges were made they were not beyond what the climate finance already promised: $50 million for Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) meant to help developing countries build capacity for transparency and $23 million for Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) for technical assistance to developing countries. These mechanisms are created in the Paris Agreement. Regarding loss and damage, the Parties held first review of the mechanism with next review to be in 2019. No numbers were agreed upon or proposed to meet loss and damage in developing countries. But the discussions opened up the avenue for enhanced financial support for loss and damage. The Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) report mentions that the discussions on loss and damage and enhanced support will be taken forward. As it turns out, most of the work for implementation of the Paris Agreement is yet to be done and with discussions still centred on whether principles of equity and differentiation should be operationalised, and if yes, how? The actual task of negotiations on the finer details remains a distant thing. Further, the direction of future of climate talks seems very uncertain with Trump as the President of the US. However, with no official statement been issued by Trump administration on its decision on the Paris Agreement and Secretary of State John Kerry promising that the US would continue to fight climate change and even double its efforts along with others, it throws open the possibility that the US would be on the negotiating table at Bonn.

"COP22","India","COP22_India156","Climate finance to top India's agenda","November 7, 2016 Monday","MINT","New Delhi, Nov. 7 -- Adaptation issues, coupled with finance and technology transfers for developing countries, will top India's agenda at a key global climate change conference starting in Morocco on Monday, signalling a continuation of its efforts to get industrialized developed nations to do more to halt global warming. The 22nd meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will take place in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7 to 18 November. Experts cautioned that India should go to Morocco with a clear position on 'loss and damage' as CoP22 will see a thorough review of what is called the Warsaw International Mechanism. This mechanism was established at CoP19 (November 2013) in Warsaw, Poland, to address the loss and damage caused by climate change-extreme weather events as well as slow onset events-in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. The Morocco meeting comes just after the landmark Paris climate agreement came into force on 4 November-a new global deal where 197 countries agreed to cut down global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit the rise in average world temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degree Celsius over pre-industrial times. ""Sustainable lifestyle, climate justice, finance, technology transfer and enhanced pre-2020 actions are going to be our focus areas at Morocco,"" said a senior environment ministry official, requesting anonymity. ""Mobilizing finance in the pre-2020 and post-2020 period is a huge concern area as well. Adequate and predictable climate finance, especially from funds under the convention, is also needed for successful implementation of the Paris deal."" The official said India will also focus on sustainable lifestyle issues, which found a place in the Paris agreement after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed for its inclusion. ""India has always followed a path of sustainable lifestyle which is based on the principle of need-based consumption. We will continue to push for it at Morocco CoP as well,"" the official added. ""Issues like pre-2020 action, finance and technology transfer are overarching issues. Besides them, loss and damage is going to be the most important issue as the Warsaw International Mechanism will be reviewed at CoP 22 . Warsaw mechanism is the fulcrum on loss and damage under UNFCCC. Therefore, India should have a clear position on it,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general at the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank. He pointed to the need for a globally funded insurance mechanism for small, poor and marginalized farmers to help them tackle the effects of climate change. Adaptation to climate change will also figure prominently at Morocco and India will stress on the urgency to take adaptation action. The government believes adaptation in the agriculture sector is a key issue for developing countries like India, especially from the perspective of food security. ""There will be issues like funding for pre-2020 action and technology transfer, but Morocco is all about adaptation,"" said Rakesh Kamal, a climate change expert. The Paris agreement was to come into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the convention, accounting for at least 55% of total GHG emissions, submit their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval. On 5 October, the threshold for entry into force of the Paris agreement was achieved and thus it entered into force on 4 November. At present, 97 countries have ratified the convention. These signatories-called parties-will also meet in Marrakech alongside the COP22 . Published by HT Syndication with permission from MINT.

"COP22","India","COP22_India157","Austria : Atoms for People, Planet and Prosperity: Scientific Forum Opens","September 29, 2016 Thursday","TendersInfo","Nuclear science contributes to many of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the IAEA supports countries in their developments efforts, said IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano at the opening of the 2016 Scientific Forum today. When world leaders adopted the Sustainable Development Goals last year, they explicitly recognized for the first time that science, technology and innovation are essential for development, he said. The SDGs are a range of objectives agreed on by the United Nations General Assembly to stimulate action in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet. Helping countries to achieve these goals is an IAEA priority. We are uniquely placed to help countries gain access to nuclear science and technology, which have a great deal to offer in industry, energy, health care, agriculture, environmental protection and many other areas. Held over two days during the IAEA General Conference, the Scientific Forum this year is showcasing how nuclear techniques are used to improve human and animal health, address climate change, boost access to energy and protect the planet. Senior officials, leading experts and academics will review the diverse contributions of nuclear technology to sustainable development. They will focus on the nine goals to which nuclear techniques make a direct contribution. The livestream of the Scientific Forum is available via this link. See a short video and our series of Impact Stories on how the IAEA supports development around the world. Countries around the world must redouble their efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030, and science, including nuclear applications, needs to play a key role in this endeavour, said Prince Albert II of Monaco. The SDGs are the only means of altering humankinds environmental footprint and, furthermore, of protecting the health of the worlds population. Monaco, which hosts the IAEAs Environmental Laboratories, strongly supports the work of the IAEA, Prince Albert said. International scientific cooperation among all stakeholders in the promotion of nuclear technology for sustainable development and renewable energy is of critical importance. Nuclear science and technology is an important avenue leading to the achievement of sustainable development, said Andrew Wheatley, Jamaicas Minister of Science, Energy and Technology. The programmes of the IAEA and its strong focus on atoms for peace of development provide support to countries in the attainment of SDGs. Jamaica, home to the only research reactor in the Caribbean, uses nuclear technology in industry, medicine, agriculture, education and research, Mr Wheatley said, highlighting support from the IAEA in crop improvement, irrigation and water management. While the peaceful application of nuclear technology is not a panacea for development challenges, it is an important tool for countries to use. In China, nuclear science has always been closely related to development, emphasized Yiren Wang, Vice Chairman of the China Atomic Energy Authority. It will no doubt contribute more to sustainable development in the future. The Chinese nuclear industry has been committed to promoting economic and social development, at the same time meeting electricity demand and improving lives, Mr Wang said. He underlined Chinas support to other IAEA Member States, including by hosting over 3,000 scientific visitors at Chinas research institutes. Nuclear technology has a major role to play in cutting carbon emissions, said Said Mouline, Director General of Moroccos National Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, who spoke on behalf of the organizers of COP22 , the United Nations climate change conference that is scheduled to take place in Marakesh, Morocco in November. We need to seriously consider how the aims of COP link with nuclear technology, he said. Alan Finkel, Australias Chief Scientist and President of the Australian Academy of Sciences and Engineering, talked of the important role nuclear energy must play in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Wind and solar energy can only provide emission-free electricity to meet global needs in conjunction with electricity storage capacity which is currently not available at a large enough scale, he said. Despite the growth in the use of renewables to produce energy, the share of coal is still increasing in the global energy mix, he pointed out. While in 2000 coal accounted for 25% of global energy production, its proportion has increased to 29% last year. We need to use low emission electricity to replace fossil fuels and move towards the electric planet, he said. We cannot do that without nuclear. From prevention to palliation, radiation medicine plays an essential role in the diagnosis and management of a wide range of diseases. However, access to radiation medicine with adequate quality assurance is limited in many countries. The session will look at what is needed to help achieve the SDG 3 target of reducing deaths from non-communicable diseases by one third by 2030. This session will showcase how nuclear technology is successfully deployed to boost food security and tackle agricultural challenges. From efficiently fighting pests and diseases to improving crop varieties and nutrition and ensuring food safety, nuclear techniques are used to guarantee sufficient food all year round. This session will discuss how nuclear technology can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 target of ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture around the world. \"

Only if Himalayas survive will Indian culture and civilisation survive"", Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, said at COP 22 in Marrakech on Thursday. Addressing a session - ""Impact of Climate Change on the Himalayan Ecosystem"" held as a side-event at the India Pavilion in COP 22 , Shri Dave said that Himalayas cannot be protected, but must be served with a spirit of selflessness. The expected outcomes from the session include key inputs for developing strategic plan for addressing issues of Climate Change impacts on the Himalayan ecosystem. The side-event held at the India Pavilion on Thursday was an attempt to highlight the emerging needs for evolving new models of conservation and sustainable development that help restoring intricate balance between economic interests and ecological imperatives in the region under changing climate scenario. India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) recognizes the Himalayan ecosystem, vital for preserving ecological security of Indian sub-continent and underlines intense vulnerability of this ecosystem. The Himalayas are among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change and being affected at a faster rate than other terrestrial habitats. Climate impacts form an important threat to mountain ecosystems. Over 80% of the population is involved in agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and other biodiversity dependent livelihood activities. Nearly 70% of the population still relies for health care on medicinal plants. Himalayas are nicknamed the ""Water Tower of Asia"". IPCC estimate suggest that glaciers in Himalayas supply freshwater to 500 million people in Himalaya-Hindu-Kush region and to 250 million people in China. The session was organized under the aegis of GB Pant Institute of Himalayan environment and development. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India160","India : Sessions at COP 22 Focus on Afforestation, Ecosystem and Climate Change","November 11, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","On the third day of Conference of Parties ( COP-22 ) on Wednesday, being held at Marrakech in Morocco, the India Pavilion witnessed three side-events that focused on the initiatives in afforestation and REDD+ in India, ecosystem and climate change and sustainable transportation. During the first session on Afforestation and REDD+, experts highlighted that forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, particularly in India, where nearly 25% of the area has tree cover. The Government has asked the forestry sector to help the country meet its goal of creation of 2.5-3.0 billion tonnes of additional carbon sinks, as per the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This target will be met using a variety of means, including afforestation, reforestation, and agro-forestry, conducted through community participation and mechanisms like REDD+. REDD+ stands for Reducing Emissions by Deforestation and Degradation, an initiative finalized under the UNs Paris Agreement in 2015. India has begun implementing REDD+ pilot projects, developing protocols for improving measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) and safeguard information systems (SIS). Emphasis was also placed on promoting the exchange of information and present potential collaborations among South Asian countries that share Himalayan and tropical ecologies.organized by Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In the second session on ecosystem and climate change, discussions were held on the role of forest in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Climate change alters existing biome types and can cause forest dieback with consequent loss of biodiversity. Various forest conservation oriented acts and policies in India are contributing to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, stabilization and improvement of carbon stocks in forests, and conservation of biodiversity. Indias forests serve as a major sink of CO2, offsetting around 12% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the country. IUCN had elaborated about its initiatives in India. ICIMOD provided the information on various activities including preparation of inventory of methodology on climate change and river system in India. Representative of Government of Bihar provided detailed information on the initiatives on the agro-forestry and strategy to meet the climate change risk. Showcasing Indias efforts on sustainable transport solutions, the Ministry of Railways, Government of India, with its technical partner, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, hosted the third session on Sustainable Transport Solutions at the India Pavilion at COP-22 in Marrakech, where the current climate negotiations are underway. Special Secretary, MoEFCC, Mr RR Rashmi, pointed out that India is on the road to managing its transport sector emissions in an effective manner, also said, In addition, there have been efforts to decrease fossil-fuel dependence in the transport sector, which have been incorporated by moving towards cleaner sources of energy and increasing the share of renewables in driving mobility. India has focused its low carbon initiatives on the development of railways, waterways, Mass Rapid Transport Systems (MRTS) and other forms of public transport. Initiatives such as the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) were highlighted by Executive Director, Ministry of Railways, and the Sagarmala projects on development of waterways by Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Shipping. The initiatives are aimed at increasing the share and volume of freight traffic on the more energy efficient rail and water based transport modes. The representative from Council on Energy, Environment and Water highlighted that the Indian Railways has taken a leadership role by planning to substitute its petroleum use with alternatives like bio-fuels, and consistently pursuing a policy of railway electrification through renewable sources of energy, with potential reduction of 138 MT of CO2 by 2030. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India161","COP 22: little progress on pre-2020 actions","November 17, 2016 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 17 -- Under the Paris Agreement, the Parties are mandated to hold a facilitative dialogue at Marrakech ""to identify relevant opportunities to enhance the provision of financial resources, including technology development and transfer and capacity building support"", with a view to identify ways to enhance the ambition of mitigation efforts by all the Parties and relevant opportunities to enhance the provision and mobilisation of support and enabling environments. H.E. Aziz Mekouar, serving as the Ambassador and Head of Negotiations for COP 22 /CMP 12/CMA 1, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Morocco, summed up the first part of the facilitative dialogue which took place on November 11, 2016. He remarked that all the Parties are making progress in implementing their climate targets before 2020 and contributing to reducing emission gaps. He highlighted that Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) are emerging as a key provision of pre-2020 actions undertaken by the Parties, especially developing countries. Mekouar highlighted a range of pre-2020 actions, which comprised funding mechanisms, energy efficiency, building and appliances standards and sustainable transport. He spoke of developing countries' increasing importance on adaptation finance and other means of implementation and developed countries' focus on the importance of enabling environments in developing countries to facilitate such transfer. The barriers to the transfer of funds and technology also need to be worked on. He spoke of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as important instrument for decreasing emissions and highlighted the importance of Kigali Amendment in HFCs and also of pact signed on aviation recently. Even though he harped on the progress undertaken by the Parties, he also observed that the Emission Gap Report clearly underlines that the current efforts lead us to 2.9degC to 3.4degC future and reiterated that 12-14 GtCO2 is to be reduced globally. The importance of adaptation and loss and damage and meaningful engagement of civil society were also flagged by him in his 10-minute wrap-up speech. European Commission Director General, Jose Delbeke, spoke about how the European Union is on its way to achieving its pre-2020 climate commitments by cutting down 22 per cent of emissions against 1990 levels which is 2 per cent more than its commitment of 20 percent. Besides highlighting the importance of ""early action"" to address climate change, he stressed on how nationally determined contributions should turn into policies and get implemented. Siti Nurbaya, Minister of Environment and Forestry of Indonesia, spoke about the developed countries undermining pre-2020 actions as the whole focus is on Paris Agreement and post-2020 actions. She highlighted the importance of ratification of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for enhancement of pre-2020 actions, especially by the developed countries. She also highlighted the efforts taken by Indonesia in the field of redd plus for restoration of forest lands, energy sector, clean energy sources and its ambitious target of renewable energy source of 23 per cent by 2025 and 30 per cent by 2030. Ravi Prasad, Joint Secretary on Climate Change, India seemed to be against the idea that there was good progress for pre-2020 actions. According to him, the ambition for pre-2020 cannot be put on ""cold storage"" while the world talks of post 2020 actions. He emphasised time-bound ratification of second commitment of Kyoto Protocol and suggested April 2017 deadline for the same. He remarked how conditionalities prove to be a major barrier in means of implementation to developing countries and stressed that pre-2020 efforts must be based on equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR). He also said that there is lot of scope for sustainable consumption patterns globally. Louise Metivier, Chief Negotiator for Climate Change, Canada spoke of the importance of mobilisation of non-state actors which included cities and sub-national organisations and civil society. She also spoke of integration of domestic climate plans for greater outcomes related to pre-2020 actions. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

Pershing said the increasing efficiency of electronic gadgets, and lifestyle changes could help reduce 30 per cent of power consumption. He emphasized on importance of research and development (R&D) for technologies that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""There are technologies available but they are expensive. More work needs to be done to bring costs down,"" said Pershing. Talking about the United Nations Climate Change Conference , 2015, in Paris, Pershing said countries now needed to work on how to implement the new global agreements to cut down carbon emissions. ""The most important aspect is to establish an authority to implement agreements,"" he said. When asked how a country like India, where a very large section of society didn't have access to electricity, should work on climate change mitigation plans, Pershing said environment-friendly solutions should be considered while providing basic facilities to people. Pershing shed light on climate-related outcomes of the US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue in New Delhi earlier this week.

Brown Jr. today welcomed Sweden to the Under2 Coalition - the global pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. ""As rising oceans inundate coastlines across our planet, Sweden joins hundreds of leaders from around the world who are forthrightly attacking the increasing threat of climate change,"" said Governor Brown. The agreement was signed during a meeting today between Governor Brown and Isabella Lvin, Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate, and Deputy Prime Minister. A number of representatives from California and Sweden joined the meeting, including Ambassador of Sweden to the United States Bjrn Lyrvall. ""There has never been a greater need for international cooperation on climate. Sweden and California will push for higher global ambition on climate change and will work individually and together to draw more international attention to the actions and ambitious reduction goals that are needed,"" said Minister Lvin. At today's meeting, Governor Brown and Minister Lvin also signed a letter of cooperation to support Under2 Coalition members in sharing best practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy development. With the addition of Sweden's endorsement, the Under2 Coalition now includes 168 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.1 billion people and $26.4 trillion GDP - equivalent to 15 percent of the global population and 36 percent of the global economy. Sweden is the 11th country to endorse the Under2 Coalition. The Under2 Coalition, the collective of governments who have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. California's Leadership on Climate Change Last month, Governor Brown reaffirmed California's commitment to exceed the targets of the Clean Power Plan and the state's efforts to curb carbon pollution, which include establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor has also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru, Chile, Australia and Scotland and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document. The impacts of climate change are already being felt in California and will disproportionately impact the state's most vulnerable populations. \"

Each year YFEL chooses the best from its applicant pool of local and international students and young professionals to be part of its year-long immersive mentorship and training experience. These select young men and women are then given rare access to decision-makers and innovators in energy and sustainability while they enrich their understanding of the technical issues through specialized workshops and courses. All of this has one goal in mind to develop YFEL members skills, confidence, and understanding to help them become future leaders in energy and sustainability. Dr. Lamya N. Fawwaz, Vice-President for Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs, Masdar Institute, said: The YFEL program inspires, engages and empowers bright young people to become future leaders in the fields of energy and sustainability, in line with the UAE governments emphasis on youth development. Supporting such programs remains vital for the youth as they help nurture talented innovators. The YFEL members have engaged with global industry and government leaders, actively participated in international conferences, and attended leadership courses to enrich their knowledge. We congratulate this years graduates on the completion of their year-long program, and on the leadership skills they have developed through their experiences. The most important thing I learned as a YFEL member is that personal and professional growth will happen when I dare to reach beyond my comfort zone, shared YFEL 2016 member Saeed Kaddoura, who is also a Masdar Institute MSc student in Water and Environmental Engineering. The YFEL program placed us in opportunities that challenged the limits of our comfort, and empowered us to succeed beyond them. Kaddoura was one of the winners of the YFEL Case Study Competition selected to be part of the UAE delegation to 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), which took place last November in Morocco. COP22 focused on how the strategies laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement of COP21 can be applied. The Agreement is an international treaty within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that covers the mitigation greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change and finance for climate action. Delegates from around the world debated many of the agreements sticking points, which gave attending YFEL members insight into how science, policy, and government come together to tackle serious issues. At COP22 YFEL members are also gaining valuable experiences right here at home through opportunities to learn from local experts about the forefront of technology, including robotics and initiatives to help bring positive change to important sustainability challenges. This is the case wit YFEL member Abdulaziz Alhammadi, who is an engineer in Dubais Road and Transport Authority (RTA). Alhammadi completed the Building a Robot Course, which taught attendees about the critical technologies that are at the heart of robotic systems, including microcontrollers, sensors, and systems integration. Led by Masdar Institute Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Dr. Prashanth Marpu, the course explained the basics of the embedded systems that control a robot, so at the end of the day-long workshop Alhammadi and other participants were able to build and demonstrate their own functioning robots. The young Emirati engineer says he is looking forward to applying the enhanced technical skills and mindset he acquired during his YFEL experience to his work at the RTA. YFEL has helped me to make better decisions in difficult situations, which is going to have a huge impact on my professional and personal development, and enhanced my design approach for street lighting projects to use environmentally-friendly energy-saving lights in my ongoing projects as one small contribution to the UAEs green economy, Alhammadi said. But the most important lesson he says he learned during his YFEL experience was how crucial energy- and water-security are for overall sustainability. Going forward, I plan to contribute to the UAEs visionary targets by focusing on environmental sustainability challenges and green energy resources, and I will employ technology to serve this vision. I want to combine my technical engineering background with the professional training and development I received through YFEL to increase the efficiency of current green energy technology sources such as solar energy systems, which can serve the UAE and wider world both economically and environmentally, Alhammadi said. Other times the most valued lessons learned by YFEL members have not been as technical. Nouf Al Ali, who is a strategic analyst associate at Dolphin Energy, cited soft skills as being the most important takeaway from her YFEL experience. One lesson that will not be easily forgotten is that differences do not usually create conflicts. To elaborate, YFEL had members from many different educational and professional backgrounds. \"

The APA is tasked with formulating modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs) under each of its elements. The work of the APA would be carried forward at the intersessional climate talks in Bonn in May 2017. On adaptation communications, the APA invited the Parties to make submissions on the element and requested the Secretariat to compile the submission into a synthesis document. Regarding global stocktake, the APA endorsed the view of Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to explore linkages on how IPCC assessments can inform the global stocktake. In this element, too, the Parties were invited to make their submissions. On transparency framework, the Parties have been asked to give submissions around the questions related to specific components of MPGs, building of transparency framework on existing Kyoto arrangements, operationalisation of flexibility for developing countries and consideration of other elements. Besides, it was also agreed to hold an intersessional workshop prior to May 2017. On matters of compliance and implementation of the Paris Agreement also, the Parties are required to make submissions. While the Parties emphasised the future course of action, the developing countries called for maintaining the delicate balance of all elements under the APA. The African group said that guidance on nationally determined contributions must take into account heterogeneity of the contributions with adaptation and means of implementation being part of it, apart from mitigation. It also called upon the developed countries to fulfil their pre-2020 ambitions and show leadership. The Parties, in particular the developed countries, also called for urgency of efforts to be taken as there was too much to accomplish in very less time.

Under each Agenda element, the co-chairs announced work to be conducted within informal consultations that would be convened by two facilitators. The Agenda items included: On various items mentioned above, altogether there were 86 submissions received from the Parties by the Secretariat. They have been compiled and uploaded on the website of the UNFCCC. On Agenda item dealing in further information on NDCs, the Parties' submissions are related to what guidance would actually be helpful, how to build on existing UNFCCC and Kyoto structures and institutions for this agenda item. The co-facilitators responsible for convening work were from Singapore and Austria. On the issue of guidance on adaption communication, co-chairs proposed that negotiations should deal with how adaptation could be measured and how it could add value to a country's climate actions. On the Agenda item dealing in global stocktake, it was agreed that the global stocktake should have a technical and political component which needs to be clearly defined. The last agenda item relating to procedural issues and institutional matters regarding implementation of the Paris Agreement would be convened by the co-chairs themselves. The co-chairs agreed that the APA's work approach has to be coordinated with Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and there needs to be a common understanding on cross-cutting issues. Noting that the APA's closing plenary would be held on November 14, when it shall conclude its work, the co-chairs called for accelerated progress that would result in tangible and useful outcomes. Even though the APA has only one week to finish its work, the co-chairs did not rule out the possibility of conducting work in the second week, after November 14, in the form of technical informal consultations, informal workshops or dialogues. Developing countries suggested that the work programme under APA must not be mitigation-centric. According to them, all the elements must be given balanced treatment and the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) must guide the formation of rules and modalities under each agenda item. The developed countries, on the other hand, pressed for work under the APA to continue in the second week, informally, noting that there's less time for the completion of work.

Experts said that focus now shift to its implementation. The historic Paris Agreement, which was agreed by 197 nations last year, was supposed to come into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the convention, accounting for at least 55% of total GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, submit their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval. On 5th October 2016, the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was achieved and thus it will enter into force on 4 November. At present, 94 parties have ratified the convention. The first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1) will take place in Marrakech (Morocco) in conjunction with the COP 22 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting that is starting from 7 November . The CMA1 meeting will start on 15 November which is also the first day of the high-level segment of the COP22 and 18th is presumed to be last day of CMA1. The CMA1 meeting is expected to address matters relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement like modalities, procedures and guidelines. It will also look at the status of ratification of the Paris Agreement. India on 2 October became the 62nd country to ratify the Paris Climate Agreement after it submitted the required papers to the UN. Though experts are excited at the Paris Climate Agreement coming into force, they said the real work starts now. ""The real excitement around the response to climate change lies beyond the deals. The focus is increasingly shifting to practical tools to implement solutions. First among these is the effort to scale renewable energy, particularly with a focus on finance,"" said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, in his blog The Years blog. Besides finance, Ghosh said, clarity on trade and investment in green technology space and democratization of data related to emissions are the real nuts and bolts of operationalising climate-related agreements.

"COP22","India","COP22_India168","COP 22: Get in line or get out","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 16 -- I have been in Marrakesh for over two days now to attend the UN climate conference ( COP 22 ), and have heard nothing other than the word ""Trump"". The discussions at Bab Ighli-the venue of the conference-are all about the Trump presidency and the chances of American withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. A veritable flood of media reports on the issue has complemented these discussions. Considering that the Paris Agreement came into force just 10 days ago, there is no excitement at COP 22 ; the mood is one of mourning, not celebration. There are two strands of conversation taking place about Trump and the anticipated US withdrawal, one is straightforward and the other is spin-doctoring. The straightforward conversation is largely centred around speculation on how quickly and in which manner will Trump withdraw and its implications for the UN climate treaty. Within the climate change networks, legal documents are being exchanged about the possible route that Trump would take to leave the Paris Agreement. Reports are being circulated on the impact that the US withdrawal would have on funding of the UN Secretariat which organises these meetings. There are discussions on the fate of the Green Climate Fund and the proverbial mirage of billions of dollars that the developed countries promised to pay to the developing countries to combat climate change in Paris last year. There is a genuine concern about the fate of the Paris Agreement in these conversations. The other view Then there are the spin-doctors. Led by some US-based NGOs and academics (and involving some NGOs from other nations, including one from India), this group is trying to spin the conversation towards the view that the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement is not that important. According to members of this group, even without Trump's support, US industry and a few ""climate-friendly"" cities and states would ensure significant climate mitigation action domestically. Secondly, they are assuring everyone that the Paris Agreement will be alive and kicking even without the US. The arguments being put forth by these spin-doctors is bizarre. One US academic has written that even if Trump jettisons the Paris Agreement now, he will join later as he gets more information on the subject and sees market opportunities in climate-friendly technologies. A representative of a prominent US-based NGO has written that the US withdrawal is an opportunity for China to take leadership of the climate change negotiations. Some American NGOs are compiling a list of countries that have supported the Paris Agreement following Trump's victory to show that the US withdrawal would have little consequences for the Agreement. But the arguments of these apologists are hollow and misleading. Let's consider their contention that climate change mitigation would continue in the US despite Trump's victory by looking at the following facts: It is quite clear that fossil fuel production and consumption in the US is all set to increase in the coming years and Obama's Clean Power Plan will most probably be junked. With this, the US commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025 will be thrown out of the window. It is important to understand that this commitment itself was meagre. On a 1990 baseline the US would have reduced emissions by a mere 13-15 per cent by 2025. If the US cannot meet even this meagre target, then any talk of continued climate change action ""by states, cities, and businesses across the country"" is a joke. Let us now consider the argument that the Paris Agreement would have little effect even if the US withdraws. These facts are: In a nutshell, then, without the US, the Paris Agreement, as it stands today, is as good as dead. No amount of spin-doctoring can refute this fact. So, what is the way ahead? Should we try to convince Mr Trump to remain with the Paris Agreement (as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has reportedly alluded) or should we allow him to leave? Better off without US Whether the US stays or leaves, Mr Trump's presidency would be extremely destructive to the Paris Agreement. If it stays, Trump might do things that would be hugely detrimental. For instance, he may not provide the funds pledged. He may go back on the US commitment to cut down on emissions. He may demand disproportionate contributions from developing countries or demand a change in rules to suit US businesses .All this would slowly finish the Paris Agreement and even the UN Framework Convention. At a time when 2016 has been declared as the hottest year on record (with the global temperature about 1.2O Celsius above the pre-industrial era) and there is a huge mitigation gap to meet the 2OCelsius target, we need countries to cut more emissions and quickly. This is the only way we can remain within the 2OC target. But a Trump presidency would not allow this to happen. In fact, as stated above, the US would dumb-down the ambition of all countries so as to allow Mr Trump to open more coal mines and frack more gas wells. It is in this context that I think it might be better that the US leaves the Paris Agreement. The world has invested too much in these negotiations for the past quarter of a century to be destroyed by a climate change denier, who at the maximum would be the US president for the next eight years. Once the US withdraws, countries would have the time to do a reality check vis-a-vis the Paris Agreement. The US withdrawal might strengthen solidarity within countries. Countries may like to make changes in the Agreement and make it stronger. They may want to make the Agreement legally binding. They may come together and increase their emissions cut targets. They may decide to abrogate the Agreement entirely and work on a new one. We can only speculate the reaction of the remaining 194 countries, but what is quite clear is that the Paris Agreement without Trump is better than Paris Agreement with Trump. At least we will know who the enemy is! As the saying goes, ""those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it"". During the Kyoto Protocol negotiations, the US (under Bill Clinton's presidency) pushed everybody and reduced the emissions cut target for the developed countries from 20 per cent to mere 5 per cent. The fear of Republicans and the Congress was used to sign a weak Kyoto deal. Then Bush Junior came and walked away from the Kyoto Protocol. Obama and his team used the same tactics from Copenhagen onwards to dilute the UN convention. Again the fear of the Republican Party and the Congress was used to sign a weak Paris Agreement. And now, Trump is planning to withdraw from this Agreement as well. We should not let this happen again. The international community should never agree on a global climate agreement just for the convenience of one country, even if that country happens to be the most powerful (and polluting) country in the world. We should agree on a climate treaty, which is in the best interest of all, especially the poor and the vulnerable communities, and not for the expediency of a few.

The side event explored synergies between India and Africa on decentralized renewable energy solutions and discussed how Indian and African private sector could collaborate to propel Africa's climate smart growth. Both India and Africa face the daunting task of defining right to power and ensuring energy access. India and Africa have huge potential of collaboration to address the challenge of economic and energy poverty through decentralized and off-grid energy clean energy solutions. It was highlighted how adoption of clean energy in Africa is hampered not by the absence of right policies but by the dearth of innovation systems. Both India and Africa need market driven distributed architecture for clean energy production and consumption. It is important to make off-grid renewable energy solutions more affordable through economies of scale - as has been shown by the Indian example of massive uptake of LEDs and low-cost solar power from solar parks. There is huge scope for innovative business models in agro-forestry, waste management, solar pumps in the region. It is important to learn from successful models of financial inclusion such as m-pesa and m-kopa. The FICCI Side Event, most importantly, highlighted that India-Africa partnership must be based on domestication of technology. India and Africa can explore collaborative partnerships in three areas for upscaling off-grid clean energy - first, in development and adoption of standard for off-grid products/systems; second, in skilling; and third, in building innovation, both in terms of technology and business models.

"COP22","India","COP22_India173","Climate smart agriculture proposed at COP 22 raises concerns","November 18, 2016 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 18 -- Climate negotiations are in process at the 22nd Conference of Parties in Marrakech ( COP 22 ). This edition of the conference is being called ""Action COP"" or ""Agriculture COP"". Agriculture is one of the sectors worst affected by climate change. Agriculture is important from adaptation as well mitigation points of view. Most countries consider agriculture among their adaptation or mitigation priorities to help limit global temperature rise, in line with the Paris Agreement. About 95 per cent of all countries include this sector in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Major agriculture-related initiatives at COP The major initiatives for the agriculture sector, which have been have been proposed and frequently discussed at COP so far are Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA) and Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA). While GACSA was launched at COP 21 in Paris, AAA has been launched at COP 22 with much fanfare. Both of these initiatives are being promoted by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) along with various governments, especially African countries. GACSA claims that it aspires to improve farmers' agricultural productivity and incomes in a sustainable way. It also hopes to build farmers' resilience to extreme weather and changing climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. The AAA initiative aims to build the resilience in African farmers by promoting sustainable soil management, better water management and risk management linked with tailored capacity development, policies and funding mechanisms. AAA is already being supported by 28 African countries. Both of these initiatives look very promising and have focused on agriculture, a sector relatively neglected during climate negotiations. Both of these initiatives have one major common element-climate smart agriculture. The term was first coined by FAO in 2010 as a means to attract climate finance to its agricultural programmes in Africa. Major Concerns related to climate smart agriculture Conflict of interest and monopoly As of September 2016 GACSA had 154 members including governments, industries, institutions and non-profits. The founding membership and steering committee of GACSA also include fertiliser companies, their front groups and partner organisations. Of the alliance's 29 non-governmental founding members, there are three fertiliser industry lobby groups, two of the world's largest fertiliser companies (Yara of Norway and Mosaic of the US), and a handful of organisations working directly with fertiliser companies on climate change programmes. About 60 per cent of its private sector members, as of April 2016, were from the fertiliser industry says an analysis report by GRAIN, a non-profit organisation. Only a handful of corporations dominates the global fertiliser industry and have a powerful lobby. This makes for serious conflict of interests, as they will be influencing the climate strategy in favour of fertiliser industry. How climate smart agriculture is defined There is no precise definition for ""climate smart agriculture"" and deliberately so. The Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture instead leaves it to its members to determine what ""climate smart agriculture"" means to them. There are no social or environmental safeguards. This leaves a lot of ambiguity and raise serious concerns. For example, CGIAR, a FAO partner in GACSA, promotes climate smart ""success stories"", which promote the use of fertilisers and genetically-modified organisms, and make no mention of agroecology. These are controversial issues. In the current form, there is strong possibility that industrial agriculture will be promoted under GACSA in the name of climate smart agriculture. Industrial agriculture is more harmful, carbon intensive and adversely impact farmers and food sovereignty Industrial agriculture has a larger carbon footprint than agro-ecological farming. It requires more chemical fertilisers and pesticides, which are a major source of carbon emission in the agriculture sector. Fertilisers, especially nitrogen fertilisers, require an enormous amount of energy to produce, resulting into more carbon emissions. Chemical fertilisers are addictive. Because they destroy the natural nitrogen in the soils that is available to plants, farmers have to use more and more fertilisers every year to sustain yields. Over the past 40 years, the efficiency of nitrogen fertilisers has decreased by two-thirds and their consumption per hectare has increased by seven times. Studies demonstrate that chemical fertilisers are responsible for much of the massive loss of organic matter, the world's most important carbon sink, that has occurred in the world's soils since the pre-industrial era. As per a estimate by GRAIN, industrial food system contributes to the climate crisis, as between 44 - 57 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions come from global food system (Deforestration: 15-18 per cent emission, farming: 11-15 per cent, transport: 5-6 per cent, processing and packing: 8-10 per cent, freezing and retail: 2-4 per cent, food waste: 3-4 per cent). Why civil societies are worried Civil society warns that climate smart agriculture can take us in the wrong direction, falling short of ensuring food and nutrition security and undermining the radical transformation of current food and agricultural systems that the world urgently needs, to address climate change. There is a fear that seeds, fertilisers, pesticides promoted by big corporations multinationals will be pushed in the guise of climate smart agriculture. This will make farmers more and more dependent on market forces and hence increase their vulnerability and reduce their adaptive capacity. More than 350 organisations from all over the world-including Via Campesina (the world's largest peasant farmers' movement), Friends of the Earth, Slow Food and many oppose Climate-Smart Agriculture and its Global Alliance-want agro-ecology to be endorsed as the mainstream pillar of agricultural policy frameworks worldwide. Jarone Browne from Grassroots Global Justice, USA a member of Via Campesina says that climate smart agriculture is a false solution and we need to give the power of food production back in the hands of food producers by adopting agro-ecology. Actual solutions to climate crisis: Agro-ecological farming Agro-ecology is a holistic approach to agriculture, based on principles of ecology as well as food and nutrition security, food sovereignty and food justice which seek to enhance agricultural systems by using and recycling natural resources instead of relying on externally purchased inputs. It encourages local/national food production by small food producers and family farmers, and is based on techniques that are not delivered from the top-down, but developed from farmers' traditional knowledge and practices as well as from farmer innovations. This approach is based on farmers' participation and makes nature a powerful ally in ensuring food and nutrition security, building healthy soils and conserving water. It increases farmers' incomes and resilience in the face of climate change, while improving biodiversity and crop diversity. Research shows that farmers can stop using chemical fertilisers without reducing yields by adopting agro-ecological practices. This conclusion was supported by the 2008 International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, a three-year intergovernmental process involving over 400 scientists that was sponsored by the World Bank and other UN agencies. Therefore, the need of the hour is to promote true solutions for climate change and strongly reject the false solutions. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

The India Pavilion registered a heavy footfall, following the opening address by the Minister and the eye-catching LED display screens, Visual Book Projection and Aqua Curtains kept the visitors coming to the Pavilion, informed and engaged. The theme of the first session held in Marrakesh yesterday was, ""Sustainable Lifestyles and Climate Justice"". The session discussed the various factors that go into developing and evolving a sustainable lifestyle. The discussion also focused on how education had a major transformative role to play. This would involve not just formal education, but also non-formal and in-formal education. The session concluded that more evidence of the role education played in achieving climate change adaptation and mitigation was needed. Director, Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Mr. Kartikeya Sarabhai, mentioned how it was largely due to the efforts of the Prime Minister of India that lifestyle was included in the Charter of the Paris Agreement, 2015. Ms. Adriana Valenzuela, UNFCCC, pointed out how guidelines had been developed for Article 6 focal points, (on education, public awareness and empowerment) and will be launched during the current COP at Marrakech. Representatives from The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), Mr. Sanjay Seth and Ms. Swati Agarwal, spoke of how most of India's infrastructure is yet to be built and how issues of lifestyle can be integrated in the new developments. Mr. Alan Reid of Global Environment Education Partnership (GEEP) spoke of how education also needs to focus on values and a larger world view. Ms. Vijeta Rattani from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), shared data on consumption pattern in the USA and how it was grossly wasteful and many times that of developing countries. The event, organized by CEE, included participants from TERI, CSE, UNFCCC and GEEP.

"COP22","India","COP22_India180","'COP of action' is 'COP of distraction': CSE","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","The Times of India (TOI)","The twenty second Conference of Parties ( COP 22 ) which began here from November 7, 2016, ended on Sunday without making any breakthroughs under critical agenda items including agriculture, finance, adaptation and pre-2020 actions. COP 22 was billed as a 'COP of Action', but ended up being a 'COP of Distraction' -- primarily because of the US election results. ""Parties were not prepared for this meeting as the Paris Agreement got operationalised on November 4, 2016, much ahead of what was anticipated. Therefore, there has not been much progress on Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines (MPG) to operationalise the Paris Agreement with discussions being shifted to the next climate talks,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, CSE, who has been attending the negotiations. Climate change threat increasesScientific reports have pointed out that 2016 is the warmest year on record; efforts to curb climate change have been largely insufficient. This is substantiated by the Emissions Gap report released by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) on November 3, 2016 which says to keep the global temperature rise within 2OC, an additional emissions cut of 14 billion tonnes CO2e per year is required by 2030. Despite this, developed countries have not ratcheted up their ambition on finance or emission cuts for the pre-2020 period. ""This shows their total lack of commitment and seriousness as historical emitters in addressing the climate change issue,"" say CSE researchers. The election results in the US further slowed down the progress at Marrakech. ""With Donald Trump as the president-elect, there is now a big question mark on the survival of the Paris Agreement if the US chooses to opt out of it,"" added Chandra Bhushan. No breakthroughs on critical issuesOn finance, the big dispute between the developed and developing countries has revolved around the OECD Report ""Roadmap to US $100 Billion"" which says that the developed countries are already on a path to reach 67 billion USD (public finance) by 2020 to match their 2020 commitments of 100 billion USD. Developing countries have contested the methodologies and the numbers and have demanded more transparency on the issue. Adaptation: Discussions started on global goal of adaptation but no consensus could be reached. Developed countries were not ready to treat adaptation in the same way as mitigation and no meaningful discussions took place on how to assess adaptation actions and how it could be linked to the stocktaking process. The goal of raising 80 million USD for adaptation finance has been met with pledges announced by developed countries but it is not over and above the climate finance. Adaptation finance still makes up a meager 20 per cent of the climate finance by developed countries. Agriculture: This COP was also called as COP for Agriculture as some major outcomes were expected. Unfortunately, no draft conclusions were adopted for this issue and the US and EU blocked the negotiating paper - it was not even released as non-paper. Loss and Damage: The adoption of a five-year plan has been postponed to next year and the parties have agreed to talk about financial support to address loss and damage. No numbers were tabled, though. India at COP22 India had no clear position regarding issues affecting its poor, including agriculture, adaptation and loss and damage. The focus was on procedural issues such as transparency framework, global stocktake, market mechanisms and on sustainable lifestyle and environmental justice. ""India did not contribute much to the discussions on the issues that affects its poor and neither the Indian negotiators were willing to openly explain their position on these issues.

The Article 13 of the Paris Agreement establishes an enhanced transparency framework for action and support with built-in flexibility for developing countries. Under the APA, this issue is dealt with informal consultations convened by co-facilitators. In the informal note, the Parties expressed urgency to start the technical work in the next round of discussions in 2017. The Parties also supported the formation of work programme that can guide technical discussions in the form of technical workshops and dialogues. In the proposed work plan, the Parties also agreed on identification of linkages between transparency framework and other mechanisms of the Paris Agreement, including the global stocktake, accounting and complaince mechanism. Under the Paris Agreement, as also reiterated in the informal note, the Parties need to arrive at a consensus on modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs) for the transparency framework. They have to forge a common ground on how experience from the existing MRV arrangements under the Convention should inform the MPGs, how 'built-in' flexibility should be operationalised with respect to the developing countries and how to organise further work in 2017 and 2018. The Parties have also recognised the importance of targeted submissions on the issue of transparency framework focussing on issues like components of the MPGs, how to build on existing MRV mechanisms and operationalisation of flexibility which they are expected to make ahead of the next intersessional climate talks. In the last informal consultation on transparency, the floor was open to the Parties to make comments on the informal note. Both the developed and developing parties endorsed the informal note for its balanced outcome and expressed their willingness to take the work forward under this element.

"COP22","India","COP22_India183","India : Sessions at India Pavilion at Cop 22 Discuss Importance of Sustainable Practices to Fight Climate Change","November 11, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","The opening side-event at the India Pavilion at the ongoing Conference of Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, initiated a lively discussion on Sustainable Lifestyles and Climate Justice. Speaking after the inauguration of the Pavilion in Marrakech yesterday, Minister of State (Independent Charge) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Mr. Anil Madhav Dave, shared his thoughts on the importance of adopting Sustainable practices and termed it as the way forward to battle Climate Change. The India Pavilion registered a heavy footfall, following the opening address by the Minister and the eye-catching LED display screens, Visual Book Projection and Aqua Curtains kept the visitors coming to the Pavilion, informed and engaged. The theme of the first session held in Marrakesh yesterday was, Sustainable Lifestyles and Climate Justice. The session discussed the various factors that go into developing and evolving a sustainable lifestyle. The discussion also focused on how education had a major transformative role to play. This would involve not just formal education, but also non-formal and in-formal education. The session concluded that more evidence of the role education played in achieving climate change adaptation and mitigation was needed. Director, Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Mr. Kartikeya Sarabhai, mentioned how it was largely due to the efforts of the Prime Minister of India that lifestyle was included in the Charter of the Paris Agreement, 2015. Ms. Adriana Valenzuela, UNFCCC, pointed out how guidelines had been developed for Article 6 focal points, (on education, public awareness and empowerment) and will be launched during the current COP at Marrakech. Representatives from The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), Mr. Sanjay Seth and Ms. Swati Agarwal, spoke of how most of Indias infrastructure is yet to be built and how issues of lifestyle can be integrated in the new developments. Mr. Alan Reid of Global Environment Education Partnership (GEEP) spoke of how education also needs to focus on values and a larger world view. Ms. Vijeta Rattani from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), shared data on consumption pattern in the USA and how it was grossly wasteful and many times that of developing countries. The event, organized by CEE, included participants from TERI, CSE, UNFCCC and GEEP. Another side-event held yesterday was Session 2: Climate Change Adaptation Actions in India at the India pavilion at COP-22 . This session served as an important platform to deliberate on the lessons that have been learnt so far in terms of adaptation, planning, prioritization and implementation under national and international funding mechanisms. It also discussed the challenges being faced in terms of stakeholder engagement, technical and capacity building support and scaling-up of adaptation. The panel deliberated on sharing of national and international perspectives on Adaptation Actions, development of synergy of national and international funding mechanism for adaptation action in India and at the global level. Evolving a strategy for mainstreaming of adaptation action in development planning was also emphasised during the session. Addressing the gathering, Special Secretary Mr R R Rashmi, spoke of the National Action Plans and the State Action Plans. He emphasised the importance of Adaptation and said that 5 out of the 8 National Missions are exclusively devoted to Adaptation. He also pointed out to the successful preparation of State Action Plan on Climate Change, in line with the objectives of National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).

"COP22","India","COP22_India184","AfDB reaffirms supporting climate resilient and low-carbon development in Africa","May 30, 2016 Monday","Pivotal Sources","Zambia, May 30 -- The African Development Bank has reaffirmed its commitment to mobilize resources to help African countries adopt and mitigate climate change. This commitment underpins its 2013-2022 Strategy promoting inclusive and green growth in Africa. Almost US $7 billion has been committed to projects in support of climate resilient and low-carbon development in the past four years. However, ahead of the upcoming UN climate talks, COP22 , which will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from November 7 to 18, 2016, the Bank is calling for implementation of the Paris Agreement, especially ensuring that climate financing is urgently delivered for African countries which are most vulnerable to climate change shocks. Last year, the Bank's support contributed significantly to ensuring that Africa's concerns were addressed in the Paris Agreement at COP21. The Bank has also committed to triple its climate change finance to about US $5 billion per year and to provide US $12 billion on renewable energy investments by 2020. In keeping with the Bank's New Deal on Energy for Africa, that provides a good entry point for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and given that COP22 is a key milestone for the implementation of that agreement, it is important that Africa is fully on board, while ensuring linkages with the Bank's High 5 priorities. According to Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group, the current climate financing architecture is not providing the finance Africa needs. ""Much more needs to be done to increase Africa's access to climate finance,"" Adesina said Friday, May 27, 2016, during a high-level panel on climate change, ""Towards COP22 in Marrakech : What are the issues at stake?"", on the last day of the Bank's 2016 Annual Meetings. Adesina pointed out that Africa, which contributes less than 3 per cent of the global greenhouse emissions, is suffering from the effects of El Ni\'f1o, which has caused severe drought in 14countries with 13 located in East and Southern Africa. Citing Kenya and Rwanda, which have had devastating floods, with over 8.4 million people facing food insecurity in Malawi and 15 million in Ethiopia, as well as vast areas of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Botswana, Adesina pointed out that the continent is already feeling the shocks of climate change. To support these countries, AfDB has allocated funds to the tune of US $549 million. Adesina demanded for ""climate justice"" for Africa, calling on the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility to ""pay for the insurance premium of African countries to the Africa Risk Capacity Agency."" ""This will allow them to cope with extreme climate events ... like Senegal which received US $17 million payout to mitigate the impacts of drought. AfDB will lead the way and triple its climate finance to US $5 billion per year by 2020,"" Adesina said. For his part, Moroccan Foreign Minister and Chairman of COP22 Steering Committee, Salaheddine Mezouar, pledged that the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) will be an event of action and an occasion to implement the Paris agreement.

"COP22","India","COP22_India186","Belgium : From Paris to Marrakesh: implementing the global climate agreement","July 2, 2016 Saturday","TendersInfo","The European Committee of the Regions hosted a high-level debate on June 29 about how to implement the Paris agreement. The challenge is to convert climate commitments into bankable projects. It is now time to bring the Paris climate agreement into life: making multi-level governance operational, setting up target assessment mechanisms and developing tailored climate finance services to move forward. These are some of the issues local and regional leaders discussed in Brussels during a high-level debate at the European Committee of the Regions with the presence of members of European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank in addition to Moroccan authorities. The COP22 world climate summit in Marrakesh next November is to take the Paris agreement from adoption to action. Paris agreed to limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2C and track progress through a robust transparency and accountability system. It also acknowledged for the first time the importance that non-state actors play in the fight against global warming, referring in particular to regions and cities as they implement around 70% of climate related decisions. On the road to the next global climate summit in Marrakesh, the European Committee of the Regions is promoting the debate on how to convert the Paris pledges into concrete results on the ground. At stake are the role cities and regions play in combatting climate change and the further support they need to implement climate mitigation and adaptation measures locally. Francesco Pigliaru , President of Sardinia and of the Commission for Environment, Climate Change and Energy of the CoR stated: "" The COP22 will open a new era: an era of improved cooperation with us, the ""non-party"" stakeholders. We now need to implement the agreement within our respective constituencies. Further assessment and support mechanisms are to be developed to make sure all countries abide by the commitments they made in Paris. The COP22 will have to make these newly created mechanisms operational. The positive and ambitious spirit of Paris has to be maintained as these instruments are rolled out . Francesco Pigliaru is the rapporteur of a CoR opinion to be adopted next October on Delivering the global climate agreement a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakesh . The Italian Member of the European Parliament Simona Bonaf declared: "" Tangible measures are expected in order to reach the objectives set by the historical and ambitious Paris agreement. Regions and cities will play a central role in the transition towards a low carbon society, particularly in the transport and buildings sectors, which are not covered by EUs Emissions Trading System. The investments required to make the change possible are impressive. More synergies are needed between public and private financing as well as between different European funds "". Philip Owen , responsible for climate finance at the European Commission stressed that the EU is supporting cities and regions in implementing the Paris Climate agreement by providing financial support, through the European Fund for Strategic Investment, cohesion and regional funds but also through specific instruments such as the Natural Capital Financing Facility and the Private Finance for Energy Efficiency, resulting from EIB and LIFE funds . We need to convert what we have committed to into bankable projects, said Esther Badiola from the European Investment Bank. EIB has EUR 100 billion for climate action loans until 2020 at the disposal of local and regional authorities but also private actors. We call cities and regions to request information and benefit from our innovative climate finance products which are tailored to the necessities of each specific case , added Esther Badiola. The Mayor of Rabat Mohamed Sadiki and the Deputy Mayor of Marrakesh Awatif Berdai were amongst the panellists. Morocco will invest all its capacity to make the COP22 a success. This is a global mobilization of our State, elected representatives, civil society, researchers and the private sector. It is also an opportunity for the Kingdom of Morocco to affirm its commitment to the environment and the fight against global warming , said Mohamed Sadiki. With the support of Moroccan authorities, the CoR is to organise a cities summit during COP22 to continue the discussion on the implementation of the Paris climate agreement, reinforce climate multilevel governance and promote the Covenant of Mayors in Morocco and beyond. Around 30 members of the CoR recently became Covenant of Mayors Ambassadors, a group of local and regional leaders engaged in promoting the benefits of joining the Covenant, EU's largest energy and climate initiative. \"

Spread over 3,000 acres in south-central Morocco, the Noor Solar Plant 1 uses CSP technology instead of PV panels and aims to tap carbon emissions by 280,000 tonnes per year once it becomes fully functional in 2017. COP22 climate conference, the 160 GW plant, which is operated by the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), is all set to reach its peak 580 GW capacity by 2022. Built for $9 billion, the plant will fulfil the energy demands of over 1.1 million people. The other three units will be functional by 2017, 2020 and 2022, all using the latest Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technology that uses heat to produce steam that powers the turbines to generate electricity. The conventional technology employs photovolatic (PV) panels. ""There are over 555,000 CSP mirrors installed. The mirrors focus the sun's light and heat up a synthetic liquid up to 400 degrees, that flows through pipes at the focus of the mirrors. When mixed with water, steam produced from this process drives a turbine and generates electrical power,"" a technician explained. Though CSP is more expensive to install, unlike the widely used PV panels, it enables the storage of energy for nights and cloudy days. ""The price is cheaper, it's about 14 cents for peak hour. For Noor 1, the price had dropped by 42 percent, we hope that they would further drop,"" an official said. ""The plan will provide 42 per cent of total power demand of Morocco by 2020 and 52 per cent by 2030,"" MASEN officials said. The Climate Investment Fund (CIF) says that Morocco depends on over 90 percent of fossil fuel imports to meet its energy demands. The Noor plant is seen as Morocco's giant leap to clean energy and a reason why it was chosen to host the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ). As per experts at COP22 , the Noor project has come up at a time when demand for energy in Morocco increased to about seven per cent annually. The Moroccan power company believes that the project will positively impact the surrounding area. With about half a million people in Ouarzazate and 23 per cent poverty, the hope is that a better supply with cleaner energy would reduce the flickering lightbulbs and malfunctioning hospital equipment. India pioneered the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which was singed by over 21 countries, including France, at Marrakech during COP22 , and its solar mission is the fastest-growing in the world. The lessons, however, India can learn from Morocco is the record time in which Noor was made functional and the technology it is using. About 300 million people in India have no access to electricity at all. ""India has its own ambitions and it's on track to meet its solar targets. However, there will be challenges in storage and balancing,"" Karan Mangotra, Fellow, The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI), said here on the sidelines of COP22 . # Kushagra Dixit was in Marrakech at TERI's invitation. \"

Contributing to the energy revolution, Mr. Paddy Padmanathan, President & CEO of ACWA Power recognized that: While Solar energy has a significant role in not only decarbonizing energy generation but also in catering for the rapidly increasing demand for new capacity to fuel industrialization, economic development and municipal serves improvement in Morocco but also to provide energy access to large parts of the underserved continent of Africa, policy makers, technology providers, investors, owners and operators need to work together to create the appropriate legal, infrastructural and regulatory environment to reduce risk and encourage investment with a long term mindset. Our $2.8 billion solar facility at Ouarzazate, Morocco is a testament to what a partnership between an active and visionary government and an investor with a time horizon spanning decades can achieve. Following on from Photovoltaica, the worlds focus on renewable energy will once again be directed towards Morocco in November when Marrakesh hosts the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Given its prominent role in Moroccos renewable energy focus, ACWA Power is also proud and privileged to play a leading role to support Morocco at COP22 which will serve the critical role of catalyzing the momentum built with the consensus achieved at COP 21 in Paris last year when the historic agreement was reached amongst 200 nations. \"

The newest members of the Under 2 Coalition were announced today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Marrakesh, Morocco, which Mr Rattenbury is attending. The ACT has played a strong leadership role on climate change and clean energy, and is on track to achieve our 100% renewable electricity target by 2020, said Shane Rattenbury, Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability. By signing this MOU, we have now joined with 165 other cities and sub-national governments from 33 countries, representing over a billion people, in setting targets that are consistent with a desire to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees. Under the new Greens-ALP Parliamentary Agreement, the ACT Government has committed to going even further - reaching zero net emissions by 2050 at the latest and setting firm interim emissions targets to get us there. The strength of the Under 2 MOU is in the shared commitment from so many cities and sub-national governments from across the world to make a difference and to show others what can be done. The ACT can play a leadership role by sharing with other jurisdictions our strong progress on meeting our renewable energy targets through our innovative reverse auction processes for large scale projects. Canberra is fast becoming a hub for investment, training and research in renewables. We have the fastest growth rate of renewable energy jobs in Australia; four national and international wind companies have established their headquarters here and there are significant training programs underway at CIT and ANU. While there are obvious environmental benefits from taking action on climate change, the ACT is also committed to diversifying our local economy by investing in the energy technologies of the future, Mr Rattenbury said. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India198","COP22: parties discuss ways to enhance transparency framework for climate action","November 10, 2016 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 10 -- The Article 13 of the Paris Agreement establishes an ""enhanced transparency framework for action and support"". Action implies the activities related to mitigation, adaptation, finance and support provided to developing countries in terms of finance and technology transfer. It further talks of ""built-in flexibility"" which will take into account different capacities of the Parties, thus, recognising specific needs of developing countries, especially Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). It further says that this process shall be non-punitive, non-intrusive and facilitative and respecting national sovereignty. The rules and modalities of the framework are expected to be in place by 2018. Why is transparency framework important? The transparency framework is intended to gain clarity on the progress of actions undertaken by the Parties in terms of mitigation and adaptation. Clarity on adaptation actions would be more relevant, as till now there has been no such mechanism to track adaptation efforts by the Parties. Further, the purpose of the framework is also to gain clarity on support provided and received. The overall process is expected to foster a sense of trust among the Parties and gain better understanding of the work undertaken by the Parties. The transparency framework, which is being operated nationally, holds the governments accountable to their citizens in the context of the sufficiency of efforts they are taking under Paris Agreement commitments. The citizens, thus, have an opportunity to know and understand what the government is doing. The framework also talks of ""built-in flexibility"" for developing countries signaling at some sort of differentiation, although the term is not defined or operationalised. One can expect more multilateral engagements among the Parties for sharing information on their respective actions and gain experiences and understanding on best practices, gaps and loopholes in the process of reporting and also on the progress of their actions. In contrast to global stocktake process, which is meant to assess collective progress of Parties, the transparency framework provides for national review of the actions undertaken by country. This framework, thus, will work like a pre-review mechanism, before the global stocktake, where countries check their individual progress on climate actions. The outcome of this can, subsequently, allow the governments to plan and ratchet up their efforts. According to the Paris Agreement, the outcome of the transparency mechanism would provide for inputs to the global stocktake that would take place in 2023. What does the Paris Agreement do not explain about transparency framework? The Agreement does not elaborate on the reporting structure: will it be nationally determined or whether it will be replaced by new reporting structures? The Agreement, however, hints at building on existing reporting mechanisms and guidelines under the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC. At the same time, 'enhanced' transparency framework points to transformed transparency framework but the transition is not defined. Developing countries that do not have much experience in reporting of actions and support would require constitution of new reporting structures. They are not capacitated for this and would require support from developed countries. For common transparency framework, the Parties have to agree on common baseline years for reporting, common reporting criteria and methods, which seem like a mammoth task. What is built-in flexibility? Although the transparency framework does talk of a built-in flexibility to developing countries (SIDS and LDCs), it does not operationalise what it actually means. It looks as if differentiation may be the key element of flexibility. But, the Parties have to agree on the scope and definition of flexibility on whether it is related to timeline, structure or outcome of reporting or all of them. Transparency framework is linked to global stocktake, accounting and compliance mechanisms that are all part of the Paris Agreement. What is not clear is how transparency would relate to other processes. There are currently gaps in reporting, especially on finance, even in developed countries such as Germany. These gaps need to be addressed. The issue of double counting also needs to be addressed. What are the Parties saying? On November 9, at the informal consultations on matters related to transparency framework, developing countries, including India, China, G-77, least developed countries and Arab group put forth a recommendation that the process of reporting has to be nationally determined. It would require support from developed countries. They also highlighted the need of capacity building and guidelines related to common transparency framework. Their focus was on the need for enhanced action and on flexibility as mentioned in the Paris Agreement. The flexibility is understood largely in terms of differentiation by the developing countries that advocated bifurcated approach to reporting. They agreed on the importance of national communications but also referred to gaps in current reporting which needs to be addressed. The developed countries led by the EU and New Zealand focused on the importance of submissions of technical papers and reports prepared by the Parties. The developing countries said that they lacked capacity to do so. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

This follows a period of downward revisions to the economic growth forecasts and volatility in financial and commodities markets globally, impacted by the slowdown from China and oil prices slump over a two year period. The Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) discussions in Marrakech were clouded by Trumps threat to pull the US out of the COP21 Paris climate change accord. While it may be difficult for the US to unilaterally scuttle the accord, since most of the world countries have affirmed their commitment to de-carbonization, the challenge lies in actually meeting the US$100 billion/year financial commitments and also agreement on the transparency of future climate monitoring. However economics will drive the substantial investments in clean and green technologies, led by China and India. We expect 2017 to be a transition year for long term changes, globally.

"COP22","India","COP22_India204","The Trump effect","November 23, 2016 Wednesday","Business Line","Mumbai, Nov. 23 -- Last year 197 countries said what they could do to keep the planet from heating up and in Paris pledged to keep their word in what became known as the Paris Agreement. The idea was to limit global warming to 2 degrees from the average of the pre-industrialisation period of the late 19th century, by the year 2100. Everybody hailed the Paris Agreement as ""historic"". In fact, it was nothing more than a loosely-worded joint statement that would bind the signatories to keeping their word, with no penalties for breach, except public shame. Enter Donald Trump. The President-elect of the United States is pro-fossil fuels, doesn't believe global warming is happening and doesn't like the Paris Agreement. He has left the world with the juddering thought that the US, the world's second largest emitter after China, will pull out of the Agreement. This implies that the US would produce and burn more coal and oil and many other countries might follow suit. There is little evidence of Trump listening to wiser counsels. Since the election of Trump came on the second day of the 22ndmeeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP22 , at Marrakech, Morocco, the conference practically began on a negative note. There wasn't much to be expected out of it anyway, but the development across the Atlantic was a big minus. It is not surprising therefore that the COP22 ended with a 'Marrakech Action Proclamation', which is a mass of sentences that are either self-congratulatory or calls for action. ""Not bold enough,"" says Arivudai Nambi Appadurai, Strategy Head - Climate Resilience Practice, World Resources Institute, who was at COP22 . If the COP was meant to make rules for redemption of the promises made at Paris, there was little success in making developed countries sign up to modalities of their finance pledge, as mentioned in Article 9 of the Paris Agreement. Paragraph 1 of Article 9 says, ""developed country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation""; Paragraph 7 says that developed countries ""shall provide transparent and consistent information on support for developing country parties..."" So, how much would the developed countries provide and when? A 'COP of Action' should have tried to get answers to such questions. The conference clearly failed the developing world on funding. The Global Climate Fund, annual contributions to which are supposed to rise to $100 billion by 2020, has so far gathered $ 10 billion - cumulatively. Against such an order of funding requirement, COP22 saw tiny commitments under various other heads: $23 million for a centre for promote sharing of clean energy technology; $50 million for helping developing countries keep better track of their greenhouse gas emissions; and $80 million for Adaptation Fund - and these were touted as a success of the conference. There are doubts about even this little money reaching developing countries. Bangladesh's environment minister, Anwar Hossain Manju, said that based on past experience ""we cannot be confident that the road map will generate the expected level of funds and delivered on time."" Similarly, there was dismay over the apathy towards 'pre-2020' action. The Paris Agreement is all about what countries would do after 2020, but that doesn't mean the world can go on a holiday till then. There were calls, including from India's Joint Secretary on Climate Change, Ravi Prasad, that 'pre-2020' could not be abandoned. The most that came out of it was a call in the Proclamation for ""further climate action and support, well in advance of 2020."" COP22 The best of the cries to Trump was made by the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, whose entire speech seemed to be addressed to his next President. He appealed to ""those in power in all parts of the world, including my own, who may be confronted with decisions about which road to take at this critical juncture"" and implored the ""leaders"" to see what the Pope had to say and what the global business community felt about climate change. On the overall, COP22 was a lacklustre conference. Nambi Appadurai describes it as ""subdued"" but nevertheless ""grease we needed to keep the wheels going"". But clearly the wheels are neither running fast enough nor in the right direction, even if Donald Trump does not turn them backwards. \"

Brown Jr. today welcomed America's closest neighbors - Mexico and Canada - to the growing Under2 Coalition, a global pact of cities, states and countries pledging to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. With Canada and Mexico's endorsements, the Under2 Coalition now includes 170 jurisdictions on six continents that collectively represent more than 1.18 billion people and $27.5 trillion GDP - equivalent to 16 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the global economy. ""We are forming our own Under2 Coalition and we are going to recruit, mobilize and work with all the states and provinces and countries. That includes Canada and Mexico, which are key partners in turning the tide against climate catastrophe,"" said Governor Brown. ""We are on the side of science and truth and whatever the flimflam artists do or say, we are going to overcome that."" The announcement followed Governor Brown's remarks at the Navigating the American Carbon World conference in San Francisco, hosted by the Climate Action Reserve, and meetings with Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna and Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Undersecretary Rodolfo Lacy. ""The governments in the Under2 coalition, like California, are leading the fight against climate change. They know that investing in clean growth will help all members reach their ambitious climate change goals and grow their countries' economies. I applaud their leadership in reducing emissions and supporting clean innovation. Canada is proud to endorse their actions today,"" said Minister McKenna. In today's meeting, Minister McKenna and Governor Brown also discussed the strong economic and environmental partnerships between California and Canada's provinces and cities and the close trade ties Canada shares with America and California. In fact, Canada is California's second largest trading partner and of the nine million American jobs that depend on trade with Canada, 1.2 million are in California. ""In Mexico, the short, medium and long term strategies are carried out in congruence with the National Programs and based on the General Law of Climate Change with regard to the implementation of public policies through the National System of Climate Change, in which the participation of state and municipal governments plays a fundamental role in the achievement of objectives and goals. Those actions also contribute to the commitments made by our country in international fora, particularly within the framework of the UNFCCC,"" said Undersecretary Lacy. While the majority of signatories to the Under2 Coalition represent subnational jurisdictions - including a number of Mexican and Canadian cities, provinces and states - with the addition of Canada and Mexico today and Sweden yesterday, more than a dozen nations have now joined the global pact. The Under2 Coalition, which is made up of the jurisdictions that have signed or endorsed the Under2 MOU, was formed in 2015 by the states of California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany to mobilize and galvanize bold climate action from like-minded city, state and regional governments around the globe. Coalition members pledge to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 2 tons per capita or 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. ""The Under2 Coalition provides an unprecedented opportunity for jurisdictions from all over the world to come together and scale up innovative policy solutions to tackle climate change. We welcome the endorsements of Sweden, Mexico and Canada to the coalition, which is an invaluable tool to position them at the forefront of driving sustainable and prosperous economies,"" said The Climate Group Chief Executive Officer Helen Clarkson. The Climate Group serves as the secretariat for the Under2 Coalition, helping members share expertise and policy solutions, while tracking progress toward delivering on commitments. California's Leadership on Climate Change Last month, Governor Brown reaffirmed California's commitment to exceed the targets of the Clean Power Plan and the state's efforts to curb carbon pollution, which include establishing the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor has also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. The Governor has traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India209","'Development should factor in climate change'","September 3, 2016 Saturday","The Hindu","MUMBAI, Sept. 3 -- Climate change treaties have been notoriously hard to implement in the past, but the Paris Agreement, signed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference last year, could be a different story. That's according to U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Dr. Jonathan Pershing who says that the will of countries, such as India and the United States, to expedite change could see the agreement come into force as early as this year. Dr. Pershing was speaking to students at the Xavier Institute of Communication on Friday, days after he had arrived in India to attend the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue as co-chair of the U.S.-India Joint Working Group on Combating Climate Change. The group was formed to review progress made in the bilateral relationship on climate resilience, air quality, forestry, capacity building and clean energy, and to discuss opportunities for future collaboration in shared climate priorities. Dr. Pershing said, ""The conversation between India and the U.S. is strongly focused on advancing our work. It is both technical and academic, with interactions between experts and academics on both sides."" The meetings between the two governments, he said, focused on how the two sides could increase interactions in terms of experts travelling each way for fellowships. He highlighted that the talks looked at the question of climate resilience in a new light. ""The question of resilience has often not been given that much importance as countries have focused more on the policy changes they can make to combat climate change, but in some cases it has to be acknowledged that climate change is already happening and we have to look at ways to manage it."" Dr. Pershing said, ""While we were speaking about resilience, there was a massive rain in New Delhi when it looked like we were walking out into rivers of water. So the immediacy of the question of climate resilience was evident right there."" In the area of resilience, Dr. Pershing said, discussions were held about water, agriculture, food, energy systems, and the focus once again was on the kind of expertise each side can contribute to the other. He said, ""Each department has been given a clear mandate that they cannot think about development without factoring in the question of climate change. Decisions will not be made that keep the question of climate change separate."" \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India210","How smart India can be green","September 21, 2016 Wednesday","Mirror Publications","Awide range of new ideas on climate change action in India are being formed around COP 22 to be held in Marrakesh in November 2016. Climate change is not a global environmental issue alone, but a local economic development action. This is the idea India is developing to present at COP22 in Marrakesh. The recent National Round Table on Towards Climate Compatible Green Growth Development: Achievements and Opportunities held in Delhi underlined this idea. The Round Table was organized by Ahmedabad based All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) with support from the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN). COP 21Paris agreement is taken seriously by India. Key ideas are being implemented though official ratification will take time. In India, at sub-national level, a wide range of actions are being taken by authorities and citizens that often go unnoticed to national and global viewers. This is unfair. India continues to lead many countries in the Commonwealth as well as the UN system. India has a wide range of applied knowledge on mitigation and adaptation to share. This knowledge is fast growing in the areas of efficient use of energy- use of energy efficient light bulbs, promoting the decentralized solar energy use; using green bonds to finance green activities; agro forestry, in peri-urban areas; and weather attribution to flood and heatwave hazards. Urban areas of India are a key to reduce emission as well as start addressing challenges of reducing poverty with sustainable solutions. New prosperity is pushing sales of cars and air conditioners in Indian cities such as Ahmedabad and even smaller towns like Mehsana and Valsad. More and more ground water is pumped out in the cities using energy. Sewerage is pumped away from the cities, causing carbon emission. Indian cities offer a challenge to emission reduction as well as an opportunity for green economic growth. Financial institutions of India are developing the capacity to mobilize ""green"" funds and the capacity to use funds for ""green"" activities. Government of India has supported NABARD with such green funds to work in rural economies. Initial efforts to mobilize green bonds from international markets have seen encouraging success. YES Bank, AXIS Bank, and others are leading this investment trend. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) offers credentials and capacities to mobilize global green money for local green activities in India. Niti Ayog has pointed out the need to find ways to expand government's green initiatives such as Ujwala that offers LPG cylinders to poor rural women. What works? And how? What will it take to widespread this to millions of rural women? This is what India is focusing on when making its key economic activities climate compatible. Work of Tata Steel in the private sector in developing low-carbonemission and low-water-use agriculture in coastal Odisha is another example. The company is working with tribals and farmers to enhance their income and assets by moving to local use of agriculture inputs (reducing transport cost), organic fertilizers, and irrigation that uses more and more ecosystem based approaches. In India a lot is going on at the state and district level. The Bihar State Disaster Management Authority with UNICEF is working on making women climate change risk literate by sharing scientific knowledge on climate and weather in local language as well as by promoting local methods and technology to use and reuse water when drought strikes. In Jharkhand UNDP and state departments have taken initiative to better harvest water to reduce both, water footprint as well as the carbon footprint of agriculture sector. In Uttarakhand, the government approved a climate action work plan based on vulnerability analysis conducted by INRM of IIT Delhi and Indian Science Insitute of Bangalore and offered full support to make the proposed climate centre of the state one of the best across Himalayas. Three areas come up for action. One, green growth is not a climate or environment action, but an action cutting across all development sectors of India. Two, the urban development sector-buildings, electricity, transport, business-is a key to set pace of actions at which emission will reduce and prosperity will increase in India. Three, finance sector will leverage ongoing development investments to be used differently so as to transform into greener activities. Green finance in India is best suited to leverage mainstream development investments in roads, bridges, townships, schools, and hospitals. India will have a lot more and new to offer to its global family at COP 22 Marrakesh. - Mihir Bhatt is founder and director of All India Disaster Mitigation Institute For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \"

Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland and the United States made the announcement this morning on the sidelines of the COP summit being held in Marrakech. The pledge is a major shot in the arm for efforts to provide request-oriented and tailored assistance for capacity building and technology in developing countries. The CTCN is a UN institution and the implementation arm of the Technology Mechanism to help nations realise their commitments under the Paris Agreement. The CTCN functions as a facilitator in harnessing expertise from a network of over 230 technology institutions from multiple sectors around the world for usage in developing countries as per their requests. Reportedly, the CTCN has received 160 requests for assistance from countries for different kinds of technological support to tackle climate change. ""We have received requests from 70 countries and have forwarded support in several sectors ranging from policy to feasibility of technology specific to conditions. We are utilising the best expertise in several of these sectors and try to provide it to the countries who express their needs,"" said Jukka Uosukainen, the head of the CTCN. The pledges, however, do not mean that there shall be a transfer of intellectual property or patents to developing countries but are only the means to get expert opinion and assistance in identifying and deploying technologies, as was clarified by Jonathan Pershing, the US special envoy for climate change. The special envoy, though, once again refused to speculate on how the election of Trump shall affect this process. The transfer of technology has been a longstanding and contentious demand of developing countries, that has been reiterated at several forums and platforms and the announcement today hinted at the posturing of the developed countries regarding the transfer of technology. ""I would prefer that we move away from the term technology transfer and use technology sharing instead since in the ICT world that we live in, technology development is a shared endeavour. Sharing would ensure that the process is two-way, instead of just uni-directional,"" said Roberto Ridolfi, director of European Commission for Sustainable Growth and Development, speaking on behalf of the European Commission.

"COP22","India","COP22_India220","Get real: Why Donald Trump must heed Morocco\\x92s King Mohammed VI\\x92s COP 22 speech on climate change","November 23, 2016 Wednesday","TOI.com & ET.com Blogs","There\\x92s no denying the fact that the biggest shock to the ongoing 22nd Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco, has been the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. From what we know of Trump, he is a climate change denier and believes that global warming is a hoax. In fact, not only was this part of his campaign pitch, but also according to sources within Trump\\x92s transition team he is looking at ways to get the US out of the historic Paris Accord \\x96 which saw world nations commit to restrict the rise in global average temperature to below 2 degree Celsius over pre-industrialisation levels \\x96 that was inked last year.In fact, the Marrakech summit is where the international community is supposed to formulate mechanisms to implement the Paris Accord. But if the incoming US administration is looking to get out of its climate change mitigation commitments \\x96 such as contributing to a Green Climate Fund of $100 billion by 2020 and transferring clean energy technology to developing countries \\x96 then the hard won global consensus on fighting climate change risks coming undone.Against this backdrop, people are putting their hopes on Trump in office approaching the issue of climate change very differently from what he had promised during his campaign. After all, the US president-elect has shown himself to be flexible. Combined with the fact that he has the reputation of a pragmatic businessman, and many environmentalists pray that Trump will eventually accept the science behind climate change. In this regard, Trump would do well to heed Morocco\\x92s King Mohammed VI\\x92s speech at the high-level segment of COP 22 . Here are some extracts from the important address of the North African leader:\\x93Today, the Marrakech Conference is a decisive turning point in the implementation process of the historic Paris Agreement.The whole of mankind is pinning great hopes on the resolutions to be endorsed. It is expecting more than just a declaration of commitments and principles to curb greenhouse warming and mitigate its effects.Indeed, humanity is looking forward to decisions which will help save the future of life on earth, and calling for tangible initiatives and practical steps to preserve the rights of coming generations.Holding this conference in Africa is an incentive for us to give priority to tackling the adverse repercussions of climate change, which are growing worse and worse in the countries of the South and in insular states whose very existence is in jeopardy.\\x94\\x93Our commitment to addressing the problematic issue of climate change through the implementation of the Paris Agreement, reflects our shared desire to enhance inter-generational solidarity.Such involvement is a moral necessity and a human obligation. It must be based on the firm belief in the inevitability of our shared destiny, and on genuine North-South solidarity for the sake of human dignity.Plenty of promises were made at previous conferences. But our conference today is a conference of truth and clarity, a conference for responsibilities to be shouldered before God and History and before our peoples.Will our conferences and agreements have any meaning if we leave it up to the most fragile segments of population over there, on the islands threatened by outright disappearance and in the fields grappling with the risk of desertification in Africa, Asia and Latin America, to face a destiny fraught with danger?The environmental issue is a critical problem which must be tackled in the most serious and responsible way.The era of colonialism is over. The logic of imposing decisions is over. What is at stake is the very existence of man. It is therefore our joint duty to work hand in hand to protect him.\\x94\\x93Wait-and-see attitudes and negligence when addressing climate change and its effects will lead to dire consequences, jeopardise security and stability and exacerbate the already expanding hotspots of tension and crises throughout the world.In the name of our shared destiny and in the name of our historic responsibility, I urge all parties to work on translating our commitment to the values of justice and solidarity into actions, by: Providing the countries of the South, especially the least developed, as well as insular states, with such urgent financial and technical support as will enhance their capacities and enable them to adapt to climate change; Advanced countries honouring their commitments and mobilising $100 billion at least, by 2020, which was the key to the Paris Agreement; All the parties being involved in facilitating the transfer of technology, and working for the development of research and innovation in the field of climate; Non-Governmental players, including companies, local communities, NGOs from civil society, giving strong impetus to the Global Climate Action Agenda.\\x94In the above extracts, King Mohammed VI has made a strong case for continued cooperation on climate change. He has made it clear that the international community must fight this challenge together to safeguard the future of humanity. And if any country, at this point, seeks to turn its back on climate change mitigation efforts, totally ignoring the scientific data, then it is the duty of the international community to gang up against it.True, without the United States the success of the Paris Accord would certainly be in doubt. But the incoming Trump administration in Washington must know that the world is well past the point of inaction on climate change. It\\x92s the duty of the international community and all global stakeholders to convince Trump of this fact. The Moroccan monarch\\x92s speech serves as a good platform. \"

The alliance, a brainchild of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was announced at the COP21 in Paris. The ISA's objective is to bring together solar rich countries on a common platform to make joint efforts through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity building measures and financial instruments to increase solar energy capacity. It's future, however, had become uncertain following differences between India and the US over its precise nature.While India wanted it to be ratified through a treaty which all member countries would sign and which would be registered with the UN, the US wanted an organization of a more informal nature without any such treaty. The differences have since been ironed out, though precisely what will be ratified at COP22 has not been spelt out.  It has the US's full support, a senior government official said. Industry watchers were delighted with the development.  It is remarkable that what was announced at COP21 is being ratified within a single year, said Jean Pascal Pham Ba, spokesperson for The Terrawatt Initiative, a global non-profit for furthering the goals of the ISA.

Coal India and NALCO are also likely to announce similar contributions soon. India has also set aside five acres of land in Gurgaon, next to the National Institute of Solar Energy, to house the headquarters of the ISA. An informal target of the ISA is to have 1 terawatt (1 million MW) of global solar power by 2030, which will require an investment of $1 trillion. (Current global capacity is around 230,000 MW).  For that there will have to be access to low cost of capital, credit en hancement mechanisms, and standardised regulation on quality control, said Jean Pascal Pham Ba,  We will also unveil a standard template for solar project documents which will be acceptable to all finance institu tions at the forth coming COP22 .

Marrakesh, Morocco is hosting the COP22 from November 7-18, where international climate leaders will come together to focus on the urgent actions needed to ensure the Paris Agreement is implemented. We need a global financial system thats fit for purpose to factor in climate risks and opportunities, said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. Developing a green bond market is key to mobilizing the private capital flows needed to address climate change. We were delighted to collaborate with the Central Bank of Morocco on this important initiative. ""Having become increasingly aware of the effects of climate change, at the COP22 in Marrakesh, countries are now specifying how to achieve commitments made in Paris. Bank Al-Maghrib's investment in World Bank Green Bonds has been made in that context. The investment will support sustainable development projects financed by the World Bank, including in countries in Africa."" said Mr. Abdellatif Jouahri, Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib. The 3-year USD 100 million bonds mature on December 15, 2019, and have a semi-annual fixed rate coupon payment. The sole lead manager is Credit Agricole CIB. This investment sends a powerful message to the global investor and climate policy community about Moroccos commitment to climate finance, said World Bank Vice President and Treasurer, Arunma Oteh. Morocco is one of the countries that has benefitted from the World Banks Green Bond program to support its transition to a low carbon economy and is now making an investment in the global transition to a greener planet.

"COP22","India","COP22_India224","Kerala to introduce India's first carbon-neutral panchayat in Meenangadi","January 21, 2017 Saturday 6:30 AM EST","Yourstory.in","Kerala's done it again. After becoming the first Indian state to administer the transgender policy and hold the first transgender school, it is now turning its attention towards a sustainable environment, by introducing India's first carbon-neutral panchayat. Having launched the ambitious project on World Environment Day last year, the environmental activists involved have decided to begin the operations in Meenangadi, a small town in Kerala's Wayanad district. A collaborative brainchild of a team of renowned scientists, students, farmers, and people's representatives, the project is being supported by environment advocacy group Thanal, the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation's Community Agrobiodiversity Centre, and Kannur University's zoology department. The idea came about following the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where the state authorities discussed the dangers of excessive climate change and the need to counter it before situations became much worse. They decided to begin with Wayanad because it is one of the four climate-change hotspot districts in Kerala, according to a report which was published by the State Action Plan on the subject. The report stated that the minimum surface temperature in the Western Ghats region may rise by 2 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. This would naturally affect paddy cultivation as well as the production of cash crops like coffee, tea, cardamom, and black pepper. Alarmed by the report and the fact that paddy cultivation in the region was already taking a hit, the Meenangadi panchayat officials came forward with the carbon neutrality project. The official aim of this project is the ""reduction of human-induced carbon emission through people's lifestyle and sustainable development in this region."" To achieve this, they have been attempting to introduce and endorse several eco-friendly measures and spread awareness regarding the same. Measures implemented The project enlists several measures, which need to be undertaken by the combined forces of the authorities and the community, to achieve their goal of a carbon-neutral panchayat. Last June, the activists had assessed the rate and quantities of carbon emissions which arosefrom domestic consumption of electricity and fuel from both houses and vehicles. They also measured the carbon content in soil and the emissions from the trees, and thus drew up a plan to plant more trees in the areas which exhibit the highest percentage of emissions in order to offset it. They have also turned towards solar power sources in terms of energy, so as to reduce the dependency on the exhaustible conventional energy sources. Adding to this, the panchayat has also set up an LED-lamp manufacturing unit so that energy-efficient lights are supplied to all the houses in this town. 70 acres of Meenangadi's usable land have been reserved for cultivation purposes only, giving a solid boost to vegetable farming in the area. As a result, the region has become self-sufficient in terms of everyday vegetables. Finally, awareness campaigns regarding the ill-effects of plastic for the environment have been abound aplenty. According to BeenaVijayan, the President of the panchayat,""A stroll into the panchayat fish market will reveal the impact of our campaign. Vendors use eco-friendly carry bags and educate customers about the ill-effects of plastic bags,""as stated by Scroll. Problems faced The greatest opposition to the project comes from the farmers of the region. Some of the measures have changed their everyday rituals, a position they are not very appreciative of. For instance, the Gadgil ecology expert panel had advised strict prohibition of human interference in the Western Ghats, which was met by great protests from the farmers who accused the panel of disrupting their livelihood concerns. TM Thomas Isaac, the State Finance Minister, has pledged to alleviate their fears by announcing an interactive conference with the farmers, where they can direct their questions and doubts towards the experts involved in the project. ""We will organise an interactive conference soon where the experts can answer all the doubts of farmers,"" he told Scroll. At the same time, getting the entire population, especially the merchant-class, to stop using plastic in one go is easier said than done. As is convincing most of the domestic households to reduce their usage of the exhaustible traditional energy sources. Advantages of the project If this project is completed within the next five years, the advantages that the state can reap from it are infinite. For instance, it would promote agro-forestry and set an example for the entire country. Not only will this help reduce the impact of climatechange, it will also serve well for the aesthetic value of the region. Farmers, too, will make grand profits out of this initiative, since demand for commodities produced in carbon-neutral territories have always been high. Once the project is completed, the farmers of Wayanad can market their products at higher rates, with a tag-line of 'carbon-neutral', inviting customers and greater sales. As mentioned earlier, it will help the region become self-sufficient in vegetables and other crops that are enlisted as 'necessary goods'. Furthermore, it will provide an opportunity for the locals to sell these same crops, especially coffee in light of its high demand, in the international market. All in all, the outcome of the project looks promising. ""Wayanad has 33 percent forest cover and no major industries that cause pollution; if there is a district that can become carbon neutral in India, it is Wayanad,"" says GiriganGopi, Principal Scientist at the Community Biodiversity Centre. The project has a target deadline of 2020. \"

On November 10, all the co-facilitators dealing with different items reported on the progress happened so far under each item. The work of forming rules and modalities has started under each agenda item but India, along with other developing countries, was not happy with the progress report that was conveyed to the co-chairs of the APA, Sara Bashaan and Jo Tyndall. Focus on mitigation limits the Paris Agreement India requested that the report should be reflective and balanced. The view was supported by other developing countries who also felt that focus on mitigation limits the Paris Agreement and stress should be also on other elements including adaptation and means of implementation. They put forth that Paris Agreement is built on a balanced approach and this should be sustained. On adaptation communication, it was agreed that lot of issues remain to be resolved, including tracking adaptation and assessment of adaptation communication. The Parties were invited to make submissions and workshop was scheduled for June 2017 on the same agenda item. On transparency framework, there was general consensus on having a robust transparency framework, but there were differences on structure of this framework and on the issue of flexibility. Global stocktake A non-paper was brought out on the issue of global stocktake. It encapsulated the views of the Parties. Issues for further consideration in the non-paper were categorised into three parts. The first part was related to input of the global stocktake and what all should feed into it. In the second part, the non-paper was about how the global stocktake should be conducted and organised. It included elements like assessment of progress, responsibility of conducting the global stocktake, how to address linkages and how to link it with other processes. The third category of questions dealt with the outcomes of global stocktake and what would be the form and format of the outcome, who would be the audience of the outcome and how would it be used to raise ambition among the Parties. The non-paper is expected to be the starting point for negotiations under this item. Developing countries were not happy with the process of work undertaken. According to them, it was not reflective and equity seemed to be absent from the agenda. The developed countries, however, expressed satisfaction with the process of work and welcomed the progress which, it said, was balanced and reflective. The APA further discussed how to capture progress under each agenda item in its closing plenary that is scheduled to take place on November 14.

The report released at the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change says Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the other G20 defaulting countries. The publishers of the report are the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science. The report by Alina Averchenkova and Sini Matikainen says these six countries ""lack overall framework legislation or regulation on climate change, and need to move from sectoral to economy-wide targets and extend the time-frame of their targets to 2030"". However, six other G20 countries -- Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy and Britain -- together with the European Union as a bloc were found to have undertaken action that is ""either completely or mostly consistent with the key requirements of the Paris Agreement"". The results from the ""Paris consistency monitor"" are based on an assessment of past and present actions by G20 countries against three indicators. The indicators are consistency of domestic emissions reductions targets with those pledged in nationally-determined contributions, progress towards meeting 2020 emissions reduction targets pledged under the Copenhagen Accord and the Cancun Agreements, and past performance in ratcheting up the ambition for climate change mitigation, said the authors. An accompanying detailed study of climate change policies in the European Union, China and the US examined some of the key drivers, including economic factors, institutional settings and features of the political systems, as well as the role of public opinion, interest groups and party politics. The report on ""Climate Policy in China, the European Union and the United States: Main Drivers and Prospects for the Future"", was released jointly on Thursday by both institutes in collaboration with think-tank Bruegel. ""For the US, bottom-up action by cities or states could help ratchet up ambition at the federal level. A few proactive states should champion more ambitious US climate policy. However, this seems unlikely to happen under the recently-elected Donald Trump,"" it said. Earlier, US-based environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in its report released here pointed out that the G20 countries continue pumping billions in overseas coal development, undermining the landmark Paris Agreement and clean energy deployment. Over the past nine years, the G20 countries -- led by China, Japan, Germany, South Korea and the US -- have kicked in $76 billion to further coal development in countries such as Vietnam, South Africa, Australia and Indonesia, it said. In Paris last December, nearly 200 countries agreed to slash their dependence on fossil fuels in a concerted effort to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial level in order to avoid a climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states the burning of fossil fuels is contributing to the rise in global temperatures.

"COP22","India","COP22_India231","EBRD supports a greener agribusiness","October 14, 2016 Friday","Pivotal Sources","United Kingdom, Oct. 14 -- ""Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too"" is the theme of the World Food Day this year, an annual event that has been celebrated every October since 1945 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This year's theme underscores how interlinked climate and agriculture are. Climatic conditions determine which crops can be cultivated and influence yield. At the same time, agriculture has a major impact on the global climate. The agribusiness sector contributes significantly to climate change, emitting one third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consuming huge amounts of water. The global drive to combat climate change, which will be marked by the COP22 climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco in November, is being combined with international steps to achieve food security for a growing population. The EBRD has a long-standing relationship with FAO. Together, the two organisations help develop effective regulations that support sustainable food production and work primarily with the private sector to implement better practices and improve standards, particularly when it comes to environmental sustainability, safety and hygiene. For example, in Georgia the EBRD and FAO are making the country's dairy sector more efficient and attractive for investors by improving the quality and safety of Georgian dairy products. The EBRD and FAO expanded their cooperation in 2013 to help reduce the impact of agriculture on climate change by promoting investments which entail a more efficient use of water, biomass, land and energy. Moreover, the EBRD has developed various financial tools such as the Sustainable Energy Initiative (SEFF) and the Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change (FINTECC) programme which have been applied in the agribusiness sector to improve energy efficiency and resilience throughout the value chain, from livestock breeding and food production and packaging, to distribution and logistics optimisation. These financial instruments help reduce the agribusiness sector's environmental footprint by supporting projects that contribute to the reduction of GHGs, better energy and water use, reduced crop losses and food waste, and the recovery of by-products of agricultural production. One example is the Bank's support to Ivan Stojakovic, the manager of Woodmaster, a jam producer in the Western Balkans, to convert agricultural waste to biofuel by using plum stones for heating which leads to energy savings and reducing CO2 emissions. In Morocco, the Bank has joined forces with FAO on a study evaluating the market penetration of climate technologies in the food sector and identifying opportunities for investment, as well as policy options for stimulating adoption of greener practices. The study has also been prepared as an input for the COP22 climate discussions. The joint efforts of FAO and the EBRD have been followed by concrete Bank investments with strong demonstration effects. For example, the Bank is helping to increase agricultural yields in Morocco while remaining cost-efficient and environmentally friendly by supporting Elephant Vert, a producer of bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides and bio-stimulants based in the country. The Bank's boost for the development and distribution of these biological products should lead to significant GHG savings of over 150,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. The EBRD will focus on how the private sector can help address climate challenges in the agribusiness sector at the Marrakesh COP22 conference. At one of the conference side events hosted by the Bank, speakers including British climate expert Professor Nicholas (Lord) Stern and EBRD Managing Director Mattia Romani will discuss the role private agribusinesses can play to counteract the intensity and the impact of climate change on their operations and the importance of government support.

""New Zealand has a fair and ambitious target of reducing emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. I have several work streams in place which will help form an effective plan to meet that target."" Climate campaigners and environment groups have criticised the New Zealand government for its lack of a plan to tackle emissions and for encouraging the exploration for fossil fuels in its waters. New Zealand ratified the Paris Agreement, agreed in December last year, on October 5. Earlier this month, the opposition Green Party said the government needed to ""real evidence"" of a plan to reduce New Zealand's emissions, which were up 19 per cent since 2008. The international campaign group, Greenpeace, has called for a summer of action to highlight the government's ""sham plan"" on climate change, saying the country was forecast to meet 80 per cent of its target by offsetting emissions in the international carbon market. --IANS py/vm \"

Since their current pledges are not enough to keep the average global temperature rise below 2 degree Celsius by 2100 from the pre-industrial level, the call is expected to bring into focus how it is important for all the nations not only to raise their ambitions for post-2020 actions but also to act effectively during pre-2020 period.An informal draft An informal draft of political declaration (Marrakech Action Proclamation For Climate and Sustainable Development), which has been in circulation for private consultations and testing the ground, talks about call for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance and technology for climate projects. Since the draft of the Marrakech conference outcome is yet to be formally released, India has been insisting to add a point on 'sustainable lifestyle' in it.India had even during its country statement on Wednesday called the nations to opt for sustainable lifestyle. The country has, in fact, been making the 'lifestyle' a big issue here during COP22 while driving home a point that the rich nations need to cut their consumption to meet the overall climate goal.""We have asked for adding sustainable lifestyle in the draft. We have said under the section sustainable lifestyle, a point on minimum carbon footprint should also be included,"" India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave said. He had even invoked Mahatma Gandhi in his speech and emphasized that the small changes in everyday lives by moderating lifestyles and encouraging sustainable consumption and production patterns will contribute the global communities in a big way to fight the challenges of climate change.It will, however, only be clear on the concluding day of the Conference on Friday whether the final draft of the COP22 will include the 'lifestyle' point in it.

"COP22","India","COP22_India234","World Asthma Day | 5% of world's asthmatics are from India","May 2, 2017 Tuesday","DNA","India ranks first when it comes to the number of deaths due to lung disease, and is 14th on the list when it comes to those who die due to bronchial asthma, a WHO report in 2014 said. The report added that India has an estimated 15-20 million asthmatics. The WHO also states that 300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, which means that nearly 5% of the world's asthmatics come from India. About 98% of cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 100 000 inhabitants do not meet norms set out in the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality guidelines, according to WHO's global urban air quality database. An increasing number of Indian cities are now measuring and reporting their air pollution levels to WHO and the number of such cities, globally, has nearly doubled to 3000 in 103 countries since 2014. These numbers are a sharp indicator of the air we breathe on World Asthma Day. While it's still difficult to pinpoint the reason behind asthma, there are several factors that exacerbate the condition. Asthma attacks all age groups but often starts in childhood. It is a disease characterised by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to person. This condition is due to inflammation of the air passages in the lungs and affects the sensitivity of the nerve endings in the airways so they become easily irritated. In an attack, the lining of the passages swell causing the airways to narrow and reducing the flow of air in and out of the lungs. Last year, a poll conducted by Curofy -- India's largest community of doctors, said that 82% doctors say there has been an increased asthma incidence in children due to increased environmental pollution. While 11% of the doctors polled blamed second and first hand smoking, seven percent chose genetic predilection as the leading cause for increased childhood asthma. Reducing the deaths and ill-health from air pollution is one of the targets of sustainable development goal three and, last year at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, governments recognised the need to curb emissions to reduce global warming. According to Dr Sameer Nanaware, Consultant - Pulmonology, Global Hospitals, Mumbai, asthma is carried from one generation to another, but there are several external factors that can cause the disease. ""These include continuous exposure to air pollutants which happen in industrial or workplace exposure. Allergic bronchitis is also another term loosely used for asthma and recurrent episodes of allergic bronchitis could actually be asthma only,"" he said. Dr Nanaware's reasoning is corroborated by a WHO report that says exposure to tobacco smoke and exposure to chemical irritants in the workplace are additional risk factors. Other risk factors include certain drugs (aspirin and other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs), low birth weight and respiratory infection. The weather (cold air), extreme emotional expression and physical exercise can exacerbate asthma. While addressing the pollution levels in urban India, Dr Nanaware said that a change in atmospheric level of pollution will certainly reduce the symptom as well as the progression of the disease. ""Stringent regulations for automobiles especially diesel vehicles, industries which emit smoke and fumes and construction sites where dust and cement cause similar problems are needed to reduce the same,"" he said. Urban India isn't the only problem when it comes to asthmatics. Rural India, too has its list of patients. Dr Nanaware attributes factors such as pollen or hay, as well as burning indoor biomass fuel, ""This not just causes asthma, but also results in a complication non-smoking Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"" he explained. The road ahead In 2015, a special committee set up by India's federal Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, submitted a report to the Centre on the devastating effects of air pollution on people's health in India. The committee proposed measures that claimed would provide the largest reduction in exposure to air pollution and, as a result, improvements in people's health. For K Srinath Reddy, the president of the public health foundation of India, who co-chaired the committee, the report is important because it highlights the contribution of air pollution to the rise in cardiovascular diseases in his country. Proposals included switching to clean energy sources for cook stoves, public transport and industry, as well as measures to reduce road traffic by raising fuel taxes and parking fees, levying congestion charges, and creating vehicle-free zones and cycle paths. While this looks practical on paper, there's still a long way to go. An example of this is Delhi that has made its public transport run on compressed natural gas, and has an expansive metro system. Yet, last Diwali, Delhi was recorded as the most polluted city on the planet. Veerabhadran Ramanathan, professor of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, in an interview with WHO said that if India was to curb its air pollution, then three things need to be done. ""One, replace existing cook stoves with clean cook stoves, two, reduce pollution from diesel transport and, three, restrict open burning of biomass and fossil fuels,"" he said, adding that air pollution would reduce by one-third if clean cooking stoves were given to all its villagers. While the Ministry of Environment in its 2016 guidelines spoke of a number of factors including car pooling, use of alternative fuels in transport, and alternative sources of power, there is still a need to highlight that clean cooking fuel may play a major factor in curbing air pollution, and thereby controlling bronchial asthma in the country. Until then, we can only hope. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India235","Over 24 nations agree to reduce 12.6 m annual pollution deaths","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","IANS-English","Marrakech, Nov 16 -- Health and environment officials from over 24 countries have committed to reducing the annual 12.6 million deaths due to pollution, the World Health Organisation and United Nations Environment Programme have said On the sidelines of the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) here, the officials on Tuesday signed up to the declaration for health, environment and climate change. The goal is to reduce pollution-related deaths through a new global initiative to promote better management of environmental and climate related risks to health. According to WHO, around 12.6 million deaths a year are associated with environmental pollution. Of these, an estimated 6.5 million deaths (11.6 per cent) are due to air pollution. The declaration encourages the health and environment sectors to exchange experiences, technical expertise and best practices to enhance health and protect the environment. Global and comprehensive links between these two sectors do not yet exist. Most pollution-related deaths occur in low and middle-income countries. However, outdoor air pollution remains prevalent in high-income countries as well, with nine out of 10 people worldwide exposed to air pollution that exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for fine particulate matter, it said. Major sources of air pollution include inefficient modes of transport, household fuel and waste burning, coal-fired power plants, and industrial activities. According to WHO, hundreds of thousands more deaths each year are due to direct climate change impacts, including heat waves, extreme weather emergencies, drought and increased diarrhoeal disease and vector borne disease transmission. These deaths are projected to rise if climate change is not addressed. For reducing the risk, Moroccan Health Minister El Houssaine Louardi said: ""We know that most health risks from climate change are preventable."" ""By establishing this initiative we can work together on strengthening health systems, investing in disease prevention and common sense measures,"" he said. The declaration recognises that well designed policies to protect the environment will result in reducing the global burden of disease attributable to the environment, as well as reducing the rising rate of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as stroke, heart disease, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases. NCDs account for nearly two-thirds -- or 8.2 million -- of deaths associated with unhealthy environments. ""The devastating consequences of air pollution affect both the climate and health. They are seen everywhere from smog-encircled mega-cities to village dwellings filled with smoke from indoor cooking. Yet virtually all air pollution is manmade and often excessive,"" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan.

VINITA APTE, President, Terre Policy Centre (A think tank working for sustainable development) The recent gap emission report released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has revealed that the world is headed towards a temperature rise of 2.9-3.4 degrees Celsius  way above the targeted 1.5-2 degrees Celsius needed to reduce the likelihood of more intense storms, longer droughts, sea-level rise and other severe climatic impacts. Looking at the current record, this will be the case even if the pledges taken last year at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris are fully implemented. To keep temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, emissions need to be limited to 42 gigatonnes by 2030. However, present estimates till 2030  according to this report  estimate emissions of 54-56 gigatonnes. In fact, it is to discuss this gap report that an international conference is taking place from November 7. Meeting this target is a great challenge ahead of us, and needs to be taken very seriously. It is one thing that the administration needs to gear itself up to chalk out proper routes of movement and make a good public transport system available, as well as efficient garbage disposal. However, the onus for reducing emissions does not only fall on the government  the people also need to fulfil their share of responsibilities. Each person needs to reduce emissions at least by 1per cent. To do this, a mere figurative single day of travelling by public transport in a year will not suffice. One has to take a pledge to leave behind private vehicles and switch to public transport for at least four days a month. Tree plantation programmes are, at times, merely on the paper. The survival of the plants is ignored. While planting new urban trees and making them survive is imperative, old ones also need to be preserved. It is no longer enough to say new trees will be planted to replace the ones cut down. Moreover, there is also a need to switch to forms of energy like solar energy. Excess consumption of water, too, has an indirect impact on emissions, with water purification equipment somewhere linked to emissions (through thermal electricity generation). The more water we waste, the more the use of machinery and therefore, emissions. Some of the rich, especially, need to curb usage of excessive and wasteful equipment. For example some people have five air conditioning units where unnecessary. This wasteful expenditure of electricity needs to be stopped. Incidentally, charging objects like mobile phones on a whim also increases emissions. People need to turn to \' reuse, refuse and recycle\' philosophy. It is also necessary to shift to locally produced goods as much as possible, as imports increase logistics, and so, emissions. (As told to Mayuri Phadnis) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \"

""As far as the ratification is concerned, India has already started the process,"" Javadekar said, addressing the Seventh St. Petersburg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, Germany. The two-day Climate dialogue that began on Monday is the informal ministerial meet co-hosted by Germany and Morocco. Thirty-five countries are attending the conference. Germany has, meanwhile, extended support to the developing countries to help them meet their climate targets, a demand being raised by several developing countries after the COP-21 agreement was signed. ""Cooperation is the key for taking actions further, because every country is at a different level of development. We need cooperation, we have the will to act, but we do not have the wherewithal to do it, not only in terms of finances, but particularly in terms of technology,"" Javadekar said. Stressing upon the pre-2020 agenda fixed during the Paris Conference of the Parties (COP)-21 held in December 2015, Javadekar said that the October 5, 2015, joint statement issued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chancellor Angela Merkel in New Delhi was the base of Indo-German partnership programme. During Merkel's visit to the New Delhi, Modi said that he admired German leadership in clean energy and commitment in combating climate change ""Germany is the most reliable name in technology in many fields and, therefore, there is finance, technology and mutual cooperation and walking the talk,"" Javadekar said. He also drew parallels between Germany's aspiration to meet 80 percent of its domestic power needs through renewable energy sources, saying that India too has hiked its clean energy targets by five times. ""Our earlier target was only 20 Giga Watts of solar energy... we scaled up it by 5 times and made it 100 Giga Watts. Other renewable energy like wind energy, now we have opened it for offshore also,"" the minister said. India aims to achieve this target by 2022. The United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP-21 held in Paris, adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degree Celsius. The agreement is due to enter into force in 2020. Germany on Monday announced plans to help developing countries to help them to transform their national climate action plan into specific strategies and measures. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks and Development Minister Gerd Muller said this while addressing the Berlin conference. ""We are ready to support developing countries in tackling this challenge and to share our experience with them. This should also give our partner countries new opportunities for development.

As per the Pre-2020 agenda, which was also agreed during Paris Agreement, it was agreed to keep the global warming due to emissions well below 1.5 degree Celsius as compared to the pre-industrial area. Commenting on a difficult financial situation which might be created if the US President-elect Donald Trump reneges from the Paris Agreement, or pulls out of the entire convention (UNFCCC) to cut down the time for exit, the minster who believes in a ""wait and watch"" strategy, said that India will have to generate domestic resources anyway. ""There is no escaping when it comes to climate change, so we have to look into resources anyway. Whatever help would come from outside is ok and beside that we will have to generate resource. Like we are doing it by imposing cess on coal so we will tackle the situation as it is created,"" Dave told IANS. Speaking with Indian media here, the Minister said that though there were many attempts to drag the COP for various reasons, it did not happen and the negotiations moved forward on its track. ""This I consider as a success of Marrakech. For us, we completed our ISA. We should not see this as a standalone. It has moved on the right track,"" he told the newsmen here. The minister also pointed out that India now stands at 20th position at Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) against last year's 23. The COP22 is being held at Marrakech, Morocco and is building up on the negotiations held at last conference in Paris at COP21. Hailed at COP of actions, not much could have been done, especially on the finance section and the agriculture where developing countries have their reservations and concerns over food security.

This will make ISA an innovative, action oriented and sui generis international and intergovernmental Treaty- based organisation that will be registered under Article 102 of the UN charter. More than 20 countries, including France and Brazil signed the Framework Agreement in the Ceremony held at Es Saadi Gardens here. The Framework Agreement will be kept open as many more countries are expected to join the ISA in the coming weeks. The Framework provides for membership open to the countries between tropics (fully or partially) who are also UN members. The ISA structure will consist of two tiers in the form of an Assembly and Secretariat. Partner Country status to be granted to other countries (not within tropics) by the decision of ISA Assembly. The Framework will enter into force with ratification by 15 countries. An important aspect is striving to keep about the operating costs minimal and therefore not necessitate mandatory contributions. In his address, Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, expressed gratitude to the Heads of State, Heads of Government, Ministers and representatives from prospective member countries of the ISA for gracing the Signing Ceremony. He thanked the countries for their continued support for concretizing the concept of the ISA and reaching today's milestone in the shortest possible time. He further stated that within 11 months of launch, ISA activities have increased significantly, and many initiatives are under implementation. With legal framework in place ISA will be a major international body headquartered in India. He also thanked Government of France for their continued support. Further, he stated that creating common buyers' market for solar finance, technology, innovation and capacity building will lead to higher quality, lower costs, products better tailored to needs, collaborative innovation, and technology ownership. International Solar Alliance is an initiative by India wherein an alliance of 121 solar resource rich countries lying fully or partially between the tropic of Cancer and tropic of Capricorn, have come together. ISA was jointly launched by the Prime Minister of India and the President of France on November 30, 2015 at Paris, France on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Representatives from around 70 countries, including more than 30 Heads of the States and Heads of the Government level participated in the ISA launch ceremony. India has offered a contribution of Rs 175 crore (around US$27 million) for creating ISA corpus fund and for meeting the cost of ISA secretariat which is coming up in New Delhi, for the initial five years.

"COP22","India","COP22_India243","United States : Film4Climate Global Video Competition Opens, In Search of Short Videos to Inspire the World","June 21, 2016 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The Film4Climate Global Video Competition formally opens today as the centerpiece of the Connect4Climate initiative to promote sustainability in the creative industries through active engagement with young people in finding solutions to climate change. Announced at the Cannes Film Festival by the World Bank Groups Connect4Climate global partnership program, the competition will be open for submissions through September 15, with the winners to be announced at a high-profile awards ceremony at the United Nations COP22 Climate Summit in Marrakesh, Morocco in November. The winning entries will receive cash prizes of $8,000, $5,000, and $2,000 for first, second and third place in each of two categories: an under one-minute Public Service Advertisement (PSA) or a Short Film up to five minutes. The competition offers filmmakers a chance to have their work reviewed by a jury chaired by Bernardo Bertolucci, and including other preeminent directors, producers, writers and political leaders. At the competitions announcement in Cannes, producer and jury member Lawrence Bender said, In every country, every city, people have different stories on climate change...there are many stories that can be told. If this worldwide film competition creates a critical mass of ideas and energy, it could help tip the balance in terms of focusing peoples attention. As the next five years will be critical to advancing and scaling up climate action around the world as part of the SDGs, the COP22 climate summit aims to encourage countries to implement ambitious climate actions, with youth playing a vital role in the agenda. It is not our role to inspire youth, it is they who inspire us every single day. Our mission is to provide them with a platform, and COP22 will be the opportunity to show the world the creativity of young filmmakers and how they are taking action on climate change, stated Dr. Hakima El Haite, Delegate Minister in Charge of Environment, Morocco, Special Envoy for Mobilization of COP22 , and High-Level Champion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Nick Nuttall, Spokesperson/Head of Communications, UNFCCC, adds, In order to unleash the full potential of the Paris Climate Change Agreement towards a better, more climate-safe world, all sectors of society and all walks of life need to be on board, including the creative industries. We are therefore delighted to be working with Connect4Climate to raise awareness on how the film industry can fast forward its contribution, and to showcase these achievements in Morocco in November at the next UN climate change conference. Sheila Redzepi, Vice President of External and Corporate Relations, World Bank Group, says: Climate change is a real and global threat affecting peoples wellbeing, livelihoods, the environment and economies. Communication is a powerful tool in furthering understanding of its impact and inspiring action to tackle it. Thats why I welcome this initiative and the support it has received from partners who, in their own fields, are leading the way in finding solutions. In addition to the main cash prizes a number of special prizes will be awarded to outstanding entries. These include a Peoples Choice award, a MENA-Award for the best entry from the Middle East and North Africa region, and a Price on Carbon Pollution award. Other prizes, including worldwide distribution by Vulcan Productions, will be awarded as determined by presenting partners. Vulcan previously partnered with the World Bank Groups Connect4Climate program to produce the spectacular large-scale architectural projection and public art display of images of climate change on St. Peters Basilica in December 2015, as a gift to Pope Francis, which was seen by an audience of several billion people. Carole Tomko, General Manager and Creative Director of Vulcan Productions, states, We know the immense power of storytelling to change the way people view an issue, to raise awareness and inspire progress. We are looking for submissions that energize and communicate in a fresh manner, and demonstrate innovative storytelling of key issues of our time. This competition is a chance for young people to tell a story that may change the world, said Lucia Grenna, Program Manager of Connect4Climate, the global partnership program behind the competition. The science of climate change is beyond debate. Politicians are moving in the direction of a solution. What we need now is the creative push that the passion and imagination of young people can provide. We need their images and words to tell a story that inspires individual responsibility and collective action on a global scale. The competition is the outcome of a partnership between the World Bank Groups Connect4Climate program, the United Nations, Vulcan Productions, and the Italian energy company Enel, which has endorsed the UNs Sustainable Development Goals and targeted carbon neutrality for its operations by 2050.

HE Al Zeyoudi added: A Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative launched in 2012 and Green Agenda 2015-2030 set the course for our economic growth ambitions, social development priorities and environmental sustainability goals. The advancement of the UAEs green economy efforts couldnt have been made without the strong support from the UN and relevant international organisations. Most notably, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP), the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Dr. Zeyoudi added. I am confident that through WGEO, we will have significant impact on knowledge and experience sharing which would help to overcome common challenges and to ensure successful achievement of our common green economy goals, Dr. Zeyoudi added. Dr. Zeyoudi made these remarks during the announcement of the global launch of WGEO at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. On his part, HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) and Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, has stated that WGEO, which was launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai at the 3rd World Green Economy Summit in Dubai, will support the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and increase global awareness on climate change to enhance the shift towards a green economy. The announcement was attended by HE Sheikh Sultan bin Hamdan Al Nahyan, Advisor to the UAE President, HE Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy, HE Dr. Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, HE Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), HE Suhail Matar Al Ketbi, the UAE Ambassador in Morocco, Mohammed Abunayyan, Chairman, ACWA Power, and representatives of the UN agencies, the public and private sectors, financial institutions, non-profit-organisations, and civil society organisations. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the global announcement of the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO). This great initiative, came under the wise vision of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, as an international organisation during the third World Green Economy Summit (WGES) in Dubai on 5 October 2016 and it is supported by the UAE and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). I would like to thank the United Nations for its pioneering role in raising global awareness about climate change, said Al Tayer. Launching WGEO at this time reflects the relentless efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WGEO will also play an instrumental role in mitigating climate change, as it serves as a mechanism for generating new solutions for sustainable energy, water and other environmental challenges, thereby lowering the risk of green economy investments, and supporting international cooperation in innovation, technology and finance. As Dubai is emerging as a global hub for green economy, we are celebrating today the announcement of the global launch of the WGEO and I would like to take this opportunity to give you a glimpse into the efforts of the UAE to become a green economy, he added. To meet the environmental challenges facing most countries in the world and to spread a culture of sustainability, we must have a global movement towards a green economy. These principles are firmly embedded within the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 for clean energy to provide 7% of Dubais total power output by 2020, rising to 25% by 2030, and 75% by 2050. The strategy consists of five main pillars: infrastructure, legislation, funding, building capacities and skills, and an environmentally-friendly energy mix. The strategy is underpinned by an expected investment of USD13 billion in the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is the largest single-site solar park in the world, with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts by 2030, he added. These efforts culminate today in this announcement pertaining to the World Green Economy Organisation, which will be permanently based in Dubai to pioneer a new approach to promoting green economy, by bringing together governments, the private sector, foundations, United Nations agencies, banking systems and society, to unite to achieve green economic goals and serve as a catalyst for generating new integrated solutions to climate change, sustainable energy, water and other environmental challenges around the world. In line with its global mandate, WGEO will significantly contribute to the implementation of the Paris climate agreement (COP 21) to shift to a green economy, a low-carbon economy that is climate-resilient, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive. WGEO will bridge the gaps between countries in innovation, technology and finance. It will provide technical assistance to countries who can benefit from Dubais green economy model, as well as models from other countries whose economies demand the development of strong, robust and diverse green strategies for the future, he added. \"

Christian Aid's analysis of the British banks, led by Senior Private Sector Advisor Ken Boyce, said: ""Financial institutions themselves need to move much more quickly in scaling up investment in renewables while phasing out investments in fossil fuels."" His assertions came as a prelude to the British government event on the role of Green finance on the sidelines of the ongoing 22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) here. The big four banks -- Barclays, RBS, Lloyds and HSBC -- have all signed the Paris Pledge for Action in which they affirmed their commitment to act in support of the realisation of the Paris Agreement's goals. ""We tried to assess what concrete actions and commitments they are taking and gave them an overall grade,"" an official statement quoting Boyce said. He said the banks were still financing the building of coal-fired power stations which would lock countries into high carbon infrastructure, making it harder for them to meet their climate ambitions. ""They are still financing oil and gas companies far more than renewables. And they are reluctant to set measurable targets for scaling up support for renewables and phasing out support for fossil fuels. ""As the grave problems caused by climate change intensify, the financing of new fossil fuel projects such as these will become increasingly risky financially. Banks that fail to take these risks into account are failing to safeguard customers' money."" He added: ""It's no surprise to us that Legal & General have announced this innovative new climate investment fund. They were one of the top performing asset managers in our analysis, with a B grade, and it's great to see forward thinking companies like Legal & General leading the way. We now need to see other financial institutions following suit."" Christian Aid's analysis found that Britain financial institutions are not moving quickly enough.

Now it's up to cities, states and provinces to drastically cut toxic carbon pollution and get us to our goal. The clock is ticking."" Last year, Governor Brown attended COP21 at the invitation of UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres and France's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development Laurent Fabius. Over the course of the conference, the Governor met with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, China's Special Envoy on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua, France's Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy Sgolne Royal, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and former Vice President Al Gore, and participated in a number of events with world leaders. California is playing a world-leading role in setting aggressive climate goals, broadening collaboration among subnational leaders and taking action to reduce climate pollutants. In September, Governor Brown signed legislation that establishes the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in North America and the nation's toughest restrictions on destructive super pollutants. The Governor also signed legislation that directs cap-and-trade funds to greenhouse gas reducing programs which benefit disadvantaged communities, support clean transportation and protect natural ecosystems. This action builds on landmark legislation the Governor signed in October 2015 to generate half of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and double the rate of energy efficiency savings in California buildings. Governor Brown has also committed to reducing today's petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent within the next 15 years; make heating fuels cleaner; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands so they can store carbon. Last year, California and Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany formed the Under 2 Coalition - an international pact among cities, states and countries to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius, the level of potentially catastrophic consequences. Today, a total of 136 jurisdictions representing 32 countries and six continents have joined the coalition, representing more than 832 million people and $22 trillion in GDP, which is nearly a third of the global economy. Over the past year and a half, in addition to participating in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, the Governor traveled to the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Vatican in Italy and the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada to call on other leaders to join California in the fight against climate change. Governor Brown also joined an unprecedented alliance of heads of state, city and state leaders - convened by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund - to urge countries and companies around the globe to put a price on carbon. These efforts build on a number of other international climate change agreements with leaders from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, North America, Japan, Israel, Peru and Chile and Governor Brown's efforts to gather hundreds of world-renowned researchers and scientists around a groundbreaking call to action - called the consensus statement - which translates key scientific climate findings from disparate fields into one unified document.

The NGO holds the distinction of the only Indian entity being addressed by the framework. Swayam Shikshan Prayog (SSP) is one of the 13 winners of the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Award, given for creating a network of rural community leaders who are combating climate change. SSP will be felicitated at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held at Marrakech, Morocco, in November. Through the various initiatives undertaken by the NGO, which is present in six districts (Latur, Osmanabad, Sholapur, Marathwada, Nanded and Washim), the women use smokeless cook stoves (chulhas), solar lamps, water heaters and water purifiers that do not require electricity to function. The women in six districts have been trained in using solar lamps, repair them and even retail them so as to increase their reach.  Around 840 \' sakhis\' (women entrepreneurs) have been trained in Maharashtra. These women have been able to reach 2,00,000 households, said Upmanyu Patil, CEO of Sakhi Unique Rural Enterprise (SURE), a part of SSP. SSP has tied up with several companies that manufacture these products, as the market-based approach ensures financial stability for the women while bringing about a change in the environment. This sustainable model has been adopted in parts of Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat besides Maharashtra. The NGO takes care of the supply and distribution aspect as well. Prema Gopalan, executive director, SSP, said,  The sakhis, after receiving training, help in generating awareness about using these products that run on renewable energy. The women are both entrepreneurs and consumers of these products. In the project areas, women have also been using precast cement and concrete toilets, as these factory-made products can be used within three hours of installation. PChandran, team leader, SSP, believes that this initiative will not only improve their lives but also that of the environment. These lamps cost anything between Rs 350 and Rs 700 and come with a two-year warranty period. Shashikant Dalvi, district manager of Climate Change Foundation (India), which is part of Al Gore\' s climate change reality project, said that we need to realise what each one of us can do to reduce carbon footprint.  Even if we reduce electricity consumption by one unit, we can reduce 600 grams of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the environment, Dalvi said. Those involved in these projects, swear by the output and conservation benefits that they get by making these produces. Such is the story of Sadhana Deshmukh of Murud who was trained for 10 days in 2012, on assembling, repairing and even marketing these lamps. Her husband owns an electrical repair shop where she sells handmade artefacts. The customers began to place orders for the products when she explained and demonstrated them.  I collected the amount for the initial investments from the prospective customers, the word of mouth worked and I began to retail the solar lamps, water purifiers and stoves. The village faces severe power cuts and the solar lamps are a boon in such situations, Deshmukh added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India251","New Analysis Shows that Fuel Economy Policies Work - but More is Needed","January 10, 2017 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","India Automobile News","Jan. 10 -- While the average fuel economy of vehicles continues to improve, a new analysis by the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) highlights that the rate of progress has slowed in recent years. The average amount of fuel required to travel 100 km improved by 1.1% in 2014 and 2015, down from 1.8% between 2005 and 2008, according to a new report launched in Washington today at the annual meeting of the Transport Research Board. This change reflects the composition of global car sales, as Light Duty Vehicles sold in OECD countries use less fuel than those sold in non-OECD countries, and suggests a technological gap in engine technology between the two regions. However due to the popularity of large, heavy and powerful vehicles in the United States America and Australia, total fuel use per kilometre travelled in these countries remains greater than outside the OECD. The new report is unique in its scope, covering more than 80% of the global vehicle market, and includes data on fuel economy trends from 2005 to 2015. The new findings were presented by Sheila Watson, GFEI Executive Secretary and Deputy Director of the FIA Foundation, and Pierpaolo Cazzola, an analyst at the International Energy Agency and the report's lead author. Ms Watson underlined that fuel economy policies work but more action is needed. She drew attention to the ongoing work that GFEI partners are undertaking to raise awareness of the importance of fuel economy, such as at the recent COP22 meeting in Marrakech, and the forty new countries that have jointed the initiative since the Paris Agreement in December 2015. In his presentation, Mr Cazzola showed evidence that ambitious policy frameworks, including fuel economy standards and differentiated taxation by fuel economy, are linked with improved fuel economy. Without policies, most vehicle attributes - including fuel economy - tend to stagnate, he said. The analysis also includes for the first time a comparative assessment of vehicle prices, identifying significant differences in vehicle prices across the main markets, with vehicles sold in the OECD and China having prices well above those marketed in Brazil, India and Mexico. It shows that achieving fuel economy reductions can come at a lower cost for consumers if efforts are focused on a wider segment of vehicles and power classes, where fuel economy performance is a secondary driver in the determination of vehicle prices. This suggests that provisions requiring greater relative fuel economy improvements in these vehicle classes offer greater opportunities to avoid passing the full cost of fuel economy improvement to consumers.

In doing so, our goal was to assist countries make sure that these NDCs were realistic and achievable, as well as linked to development priorities. The next step, and what is likely to be the focus at COP22 , is to help turn these targets into action on the ground. While the Paris Agreement has been lauded for putting countries on a long-term path to achieve a zero-carbon, sustainable future, the fine details and rules of the game will be addressed at Marrakesh, which has been dubbed the COP for Action. The regional dialogues are a successor to previous dialogues hosted in the lead-up to the Paris Agreement. Those discussions saw UNDP and partners work with governments to determine their own specific goals and ambitions. The upcoming dialogues will focus on NDC readiness, and the steps that need to happen legally, fiscally, technically that will enable momentum and results.

"COP22","India","COP22_India256","Action on water and climate needed for Paris goals and climate justice","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 9 -- Organised for the first time in the history of UN Climate Change Conferences (Conference of the Parties, or ""COPs""), the Action Day for Water at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ) created through the Global Climate Action Agenda calls for more attention to water as a way of providing solutions to help implement the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Countries have identified water as a key to adaptation in 93 per cent of their national climate action plans (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or ""INDCs""). Since water is fundamental for food security, human health, energy production, industrial productivity and biodiversity, in addition to basic human needs and its availability, ensuring water security means ensuring security in all these domains. In addition, water is critical for successful climate change mitigation, as many efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions depend on reliable access to water resources. Systematically addressing these challenges is, therefore, key to adapting to climate change and reducing the negative impacts of water-related disasters. On this occasion, the ""Blue Book on Water and Climate"" will be launched by the Moroccan government and its partners as a concrete outcome of its interim International Conference on Water and Climate, hosted in Rabat in July 2016, in cooperation with the Government of France and the World Water Council. The publication collects the orientations and recommendations brought forth by the international water community to support the implementation of climate commitments. It also proposes a variety of concrete and applicable solutions related to adaptation and resilience through water management. ""This aligns perfectly with COP22 , which is striving to be a COP of action!"" said Charafat Afailal, Minister Delegate in charge of Water of Morocco. ""Now, we need to realise what is at stake, since water insecurity leads to increased conflicts, tension between populations, and also provokes migration that threatens overall stability."" Climate justice is also a priority of the Water Action Day, as evident from the launch of the ""Water for Africa"" initiative, established by the Kingdom of Morocco and supported by the African Development Bank. This initiative aims at rendering justice to Africa through the adoption of a specific action plan that will mobilise different international political, financial and institutional partners to improve water and sanitation services and management in Africa, for those most affected by climate change. ""While humanity experiences increasing demographic and socio-economic stresses, recent episodes of extreme climate around the world bring additional complexities in finding solutions to reduce these stresses. Water is one of the most impacted resources, but water also provides solutions to these challenges,"" said Benedito Braga, president of the World Water Council. In addition, the three alliances for basins, megacities and businesses-created at COP21 in Paris and strongly engaged in water and climate action-which today represent more than 450 organisations worldwide, signed a common commitment to jointly mobilise their partners, identify and disseminate good practices and support the development of new projects by actors on the ground engaged in adaptation and resilience of the water sector. These three Alliances reported, in particular, during the Water showcase event on the positive progress made with the Flagship Projects on water adaptation launched at COP21, such as the Hydrological information system of the trans-boundary Congo River, the integrated management of the Hai River in China, the strengthening of the new Mexico Metropolitan Organization for Urban flooding drainage or the ""Eco-cuencas"" Climate adapt cooperation project between European and Andean countries and on new adaptation projects announced at COP22 Water Day, for example, the Sebou River management in Morocco, the creation of the Water Adapt Training Center in Brasilia or the future use of the SWOT satellite for Hydrological observations, inter alia"". ""Adaptation of water resources to climate change must be organised at the natural level of national or trans-boundary basin of rivers, lakes and aquifers, where water is flowing from upstream to downstream and mobilise all actors in the field, including local authorities, economic sectors and civil society to achieve a common vision to face the climate change challenges"", said Roberto Ramirez de la Parra, the president of the International Network of Basin Organizations.

A few weeks ahead of this world event, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), which made food security a priority, with Schneider Electric, the global specialist in energy management, and the African Biofuel and Renewable Energy Company (ABREC), the African renewable hub, decided to experiment a ""multi-energy"" plant for irrigation, fish farming and farming transformation. Developed by Schneider Electric, this solution is called Microsol. In this framework, ABREC, UEMOA's delegated project manager, signed a contract with Schneider Electric to implement the Microsol rural electrification solution in the eight member states of UEMOA. With Microsol, the three partners want to progressively offer to ~100,000 people access to the required electricity for irrigation, lighting, fish farming, farming transformation and the provision of drinking water without CO2 emissions.

As planned, India's ratification, a globally significant event, came on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. India submitted its voluntary action plan to cut carbon emissions on the same day last year. ""At 19:50 hrs IST today on Gandhi Jayanti, India deposited its Instrument of Ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change at the @UN,"" environment minister Anil Madhav Dave tweeted. According to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), India accounts for 4.1% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. With India ratifying the agreement, 62 countries accounting for 51.89% of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have joined the agreement. The historic Paris Agreement, which was agreed by 197 nations last year, comes into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the convention, accounting for at least 55% of total GHG emissions, submit their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval. India's move comes ahead of the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the UNFCCC in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 7-18 November. The host of COP22 hopes the 55% target would be achieved before the climate change conference starts. ""Ratification by India will help generate the political momentum necessary to bring the amendment in force,"" said the environment ministry, in an official statement put out on Sunday. ""India's decision to ratify the Paris agreement has come after ensuring compliance of domestic legal requirements, internal discussions and after obtaining clarity from UNFCCC with regard to transparency and participation of parties in the future processes. Countries have been assured by UNFCCC that other parties will be given sufficient time to ratify the Paris Agreement, at least till 2018, so that future decision-making is as inclusive as possible. India through its participation in the Paris Agreement, under the UNFCCC process, will articulate the interests of the poor and vulnerable groups,"" the statement added. Dave said in Morocco, India will raise issues related to finance and technology transfer from developed nations to developing nations-a long standing Indian demand. Environmentalists welcomed the fact that India had come out as an early mover in the ratification process and said the country should now play an important role in ensuring its implementation. ""By being in the club of early ratifiers, India has shown itself as a responsible and serious global player in climate talks. But ratification is just the beginning of tough and difficult negotiations ahead. India will have to pay an important role in making the agreement effective and equitable,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, a think tank. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last month India's ratification was the best possible tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, who lived an austere life that left a minimum carbon footprint. ""The rule book for implementation of the Paris Agreement is yet to negotiated. India should play an important role in issues of adaptation, finance and loss and damage in the upcoming climate talks in Marrakech as these issues are important for the poor and vulnerable population of the country,"" Bhushan added. CSE also said that India is already experiencing the impacts of climate change -- like extreme weather events, frequent droughts and floods -- when the temperature rise is about 1.1degC above pre-industrial levels. Earlier this week on Wednesday, the union cabinet approved the ratification of the Paris agreement. In its voluntary action plan submitted to UNFCCC to tackle climate change, India has committed itself to reducing the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product by 33-35% by 2030 from 2005 levels, and generate 40% of its cumulative electric power from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources.

As many as 31 countries had joined it at a special event at the UN on September 21 during the General Assembly high-level week.In early September, the world's two largest emitters - China and the United States - had joined the Agreement, providing the impetus for other countries to quickly complete their domestic ratification or approval processes.The Agreement will now enter into force in time for the Marrakech Climate Conference ( COP 22 ) in Morocco where countries will convene the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement (CMA1). The COP22 will be held from November 7 to 18.The countries that have not yet joined the Agreement through ratification may participate as observers.Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said, ""Above all, entry into force bodes well for the urgent, accelerated implementation of climate action that is now needed to realize a better, more secure world and to support also the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals.""""It also brings a renewed urgency to the many issues governments are advancing to ensure full implementation of the Agreement,"" she said.""This includes development of a rule book to operationalize the agreement and how international cooperation and much bigger flows of finance can speed up and scale up national climate action plans"", the UN statement said quoting her.The Paris Agreement's entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and two specific thresholds.Adopted by 196 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Paris Agreement's key aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change.It also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.

"COP22","India","COP22_India264","United States : Pneumonia and diarrhoea kill 1.4 million children each year, more than all other childhood illnesses combined UNICEF","November 14, 2016 Monday","TendersInfo","Pneumonia and diarrhoea together kill 1.4 million children each year, the overwhelming majority of whom live in lower and middle-income countries. These childhood deaths occur despite the fact that both illnesses are largely preventable through straightforward and cost effective solutions like exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, quality primary healthcare and reducing household air pollution. These findings are included in a new UNICEF report One is Too Many: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea released today. Pneumonia in particular remains the leading infectious killer of children under five, claiming the lives of nearly a million children in 2015 approximately one child every 35 seconds, and more than malaria, TB, measles, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all childhood pneumonia deaths are linked to air pollution, a fact UNICEF said world leaders should keep in mind during ongoing climate change talks at COP22 . COP22 can help to save childrens lives by commiting to actions that will reduce air pollution linked to climate change and agreeing to investments in prevention and healthcare, Ndiaye said. Like pneumonia, diarrhoea cases among children can, in many instances, be linked to lower levels of precipitation caused by climate change. Reduced availability of safe water leaves children at greater risk of contracting diarrhoeal diseases and suffering impaired physical and cognitive growth. Nearly 34 million children have died from pneumonia and diarrhoea since 2000. Without further investment in key prevention and treatment measures, UNICEF estimates that 24 million more children will die from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2030. These illnesses have such a disproportionately high impact on child mortality and are relatively inexpensive to treat, said Ndiaye. Yet they continue to receive only a fraction of global health investment which makes absolutely zero sense. Thats why were calling for increased global funding for protective, preventive and treatment interventions that we know will work to save childrens lives. UNICEF is also recommending increased funding for child healthcare generally and also for that focused on groups of children especially vulnerable to pneumonia and diarrhoea the youngest and those living in lower and middle-income countries. The report shows: - Approximately 80 per cent of childhood deaths linked to pneumonia and 70 per cent of those linked to diarrhoea occur during the first two years of life; - Low- and lower-middle income countries are home to 62 per cent of the worlds under 5 population, but account for more than 90 per cent of child pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths globally. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India265","South Africa : National Stakeholder Consultation Session in preparation for COP 22/CMP12","November 3, 2016 Thursday","TendersInfo","It is my pleasure to be with you today as we finalise our negotiating position and key messages that will guide South Africas delegation in the negotiations at the twenty second session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Marrakesh, Morocco. I am particular pleased to see a number of women and youth represented in this meeting from different organisations Allow me to share some thoughts on this subject, that is notably the biggest challenge facing humanity in the 21st century, and particularly since Africa, once again, will open its arms to the world in November to seek practical solutions to the scourge of climate change. Background You are all aware that 2015 was a special year on the international calendar. The world agreed to both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. This was largely due to increasing realisation globally of the seriousness of the challenge posed by climate change, spurred by overwhelming and very detailed scientific evidence on its causes and impacts contained in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes 5th Assessment Report. The simple truth is that climate change is already here today, and we are bearing the brunt of it. It is particularly devastating for us in the developing world, and specifically in Africa, and particularly for the vulnerable sectors of our population. South African context South Africas historically low-cost energy supply, together with the predominance of extractive industries, has combined to create our highly energy-intensive economy, with coal as the main fuel source, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal dominates the South African energy system, accounting for 74% of primary energy supply and 23% of final energy consumption. In 2010, South Africa generated 94% of its electricity using coal (IEA, 2012). At present South Africa and Nigeria are the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Africa. For South Africa, its GHG emissions per capita are higher than in most other major emerging economies, including Brazil, China, and India. This has triggered a number of policy initiatives across government, driven by various departments, including the National Treasury, the National Planning Commission, the Department of Energy through its Integrated Energy Plan (IEP) and Integrated Resources Plan (for electricity), and the Department of Environmental Affairs and highly successful renewable energy programme, various Cities programmes and others. The National Climate Change Response White Paper provides the framework for climate change policy in South Africa. The policy recognises that South Africa is a significant contributor to global climate change, mainly due to GHG emissions arising from its energy intensive, fossil-fuel powered economy. On the other hand, South Africa is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to our socio-economic and environmental context. Fortunately, as well as the abundance of coal, South Africa is also blessed with some of the best renewable energy resources in the world. Contributions to global solutions South Africa as a responsible country has continued to contribute immensely to finding a global solution to the climate change problem. In 2009, we made a pledge at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to limit our emissions in 2020 and 2025. In 2011, under South Africas COP Presidency, world leaders agreed on the Durban Platform, that launched the 4-year negotiating process of a multilateral legal framework on climate change, concluding at COP 21. In 2015 we led the Group of 77 plus China at COP 21 in Paris in a successful negotiation process that resulted in the Paris Agreement. With other countries, we also committed ourselves to work towards building climate resilience in our society, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions through our Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). The INDC demonstrated progression from the deviation from business as usual form of commitment made in Copenhagen to the peak, plateau and decline greenhouse gas emissions trajectory range outlined in our National Climate Change Response Policy. We have committed to keeping South Africas emissions in a range between 398 and 614 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2025 and 2030, as defined by our national policy. We are doing all this despite the many challenges that our country is facing, of poverty, inequality and unemployment. We are committed to contributing our fair share to the global effort of reducing global warming, and to transitioning to a lower carbon and climate resilient economy and society. This may seem like a daunting challenge. However, as one wise man once said it always seems impossible until it is done. We strongly believe that working together as business, government, non-governmental organisations and labour, we will rise to this challenge of bringing about a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Progress report in 2016 We all thought 2015 was a critical year for the fight against climate change, and yet 2016 is proving to be an even more exciting year. Countries adopted a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) amendment under the Montreal Protocol in a meeting in Kigali in October. In addition, a global market-based measure the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was adopted at the 39th session of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal in early October. In addition, sufficient countries ratified the Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC so that it will enter into force in November, far sooner than anyone expected. These global achievements are significant demonstrations of global commitment to taking climate action. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India266","Paris Agreement comes into force; first meeting of governing body may not happen","November 4, 2016 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 4 -- The Paris Climate Change Agreement, a landmark treaty signed by members of the UNFCCC in December 2015, has entered into force today (November 4). So far, 94 of the 192 signatories have ratified the agreement, which is beyond the threshold of ratification by ""at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions"" for the agreement to come into force. The European Union ratified the agreement in October 2015, ensuring the agreement's enforcement, 30 days later, as per the agreement. India had ratified the agreement on October 2 while other major emitters China and the USA had submitted their instruments of ratification a month earlier. The Paris Agreement lays down the objective of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2030. The objective is to be achieved through Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. While the Paris agreement provides a broad framework, the specifics of implementation, monitoring and the establishment of new institutions remain to be detailed. Although not stated explicitly, the Paris Agreement was prepared with the assumption that it will come into force only by 2020 when the Kyoto Protocol wraps up. But the agreement's entry into force has come within a year of signing the treaty in Paris, much sooner than expected even as the 2012 Doha Amendment of the Kyoto Protocol, which extends the mandate of the Kyoto Protocol up to 2020, is yet to be ratified. The promptness of the members of the agreement in ratifying it has been seen as a strong and positive political intent around the world to fight climate change. The statement by the UNFCCC announcing the agreement's entry into force claims euphorically that the agreement is ""undoubtedly a turning point in the history of common human endeavor, capturing the combined political, economic and social will of governments, cities, regions, citizens, business and investors to overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change. Its early entry into force is a clear political signal that all the nations of the world are devoted to decisive global action on climate change.This is a moment to celebrate."" The statement, however, also calls for caution and recognises the steepness of the task of enforcing ""unprecedented reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and unequalled efforts to build societies that can resist rising climate impacts."" What to expect from COP22 climate change conference? The COP22 climate change conference to be held in Marrakesh from November 7-18, 2016 shall also be the site for the first meeting of the members of the Paris Agreement's governing body-the CMA. The meeting is scheduled to happen on November 15. As less than half of the signatories have ratified the agreement so far, it is highly likely that the CMA1 (first meeting of the CMA) shall be suspended. ""During the pre-COP meetings held recently, it was decided that the CMA meeting should be suspended this year to allow time for other signatories to ratify the agreement and be a part of the decision-making process,"" said Ravishankar Prasad, a Joint Secretary for Climate Change at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The UNFCCC statement, too, hints at 2018 as the year by when members are expected to complete the details of the ""rule book"" that shall decide the implementation of the Paris Agreement. But while it is highly likely that nothing shall be set in stone during CMA1, progress in negotiations on specifics regarding adaptation, loss and damages and financial flows is expected. The establishment of institutions to coordinate capacity building and technology transfer and development, as well as a review of the finance mechanism, is likely to happen at the COP22 and CMA1 meetings this year, according to officials at the MOEFCC. One of the talking points during this year's COP is likely to be the financial mechanism at play for climate change action and specifically, target of mobilising US$100 billion from developed countries towards developing countries by 2020. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released a roadmap detailing the mobiliSation of about $67 billion from national commitments and further $22.8-25.5 billion from private entities by 2020. While the roadmap details a doubling of the adaptation fund by 2020, critics have pointed out that the roadmap relies heavily on market-based loans and export credits which should not count as funds. According to Prasad, ""The roadmap released two weeks ago relies on a similar methodology as the OECD-CPI report published last year, which was problematic for India. The ministry is currently vetting the roadmap and a rebuttal for the same shall be expressed soon."" Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

The findings are part of a report that was released on Friday, One is Too Many: Ending Child Deaths from Pneumonia and Diarrhoea in Marrakech while world leaders meet for the UN climate conference known by the shorthand COP22 to discuss the ways in which environmental issues are negatively impacting childrens health. We have seen clearly that air pollution linked to climate change is damaging the health and development of children by causing pneumonia and other respiratory infections, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Fatoumata Ndiaye said in a news release. Roughly one child dies every 35 seconds from pneumonia, making it the leading infectious killer of children under the age of five. Nearly one million children were its victims in 2015 more than malaria, tuberculosis, measles, and AIDS combined. According to Ndiaye, the high rates in part have to do with the fact that some two billion children are living in areas where air pollution exceeds international guidelines. As a result, she says, many are falling ill and dying. World leaders meeting at COP22 can help to save childrens lives by committing to actions that will reduce air pollution linked to climate change and agreeing to investments in prevention and healthcare, she said. Rates of diarrhoea in children are also related to climate change: as precipitation declines in certain areas, the reduced availability of safe water means more children are at risk of contracting diarrhoeal diseases and suffering impaired physical and cognitive growth, if not death. Since 2000, nearly 34 million children have died from pneumonia and diarrhoea. UNICEF estimates that a further 24 million will die by 2030 if further investments are not made in key prevention and treatment options. These illnesses have such a disproportionately high impact on child mortality and are relatively inexpensive to treat, noted Ndiaye. Yet they continue to receive only a fraction of global health investment which makes absolutely zero sense. Thats why were calling for increased global funding for protective, preventive and treatment interventions that we know will work to save childrens lives. According to the report that was released on Friday, 80 per cent of childhood deaths linked to pneumonia and 70 per cent of those linked to diarrhoea occur during the first two years of life. 62 per cent of children under the age of five live in low and middle income countries but account for 90 per cent of child pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths worldwide. UNICEF urges that funding be targeted towards childrens general healthcare as well as for those groups who are particularly vulnerable to pneumonia and diarrhoea i.e., those under the age of five and living in lower and middle income countries.

With the addition of the Currentergy Division, Dominovas Energy continues to diversify its portfolio of proven energy solutions into hydropower generation applications to broaden its revenue generating opportunities in the renewable energy sphere. With a focus on deploying commercially available, and the most advanced, proven high performance hydropower technologies, Currentergy seeks to harness both large and small-scale opportunities to electrify developing economies in Africa and Latin America; thus fostering and expanding exponential economic growth within these frontier markets. In so doing, Currentergy has developed its proprietary ORCAS (Ocean River Current Access Solutions) system, which is platformed upon the most advanced and effective hydropower technologies available today. The ORCAS system enables both on- and off-grid clean energy and micro-grid flexibility for the generation of electricity from river and ocean-based power generating systems. The ORCAS system is underpinned by its strategic partner and leading global technology supplier Andritz Hydro. Globally, Andritz Hydro's hydropower solutions comprise over 175 years of experience in the deployment, service, refurbishment and rehabilitation of hydropower energy projects. Dominovas Energy CEO Neal Allen welcomes the new Currentergy Division and the addition of Leeshan Ramasamy as Managing Director and head of the Division. Mr. Ramasamy has considerable operational and systems management experience within the development and cultivation of frontier markets' infrastructure and natural resources, having produced significant returns within the mining industry, including the building and operating of profitable chrome processing plants, which led to securing contracts with major ferrochrome producers, such as Xstrata and Hernic Ferrochrome in South Africa. Prior to joining Currentergy, Mr. Ramasamy directed the civil construction and installations for the fiber optic footprint deployment of telecommunications giant Neotel in South Africa. ""As an active member of President Obama's Power Africa Initiative, we continue to enthusiastically support the electrification of Africa and realize that the abundant supply of underutilized natural resources can be responsibly harnessed to create clean sources of electricity. I agree with Andritz that hydropower is the most economical and least environmentally impactful form of renewable energy available."" Mr. Ramasamy continues, ""The ORCAS hydro system can empower local communities with micro grid applications, as well as feed utility grids in a green and eco-safe fashion. As the post-Paris Climate Accords world embraces a low carbon energy future, Currentergy is excited to be a leader in electrifying frontier markets."" ""The world is at a crossroads as a result of the effects of global warming and CO2 pollution, as reported at the historic United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris recently.

The Kyoto Protocol, that was adopted in 1997 and came into force in February 2005, is an international agreement under United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which binds a certain group of ""developed countries"" (listed under Annexe-I) of its total 192 parties to reduce their emissions. While the landmark Paris climate change agreement -- COP21, that entered into force in November 2016 (during COP22 ), is for the post-2020 period, the Kyoto Protocol is like the pre-2020 agenda to contain climate change. ""In view of the critical role played by India in securing international consensus on climate change issues, this decision further underlines India's leadership... to global cause of environmental protection and climate justice,"" an official statement said. India ratifying the Kyoto Protocol will also encourage other developing countries to follow suit. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was between 2008 to 2012 and the second period -- the Doha Amendment -- which was adopted in 2012, was to enter in action in 2013 to 2020. It is yet to enter into force as it requires 144 ratifications out of the 192 parties to the Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is the commitment of the developed countries -- the major cause of global warming due to their higher emissions, to bring these down. However, unlike the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol does not bind its ""developing parties or counties"" like India and China (based on the per capita emission) into any kind of obligation to reduce the emissions or set any targets. The targets are only applicable to the less than 40 countries listed in Annexe-I. The US, which amounts for about 17 per cent of global emissions (the highest), was among the first developed countries to oppose the Kyoto Protocol and has not signed it yet. Canada, following the US, has also withdrawn from the Protocol. Experts see India's move as a step to build pressure on the developed countries to operationalise the Doha Amendment. During the first commitment period of the Protocol (2008-12), 37 industrialised countries and the European Community committed to reduce GHG emissions to around five per cent against the 1990 levels. Under the Doha Amendment, which should've become operational on January 1, 2013, the obligated parties are required to work towards reducing the GHC emissions by at least 18 per cent below 1990 levels, till 2020 before the Paris Agreement kicks in. Parties are also supposed to report a revised list of the GHCs during second commitment period. Meanwhile, in absence of any global binding committments since 2013, the year 2016 was the warmest so far, followed by 2015 and 2014. --IANS kd/vm \"

Amina Benkhadra, Morocco\\x92s former energy minister and current director-general of the Moroccan National Hydrocarbons and Mining Company, spoke with Rudroneel Ghosh about India-Morocco synergy in hydrocarbons, Morocco hosting the next UN climate summit and what it means to be a woman politician in the Arab world:\\xA0\\xA0\\xA0\\xA0\\xA0 \\xA0You attended the 4th India-Africa Hydrocarbons Conference in New Delhi in January. What are your thoughts about boosting cooperation between the two sides in the hydrocarbons space?\\xA0The 4th India-Africa Hydrocarbons Conference held on the 21st and 22nd of January 2016 in New Delhi, was a clear illustration of the Indian and the African governments\\x92 aims to boost their bilateral cooperation in the hydrocarbons sector. India has emerged as the fourth largest consumer and third largest importer of hydrocarbon products. On the other hand, Africa plays a significant role in this sector with 14.5% of current proved recoverable oil reserves and 13.2% of the recoverable gas reserves in the world. This supply-demand complementarity is a natural avenue for a long-term and sustainable partnership between Africa and India in the hydrocarbons sector. It is with this in mind that we want to strengthen ties between Morocco and India by attracting Indian oil companies to invest in the Moroccan hydrocarbons sector.\\xA0What\\x92s your take on the future of oil given the current low price environment?Despite substantial adverse implications for the oil and gas industry, the collapse in the price of oil will generally have positive implications for the global economy. A $60 reduction in the price of crude oil translates into a $5 billion per day stimulus to the global economy, or more than $2.3 trillion per year. However, benefits to the broader economy would be somewhat offset by the negative impacts to the oil and gas industry.In spite of these market circumstances, I believe that an extended period of low oil prices might actually help reset the industry for the better and place it on a more sustainable development path for the medium term.Please elaborate on Morocco\\x92s push for renewables and your country hosting the UN Climate Conference ( COP22 ) this year. Morocco imports 94% of its energy needs. In this context, the energy strategy Morocco adopted in 2009 aims to mobilise domestic energy sources, mainly renewables such as wind and solar. Our Solar Power Programme and Wind Power Programme totalling 2000 MW each will be achieved by 2020. These projects accelerate the massive introduction of renewable energy sources in electricity generation as they will represent 42% of the global electrical capacity installed in 2020 (solar, wind and hydraulic power representing each 14%). By 2030, renewable energy will represent 52% in the total capacity installed equivalent to 12,850 MW.Morocco\\x92s commitment to environmental protection did not start today. Indeed, this strategy is in our national interest and conforms to our international commitments. It reflects the supreme interest that our King Mohammed VI has placed on sustainable development and preservation of the environment. His majesty has expressed this with force and determination on various occasions including the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, Rio + 5 in New York in 1997 and at the World Summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in 2002. Since the Earth Summit in 1992, Morocco has participated actively and regularly in international efforts to protect the global climate.In moderating COP22 , Morocco will highlight its determination to advance negotiations and solutions that should be followed. We must continue efforts to support a large part of the Southern countries, particularly African countries and island nations. We already know that COP22 will address the issues of funding, innovation and technology transfer to fight the effects of global warming.As a politician and a former minister, how do you view the dynamics of being a woman leader in the Arab world?Being a woman leader in the Arab World is a challenge. In Morocco, under the leadership of our King, the government has adopted a variety of laws, strategies and action plans in order to promote and protect women\\x92s rights and women\\x92s position in society. Since the implementation of the new family code in 2004, Morocco is presented as a country which invests in favour of gender equality. Important progress has been made in the last fifteen years which has improved women's access to high offices. It is a huge honour for me to be holding such an office. As women, we have to show that we are not only equal but that we can surpass the limits set for us. \"

""Developed countries have failed to undertake the measures required to achieve the global temperature goals. The adaptation costs and needs of developing countries will continue to grow unless significant action is undertaken,"" said the report ""Global Goal on Adaptation."" The report released at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) here by ActionAid, CARE International and WWF highlighted the need for urgent action on the GGA for increasing support to vulnerable countries, populations and ecosystems. ""While the developing countries are already making significant investments in adaptation, this can also divert resources away from other development priorities,"" the report said. With climate impacts rising and set to become more severe in the years ahead, this means that most developing countries cannot meet the growing adaptation needs without further support. ""Increasing warming levels make it more crucial that we have a global goal on adaptation to ensure the world scales up its efforts and keeps people's safety at the centre,"" global lead on climate change for ActionAid Harjeet Singh said in a conference. The report recommended that by 2018, all developing countries should have available assessments of their existing capacity and projected gaps to develop adaptation strategies and meet adaptation needs, with clear requirement of international support to be provided. Climate Change advocacy coordinator with CARE International Sven Harmeling said that the developed countries need to provide more support for priority actions of community adaptation in developing countries. To accelerate the adaptation action preparation by 2018, ActionAid, CARE and WWF make nine key recommendations. These include, development and implementation of a gender-equitable National Adaptation Plan (NAPs), assessments on capacity gaps and support needs in developing countries, strengthening global institutions, scaling up adaptation finance provided by developed countries and adapting science based finance targets. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank (EIB) said here that it would increase its climate-related investments by 30 per cent. The EIB, which has also invested in Lucknow Metro Rail Project in Uttar Pradesh, invested 20.7 billion Euros in 2015 and 90 billion Euros in the last five years towards climate-related projects.

By setting a new path for increased cooperation between national, regional and local governments and working to get the finances right, the world is making progress. We must continue to look forward as words are nothing without action: we must scale-up investment and support the worlds cities and regions who will make or break the Paris climate promises said Markku Markkula, President of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) - the EUs assembly of local and regional representatives. During the COP22 During the climate talks in Marrakech two initiatives were launched by the UNs Climate Champions Hakima Al Hait and Laurence Tubiana to increase cooperation between all levels of government and accelerate the delivery of climate measures on the ground: the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and the 2050 Pathways Platform . The UNs Climate Champions have worked hard to give cities and regions a stronger voice in the UN climate talks and put in place the finances needed to convert Paris commitments into bankable projects, said President Markkula. While the new Marrakech Partnership focuses on bolstering investments from 2017 to 2020, the 2050 Pathways Platform targets long-term deep decarbonisation action plans both which the CoR had called for. President Markkula said, The EU must now show the way by updating the 2050 Roadmaps to ensure it complies with the Paris Agreement's obligations. Six European regions have already joined the UNs 2050 Pathways Platform: Baden Werttemberg, Catalonia, Greater Manchester, North Rhine-Westphalia, Piedmont, Scotland?and Wales. And there are many more ready to join President Markkula added. He also welcomed The Marrakech Action Proclamation adopted by Heads of State reaffirming their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and mobilise USD100 million annually by 2020. However, President Markkula warned, We still need more ambitious targets if we are to avert the devastation climate change will bring. The EU must upgrade its own commitment of cutting 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 50% instead of 40% by 2030. We must aim for a carbon neutral world by 2050'. Through initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, the worlds local and regional governments are key to bridging the gap between governments climate commitments and the Paris Agreement which seeks to keep temperatures rising well below 2C. A total of 111 countries out of 197 parties to the UN climate convention have ratified the Paris agreement as the COP22 came to an end. \"

The African Development Bank and its partners are hosting the Africa Pavilion, which provides a space to address issues affecting the continent. Events kicked Monday with a discussion of urban resilience. The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on Monday, November 14 reiterated their commitment to support African cities, which are being impacted by the effects of climate change, and to build resilience. The two institutions delivered this message at a joint event on ""Leveraging climate finance for urban resilience in Africa"" at COP22 in Marrakech. The two organisations pledged to redouble their efforts towards meeting the cost of climate change adaptation, which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) projects to be in the range of US $28-67 billion per year by 2030. The event took place at the Africa Pavilion - an area dedicated entirely to the continent where climate change issues specific to Africa will be showcased. The AfDB, the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the African Union and NEPAD are hosting the Africa Pavilion at COP22 . The Pavilion provides the space for the Bank and its partners to showcase innovative initiatives and actions aimed at achieving the objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement. The Pavilion also serves as the hub of African networking, through debate, information exchange, exhibitions and formal and informal meetings. . Amadou Hott, AfDB Vice-President, Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, said, ""The AfDB is committed to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and support African countries to access funding from all partners including the GEF to meet their ambitions set in the National Determined Contributions (NDCs)."" He stressed that the Paris Agreement recognizes the major role that urban centres have to play in tackling change, adding that cities are now home to over half of the global population. Hott emphasised that, in Africa, urbanisation would increase exponentially over the coming decades, a development that has profound implications in the face of climate change, creating vulnerabilities to external shocks, including economic and climatic. He stressed that cities will need more capacity to absorb and recover from climatic shocks and stresses, but lamented that the expansion of cities is at the expense of forests and other natural environments or ecosystems, and comes with increase in pollution, and related diseases. He listed the Bank's ""High Five"" priorities for Africa: Light up and power Africa; Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; Integrate Africa; and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. GEF also supports the Sustainable City Programme, which the AfDB is implementing in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, said Ishii. Cities can be designed to be more compact, to reduce the impact of flooding for instance, she said, adding that cities' infrastructure can also be retrofitted to increase their resilience.

Barkindo and Espinosa, along with senior delegations from both organisations, discussed the importance of enhancing cooperation between the UNFCCC and OPEC, especially on matters related to climate change, sustainable development and economic diversification. The meeting builds on the ongoing involvement of OPEC in climate change negotiations and the active participation of its Member Countries. Barkindo congratulated Espinosa on the entering into force of the Paris Agreement and the significant and effective support provided by the UNFCCC secretariat in this process. He pointed out that successful implementation of the Agreement is a priority for OPEC, adding that OPEC Member Countries have been involved in climate change negotiations and the implementation of the Convention since its inception process. The UNFCCC secretariat shared information regarding a high level event on sustainable economic transition and economic diversification to be organised by the Moroccan Presidency during COP22 . The event is expected to be attended by Ministers and heads of delegations and targets raising awareness of the importance of economic diversification and transformation in relation to the impact of the implementation of mitigation measures and how that is linked to sustainable development for many developing countries. The leaders agreed that enhancement of cooperation between the two organisations is beneficial, particularly since the OPEC Secretariat is an intergovernmental organisation representing 14 developing countries, all of which are also Parties to the UNFCCC. Such teamwork enhances input from developing countries in the implementation of both the Convention and the Paris Agreement. The importance of inclusiveness and participation by all parties in implementing the Paris Agreement was emphasised during the meeting, taking into account that sustainable development and poverty alleviation are high priorities for all. The key role of oil in economic development and the right of developing countries to develop was stressed. In this regard, the OPEC efforts towards sustainable market stability were recognised as a contribution to a healthy global economy and helping implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement and the transition to a low emission economy. Both secretariats acknowledged that economic diversification is an important objective for building economic resilience and agreed to explore all available capacities which can assist OPEC Member Countries in diversifying their economies and achieving just transition of work force. The Paris Agreement will enter into force on 4 November 2016. As a result of this, the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA1) will take place in Marrakech in conjunction with COP22 /CMP12.

"COP22","India","COP22_India281","All countries should see air pollution in Delhi as 'wake-up call' - UNICEF","November 11, 2016 Friday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York, Nov 11 (Just Earth News): Amid reports that air pollution in India's capital, Delhi, has hit record highs over the past week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has called on all countries to pay attention this emblematic case and take decisive actions to tackle the issue. With every breath, children in Delhi are suffering, said UNICEF in a news release on Thursday, pointing to reports that air pollution in one of its neighbourhoods hit 999 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter (compared to an average of between 150-350 in January 2016). Delhi is a wake-up call to the world on air pollution. It is a wake-up call to all countries and cities where air pollution levels have resulted in death and illness amongst children, it added, stressing: Unless decisive actions are taken to reduce air pollution, the events we are witnessing in Delhi over the past week are likely to be increasingly common. According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), there is a close, quantitative relationship between exposure to high concentrations of small particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) and increased mortality or morbidity, both daily and over time. This type of pollution has health impacts even at very low concentrations and no threshold has been identified below which no damage to health is observed. On the air pollution in Delhi, UNICEF said that an estimated 4.41 million children in the city missed three days of school, earlier this week, following a decision to close its 5,798 schools to minimize the risk for children to be exposed to the polluted air. Air pollution challenge not unique to Delhi It further said that this is not just challenge in Indian capital, numerous other cities in the country, such as Varanasi and Lucknow, as well as elsewhere in the world such as London, Beijing, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Manila have exceeded international guidelines in some cases by considerable margin. Recent analysis by the agency has shown that, globally, 300 million children live in areas with the most toxic levels of outdoor air pollution exceeding six times international guidelines. Highlighting that air pollution is a major contributing factor to some of the most deadly diseases children face, such as pneumonia, UNICEF cautioned that the pollution also affects their overall health. Almost a million children under the age of five die from pneumonia per year and about half of those cases are directly linked with air pollution. Studies show it is linked with and can exacerbate asthma, bronchitis, airway inflammation, coughing and wheezing. Illness associated with air pollution can affect childrens ability to go to school, the agency said, adding: New research even points to the effects it can have on cognitive development amongst very young children. Those without access to medical treatment, who are often the poorest, and those who have pre-existing respiratory conditions, are most at risk. Much can be done to improve the situation Further in its release on Thursday, UNICEF said that stronger measures to cut back on the sources of air pollution. Air pollution moves across borders, both national ones as well as subnational ones, and so we will need coherent government policies to address these transboundary risks, it noted. Also, providing children with access to good quality healthcare is a major part of protecting them from air pollution, and treatment and prevention programmes for pneumonia, as well as other respiratory conditions, can significantly reduce the chance a child falls sick or dies. UNICEF also called for better monitoring of air pollution at a global scale. When a child, a mother, a father or caregiver know how bad the air is on a real-time basis, they can begin to take actions to reduce exposure, it stressed and urging pregnant mothers, and others who are at especially high risk to do their best to avoid areas where air pollution is at its highest. Public knowledge on air pollution is a key first step to tackling it it is key to supporting government policies to reduce it, the agency stressed. COP22 is an important platform for action Reminding that this week is also the first week of twenty-second Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), popularly known as COP 22 , UNICEF said: Actions that reduce air pollution can not only improve childrens health, but can also go a long way to also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the argument for reducing air pollution could not be clearer. And because we can we must, underscored the agency. Photo: World Bank/Simone D.

"COP22","India","COP22_India282","'Act now to prevent water conflicts'","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","Samay Live","Although Conference of Parties started in 1994 nothing substantial has emerged so far due to sheer neglect of nature and love for humanity. Whatever changes have come by have not led to positive changes. As the world leaders discuss climate change at the ongoing 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakech, Morocco that began on November 7 and will continue till November 17, increased population and demand for energy are now being blamed to be the causes for Climate change. ""The nation states should realize the dangers of mitigation efforts through business and funding of corporate world, which would instead aggravate negative climate change impacts but not solve them,"" Magsaysay and Stockholm Water Awards winner Rajendra Singh, popularly known as the Waterman of India, said in Marrakech on Monday November 14. Singh has given the slogan ""water is climate and climate is water"" and is campaigning for Dharwad Declaration 2016, which is an outcome of Global Water Meet for Climate Change Adaptation: Agrarian Perspectives' organized by University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, Karnataka, just before the Morocco summit which was attended by water experts, activists and policy makers and farmers from across 20 countries representing five continents. The Dharwad Declaration had recommended: a) A comprehensive review of policy and holistic plan related to water use efficiency, conservation, rejuvenation of rivers, and value added services (demand driven rationing) b) Urgent attention to identify and recommend location specific and ecologically sustainable water saving crops that helps bridge the yield gap currently existing in farmers' fields compared to results from research and demonstration programs. In Marrakech, Singh has spoken at various events like conferences, Agoras, interactions, group meetings and summit of Vice Chancellors of African Universities in the COP22 in the Green Zone, and has appealed to the global community upon placing priority on water conservation and agriculture in the global climate change adaptation programmes and funding. He has also been highlighting the success stories of community efforts in climate change adaptation through water harvesting, greening the fields and reforestation in India. Notably, Water has got the prominence at the summit level for the first time in Marrakech where there is a separate dialogue on the issue. Earlier it had figured in COP-21 in Paris last year only after a sustained movement by water activists from across the globe. As campaign for community driven water conservation is gaining ground, COP 22 in Morocco would be historic in the sense that here water, climate adaptation and community action with agrarian perspectives gets prominence. Hence, the Dharwad Declaration of Climate Change, Water and Agriculture, becomes important for water activists from across the globe. This is also because Water has already become a scarce commodity in Asia and Africa. In India, the per capita water availability has already decreased from 5177 m3 in the 1950s to 1545 m3 in 2011. Li Ji, a Professor of China Agricultural University in Beijing, who studied the water problems in north China, pointed out at the Global Water Meet that 18 provinces there face water shortage which is ""serious"" in at least nine of these provinces. The African nation Malawi, where people are affected by flood is already declared a disaster nation. ""We cannot define floods minus climate change,"" Moses Busher, National Coordinator of Centre for Children's Affairs, Malawi, had said in Dharwad. Already there are prolonged and intensified droughts in eastern Africa; depletion of rain forests in equatorial Africa; unprecedented floods in western Africa. European countries too face the gloom. Slovakian environmentalist and recipient of Goldman Environmental Prize, Michal Kravcik, warns that in a decade, the water resources in Slovakia will decrease in total by ca 4-6 billion cubic meters annually, what represents 10-17 % of the total volume of yearly rainfalls. A UN report states that as many as 3.4 billion people will live in water-scarce countries, by 2025. There is no doubt that challenges in the water sector are aggravated by climate change impacts. What sounds ominous is that the mismatch between demand and supply of water is now creating more water conflicts. The war in Syria is being cited as an escalation of what had started as water conflicts. Syria for the last four decades was among the countries leading in food sustainability. ""I saw in Turkey that big dams on Euphrates river stopped water flow to Syria. This affected Syria and people started migrating to Germany via TurkeySee this war started with water. Similar water conflicts are there in Sudan, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Palestine. Central Asia and Africa is facing grave threat over water,"" Singh claimed. Aida Shibli, a Palestinian peace worker consented that ""Palestine today as many places in the Middle-East, is in a critical situation with regard to water Coming from war zones, life and water means different."" More action is required on ground to prevent water conflicts. It is in this light that the Morocco summit is crucial. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India284","GE Announces More Than $800 Million in Digital Industrial Power Orders for Asia-Pacific Region","September 20, 2016 Tuesday","Pivotal Sources","Korea Republic of, Sept. 20 -- GE Power, a division of GE, announced more than $800 million in new orders across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, showcasing the company's leadership in providing regional customers with more efficient, reliable and sustainable solutions for the digital transformation of electricity. Announced at this year's Power-Gen Asia industry conference in Seoul, GE's APAC orders span across the company's comprehensive power generation portfolio. Orders include the first heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) technology project following GE's acquisition of Korean-based Doosan Engineering & Construction Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) business in August 2016. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Korea announced its aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37% by 2030. GE's broad power generation portfolio is well positioned to support the country's goals and regional customer needs with the latest high-efficiency technologies. GE's current Asia Pacific gas turbine fleet consists of more than 1,000 units across 15 countries, comprising the largest gas turbine portfolio in the region. GE units can deliver from 22 megawatts (MW) of power up to 519 MW, the equivalent power that would be needed to supply more than 1 million homes in countries such as Japan and Korea. More than 20,000 GE professionals work in the region with dedicated facilities in 10 countries. Today's announcement includes more than $660 million in orders from GE's Power Services business (signed during the last 90 days), providing customers with other-OEM service capabilities. Power Services expanded its total plant solutions capabilities with GE's acquisition of Alstom's Thermal Power business in 2015. GE also continues to see growth in its combined cycle power plant technologies such as HRSG to enable better plant performance.

"COP22","India","COP22_India285","Renewable Energy Shines in Morocco","September 16, 2016 Friday 6:30 AM EST","India Energy News","Sept. 16 -- Waiting for # COP22 , Morocco prepares the ground for the next world climate summit with Photovolatica 2016. EGP and RES4MED, gold sponsors of the event, discuss green tech development potential in Africa. In recent years, Morocco has consolidated its leadership in the development of energy from renewable sources throughout North Africa. It is preparing to host the next United Nations Climate Summit ( COP22 ) in Marrakech from November 7 to 18. The summit represents a crucial event in the future of climate policy, bringing together representatives from governments, organisations and businesses to take stock of the state of implementation of the agreement signed almost a year ago at COP21 in Paris, defining ambitious goals in the fight against global warming. The second edition of Photovoltaica was held in Casablanca from September 7 to 9 in light of this important event. The fair, which is dedicated to solar energy development and technology, was held under the high patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and Morocco's Ministry of Energy and the Environment. It is in this context that the launch of a new national energy plan, to promote a 40 billion dollar investment in 15 years was announced, of which two-thirds will be used in the development of green power plants. The gold sponsors of the event were RES4MED (an organisation for the development of renewable energy in the Mediterranean area) and Enel Green Power, which collaborated with Cesi, Enerray, Erm, Italgen and Poyry, presenting a joint stand at Photovolatica 2016 to promote green tech, as well as a workshop on solar technology innovation and development. Francesco Venturini, head of Enel's Global Renewable Energies Business Line, spoke at the opening of the event, underlining Morocco's increasing competitiveness in the renewables sector, having set a 52% green generation target by 2030. In the last two years, stated Venturini, the Kingdom of Morocco has demonstrated its leadership in the sector in northwestern Africa, by launching some of the most noteworthy projects for plants from renewable sources, including both solar power and wind power technology, to which Enel Green Power will contribute, having won a tender with Nareva and Siemens to build five wind farms totaling 850 MW. After having expressed his appreciation for the newly introduced regulatory innovations and the upcoming creation of the independent authority in the sector (Anre), Venturini expressed his hope that the Moroccan government may consider the possibility of increasing the share of photovoltaic technology within the National Solar Plan. In particular, Enel's Global Renewable Energies head welcomed the opening of tenders calling for solutions that combine photovoltaic technology with storage systems, in order to offer more flexible solutions in electricity generation and distribution, compared to concentrated solar power. A conference promoted by EGP and RES4MED was held on the second day of Photovoltaica, called ""PV deployment, lessons learned and potential of application in Morocco and Western Africa."" The workshop offered experts, institutional leaders and private companies the opportunity to analyse the different aspects related to the development of solar plants and industrial integration, focusing on green strategies in particularly dry areas, such as North Africa and sub-Saharan countries.

Some may also say that journalism itself is guilty by omission due to what many educators see as poor coverage of climate change. Such issues were the topic of conversation among panelists and delegates alike at the 4th World Journalism Education Congress (WJEC) entered its second day. Professor David Robie of the Pacific Media Centre set the tone of the panel discussion, questioning what the role of the media and indeed media education was in a post-COP21 world. He asked whether media currently was giving enough emphasis to the issue, but more importantly to the human rights issues that sit within climate change. This was a theme readily engaged with by the panelists, Professor Crispin Maslog, chairman of the Asian Media Information and Communication Centre in Manila, Dr Hermin Indah Wahyuni of Universitas Gadjah Mada, National University of Samoa's Misa Vicky Lepou, and Jose Maria Carlos from the Philippines. Although speaking to journalism education and climate change in their respective countries - the Philippines, Indonesia and Samoa - all of the panelists said the media was failing in reporting climate change. Professor Crispin Maslog on the climate change panel. Image: Del Abcede Although coverage was not wholly lacking, the panel stressed, improvements are still needed. Dr Wahyuni said this was the case as current framing centred on a ""impact-victim frame"" which only built a ""easy causal relationship"" between disasters and climate change. Although Carlos also noted that this was the case in his discussion, he said that despite a ""high level"" of climate change coverage throughout Asia, gaps remained in the ""depth of understanding"" of the issue by the Filipino public. He highlighted that this was a concern noted not only by academics and non-governmental organisations, but also journalists themselves. Misa said the current lack in climate change coverage culminated in a ""top-down"" effect in newsrooms, in which editors refused to take notice of the issue because it was not ""sexy"" enough. She highlighted that this seemed to be the case in Samoa, where climate change was the lesser covered topic in three of its newspapers compared to business. Misa noted this ""reflects the priorities"" in the daily news agenda worldwide. Calls not new However, this is not the first time such issues have been noted, nor calls for new media strategies in relation to climate change made. Several academics, journalists and non-governmental actors debated the issue in May forAsia Pacific Report. Although unable to reach consensus on a precise strategy moving forward, all stressed the importance of changes being made. Future solutions? The panelists also did not simply lament the current state of climate change journalism. Both Dr Maslog, Dr Wahyuni, Carlos and Lepou all posed possible solutions to the current crisis. Dr Maslog said that ""training on the job"" should take place for media practitioners into environmental and disaster reporting. Professor Cris Nash of Monash ... posing a question. Image: Del Abcede/PMC Dr Wahyuni said the media should continue to act as an observer, but stressed that in doing so it should ""keep up with science"". Carlos agreed, saying ""good principles"" should continue to be stressed. Dr Wahyuni said, however, echoing points made by her fellow delegates throughout the WJEC regarding student journalists being at the heart of improvements, said the introduction of a climate change module into the journalism curriculum would ""bring life to journalism education"". Both panelists and delegates agreed, however, that ""so much needs to be done"". In the face of a lack of ""political will"" from both politicians and journalists alike regarding climate change however, all acknowledged that it may be an uphill battle.

"COP22","India","COP22_India287","Every automobile brand wants to take on Tesla's Model 3 with their version of a long-range electric car: But why?","May 28, 2016 Saturday 6:30 AM EST","Yourstory.in","Elon Musk may have kick-started a hysterical technology movement ever since Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2008. For $35,000, Tesla Inc.'s Model-3 car is expected to offer a range of 346 km on a single charge. Game changing as it may be, it will require a lot of money to get the battery packs and the software controlling the battery management system to be on top of the game. So what does Tesla Inc. do? It has raised $2.1 billion in cash after two tranches of stock sale. It will use this money to increase the number of charging stations and also manufacture close to 2,00,000 Model-3 cars. However, the automobile world does not want Tesla Inc. to steal all the thunder from them. So every known brand from General Motors to Toyota to Ford to Mercedes to BMW to Hyundai - has long-range electric vehicle (EV) strategies in the pipeline. Ever since the announcement of Tesla's Model-3, consumers are in love with long-range EVs even before its launch. Expectations of each launch has reached fever pitch, sort of like in tribal societies who expect the birth of a male heir to continue the lineage of the tribe. Tesla's online bookings were a case in point because the company garnered close to 4,00,000 requests. The company has not revealed how many of them will be delivered by 2018. But the key to the fever pitch is the 346 km that the Model 3 promises to perform. But Nissan took a dig at the Model-S with its ad-campaign with the tagline ""Why wait when you can drive an all-Electric Leaf. And why drop $1,000 to stand in line when you can get $4,000 cash back and best-in-class range."" Nissan asks a very pertinent question. But are automakers worried? The answer is, yes! Technology in the long-range EV game ""Every EV car maker's dream is to increase the range. With new age battery management systems, the battery packs are getting smaller and are more efficient,"" says Chetan Maini, Founder of Reva, which was bought by Mahindra & Mahindra in 2010. A long-range EV is like a phone that offers 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM. The car is now a device and consumers have their data stored in the cloud. Thus, for this one reason Tesla is closer to the consumer than most other automobile companies. Most OEMs have to depend on dealers and disparate diagnostic connected systems to serve the customer. Tesla Inc. can build an entire ecosystem - of startups building on its tech platform - to bridge concepts like the connected home or health or city. The car is the centre of the Universe. This is the Universe that everyone is entering. The long-range EV of 346 km is the first step. The larger game is in the software to enable various pieces of the connected consumer ecosystem. No wonder automobile vendors like Bosch GmBh and Continental are building software teams to support automobile brands to ramp up their connected ecosystem and are sourcing electric vehicle drive systems to ready future launches of EV cars. The real debate is global warming In the middle of all these debates about range and design global warming is the argument that is going to move the needle in favour of EVs. Carlos Ghosn, the Chairman of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, has been making a case for EVs to be the only solution to reduce global warming because transportation amounts to 17 percent of the total CO2 emissions in the world. The recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference has garnered signatories from 196 nations to limit the rise in global warming to only two degrees centigrade. Tesla Inc. has made the noises in this direction. Hopefully, other automobile companies have followed the long-range EV debate with the right reasons than the novelty aspect of it. Seriously, these large automobile brands have already made big investments for 2030, when EVs are expected to be 35 percent of the total automobile sales - according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance in the world. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India288","Belgium : European Union joins Mission Innovation, a global initiative on clean energy","June 5, 2016 Sunday","TendersInfo","As the 21st member of Mission Innovation the EU will accelerate global clean energy innovation with the objective to make clean energy widely affordable. The European Union has joined Mission Innovation, a global initiative on clean energy, at its inaugural ministerial meeting in San Francisco on 1-2 June. This initiative was launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) in Paris with the aim of reinvigorating and accelerating public and private global clean energy innovation. In joining Mission Innovation, 20 of the world's major economies, representing 58% of the world population and over 80% of global clean energy research budgets, have pledged to double their government investment in clean energy research and innovation over the next five years. The European Commission has now joined this initiative on behalf of the EU, which funds clean energy under the EU research and innovation programme Horizon 2020. Maro ef?ovi?, Vice-President responsible for the Energy Union, said: ""The European Commission is honoured to be part of Mission Innovation. Scaling up clean energy innovation is key to the success of the European Energy Union and to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. It also represents a major global economic and industrial opportunity. Mission Innovation therefore coheres perfectly with our upcoming research, innovation and competitiveness strategy."" Carlos Moedas, Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, added: ""I have set three goals for the EU research and innovation policy - Open Innovation, Open Science, and Open to the World - and Mission Innovation combines all three. Open innovation by bringing a variety of actors together, open science by promoting synergies and the sharing of research results, and openness to the world by being a prime example of a truly global collaboration. I am confident that Mission Innovation is well geared to accelerate the clean energy revolution."" Around 10 billion funding is expected to be allocated to clean energy under Horizon 2020 for the period 2014-2020. Under Horizon 2020, the European Union is set to progressively increase its clean energy research budget each year from 2015 to 2020. Ultimately, the annual budget will have grown from a little under 1 billion per year in 2015 to almost 2 billion per year in 2020, with the average annual budget for the period 2013-2015 as a baseline. Background Following COP21, the Commission signalled the EU's intention to join Mission Innovation in the Communication The Road From Paris, assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement. So far six EU Member States Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, U.K. and Norway have joined the non-binding initiative, alongside 13 other participants from around the world. The meeting in San Francisco on 1-2 June 2016 was the inaugural event of Mission Innovation. Countries joining the initiative agreed to step up coordination on research and innovation projects focusing on breakthrough technologies. Priority is given to technologies that can be flexibly adapted to varying economic and energy market conditions in the participating countries and the broader world. Projects covered by the initiative will be designed and managed in a way to attract private investors who would help bring the new technologies to the market. Mission Innovation members also commit to provide, on an annual basis, transparent and easily-accessible information on their clean energy research and development efforts to promote transparency and engage stakeholders broadly. Besides Horizon 2020, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is funding Research, Development and Innovation in different sectors including clean energy. In fact, 13 out of the 64 EFSI projects approved so far are for renewable energy. The EU also contributes to Mission Innovation with its experience from the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan), which was launched in 2007 to coordinate low-carbon R&D activities among EU Member States and other countries who wish to join in. The European Commission is preparing an integrated research, innovation and competitiveness strategy for the Energy Union. This initiative will be launched in November 2016, and will reflect on the synergies Mission Innovation enables between European and global efforts. \"

The signing ceremony took place at the Assises de la Mer maritime conference in La Rochelle in the presence of Alain Vidalies, French Secretary of State for Transport, the Sea and Fisheries, Frdric Moncany de Saint-Aignan, Chairman of Cluster Maritime Franais (French Maritime Cluster), and Gildas Maire, Chairman of Armateurs de France (French Shipowners Association). This agreement was made possible by the EU guarantee under the Investment Plan for Europe commonly known as the Juncker Plan and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). This is the first time that the new EU guarantee mechanism has been applied to making maritime transport greener in Europe. It was welcomed by Alain Vidalies, French Secretary of State for Transport, the Sea and Fisheries: During the CIMER (Inter-ministerial Committee for the Sea) meeting in October 2015, the Government decided to implement this financial tool by agreeing to a pilot project in France. What we are unveiling today is an initial illustration of this dynamic, which I hope will spread across our maritime economy, leading to similar agreements in other sectors, particularly ports. European Commissioner for Transport Violeta Bulc said: ""The new EU guarantee mechanism will increase responsible investment in the maritime sector. It will also improve the environmental performance of the ""motorways of the sea, an EU transport policy priority. The maritime sector must play its part in tackling climate change. Ten days ago, progress was made at an international level. In the near future, ships will have to emit less sulphur and efforts to cut CO2 emissions have been stepped up. This will require immediate investment, to which today's agreement will contribute. With an overall envelope of EUR 750m, the new mechanism is intended to finance new shipbuilding projects but also the conversion and modernisation of existing ships, while respecting the principles of sustainable transport and environmental protection. More specifically, it will support investment in the development of technologies to improve energy efficiency and cut harmful emissions in the European maritime transport sector. Under the framework agreement signed with Socit Gnrale, a EUR 150m guarantee will be provided by the EIB to finance and support the promoters of green projects in the maritime transport sector, with favourable financial terms for the beneficiaries as a result of the EIB's AAA rating. The signature of this agreement makes France the first country to benefit from this EU mechanism open to all shipowners. This is a new Juncker plan financing programme, and is also the first framework agreement for making the maritime sector greener in Europe, said the EIB Vice-President. Coming as COP22 is held in Marrakesh, it is a strong signal from the EIB in support of green and lasting growth. With the EU guarantee, the EIB is offering an attractive and tailored financing framework to support sustainable projects mounted by French shipowners. It is a first for Europe. Socit Gnrale CIB Global Head of Asset Finance Frdric Surdon added: With this agreement, Socit Gnrale is reaffirming its support for its French and European maritime sector customers. This cooperation agreement is also part of Socit Gnrale's climate policy, which seeks to strengthen our bank's role as a key player in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy. Frdric Moncany de Saint-Aignan, Chairman of Cluster Maritime Franais, said: Following the CIMER and in accordance with the vision presented by the President of the French Republic when he opened the Assises de lEconomie de la mer maritime conference, this tool is in line with current political will. It will also support the efforts of French shipowners to ensure sustainable maritime transport, and is a key element of the blue growth promoted by Cluster Maritime Franais for several years. Gildas Maire, Chairman of Armateurs de France, voiced his satisfaction with the signature of this agreement, saying: French shipowners welcome this financing tool, not only for new shipbuilding, but also for bringing existing vessels up to standard. We hope that it will be possible to extend it to ships operated by European companies but developed outside EU waters. It should be remembered that maritime transport and service vessels operated by European shipyards are part of a globalised sector and are designed to sail in seas across the world. This first EU-level agreement was signed thanks to the major efforts of the teams at the Ministry of the Environment, Energy and the Sea, and the EIB, in response to calls from the Inter-ministerial Committee for the Sea (CIMER) in October 2015 to implement a financial guarantee mechanism to facilitate access to credit by shipowners, as well as the teams at Socit Gnrale, which acted as pilot bank for this programme.

The NOOR PV I Programme will consist of three projects: NOOR Ouarzazate IV with a capacity of around 7O MW, NOOR Laayoune, 80 MW and NOOR Boujdour 20 MW. ACWA Power submitted the lowest tariff price for the project at 4,6MADc/kWh, i.e. 4.8$c/kWh. Together, the NOOR PV I Programme and the NOOR Ouarzazate I, II and III CSP projects demonstrate the viability of all solar technologies, and advance the Moroccan Kingdoms ambition to install two gigawatts of solar energy by 2020. The NOOR PV I Programme will be included in the recently launched ACWA Power RenewCo, a new company created to group ACWA Powers existing renewable energy portfolio, which already exceeds 1 GW. The company will be headed by Chris Ehlers, who is currently Chief Operating Officer Renewables at ACWA Power and has been appointed Chief Executive Officer. In collaboration with the Chint Group, Sterling & Wilson and Shapoorji Pallonji, ACWA Power will undertake the NOOR PV I Programme, launched by Masen (Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy), under a 20-year build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) scheme. Masen has entered into a power purchase agreement (PPAs) to off-take the output generated electricity and will also act as a shareholder together with ACWA Power in addition to sole lender. Chairman of ACWA Power, Mr. Mohammad Abunayyan said: With vigour and vision, the government of Morocco is racing toward a renewable energy target of 42%, and ACWA Power is proud to collaborate in achieving this ambitious target. It is an immense vote of reliability on ACWA Power to have been selected for yet another stretch of Moroccos sustainable energy strategy and it was realised here at this critically important COP22 event in Marrakech. In the vein of the NOORo Solar Complex in Ouarzazate, this programme will not only focus on the delivery of energy at low-cost, but it will also push to engineer a strategy of employment creation and economic development from green energy. Morocco today has almost achieved its 42% of renewable energy target for 2020 with the current power plants that are operating and under development, and they are now heading quickly towards the next target for 2030, he added. President and CEO of ACWA Power Paddy Padmanathan added: The Moroccan Kingdom has invested in a more sustainable future. Already they have not only sought to reduce carbon emissions but to also dramatically redefine the countrys energy mix in just a matter of years they are leading this decisive move from the industrial revolution to a green revolution. These are ambitious targets for any government and ACWA Power is honoured to contribute to this visionary and vital journey with the NOOR PV I Programme. As part of the finance structure for the NOOR Laayoune and NOOR Boujdour projects, Masen has issued the first sovereign-guaranteed green bond in Morocco for the financing of a sustainable energy project. German bank Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau will fund the NOOR Ouarzazate IV project. Construction on NOOR PV I will begin in Q1 2017 and is estimated to take 12 months to complete. The plants will produce enough electricity to power thousands homes every year, using photovoltaic (PV) solar panels to generate electricity. It is estimated that the project will also reduce carbon emissions by tens of thousands of tons of CO2, equivalent emissions for every year of operation. \"

At the core of the agreement is the notion to restrict global warming to 1.5 C. Lars Bondo Krogsgaard comments, ""In my point of view the agreement has two sides. One side is that states are now looking to define serious measures to protect the climate and preserve the planet for future generations. The other side is that decarbonising the energy sector means an increasingly positive business environment for wind, in particular for onshore wind as cost-efficient source of energy."" The global energy sector emits most greenhouse gases. The power sector alone accounts for roughly 1/3 of global emissions. Therefore, the 197 states of the climate convention pointed out that it will be extremely important to look at decarbonising the energy sector. The upcoming COP22 Source: Nordex \"

European cities and regions shape EUs energy and climate policies as Europe goes under a major revision of its energy landscape. Europe is indeed in a pivotal moment as it is to define the future of its energy policy in the next two years said Member of the European Parliament Claude Turmes. We need to overcome current market distortions, create financial instruments that reduce banks risk perception and resolve costs of capital issues. We want further alliances between the EU and local and regional authorities to come up with a legislative package that allows renewables to really take off. Francesco Pigliaru (IT/PES), President of Sardinia and of the ENVE Commission of the CoR said: ""We need to empower consumers in the emerging Energy Union and facilitate financial flows for cities and regions to boost sustainable energy investments. We call the EU to unlock the potential of decentralised energy production from renewable sources and better integrate large-scale transnational energy networks with regional smart grid infrastructures"". Mary Donnelly, European Commissions D irector for Renewables, Research & Innovation declared: the Energy Unions leitmotiv is twofold. On one side, consumers must be the starting point and the centre of our new energy policy, first looking at energy services demand. On the other side, regional cooperation is central as it is more cost-effective to deliver a sustainable, secured and affordable energy to citizens. As part of the energy efficiency package to be presented early autumn, the EC will launch a new initiative on smart financing for smart buildings, announced Mary Donnelly. It will be developed under three pillars: increasing liquidity flows, aggregating efforts for technical assistance and strengthening interaction with financial institutions for capital markets to better assess risk and price energy efficiency projects. Following the debate on the Energy Union, ENVE voted on the following points: Unanimous adoption of the draft opinion "" Delivering the global climate agreement a territorial approach to COP22 in Marrakesh"" by rapporteur Francesco Pigliaru (IT/PES) , President of Sardinia and of the ENVE Commission of the CoR. At stake is the implementation of the Paris climate agreement, making multi-level governance operational, setting up target assessment mechanisms and developing tailored climate finance products to move forward implementation on the ground. Jo Leinen MEP (S&D/DE), co-sponsor of the European Parliaments COP22 resolution, welcomed CoRs contribution and stressed the need to closely cooperate with local and regional authorities in the run-up to Marrakesh.

By 2030, it hopes to get 52 per cent from renewables. Just how serious the country is about solar power comes across loud and clear to visitors as soon as one crosses the Mohamed V International Airport here Large solar panels along the road and street lights topped with solar panels line the way for a few miles -- highlighting how the north African nation is moving firmly ahead in its mission to become a solar superpower. The first phase of the $9 billion project was launched in 2013, while the second and third phases were launched in 2016. When completed in 2018, the desert solar power complex will have a 582 MW capacity, enough to power 1.1 million homes -- and would measure the size of capital Rabat. Morocco's leadership in renewable energy was highlighted at last month's Crans Montana Forum where Said Moufti, Research Director of the Royal Institute for Strategic Studies, pointed out that solar and wind power plants had been set up all over the southern provinces. ""Morocco is showing by way of example,"" he said. The first phase of Noor, which was commissioned in February 2016, uses 500,000 curved mirrors spread over thousands of acres of desert to generate up to 160 MW, making it one of the world's biggest solar thermal power plants. While Phases II and III are also CSP projects, Noor IV, the final phase, uses photovoltaic (PV) technology to produce electricity. Morocco's stress on renewable energy will not only help the country reduce its energy imports, but also generate revenue from exporting energy across the Mediterranean to Europe and to its neighbours in Africa. Morocco, a country of 33 million people, is the only African country with a power cable link to Europe. The stress on renewable energy will also create jobs. Morocco currently employs about 3,000 people in the renewable energy sector. According to a study by the Euro-Mediterranean Forum of Institutes of Economic Sciences (FEMISE), the country is expected to create between 270,000 and 500,000 new green jobs by 2040. The report was released at the COP22 held in Marrakech last year. The Noor project is being developed on a build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) basis by ACWA Power Ouarzazate, a consortium of Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power, the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), Aries and TSK.

Even that record is likely to be beaten in 2016, he added, recalling that the Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degree-Celsius. Even the 2015s record of hottest year likely to be beaten in 2016. WMO Secretary-General Further in the report, WMO, the UN systems authoritative voice on the state and behaviour of the Earths atmosphere, also highlighted some of the high-impact climate events. These included the east African drought (2010-2012) that caused an estimated 258,000 deaths; the southern African drought (2013-2015); South-East Asia floods (2011) that killed 800 people and caused more than $40 billion in economic losses; heatwaves in India and Pakistan (2015) that claimed more than 4,100 lives; Hurricane Sandy (2012) which resulted $67 billion in economic losses in the United States; and Typhoon Haiyan (2013) which killed 7,800 people in the Philippines. According to the agency, the five-year timescale allows for a better understanding of multi-year warming trends and extreme events such as prolonged droughts and recurrent heatwaves than an annual report. The report further examined whether human-induced climate change was directly linked to individual extreme events. Many individual extreme weather and climate events recorded during 2011-2015 were made more likely as a result of human-induced climate change, WMO said. In the case of some extreme high temperatures, the probability increased by a factor of ten or more. The WMO report was submitted to the Twenty-second Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), known as COP 22 , meeting Marrakech. The agency added that will release its provisional assessment of the state of the climate in 2016 on 14 November to support the discussions at COP22 . 2011-2015 Weather: Hot and wild Further in the news release, temperatures for the 2011-2015 period were 0.57 degree-Celsius (1.03 degree-Fahrenheit) above the average for the standard 1961-1990 reference period. The warmest year on record to date was 2015, with temperatures 0.76 degree-Celsius (1.37 degree-Fahrenheit) above the reference period. Additionally global ocean temperatures also rose at unprecedented levels and sea-surface temperatures for the period were above average in most of the world, except in some parts of the Antarctic Ocean and the eastern South Pacific Ocean. The period also saw a decline in the Arctic sea ice coverage. Averaged over 2011-2015, the mean Arctic sea-ice fell 28 per-cent below the 1981-2010 average. The minimum summer sea-ice extent of 3.39 million square-kilometres in 2012 was the lowest on record. By contrast, for much of the period 2011 2015, the Antarctic sea-ice extent was above the 1981-2010 mean value, particularly for the winter maximum. Surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet also continued at above-average levels and mountain glaciers also continued their decline. Northern hemisphere snow cover extent was well below average in all five years and in all months from May to August, continuing a strong downward trend, said WMO. Rising sea levels Referring to studies, WMO said that the contribution of continental ice sheets, particularly in Greenland and west Antarctica, to sea-level rise is accelerating. It noted on satellite record (from 1993 to present), sea levels have risen approximately 3 mm per year, based on tide gauges, compared to the average 1900-2010 trend of 1.7 mm per year. As the oceans warm, they expand, resulting in both global and regional sea-level rise, the agency explained, adding that increased ocean heat content accounts for about 40 per cent of the observed global sea-level increase over the past 60 years. Extreme Weather The news release also mentions some examples of extreme weather which include record high seasonal and annual temperatures in the United States in 2012 and in Australia in 2013, hot summers in eastern Asia and western Europe in 2013, heatwaves in spring and autumn 2014 in Australia, record annual warmth in Europe in 2014, and a heatwave in Argentina in December 2013. Pointing to a study of a 2014 drought in south-eastern Brazil that found that similar rainfall deficits had occurred on three other occasions since 1940, the agency said that the impacts in 2014 were, however, exacerbated by a substantial increase in the demand for water, due to population growth. Such impacts show an increased link to human vulnerability, noted WMO. Photo: WMO/Kate Chumak Source: HYPERLINK http://www.justearthnews.com www.justearthnews.com \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India309","'Not using fly-ash fully will be disastrous for environment'","November 21, 2016 Monday","The Times of India (TOI)","State-run power generation company Mahagenco has been regularly flayed for not fully utilizing its fly-ash in a scientific manner. Whatever fly-ash it uses is not transported properly and the ash spreads into the atmosphere causing air pollution. Now Mahagenco has decided to fully use the ash generated by its power stations at the plants itself. This will minimize damage to environment.Environmentalist Sudhir Paliwal had been pursuing the state energy ministry for full and scientific utilization of fly-ash. Energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has appointed him as a director in Mahagams, a Mahagenco fly-ash utilization subsidiary, so that the state can benefit from his expertise. TOI spoke to Paliwal to know about the company's plans. Excerpts from the interview...Q. What was the need for forming a separate company?A. Full and scientific utilization of fly-ash needs an innovative approach and interface with industry. Mahagenco officials don't have time to spare. So the government decided to form a separate company. Earlier, such a subsidiary was formed for mining coal. Mahagams also plans to do plantation on ash bunds.Q. Why is full utilization of fly-ash necessary?A. India currently generates 184 million tons (mT) fly-ash per year. Only 55.69% of it or 102.5 mT is used. By 2031 the country will generate 900 mT ash. If the utilization ratio remains the same then we will have 500 mT unutilized fly-ash per year, which is catastrophic. In Maharashtra the utilization of fly-ash is even worse. We use only 45% and remaining 55% is stored in ash ponds after mixing it with water. India has signed the several environmental pacts including United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) is a term used under UNFCCC for reductions in greenhouse emissions that all countries that signed the UNFCCC were asked to publish in the lead up to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, France in December 2015. One of the clauses in INDCs was to increase the use of fly-ash to improve air quality. So the country is bound by international conventions too.Moreover, we are spending Rs96 per ton store fly-ash in ash ponds. A thousand litre of water per ton is wasted. Now union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has said that power plants will have to transport ash to users within a radius of 100km free of cost. This will entail an expenditure of Rs2,000 crore per year. In a radius of 100km to 300km, Mahagenco will have to bear half the expenses for transport. This means spending another Rs1,500 crore. The company can't spare Rs3,500 crore as it will sharply increase power generation cost. Therefore, we need to use the fly-ash in the power plant premises itself. We hope to earn at least Rs500 crore from fly-ash.Q. Why innovative approach is needed for full fly-ash utilization?A. There is saturation in use of fly-ash for cement, bricks, line filling and roads. Huge amount of fly-ash is lying in Chandrapur, Koradi and Khaparkheda power stations as there are no users. We have decided to set up clusters of industries using fly-ash within the power plant premises. We will provide incentives to industries to set shop there. There is scope for exporting fly-ash and its products. We will help industries in obtaining the required technologies. Fortunately, ten organizations including industries have come forward to use fly-ash and help us in research work.Q. Many experts say that fly-ash is radioactive. Doesn't this pose a health hazard?A. We are aware of this fact. Technologies are available to keep the emission within permissible limits. For example, the new fly-ash panels are coated with cement to reduce emissions. In future better technologies will emerge.Q. Mahagams will take care of fly-ash generated by Mahagenco power stations. What about private power plants?A. The state government has formed a fly-ash council with chief secretary as the chairman. Mahagenco's managing director is the member secretary. This council will ensure that all power plants, private or government, fully utilize fly-ash in a scientific manner. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India310","Smart Cities Can Get More Out Of IoT, Gartner Finds","November 9, 2016 Wednesday","Information Week India","India, Nov. 9 -- In October, when a large-scale cyberattack disrupted popular websites such as Twitter and Netflix, security problems with the internet of things (IoT) were in the spotlight. Are baby monitors and LED lights the next sources of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against critical infrastructure? But all is not doom and gloom when it comes to IoT technology. There is an upside and much promise. At the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Barcelona, the firm's analysts propose that smart cities start looking beyond what IoT is currently being used for -- mainly transportation and congestion issues -- and begin thinking about a whole new realm of possibilities for the technology, especially around environmental, climate change, and sustainability issues. With Europe as the backdrop, the Gartner analysts focused on the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP 21, which was held in Paris last year and led to a new agreement to curb greenhouse gases around the world. The agreement, coupled with other continental initiatives such as Horizon 2020 (a research development program sponsored by the European Union), will put a new burden on countries, as well as cities, to meet these goals, especially around emissions. This is where IoT comes in. ""With the Horizon 2020 goals of energy efficiency, carbon emission reductions and renewable energy in mind, many cities in Europe have launched energy sustainability, resource management, social inclusion and community prosperity initiatives,"" Bettina Tratz-Ryan, a research vice president at Gartner, told the audience, according to a Nov. 8 statement. The show runs from Nov. 6 to Nov. 10. To that point, Gartner has predicted that many smart cities will start changing their key performance indicators (KPIs) in order to meet these goals. The question is how to employ IoT, data, and analytics, as well as the IT professionals responsible for implanting these initiatives, to meet these new objectives. The focus on IoT and transportation is a good start. Many cities have started using this data to alleviate traffic and increase driver and pedestrian safety. But Gartner says it's time to take it to the next level. ""The uptake of ride sharing, the electrification of public transportation, the support infrastructure for e-vehicles and congestion charging for combustion engines, all of those examples are driving cleaner air, producing fewer GHG emissions and saving energy, while improving the noise levels and ambience on streets,"" Tratz-Ryan said during the Gartner event, according to the statement. An example is Florence, Italy, a city that is using electric vehicles as tour buses that take visitors around the city while reducing pollution. The key to all of this is discovering how to use the IoT and the data sensors collect to make better planning decisions. By next year, Gartner is predicting that smart cities will be using about 380 million connected devices, with about 58% of these being used in commercial building and with transportation. By 2020, that number could jump to 1.39 billion connected IoT sensors and devices. Gartner is not the only firm bullish on IoT. A recent report from Forrester Research urged enterprise CIOs to get behind the technology, noting that IT leaders need to ""create business insights at multiple levels of their organization, and, ultimately, start to bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds."" In her talk at the Gartner event, Tratz-Ryan also spoke about using these smart buildings, which are using IoT-connected devices to control lights and temperature, as ways to meet these new environmental KPIs, while proving to citizens that the technology is working toward a greater goal. ""The advantages for cities will be profound,"" Tratz-Ryan said. ""They will not only meet their mandated targets of the Horizon 2020 goals, but also develop greener and more inclusive city conditions that citizens can acknowledge as KPIs.""

""Saudi Arabia is quickly emerging as a regional leader in sustainability, said Yousef Al-Benyan, SABIC Vice Chairman and CEO, who is leading the companys delegation. At SABIC, we are proud that some of our most important initiatives have helped progress on this journey, including the Home of InnovationTM, which is promoting sustainable downstream development, and the worlds largest CO2 utilization plant. Examples such as these not only prove that Saudi Arabia places a great importance on sustainable development, but also that we have been working hard for many years to put practical solutions in place. This is Chemistry that MattersTM to the long-term health of our society. The SABIC delegation is attending Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Masdar City on Global Action Day, January 16, and the World Future Energy Summit from January 17 to 19. ADSW is a global platform to address the interconnected challenges that affect the widespread acceleration and adoption of sustainable development and clean energy. The Saudi delegation is building on the Gulf Cooperation Councils highly successful participation in the United Nations Conference of Parties ( COP22 ), held in Morocco in November. Saudi Arabia is a country of focus for the event because of its emerging regional sustainability leadership role as highlighted in the Saudi Vision 2030 and its advances in renewable energy. On January 17, Saudi delegates will highlight the countrys major initiatives during two panel discussions. Fahad Al-Sherehy, Leader, SABIC T&I, will represent the company during the panel entitled Transforming the Energy Sector in Saudi Arabia to Enable Vision 2030. Sustainable SABIC initiatives showcased at the event include the Home of InnovationTM, a project to foster downstream development through collaboration and innovation. The facility includes a demonstration house, designed to achieve net-zero energy in the demanding climatic conditions of Saudi Arabia. SABIC achieved this efficiency by integrating innovative solutions in collaboration with industry-leading partners. The home has over 200 advanced systems, materials, and products, including many that reduce energy and water use. If all homes in Saudi Arabia were as efficient as the Demonstration House it would reduce CO2 emissions by the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants. SABIC has also built the worlds largest CO2 capture and utilization plant at its manufacturing affiliate United in Jubail. The plant is designed to capture up to 500,000 tons of CO2 from the production of ethylene glycol annually, before purifying and distributing it to a network of affiliates to produce valuable products such as fertilizers. The project reduces emissions while increasing efficiency and lowering costs. Featuring prominently at the conference are SABICs qualified sustainability solutions, which create less CO2 emissions than traditional materials during production or save more in other lifecycle phases. They include a wide range of solutions for use in transportation, construction, medical devices, electrical and electronics, clean energy, packaging, and agri-nutrients. These solutions pass suitability benefits to customers by enabling the creation of productions that are lighter, stronger, thinner, more durable, better insulated, or more easily manufactured. Last year, SABICs manufacturing operations utilized 3.3 million tons of CO2. The company is on target to meet ambitious targets to reduce green-house gas, energy, and water intensities by 25 percent, and material loss intensity by 50 percent by 2025from levels in 2010. Al-Benyan said: Sustainability is helping SABIC to emerge as a global leader in the petrochemicals industry. Embedding sustainable practices in our global operations has resulted in many benefits such as energy savings, improved resource efficiency, technological innovation and cost savings. \"

ACCIONA is confident that the pace of ratifications and voluntary contributions by countries (NDCs - National Defined Contributions) will increase, to achieve a significant level of global commitment. In view of the most recent data on temperatures and atmospheric CO? concentrations (which averaged over 400ppm in 2015), ACCIONA is confident that the Parties will step up their commitment so that there is a real chance of keeping global warming below 2&#186C with respect to pre-industrial levels. The Parties' NDCs are still far from achieving that goal (they will result in warming by 2.7&#186C, according to the International Energy Agency). The Company also considers it vital that the Marrakech summit make progress in specifying mechanisms to incentivise and enhance the attainment of the NDCs, specifically: Promote carbon pricing worldwide so as to incentivise the global transition towards a decarbonised economy.

"COP22","India","COP22_India325","United Arab Emirates : How corporates are taking the lead in renewable energy","November 17, 2016 Thursday","TendersInfo","Over the last few years there has been a significant increase in the voluntary demand for renewable energy sourced by large corporations to supply their own operations and supply chains. As of today, 40% of the Fortune 500 companies have set clean energy targets, over 50 businesses representing a market cap of USD 15 trillion have signed on to the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers Principle and over 83 leading corporations have become part of RE100, a global, collaborative initiative of businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity. The subject of the corporate sourcing of renewables as well as its growing interest took centre stage at COP22 on Sunday, November 13 in Marrakech, Morocco. Throughout the course of a dedicated session organised by IRENA in collaboration with the Clean Energy Ministerial, RE100 and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the potential for corporate sourcing of renewables was further highlighted. With an increasing number of companies committing to ambitious sustainable energy goals to reduce their carbon footprint, corporate electricity strategies can play an important role in accelerating renewable energy deployment and progress towards global climate objectives. Companies, both large and small, and from diverse business sectors, showcased that they are not only increasingly buying renewable energy, but are looking for ways to share knowledge, experience and best practices so that other companies can learn and ultimately collectively drive renewable energy costs down even further. The event also served as the kick-off of IRENAs new initiative to assess corporate renewable energy purchases and provide more clarity to consumers to inform choices. The REmade Index will improve knowledge and practices for businesses that want to make renewable energy procurement and purchasing a central part of their operations strategy. In the public eye there are many pronouncements but there are no measurements. That accountability will bring great impetus to this initiative, said IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin, who moderated the panel. For companies that dont have the decades of experience we are developing best practices, case studies and white papers in addition to using our collective voice to open up market access since in many instances buyers have no choice about what kind of power they can purchase, said Bill Weihl, Director of Sustainabilty at Facebook. Importantly, the trend of renewable power purchases is not only happening in the technology sector and in just one market. Major manufacturers around the world are also moving into sourcing significant shares of their power from renewable sources. This isnt just tech companies it is happening in many sectors and globally, added Weihl. Name a sector you will find a company or a number of companies committing to either 100% renewables or to a path of getting there. COP22 . At present, about 7% of the electricity sourced by Dalmia Cement is based on renewable energy but the company is committing to a long term transition to 100% renewable power. Small and medium size companies are also looking to get into the game and make renewable power purchases. This is not just a club for the largest companies, we need to enable SMEs and companies of all scales to source renewable energy, said Simon Currie, Global Head of Energy, Norton Rose Fulbright. Creating templates, such as for power purchase agreements PPAs , will help reduce transaction costs. IRENA and the Coalition for Action are developing the REmade Index to support the Corporate Sourcing of Renewables campaign of the Clean Energy Ministerial. The index will catalogue the companies worldwide that purchase renewables to power their operations. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India328","Climate change impact: Morocco counts on renewable energy to reduce CO2 emission","November 24, 2016 Thursday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 24 -- In Morocco, 40 per cent of the population is involved in agriculture. The country went without rain for over two months due to the El Nino phenomenon and received 42.7 per cent less rain during its main planting season. The impact of climate change on Morocco's agricultural production was catastrophic, with total output falling 70 per cent in the 2015 season. It is this experience and the futility of it that made Morocco put the impacts of erratic weather patterns on agriculture at the heart of the discussions during the COP22 in Marrakech. While Morocco was instrumental in formally launching ""Adaptation of African Agriculture"" (AAA) initiative at the COP22 conference, the host nation of the summit has also been directing its efforts towards fighting climate change by acting upon several sectors. In 2015, this North African country banned the use of plastic bags, initiated the process of replacing dirty old fleet of buses and taxis, announced plans for extending the urban tram networks in Casablanca and Rabat and also launched first city bicycle hire scheme in Africa. Commitment towards renewable energy Morocco has also taken an ambitious leap to transform the country's energy mix. In 2015, King Mohammed VI announced the government's plan to increase the share of renewable electricity generation to 52 per cent by 2030. In 2015, the country removed subsidies on petroleum products. According to the INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution) plan submitted by Morocco to the UNFCCC, the country plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially in agriculture, by 32 per cent by 2030. Morocco has also pledged to plant 200,000 hectares of forest. These measures will lead to a cumulative reduction of 401 megatonnes of C02 over the period 2020-30. However, Morocco's commitment is largely dependent on accessing climate financing. Focus on solar power The first phase of the Noor solar project (160MW) near Ouarzazate was opened in February 2016. Instead of conventional PV (photovoltaic) solar panels, Noor uses CSP (concentrated solar power) technology wherein giant mirrors reflect the sun's rays on to tubes containing liquid. This liquid is super-heated to drive turbines. In fact, CSP offers storage of electricity for up to three hours after the sundown, hence covering peak demand times. Phase II, which is currently under construction, uses the same CSP technology on a bigger scale. Phase III is expected to use a new variant of the CSP technology. These two projects, likely to be completed by 2017-18, will add another 350MW to the national grid. The fourth phase is also on the anvil. Investment in wind energy Morocco is also heavily investing in wind. A consortium of Enel Green Power, Nareva and Siemens will build five new wind farms at different sites across Morocco-Midelt, Tangier, Jbel Lahdid, Tiskrid and Boujdour in the disputed Western Sahara territory. These wind farms will have a combined capacity of 850MW. This huge surge in power generation will take Morocco closer to its aim of producing 14 per cent of electricity from wind by 2020. Per unit cost (US$0.03 per kWh), as mentioned in the tenders, was one of the lowest in the world. The cost factor Although the launch of the Noor CSP project has reduced the price of electricity to around $0.16 per kWh, but still it is expensive compared to solar PV, which has reduced to as low as $0.03 per kWh. To remain commercially competitive across the world, the costs of CSP have to fall low enough. Moreover, the CSP technology uses large amount of water to keep the mirrors clean. But in water-stressed Morocco, availability of enough water is a challenge. Fossil fuel still dominates the energy scenario in Morocco with coal contributing the largest part of energy production (35 per cent). It is set to expand over the next five years. Meanwhile, the search for hydrocarbon deposits in Morocco continues. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

With established and fast transportation links within Morocco and across the region, the site is ideally located to provide a rapid response and lead times to customers in the region. Eatons Morocco Plant Operations (MPO) is the newest addition to the companys Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) manufacturing footprint and has consolidated the companys manufacturing and support assets in Morocco, including Berrechid Technologies (Btec) factory in Casablanca and the Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) training facility for West Africa. The MPO builds on Eatons presence in Morocco, which started commercially over 40 years ago, with manufacturing beginning in the country 17 years ago. The company employs approximately 300 people in Morocco with the intention to expand to close to 550. The MPO extends Eatons capability in the region by creating an electronics center of excellence, adding new competencies, such as printed circuit board assemblies (PCBA) and power electronics modules for rail and aerospace, a new electronic Power Distribution Unit product line (ePDU), used in IT applications and Data Centers, and UPS accessories. The company is actively hiring and developing professionals who will be part of the electronics center of excellence for the region. To support this, Eaton has established a partnership with the Moroccan Aerospace Institute (IMA) in Casablanca, enhancing their electronics training capability and developing a program whereby future employees spend a period of seven weeks at IMA before starting their new roles. ""We invested in Morocco because of its skilled workforce, the stability of its economy and the proximity to our key European and African customers. There is also a strong correlation between our objective of increasing local procurement and the National Pact for Industrial Emergence of the Moroccan Government, which helps foster a growing ecosystem of local suppliers and partners that will be essential to ensure the long term viability of our manufacturing operations in the country,"" Eatons Revathi Advaithi said. ""The establishment of our operations in Midparc would not have been successful without the extensive support of many institutions. We are grateful to the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment and the Digital Economy, the local administrations and authorities, the developers and architects, as well as the talent development partners, who have all made this possible,"" added Advaithi. As for the Minister, Moulay Hafid Elalamy welcomed the start of operations at the new site of the world's leader in electrical and hydraulic components and systems, emphasizing that ""Morocco is proud to host a production site of a company that is in the top 20 of the energy storage system manufacturers in the world."" ""Its startup will help develop local value chains and strengthen the dynamics of ecosystems by building a robust supplier base; the project is fully aligned with the guiding principles of our industrial strategy,"" he added. In addition, it has been identified that the Eaton facility in Casablanca will serve as the pilot manufacturing site for energy storage battery packs and systems, supplying thousands of households and businesses across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The development of energy storage manufacturing in Morocco seeks to make a number of the goals and ambitions identified in the Paris Agreement a reality, by supporting the implementation of green and low carbon technology. This intention has been recognized internationally as this energy storage project has been officially validated as a COP22 labelled project, a designation awarded by the COP22 steering committee to projects that demonstrate action that could help mitigate climate change. With production intended to start 2017, this project will have a positive impact locally, regionally and internationally. \"

Responding to an invitation to this end by the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, heads of state from close to 90 countries and delegations from other UN member countries issued this proclamation, a key document emerging from the negotiations at COP22 , to signal a shift towards a new era of implementation and action on climate and sustainable development. ""Our climate is warming at an alarming and unprecedented rate and we have an urgent duty to respond. We welcome the Paris Agreement, adopted under the Convention, its rapid entry into force, with its ambitious goals, its inclusive nature and its reflection of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, and we affirm our commitment to its full implementation,"" the Proclamation read out by COP22 President Salaheddine Mezouar said. Irreversible Referring to the momentum on climate change worldwide, and in many multilateral fora, the Proclamation said that this momentum was irreversible, being driven not only by governments, but by science, business and global action of all types at all levels. The Proclamation stressed on nations having to rapidly build on the post-Paris momentum, and move forward purposefully to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster adaptation efforts, thereby benefiting and supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was adopted at the UN headquarters in New York last year. The UN climate summit here had started under the shadows of the US Presidential elections results and the ascent of Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax and threatened to pull out of the treaty, had been the source of much uncertainty and anxiety at the summit. The Proclamation, therefore, called for the highest political commitment to combat climate change, as a matter of urgent priority. Countries also demanded solidarity with those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, highlighting the need to support efforts aimed to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability. Climate finance stressed The countries also called for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries. ""We the Developed Country Parties reaffirm our USD $100 billion mobilisation goal. We, unanimously, call for further climate action and support, well in advance of 2020, taking into account the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, the least developed countries and those particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change,"" the Proclamation read. The nations, who are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (which does not include the U.S.) also encouraged the speedy ratification of the Doha Amendment with its focus on pre-2020 action. Closing the gap Given the gaps in emissions reduction to stay on course for keeping global warming levels under 2C, nations also called for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst countries to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. To this end, the ""2050 pathways platform"", a multi-stakeholder initiative, was adopted by the High-Level Climate Champions here, aimed at supporting those seeking to devise long-term, net zero-greenhouse gas, climate-resilient and sustainable development pathways. High-Level Climate Champions Laurence Tubiana of France and Hakima El Haite of Morroco spoke at the Marrakech summit on Thursday evening inviting nations to set on a path of decarbonisation. The 2050 pathways platform will support countries seeking to develop long-term deep decarbonisation strategies, including through the sharing of resources, knowledge and experiences, an official statement said. It will also build a broader constellation of cities, states, and companies engaged in long-term low-emissions planning of their own, and in support of the national strategies, the statement added. Already, 22 countries have started or are about to start the process of preparing a 2050 pathway. Many others are expected to join. \"

They also agreed on a clear road map to meet that deadline. The Paris Agreement, meant to take various climate actions by all countries post-2020 to save the world from disastrous consequences of global warming, had entered into force on November 4. The pre-2020 action is being covered by the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 where only developed nations are supposed to take actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The rules to implement the Paris climate deal will be framed in such a way that it can take care of transparency of action of all countries as per their respective pledges under the agreement which was adopted by195 countries in December last year. The rules will specify the ways and means for measuring and accounting of emission reductions in all countries. It will also have a mechanism to mobilize climate finance to help the developing countries in taking adaptation measures.The Conference ( COP22 ) was sched uled to conclude on Friday but negotiations on the tricky issue of finance forced it to continue till early Saturday morning. Many developing countries including India expressed their concerns over the draft text. Though the text was adopted after assurances of further discussion on it in the run up to the next conference in Bonn in 2017, it left many questions unanswered specifically on the absence of a clear road map to mobilise $100 billion by 2020 as promised by rich nations. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India339","World will witness 2.9 to 3.4degC temperature rise even if Paris deal fully implemented","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 16 -- The United Nations Emission Gap Report 2016 was discussed on November 14, 2016 at a side event in CoP 22 in Marrakech. This report was released recently by United Nations Environment (UNEP) and this it assesses the latest scientific studies on the emission gap and how it can be bridged with particular attention to energy efficiency and links to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UNEP has been producing annual Emissions Gap Reports since 2010 for an independent scientific assessment of how actions and pledges by countries affect the global greenhouse gas emissions trend, and how this compares to emissions trajectories consistent with the long-term goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The assessment is based on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by almost all countries in the world and a large number of studies supporting robustness of the estimates. GHG emissions This assessment reveals that total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to show a steady increase, reaching approximately 52.7 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2014. Notably, the rate of global GHG emissions increase during the period 2000 to 2010 was faster (2.2 per cent per year) than during the period 1970 to 2000 (1.3 per cent per year), increasing in 2010 and 2011 (3.5 per cent per year) and then slowing in 2012 to 2013 (1.8 per cent per year). This report finds that 2030 emissions are expected to reach 54 to 56 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent - far above the level of 42 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is needed to have a chance of limiting global warming to 2oC this century. The predicted 2030 emissions will, even if the Paris Agreement pledges are fully implemented by all countries, place the world on track for a temperature rise of 2.9 to 3.4oC this century. Waiting to increase ambition would likely lose the chance to meet the 1.5oC target. Therefore, immediate and urgent action is required pre-2020. The temperature increase of 2.9 to 3.4oC can prove devastating for the world as it will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like more-intense storms, longer droughts, floods, ice melting, sea-level rise and other severe climate impacts. Need for ambitious goals Several countries will need to accelerate action to meet their Cancun Pledge by 2020. Collectively, these pledges are not ambitious enough to have a better starting point in 2020 to meet the 2030 levels of global greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the longer-term goals of below 2 or 1.5degC. Urgency of enhancing pre-2020 mitigation action is indisputable. The Kigali Amendment to the UN Environment-hosted Montreal Protocol, agreed in October, aims at slashing the use of hydrofluorocarbons. Early studies indicate this could cut another 0.5 degrees if fully implemented. However, emissions won't begin to be reduced at any significant rate until 2025. ""We are moving in the right direction: the Paris Agreement will slow climate change, as will the recent Kigali Amendment to reduce HFCs,"" said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. ""They both show strong commitment, but it's still not good enough if we are to stand a chance of avoiding serious climate change. ""If we don't start taking additional action now, beginning with CoP22 , we will grieve over the avoidable human tragedy. The growing numbers of climate refugees hit by hunger, poverty, illness and conflict will be a constant reminder of our failure to deliver. The science shows that we need to move much faster,"" added Solheim. This report notes that the strengthened long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement require even stronger actions than previously identified, calling for accelerated efforts pre-2020, as well as increasing the ambition of the Nationally Determined Contributions. It further notes that the need for urgent action has been reinforced by the fact that 2015 was the hottest year since modern temperature record keeping began. Although high temperatures were exacerbated by the effect of El Nino, it is notable that ten of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2000, and the trend continues, with the first six months of 2016 all being the warmest ever recorded. 2016 is almost certain to be the hottest year ever globally. Opportunities This report presents an assessment of the technologies and opportunities to find the further cuts required, including through non-state actors, energy efficiency acceleration and crossover with the sustainable development goals. It notes that non-state actors (the private sector, cities, regions and other subnational actors like citizen groups) can cut several gigatonnes off the gap by 2030 in sectors like agriculture and transport, provided the many initiatives meet their goals and do not replace other action. Energy efficiency is another area where investment could bring bigger gains. This report finally indicates that the world is still heading for temperature rise of 2.9 to 3.4oC this century, even with Paris pledges. The 2030 emissions will be 12 to 14 gigatonnes above levels needed to limit global warming to 2oC. Opportunities include enhanced pre-2020 action building on Cancun pledges, cost-effective energy efficiency and stimulating action by cities, companies and civil society. World must urgently act to cut a further 25 per cent from predicted 2030 emissions. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Down to Earth.

Speaking on the occasion Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General, TERI said, ""The Paris Agreement was a testament to collaboration and perseverance - of nations who debated and negotiated to ultimately reach a consensus. The Marrakech COP, on the other hand, was notable for the actions that took place outside of the negotiations, with politicians, countries and organisations using it to announce new initiatives, strategy and finance. Action from negotiation tables now has moved to factories and policy making rooms of governments, which is a big shift from Paris. There was very clear focus on the need to define climate action, finance, mitigation and adaptation. The parties also adopted work plans for carrying the discussions forward."" TERI also noted that the Marrakech COP was also one of partnerships. 22 countries joined the Indialed International Solar Alliance (as against the requirement of 15 for the Alliance to come into force) that calls for cooperation to boost solar energy infrastructure and receive clean energy financing.

This follows a period of downward revisions to the economic growth forecasts and volatility in financial and commodities markets globally, impacted by the slowdown from China and oil prices slump over a two year period. The Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) discussions in Marrakech were clouded by Trump's threat to pull the US out of the COP21 Paris climate change accord. While it may be difficult for the US to unilaterally scuttle the accord, since most of the world countries have affirmed their commitment to de-carbonisation, the challenge lies in actually meeting the US$100 billion/y financial commitments and also agreement on the transparency of future climate monitoring. However economics will drive the substantial investments in clean and green technologies, led by China and India. ""We expect 2017 to be a transition year for long term changes, globally. With the rising protectionism across the world, issue of energy security will once again come to the fore in Asia Pacific. This will accelerate adoption of clean technologies which can be harnessed locally and those that are less impacted by global policy & price fluctuations,"" noted Ravi Krishnaswamy, Vice President, Energy & Environment, Asia Pacific, Frost & Sullivan. Global oil industry will begin a slow recovery With oil prices expected to average about US$55/bbl in 2017, the focus will be on operational excellence as industry players try to survive the tight upstream market. However, interest in downstream sector will continue to be strong with a slew of refinery and petrochemical investments planned across developing Asia including China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. Rise of LNG for power generation, even as coal will see decline in capacity addition during 2017 The global glut in LNG supply, aided by the possible large scale exports from the USA, has provided a huge opportunity for South and Southeast Asia increase its base load capacity using gas. Furthermore, the push towards delinking natural gas price from crude oil price could help development of Asian gas market, in the long run. There are signs of this already impacting the coal power plant industry, with 25% less coal capacity likely to be added in 2017 across China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia than in 2016. Edge analytics and cloud adoption to drive the demand for critical power infrastructure Critical power and cooling infrastructure for data centres will witness 8.2% growth in 2017. Security concerns, both cyber and physical, will further increase spending in advanced infrastructure management. Increasing connectivity and growing adoption of mobile applications in banking, travel and social media will drive the demand for cloud and edge analytics, thus propelling the overall data centre critical infrastructure market. Digital transformation of homes and buildings market Reducing non-revenue water will remain key focus for the water industry The issue of resources and revenue leakage continues to plague the water sector across most of Asia. This will remain a major investment opportunity, with adoption of digital technologies like sensors and smart meters, helping to solve the problem to some extent. Indonesia's ambitious plans to restructure its water sector and attract US$25 billion in potential investments would very much depend on the actual ground level implementation. Lack of financial prudence, political interference and policy flaws could potentially derail the plan, if these issues are not addressed. \"

This occurred in the lead up to COP22 that will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in which Alstom participates. With global urban transport emissions expected to double to nearly 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2025, favouring transport modes with the lowest carbon footprints is crucial. Rail can be a key contributor in the fight to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) and reach the target set at COP21 in 2015 to keep global warming below 2degC. The tram, for example, has been identified as one of the greenest urban transport modes[1] due to its low environmental impact when in operation. The study conducted by Alstom and Carbone 4 compares the carbon footprint of tramways and BRT systems, enabling a better understanding of their comparative performance over the entire lifecycle including construction, operation and maintenance of the two systems. An analysis conducted on a typical 10 km line operated in Belgium demonstrated that for equivalent transport capacity, over a 30-year lifetime, a tramway system emits about half as much CO2 as a BRT system operated with diesel buses, and about 30% less CO2 than a BRT system operated with hybrid buses.

(TSE: 6501; ""Hitachi"") today announced its set of long-term environmental targets with a view towards 2050, called ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"". In ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"", under its ""Environmental Vision"" which sets forth a vision for the company through environmental management, Hitachi has set targets such as achieving 80% reductions in CO2 emissions across the company's value chain by fiscal 2050 compared with fiscal 2010, achieving a 50% improvement in the efficiency of the use of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared with fiscal 2010, and minimizing the impact on natural capital; for building a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature. Moving ahead, Hitachi will drive forward with initiatives towards the future achievement of these targets. In recent years, the will for society to work towards the reduction of environmental burdens, and towards the resolution of global environmental issues in the long term, has been demonstrated by agreements such as the Paris Agreement adopted at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP21, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by a United Nations. Additionally, because the Social Innovation Business that Hitachi is developing globally are long-term business operations relating to the construction of social infrastructure, a long-term environmental perspective is also essential in accelerating the development of these business operations. In light of these developments, and from a long-term perspective, Hitachi believes that it is necessary to take steps to combat environmental issues such as climate change, depletion of resources and destruction of ecosystems; and has therefore established the ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" as a set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2050. The outline of ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" is as follows. Long-Term Environmental Targets: ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" is a set of targets for 2050 established under the ""Environmental Vision"" that ""Hitachi will resolve environmental issues and achieve both a higher quality of life and a sustainable society through its Social Innovation Business in collaborative creation with its stakeholders"", whereby Hitachi will aim to globally build a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature. 1. Realization of a Low-Carbon Society (1) Target Achieve 50% reductions in CO2 emissions by fiscal 2030, and 80% reductions by fiscal 2050 across the value chain compared to fiscal 2010 (2) Initiatives CO2 emissions at the ""Use"" stage of the product and solutions, which Hitachi delivers to customers, account for more than 90% of CO2 emissions in the entire Hitachi value chain. To reduce emissions at this stage, Hitachi is adopting the following four action policies. Continuous efforts are also being made to reduce emissions at the ""Production"" stage. a) Move business structure to low-carbon model c) Develop and provide super-efficient, energy-saving products and low-carbon energy d) Provide energy-conserving social system solutions through cooperative harmonization between systems, across a wider area, and in an integrated way 2. Realization of a Resource Efficient Society (1) Target Build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently and achieve a 50% improvement in usage efficiency of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared to fiscal 2010 in the Hitachi Group (2) Initiatives To maximize its contribution to the construction of a water and resource circulating society through its business operations, Hitachi will evolve a series of processes comprising of high-quality water production, purification, water supply and drainage and offer solutions to expand use of recycling. Further, it will create water resources through its global expansion of sea water desalination. Moreover, Hitachi will also implement the following policy measures with the aim of achieving a 50% improvement in usage efficiency of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared to fiscal 2010. a) Promote efficient use of resources and reduction of waste by manufacturing resource-saving products with long service lives, and shifting towards servicing and sharing of businesses b) Promote recycling of resources through exhaustive product collection and recycling c) Reduce volume of water use and reinforce drainage purification and reuse in production processes in accordance with regional water risks 3. Realization of a Harmonized Society with Nature Minimize the impact on natural capital (2) Initiatives Hitachi will evaluate the impact that its operations have on ecosystems at each stage of the value chain, and implement actions to minimize the environmental burden. More specifically, Hitachi will supply products and services that contribute to ecosystem conservation, including atmospheric/water purification systems and nature monitoring systems, and promote environmentally conscious procurement activities.

South Africas strategic role in the Paris Agreement started when the country hosted the 17th Conference of Parties (COP17) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2011. This resulted in the COP17 Durban Agreement, also known as the Durban Platform, which formed the bedrock for the subsequent Paris Agreement. Since then, South Africa has been at the forefront of multilateral climate change negotiations, seeking at all times to keep the spirit of the Durban Agreement alive. The Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Phillemon Mapulane remarked that South Africa cannot afford to be the last country to ratify the Paris Agreement when it played a leading role in birthing it. As legislators, we appreciate the effort our government, among other leading countries, put into realising the Paris Agreement, said Mr Mapulane. It is in this context that the Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs has decided to host a climate change colloquium themed Unpacking the COP21 Paris Agreement: implications for the nation on Friday, 28th October 2016, in preparation for the holding of the COP22 Climate Change Conference which is scheduled to be held from the 7th to 19th November 2016 in Marrakesh, Morocco. The Committee has invited all relevant stakeholders to participate in the deliberations during the colloquium. The Committee invites all members of the public wishing to participate in the colloquium to contact the Committee Secretariat and make the necessary arrangements. \"

But done right they can be value drivers instead. Not only for the public sector but also the private sector. That is the main conclusion from Lisa Grice, global director of sustainability services at Ramboll, and currently participating in the Sustainable Innovation Forum during COP22 , the UN climate change conference in Marrakesh. The new carbon economy presents private sector opportunities in consulting, engineering, developing products and technology, construction, operation and financing, Lisa Grice states.Lisa Grice says, that the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient economy, aka the new climate economy promises a wealth of opportunity for those enabling the transition. Solution providers include those bringing new products, like Teslas electric car, or new business models, such as mobility as a service (MaaS). Engineering and consulting services are called for to help customers, public and private alike, establish low carbon, climate resilient infrastructure. Supply chain management services that investigate and mitigates the risk of climate change is a much needed service. And as much as ever the ability to help clients reduce energy use stays is in demand, Lisa Grice explains. For example, Ramboll recently identified significant water and energy savings for one of the worlds largest spirits distillers through a series of audits at their plants in North America. The team identified how the five already energy efficient facilities could further reduce energy use by 10% with approximately a 2.5 year payback. Capital project opportunities ranged from boilers to biomass projects to lighting to increased use of waste heat and simultaneous generation of heating and cooling to combined heat and power opportunities. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India366","Orange and ENGIE pursue their commitment to the electrification of rural Africa","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Tendernews.com","France ,Nov. 16 -- The kits include a solar panel connected to a battery that can be used to provide domestic appliances with electricity. They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralized source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones. This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment. ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via ""Orange Money"". The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. Access to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimize the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa. During the COP22 conference, Orange and ENGIE reaffirm their commitment to leveraging their technological expertise to stimulate sustainable progress and economic and social development on the African continent. \"

The three-day-long event will discuss the opportunities for the continent post COP21, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to climate action among other issues. A World Bank analysis estimated that not addressing climate change could plunge 100 million more people into poverty by 2030. Of those 43 million would be in Africa. The report also said that poor countries and poor communities within countries are not equipped to adapt to climate change. In December 2015 in Paris, countries adopted a new comprehensive climate change agreement, central to which is nationally determined action and international cooperation. This action will be driven by private and public investment. ""Just as the risks of climate change are immense, so too are the rewards of climate action if we invest in our people and our planet,"" said Vincent Biruta, Rwanda's Minister of Natural Resources. Africa Carbon Forum is an annual gathering aimed at spurring climate investment, through sharing information on policy, such as use of markets and mechanisms, financial opportunities, and cooperative initiatives arising from the international response to climate change. ""Africa is going to play a critical role in the spread of markets under the Paris Agreement.

Her master's research concerns the loss and damage impacts related to climate change, as an issue, which can include the loss of livelihood, territory and property. Jiva's research focuses on the Pacific's role in getting loss and damage issues on the negotiating table, and successfully into the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) outcomes and documents. ""I went to the meetings and the negotiations about loss and damage,"" she says. ""My main role was to take notes and do briefings for our main negotiator so that's what really consolidated my research question."" A goal for Jiva is to attend COP22 in November this year, which will be held in Marrakech, Morocco. She told Asia Pacific Report that this year the conference would be reviewing the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, a policy that aims to address climate-related loss and damage in developing countries vulnerable to extreme effects of climate change. In 2013, in Warsaw, the Pacific fought strongly for this mechanism, she says. The young activist is also a member of Pacific Islands Climate Action Network (PICAN), an organisation that brings together Pacific NGOs and civil society actors who advocate for climate change.

Last year's Paris Agreement showed the world was united in its concern about climate change and its commitment to decarbonising the global economy, he said. ""The rest of the world will not risk a global climate catastrophe because of one man's opposition,"" he said. ""On a practical point, now that the Paris Agreement has come into force no country can easily withdraw for at least three years. Even if the US wanted to do so at that point it would suffer considerably, both a political and diplomatic cost as well as putting itself at the back of the pack on the benefits of clean tech,"" he said. ""Although the US will certainly suffer from any obstruction of efforts to stop climate change, it also risks the lives of millions of the world's poorest people who have done nothing to cause the problem yet are the most vulnerable to its effects,"" Adow added. Trump -- a climate-change sceptic -- during his campaigning has threatened to cancel the Paris deal if he comes to power.

Figueres was among a number of speakers who spoke at the stocktake event held on May 21, halfway through the Bonn Climate Talks. Speaking in context of the amount of work that lay ahead before various climate organisations, Figures said that ""Parties are challenged by their own success."" She urged the necessity of coherence not only among the three subsidiary bodies of the UNFCCC-including the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA)-but also to work in coordination with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), NASDAQ platform, Sendai framework and Addis Ababa for total and comprehensive climate actions. The stocktaking event was one of two held on May 21 to assess progress and seek parties views on the way forward. It was convened by the current President of CoP21, French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Segolene Royal, and Hakima El Haite, on behalf of the incoming Presidency of CoP22 /CMP12 to be held at Marrakesh, Morocco. Other speakers included the chairs of the SBI and SBSTA and Laurence Tubjana from the CoP presidency. Royal expressed happiness at observing that a positive mood continued in the three subsidiary bodies. She also appreciated the Parties' efforts at reaching consensus on issues and their full support and cooperation. She said that it was essential to assess whether progress had been made. El Haite, while speaking on behalf of the Moroccan Presidency, said that Marrakesh had huge expectations from CoP 22 . ""We want it to be an action CoP,"" she said. The three subsidiary bodies, the SBI and SBSTA and the APA made their statements on the progress achieved. While SBSTA was pleased to report that it continued to provide scientific and technological advice to Parties, it reported that it had held a workshop on matters related to agriculture and a special event on how advising the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) can inform global stocktake. It also mentioned that it was working in coordination with SBI on joint matters of response measures and review. On the joint matter of global stocktake, it was closely working with APA Co-Chairs. SBI Chairman Thomas reported that his organisation was committed to empowering observers, creating a platform for transparency and also include social partners and gender inclusiveness in its mandate. It also mentioned that pre-2020 actions to address climate change were critical and effective tools were required so that such actions were taken forward. He remarked that ""this session is rich in additional mandated events and to encourage discussions on cross cutting issues."" The mitigation and adaptation technical meeting that SBI organized also recognised that pre-2020 actions were important. On sustainable climate solutions, he remarked that ""climate empowerment is an implementation-oriented exercise and would not be possible to sustain if gender actions are not taken into account."" The APA was ""happy to report"" that it had adopted a revised agenda and the addition of ""adaptation registry and adaptation communication"" in it was done in communication with the SBI Chair after intense deliberations with the Parties. APA co-chair Sara Bashaan also pointed out that APA was committed to ""balance, transparency and inclusiveness."" The Adaptation Committee and Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) reported their progress of holding meetings and technical examination process. Both groups, it was reported, were working in coordination. The Special Committee on Finance (SCF) reiterated that it would serve the Paris agreement under the mandate given to it. It would continue to provide coherency in delivery of finance, mobilise funds and provide Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of support provided to the developing countries. The review of the work of SCF would be made in Marrakesh. The Executive Committee (Ex-Com) of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and damage (WIM) reported on the progress made on its mandate to "" establish a clearinghouse for risk transfer that serves as a repository for information on insurance and risk transfer, in order to facilitate the efforts of Parties to develop and implement comprehensive risk management strategies"" and ""establish a task force to complement, draw upon the work of and involve, as appropriate, existing bodies and expert groups under the Convention including the Adaptation Committee and the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, as well as relevant organisations and expert bodies outside the Convention, to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimise and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change"". For both these mandates, work was underway. The draft committee for clear-house was established and the task force for the second mandate had developed its terms of reference (ToR). The representative of the GCF declared to move from ""resource mobilisation to implementation"". He highlighted that currently, projects worth US$ 168 million were happening. He urged countries ""not to wait and not to hold back on their commitments as the GCF is waiting for funds from Parties."" The IPCC representative reported to the CoP president that it had already started work on its special report to be brought out in September 2018 and also to align the report ""with the process of global stocktake.""

"COP22","India","COP22_India374","Hitachi Group Sets Long-Term Environmental Targets ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050""","September 6, 2016 Tuesday","Pivotal Sources","Japan, Sept. 6 -- Hitachi, Ltd. announced its set of long-term environmental targets with a view towards 2050, called ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"". In ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"", under its ""Environmental Vision"" which sets forth a vision for the company through environmental management, Hitachi has set targets such as achieving 80% reductions in CO2 emissions across the company's value chain by fiscal 2050 compared with fiscal 2010, achieving a 50% improvement in the efficiency of the use of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared with fiscal 2010, and minimizing the impact on natural capital; for building a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature. Moving ahead, Hitachi will drive forward with initiatives towards the future achievement of these targets. In recent years, the will for society to work towards the reduction of environmental burdens, and towards the resolution of global environmental issues in the long term, has been demonstrated by agreements such as the Paris Agreement adopted at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP21, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by a United Nations. Additionally, because the Social Innovation Business that Hitachi is developing globally are long-term business operations relating to the construction of social infrastructure, a long-term environmental perspective is also essential in accelerating the development of these business operations. In light of these developments, and from a long-term perspective, Hitachi believes that it is necessary to take steps to combat environmental issues such as climate change, depletion of resources and destruction of ecosystems; and has therefore established the ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" as a set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2050. The outline of ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" is as follows. Long-Term Environmental Targets: ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" ""Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050"" is a set of targets for 2050 established under the ""Environmental Vision"" that ""Hitachi will resolve environmental issues and achieve both a higher quality of life and a sustainable society through its Social Innovation Business in collaborative creation with its stakeholders"", whereby Hitachi will aim to globally build a low-carbon society, a resource efficient society, and a harmonized society with nature. 1. Realization of a Low-Carbon Society (1) Target Achieve 50% reductions in CO2 emissions by fiscal 2030, and 80% reductions by fiscal 2050 across the value chain compared to fiscal 2010 (2) Initiatives CO2 emissions at the ""Use"" stage of the product and solutions, which Hitachi delivers to customers, account for more than 90% of CO2 emissions in the entire Hitachi value chain. To reduce emissions at this stage, Hitachi is adopting the following four action policies. Continuous efforts are also being made to reduce emissions at the ""Production"" stage. a) Move business structure to low-carbon model b) Develop innovative devices and materials that contribute to reduction of environmental burden c) Develop and provide super-efficient, energy-saving products and low-carbon energy d) Provide energy-conserving social system solutions through cooperative harmonization between systems, across a wider area, and in an integrated way 2. Realization of a Resource Efficient Society Build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently and achieve a 50% improvement in usage efficiency of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared to fiscal 2010 in the Hitachi Group (2) Initiatives To maximize its contribution to the construction of a water and resource circulating society through its business operations, Hitachi will evolve a series of processes comprising of high-quality water production, purification, water supply and drainage and offer solutions to expand use of recycling. Further, it will create water resources through its global expansion of sea water desalination. Moreover, Hitachi will also implement the following policy measures with the aim of achieving a 50% improvement in usage efficiency of water and other resources by fiscal 2050 compared to fiscal 2010. a) Promote efficient use of resources and reduction of waste by manufacturing resource-saving products with long service lives, and shifting towards servicing and sharing of businesses b) Promote recycling of resources through exhaustive product collection and recycling c) Reduce volume of water use and reinforce drainage purification and reuse in production processes in accordance with regional water risks 3. Realization of a Harmonized Society with Nature (1) Target Minimize the impact on natural capital (2) Initiatives Hitachi will evaluate the impact that its operations have on ecosystems at each stage of the value chain, and implement actions to minimize the environmental burden. More specifically, Hitachi will supply products and services that contribute to ecosystem conservation, including atmospheric/water purification systems and nature monitoring systems, and promote environmentally conscious procurement activities. Hitachi will also seek to minimize environmental burden at factories and offices, such as by paying care and consideration to scarce species on factory grounds and managing the volume, quality and temperature of drainage water and exhaust gas emissions.

"COP22","India","COP22_India375","We have almost certainly blown the 1.5-degree global warming target","August 17, 2016 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Aug. 17 -- The United Nations climate change conference held last year in Paris had the aim of tackling future climate change. After the deadlocks and weak measures that arose at previous meetings, such as Copenhagen in 2009, the Paris summit was different. The resulting Paris Agreement committed to: Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2degC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. The agreement was widely met with cautious optimism. Certainly, some of the media were pleased with the outcome while acknowledging the deal's limitations. Many climate scientists were pleased to see a more ambitious target being pursued, but what many people fail to realise is that actually staying within a 1.5? global warming limit is nigh on impossible. There seems to be a strong disconnect between what the public and climate scientists think is achievable. The problem is not helped by the media's apparent reluctance to treat it as a true crisis. The 1.5? limit is nearly impossible In 2015, we saw global average temperatures a little over 1? above pre-industrial levels, and 2016 will very likely be even hotter. In February and March of this year, temperatures were 1.38? above pre-industrial averages. Admittedly, these are individual months and years with a strong El Nino influence (which makes global temperatures more likely to be warmer), but the point is we're already well on track to reach 1.5? pretty soon. Animated Timeline showing best current estimates of when global average temperatures will rise beyond 1.5? and 2? above pre-industrial levels. Boxes represent 90% confidence intervals; whiskers show the full range. Andrew King, Author provided On our current emissions trajectory we will likely reach 1.5? within the next couple of decades (2024 is our best estimate). The less ambitious 2? target would be surpassed not much later. This means we probably have only about a decade before we break through the ambitious 1.5? global warming target agreed to by the world's nations in Paris. A University of Melbourne research group recently published these spiral graphs showing just how close we are getting to 1.5? warming. Realistically, we have very little time left to limit warming to 2?, let alone 1.5?. Parallels with climate change scepticism The public seriously underestimates the level of consensus among climate scientists that human activities have caused the majority of global warming in recent history. Similarly, there appears to be a lack of public awareness about just how urgent the problem is. Many people think we have plenty of time to act on climate change and that we can avoid the worst impacts by slowly and steadily reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades. This is simply not the case. Rapid and drastic cuts to emissions are needed as soon as possible. In conjunction, we must also urgently find ways to remove greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. At present, this is not yet viable on a large scale. Is 1.5? even enough to avoid ""dangerous"" climate change? The 1.5? and 2? targets are designed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. It's certainly true that the more we warm the planet, the worse the impacts are likely to be. However, we are already experiencing dangerous consequences of climate change, with clear impacts on society and the environment. For example, a recent study found that many of the excess deaths reported during the summer 2003 heatwave in Europe could be attributed to human-induced climate change. Also, research has shown that the warm seas associated with the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in March 2016 would have been almost impossible without climate change. Climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, from heatwaves in Australia to heavy rainfall in Britain. These events are just a taste of the effects of climate change. Worse is almost certainly set to come as we continue to warm the planet. It's highly unlikely we will achieve the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, but that doesn't mean governments should give up. It is vital that we do as much as we can to limit global warming. The more we do now, the less severe the impacts will be, regardless of targets. The simple take-home message is that immediate, drastic climate action will mean far fewer deaths and less environmental damage in the future.

"COP22","India","COP22_India376","Belgium : Local and regional leaders on present and future of major EU policies and challenges","October 8, 2016 Saturday","TendersInfo","The European Committee of the Regions (CoR) will hold its fifth plenary session of the year in parallel with the 14th European Week of Regions and Cities (EWRC), which will bring Cohesion Policy experts and policymakers together with project managers from across Europe for a four-days programme of 130 workshops, events and project visits. Also, on 13 October, the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) will officially sign an Action Plan with the CoR . At the plenary session, which will be web-streamed, 14 opinions will be adopted by local and regional politicians: Delivering the Global Climate Agreement A Territorial Approach to COP22 in Marrakech : After Paris, much is at stake: the implementation of the actual agreement, the gap between objectives and commitments to limit global warming to well below 2C, the setting up of a system of multi-level global governance of climate issues that fully integrates cities and regions, and the need to tailor financial instruments in order to fast-forward climate action on the ground. European regions and cities want their voice heard during COP22 in Marrakech. In an opinion drafted by Francesco Pigliaru, president of Sardinia (IT/PES), the CoR is to vote on concrete proposals to convert the Paris deal into action. Speeding Up Connectivity: the Digital Single Market. In September, the European Commission presented new proposals to improve connectivity in Europe. They include an overhaul of EU telecoms rules, deployment of 5G and Wi-Fi networks and access to extremely high-gigabit connections. Andrus Ansip, European Commission Vice-President for the Digital Single Market, will debate these new initiatives and other legislative proposals, which are the focus of three opinions by local and regional politicians: EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 Accelerating the digital transformation of government (rapporteur: Martin Andreasson, Member of Vstra Gtaland Regional Council, SE/EPP). Digitising European Industry Reaping the full benefits of a Digital Single Market (rapporteur: Kieran McCarthy, Cork City Council, IE/EA). European Cloud Initiative Building a competitive data and knowledge economy in Europe (rapporteur: Anne Karjalainen, City councillor of Kerava, FI/PES). Simplification of ESIF from the perspective of Local and Regional Authorities: The European Structural and Investment Funds are the EU's main investment tool but programme and project implementation is often slowed down by discrepancies between EU regulations and rules in individual countries, auditing and control requirements, imbalanced application of state-aid rules and other obstacles. In an opinion drafted by Petr Osvald (CZ/PES), Councillor of the City of Plze?, local leaders distil their views on how to make ESIF more effective and timely without weakening the fight against misuses and corruption. State Aid and Services of General Economic Interest: The impact of the EU's state-aid controls on local and regional public services is the focus of an opinion drafted by Markus Tns (DE/PES), Member of the North Rhine-Westphalia Landtag. He calls for a simplification of state-aid rules, legal certainty and more flexibility for local and regional authorities and suggests that social public services should not be subject solely to competition and market rules. The European Pillar of Social Rights: After years of high unemployment and austerity, the European Commission has launched a consultation on a European pillar of social rights. The CoR draft opinion is prepared by Heinz-Joachim Hfer (DE/PES), Mayor of Altenkirchen. It outlines that strong social safeguards could help Member States address social inequalities, combat social dumping, bring social standards up, and consolidate the EU's aims of inclusive and sustainable growth. An EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy: The action plan's aim is to move the EU towards a sustainable economic model that brings growth and jobs while respecting the environment. This opinion has been drafted by Babette Winter (DE/PES), State Secretary for Europe and Culture in the Thuringia State Chancellery. It calls for greater emphasis on education and awareness-raising, action to promote mandatory 'green public procurement', the revision of eco-design provisions, and increased use of taxation to support secondary raw-material markets. An EU Strategy on Heating and Cooling: Increasing the efficiency of heating and cooling, which accounts for 50% of energy consumed in the EU, is critical to achieving the EU's energy objectives. In an opinion drafted by Daiva Matonien? (LT/ECR), Member of iauliai City Counci, EU's regions and cities call on the Commission to make more specific policy recommendations and to review existing financial support mechanisms. Local leaders also ask for the removal of barriers to the development of combined heat and power (CHP) plants and networks. The Commission presented its energy and security package in February. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India377","Natural disasters force 26 million people into poverty each year: World Bank","November 14, 2016 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 14 -- The impact of extreme natural disasters is equivalent to a global US$520 billion loss in annual consumption, and forces some 26 million people into poverty each year, a new report from the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) reveals. ""Severe climate shocks threaten to roll back decades of progress against poverty,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. ""Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative."" The report 'Unbreakable: Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters' warns that the combined human and economic impacts of extreme weather on poverty are far more devastating than previously understood. In all of the 117 countries studied, the effect on well-being, measured in terms of lost consumption, is found to be larger than asset losses. Because disaster losses disproportionately affect poor people, who have a limited ability to cope with them, the report estimates that impact on well-being in these countries is equivalent to consumption losses of about $520 billion a year. This outstrips all other estimates by as much as 60 per cent. With the climate summit, COP22 , underway, the report's findings underscore the urgency for climate-smart policies that better protect the most vulnerable. Poor people are typically more exposed to natural hazards, losing more as a share of their wealth and are often unable to draw on support from family, friends, financial systems, or governments.

"COP22","India","COP22_India378","Morocco,United Kingdom : Creating green financial markets in Africa","October 14, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","With the world gearing up for a major international climate conference in Morocco, a spotlight has been thrown on the role of Africa in the global fight against climate change. As our colleagues at the African Development Bank (AfDB) have so eloquently expressed, Africa faces a double-edged challenge it must drastically increase its citizens access to basic power services and at the same time it must meet its commitments under the climate change agreement. African nations made climate commitments as part of the Paris Climate Agreement, sealed at the COP21 climate talks in the French capital at the end of 2015. The COP22 follow-up conference will be held in Marrakesh in November 2016, building on the Paris accord and helping deliver its pledges. Africa and its climate challenges will certainly feature strongly in the Marrakesh discussions. The EBRD has joined in the collective response to addressing Africas energy challenges. Since 2012 it has been actively investing in three North African economies. But the Banks particular expertise in attracting private sector financing to green energy investments is now spreading to other countries across the continent. The EBRDs involvement in the southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region came in response to the political and economic upheaval that swept across the Arab world in 2011. The Bank applied the skills that it had developed in promoting the private sector in emerging Europe to a whole new set of countries. Over the last four years, it has financed around 100 projects worth over 3.8 billion in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as in Jordan. Climate finance has played a major role in this engagement and an important priority has been placed on developing renewable sources of energy, tapping into the regions abundant natural resources of sun and wind. Together with international partners, the EBRD launched a US$ 250 million financing framework for private sector renewable energy generation in its SEMED region in 2015. Its first project under the new facility was an investment with Moroccos Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE) Bank of Africa and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) in a windfarm in Khalladi, close to the Moroccan city of Tangiers. North Africa has also proved to be fertile ground for another of the EBRDs innovative and powerful climate instruments, its Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities (SEFFs). Through its SEFFs, the EBRD extends credit lines to local financial institutions that seek to develop sustainable energy financing as a permanent area of their business. Finance for sustainable energy projects is provided primarily in energy efficiency and small-scale renewable projects. Local banks lend the funds they have received from the EBRD on to their clients, such as small and medium-sized businesses, corporate and residential borrowers, and renewable energy project developers. This financing instrument has been very popular across a large number of countries where the EBRD invests. Individual facilities are tailored to suit the prevailing market conditions in any given country. Up to now, over 30 SEFF programmes and still counting have been developed in 24 countries, such as the successful TurSEFF in Turkey, a facility worth some US$ 1.5 billion for Turkish banks to pass on to their clients. The equivalent facility for Morocco is called MorSEFF. In 2015, the EBRD, the Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (AFD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Kreditanstalt fr Wiederaufbau (KfW) teamed up together and with support from the European Union provided a 20 million credit line under MorSEFF for climate projects for the clients of BMCE Bank. An important element in the roll-out of the SEFFs is the EBRDs cooperation with international donors such as European Union and the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). With their support and funding, the EBRD can reach out to even more potential investors and provide inventives that not only help reduce market barriers to successful investment in sustainable energy projects but contribute to the successful development of financial markets and banking sectors fully attuned to the promotion of a low-carbon economy. The EBRD is currently actively engaging in knowledge-sharing exercises, passing on its expertise to parties who may well look to the CIFs to help fund their investments. The Bank is also keen to ensure that, in addition to the provision of its own financing, its successful SEFF business model can be shared with other insitutions, even in countries that do not come within the EBRDs geographical remit. We have, for example, shared our experiences with SEFFs with the AfDB to support the start of their activities in sub-Saharan Africa. The EBRD has also highlighted its SEFF products to a range of African banks at a pre- COP22 conference in Casablanca in October 2016, co-hosted by BMCE. By stepping up its international cooperation in this way, the EBRD is seeking to achieve a lasting impact and to make an important contribution to addressing the global climate challenge. \"

Energy Day is being jointly organized by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), in cooperation with the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) and the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE), as part of a series of thematic days hosted by the Climate Champions and held under the auspices of the COP22 Presidency. The Paris Agreement set urgent climate action firmly in the context of sustainable development, with conversations today focusing on how we achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Number 7 (to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all), and secure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy that can connect the current 1.1 billion people in the world who have little or no access to electricity, and the 2.9 billion people that still rely on smoky, dangerous solid fuels for cooking and heating. Discussions and commitments made throughout the day will include: Announcements from the RE100 and EP100 initiatives Pre-launch commitments to One for All a global campaign to be launched in early 2017 that seeks to mobilize new forms of capital and new investors to end energy poverty before 2030. Developments in the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Lighthouses Initiative, launched in Paris last year aimed at supporting islands in the transformation of their energy systems. Developments related to the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) The remarkable renewable energy transformation of Morocco, this year's COP hosts. Closing the energy gap offers us one of the greatest economic opportunities of our lifetime, said Rachel Kyte, CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All. In 2016, the world needs an energy system that allows universal access, supports new jobs and meets our aspirations of a just, fair future for all. To achieve this, promises made must be promises kept. The climate objectives agreed in Paris require nothing less than the radical decarbonisation of the global economy, said Adnan Z. Amin, IRENA Director-General. Transitioning rapidly to a future fuelled by renewable energy, combined with improving energy efficiency, is the single most effective way to stave off catastrophic climate change while providing citizens with a better quality of life. But the pace and scale of change needs to dramatically increase if we are to fulfil the promise of the Paris Agreement. Governments need to create the necessary policy and finance frameworks to catalyse a groundswell of initiatives, as the private sector develops its own decarbonisation strategies. This is well within our reach. New announcements made on Energy Day include: The RE100 and EP100 initiatives are designed to work together to provide the least-cost decarbonisation pathway for business, and today three companies Dalmia Cement, Philips Lighting and Swiss Re become the first companies to be part of both campaigns led by The Climate Group, in partnership with CDP and the Global Alliance for Energy Productivity. Together, RE100 companies are collectively creating over 100TWh of demand for renewable electricity more than enough to power Morocco three times over. Members speaking today include Alejandro Agag, CEO, Formula E, Kevin Rabinovitch, Global Sustainability Director for Mars, and Bill Weihl, Director of Sustainability, at Facebook. Mr. Rabinovitch announced a new wind power purchasing agreement to power Mars' Mexican operations. A new private-sector led initiative, the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), was also announced - REBA builds connections between corporate electricity demand and renewable energy supply. Since COP21, the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative grew rapidly to include 39 States and 19 development partners and developed an innovative island renewable energy support programme. 19 renewable energy projects in the Caribbean were registered on the Sustainable Energy Marketplace, representing an investment volume of $1 billion. Two island States, Antigua and Barbuda and Cabo Verde, were selected to receive funding from the IRENA/ ADFD Project Facility and other co-financiers for a total of $45 million. In addition the UAE have recently announced $50 million for renewable energy projects in the Caribbean States. Alejandro Agag, CEO, Formula E commented: ""Electric vehicles reach their full potential when coupled with renewable energy charging - which is why all the fully-electric Formula E cars are powered by a revolutionary zero-emission glycerine. The future is electric!

"COP22","India","COP22_India380","Carbon Capture, Storage Seen as Essential to Energy Future","November 15, 2016 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","India Energy News","Nov. 15 -- Limiting carbon emissions requires the rapid, widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to augment alternative energy sources such as nuclear, wind and solar, according to the Global CCS Institute's 2016 Status Report. The Institute today convened a panel of experts to discuss the conclusions of the report, and how carbon reduction goals might be met under the newly elected U.S. Administration. Held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., the panel offered a diversity of perspectives on policy, regulation, politics and business. Participants included:  Jeff Erikson, General Manager, Global CCS Institute  David Mohler, Deputy Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy  Armond Cohen, Executive Director, Clean Air Task Force  Adele Morris, Director, Climate Change and Energy Economics Project, Brookings Institution  Bob Inglis, Director, Energy and Enterprise Initiative, George Mason University; former Republican Congressman from South Carolina The panel coincided with the release of the 2016 CCS Status Report, and the United Nations' 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco. ""Carbon capture is at a crossroads - it is essential, but not inevitable,"" said the Institute's regional General Manager Jeff Erikson. According to the International Energy Agency, approximately four billion tons per year of CO2 must be captured and stored globally by 2040, up from current annual capacity levels of about 40 million tons per year. The Status Report concludes that while more CCS projects are expected to come online, long-term climate goals are unlikely to be met without policy actions that create a level playing field with other low-carbon technologies. ""While North America leads the world in large-scale CCS projects, stronger commercial, policy and regulatory measures are needed to accelerate global CCS development and meet global climate change goals."" said Erikson. ""To realize its full potential as both a climate change tool and a job creator, CCS requires greater government support, similar to what renewables have enjoyed over the years."" The Global CCS Institute will continue to advocate for accelerated deployment of CCS, as energy policies, technologies and economics continue to evolve. Source: Global CCS Institute \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India381","IEA: world commits to tackling climate change","November 7, 2016","Indian Oil and gas news","New Delhi, Nov 07 -- The agreement was ratified last month, less than a year after it was approved by 197 countries under the French Presidency at COP21 last December. The agreement marks an unprecedented milestone in the global effort to combat climate change. Under the landmark agreement, nations have agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and focus efforts and investments toward a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. The goal is to keep global average temperatures from rising well below 2\'b0C with the aim of working to limit it to 1.5\'b0C. The question now turns to implementing the terms of the agreement, helping nations meet their goals and, more critically, ratchet them further. Next week, the world meets in Marrakesh, Morocco, during COP22 to do just that. The International Energy Agency will soon release World Energy Outlook 2016, which will highlight the various pathways to reach these targets. The report this year looks at individual country pledges and examines how close - or far - nations are from reaching these goals. It outlines a course that would limit the rise in global temperature to below 2\'b0C and, for the first time, it also plots possible pathways for meeting the much more ambitious 1.5\'b0C goal. ""Let's not underestimate the task ahead,"" said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA. ""Limiting carbon emissions and changing our energy systems is a monumental challenge. But the IEA is working with governments around the world to help identify solutions and show how it can be done."" The Paris Agreement will transform the global energy system for decades to come. WEO-2016 will examine how a post-Paris world redefines the idea of energy security, particularly in the power sector, the frontline in the fight against climate change. WEO-2016 offers the most comprehensive analysis of what this transformation of the energy sector might look like, thanks to its energy projections to 2040. It reviews the key opportunities and challenges ahead for renewable energy, the central pillar of the low carbon energy transition, as well as the critical role for energy efficiency. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India382","Morocco : OPIC and ReNew Power Ventures Sign Commitment for 100 Megawatt Solar Farm in India","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","TendersInfo","The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Governments development finance institution, signed a commitment with ReNew of approximately $74 million for a 100 MW solar project in the Indian state of Telangana. Announced during the 22nd session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP22 ), this project will diversify the countrys power generation mix with a clean source of renewable power and help the country reduce GHG emissions. In India, outdoor air pollution is an ever growing public health concern. OPICs partnership with Renew Power Ventures will have a transformative impact by helping India both reduce its emissions and increase energy capacity in the country through a diversified power generation mix, said OPIC President and CEO Elizabeth L. Littlefield. OPIC is committed to assisting India in its transition to a low carbon economy by investing in clean energy projects. The Telangana solar project is the first project approved under the ReNew Master Financing Facility, a $250 million facility between OPIC and ReNew to be used for the development, construction, and operation of solar energy projects awarded under the Government of Indias Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. Under the ReNew Master Financing Facility, up to 400 MW of new solar renewable power generation will be constructed in India across multiple projects. ReNew will be utilizing the innovative Master Financing Facility provided by OPIC to streamline the timeline for financing new renewable energy projects. Generating electricity from renewable energy can reduce a countrys dependence on fossil fuels and offers significant health benefits, in addition to being a sustainable source of energy. As the fourth largest energy consumer in the world, India must overcome a number of challenges to meet its rising energy demand and sustain economic growth. Currently, solar energy accounts for approximately one percent of total energy capacity in India, or 7.5 gigawatts. This project will support the Government of Indias goal to have 170 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2022, of which 100 GW are to be solar. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India383","This Year's Global Climate Change Conference Has The Boldest Agenda Yet","November 1, 2016 Tuesday","Youth Ki Awaaz","India, Nov. 1 -- As of today, the Paris agreement has achieved a critical threshold with 86 parties representing 62 percent of the global emissions, ratifying the agreement. This political mass officially pushed the agreement into force. With the major parties on board with regard to the climate agenda and the Paris blueprint laid out, COP 22 at Marrakesh is all set to get the ball rolling towards climate action. The COP is rightly given the moniker of £ction' COP. At COP 22 The new transparency mechanism with established guidelines to verify, measure and report the greenhouse emissions, is under consideration. This assumes even greater importance because the temperature will still rise by 2.7 degrees even if the countries deliver on their NDC promises. Hence, a proper accountability framework has to be built in and undoubtedly, this will be a tough task to meet. Another sticky issue will be the mobilisation of funds by developed nations. As per Article 9 of Paris agreement, developed nations shall provide financial resources to assist developing countries. As per reports, the flow of climate funds has been dismal with roughly $10.3 billion. This has been committed to the Global Climate Fund cumulatively in the past six years in contrast to the promised $100 billion annually. Despite the lack of political will, the technical inconsistencies and ambiguities involving the definition and scope of climate finance, are expected to be ironed out. Also, the neglected area of adaptation efforts may also find place in the financial road map. The COP 22 Manish Bapna, MD of World Resources Institute has said that India has one of the boldest renewable energy targets in the world, making it destined to be a major player in solar and wind markets. However, its efforts are sharply limited due to restricted means of implementation in the form of finance, technology and capacity-building support. India would achieve its target only if it receives financial support and discounted rates on cutting edge technologies from developed nations. The estimate says that it will require over $2.5tn to meet all its targets. Hence it is crucial that India makes a pressing statement for a concrete road map towards climate finance and technology transfer in COP 22 . It is to be seen how the member states will carry forward the momentum generated in Paris and if the political will would materialise in Marrakesh. Although it is clear that the COP 22 will need to show real urgency and expediency to realise the fairy tale story of COP 21. HYPERLINK htsyndication@hindustantimes.com \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India384","Climate change: Donald Trump turning his back on commitments would be disastrous for the world","December 14, 2016 Wednesday","The Financial Express","The world is concerned about the fate of the various important international agreements on climate change under the US President-elect Donald Trump, even as it forges ahead by taking global and domestic action to slow down the rate of carbon emissions. Scientists firmly believe that the threat of climate change is real and human activities are responsible for it. This thought has leapfrogged from the UNFCCC COP21 summit in Paris (November 2015) to this year's COP22 in the Ochre City of Marrakech, Morocco. We know that the US and other developed countries have been deeply involved in finalising all international treaties on climate change. Let us have a look at some of these agreements to appreciate the magnitude of challenge cancelling these will pose, if Trump decides to turn the clock on such agreements. The Paris agreement was ratified by 63 countries, including the US, which currently emits about 55% of the global emissions. In Marrakech, the International Solar Alliance (ISA)-an initiative of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi-has been ratified to bring all sunshine-rich nations between the tropics on a common platform with regard to policies, programmes/projects, capacity-building measures and financial instruments to increase solar energy capacity. In addition, a group of 48 small and poorest island nations have committed to zero carbon societies by 2050. In October, Montreal Protocol, ratified by 191 countries, was convened in Kigali, Rwanda, to discuss the replacement of substances that deplete the ozone layer. Here, developed countries were asked to take the lead to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by inventing technologies which should be available to developing countries at an affordable price. Many countries, including India, are working on patent-free solutions searching for alternatives to HFCs. This year itself, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, at its 39th conference, discussed measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the International Maritime Organisation impressed upon governments to ratify the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, so that dumping in the seas could be stopped/regulated to mitigate maritime environmental pollution. Besides, there have been some international treaties to combat climate change in the earlier years. In all the above treaties, the US has been the key player in shaping the conversation on climate change. In the recent past, America's active engagement with China, India and small island nations has helped fashion global agreements. How all this would change under President Trump is a question. If the President-elect pulls out of the Paris agreement, the Barack Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, under the US National Climate Action Plan, may not be adhered to and may, consequently, derail the efforts to speed up the production of renewable energy. History may repeat itself, as had happened with Kyoto Protocol in 1997, where the US did not ratify the protocol following a change of guard in Washington, even though it was instrumental in getting it through. Moreover, with America withdrawing, some other rich nations may follow suit. In the above, rather grim scenario, it would be extremely difficult to limit the average global temperature rise well below 2-degree Celsius by 2100 from the pre-Industrial Revolution period, as decided in Paris. Moreover, the US is required to add to its current abysmally low emission target, otherwise the world may face even a 4-degree Celsius rise. The world needs a 0.9% reduction in emission level every year till 2030 at least to achieve the target of below 2-degree. Also, the decision made at the recent COP22 for finalisation of the rule book, which would turn pledges made in Paris into action, would be jeopardised. The issue of providing $100 billion to developing countries, though still unresolved, would receive further setback. The world is suffering from extreme climate conditions of floods, drought and storms/hurricanes, etc, and even the US is not immune to this. That is why Washington-based think tank World Resources Institute is in favour of strong action to tackle climate change. In addition, the 45 US companies, including largest retailer Walmart, have committed to ambitious emission reduction targets. Further, due to global warming, some parts of the Arctic are experiencing a jump of 20-degree Celsius above normal temperatures. This is akin to having 50-degree Celsius in November, and about 65-degree Celsius in June, in Delhi. This new phenomenon may disrupt monsoon activity over some parts of the world, drastically affecting humans by causing various disease outbreaks and threatening food security due to inconsistent crop yields. In fact, this has already started happening. In the wake of this crisis, it is important to determine whether the US President-elect has changed his views on climate change which he described as a 'Chinese hoax' during his election campaign. There is no real trade-off between climate change and economic interests of the US and other rich nations. If we want robust inclusive growth, we must act on climate change. Trumping climate change would simply be disastrous. The author is a former ISS officer and a former UN consultant \"

This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment. ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via ""Orange Money"". The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. Access to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimize the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa. During the COP22 conference, Orange and ENGIE reaffirm their commitment to leveraging their technological expertise to stimulate sustainable progress and economic and social development on the African continent. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India389","Belgium : Marrakech climate conference: world forging ahead on climate action","November 21, 2016 Monday","TendersInfo","The Marrakech climate conference concluded yesterday with concrete results to put the Paris Agreement on climate change into action. Almost 200 countries met in Morocco for the annual UN gathering, against the backdrop of the rapid ratification and entry into force of the landmark deal. The Paris Agreement became international law on 4 November 2016, less than a year after it was adopted. This enabled the Marrakech conference to convene the first ever meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Caete said: ""The progress here in Marrakech is the clearest proof that the world is forging ahead on global climate action. Climate change is bigger than any one country. And despite all the current uncertainties, this is our clear message from Marrakech: We will stand by Paris, we will defend Paris, and we will implement Paris. The global clean energy transition is here to stay, and Europe will continue to lead the way towards a more sustainable and competitive economy."" The Marrakech climate conference ( COP22 ), dubbed the Action and Implementation COP, set out to demonstrate that commitments made in Paris last year are being put into practice, and to act as a catalyst for further action. There were a number of concrete outcomes: The Marrakech Action Proclamation One of the key deliverables from COP22 , the Marrakech Action Proclamation, is a call for the highest political commitment to tackle climate change. It sends a message of global unity and continued resolve to deliver on the Paris objectives and the transition to a global low-carbon economy. The Paris work programme Parties made good progress on the elements of the Paris rule book which will guide the implementation of the agreement and in particular on transparency and the five-year ambition cycle. Parties agreed a way forward that will ensure the rule book will be ready by 2018. Solidarity Package Climate Finance including the 2020 Roadmap: All Parties welcomed the further efforts by the developed countries in increasing their public climate finance contributions. Under long term-finance discussions, the Parties welcomed the progress by donors towards reaching the goal of jointly mobilising USD 100 billion annually by 2020 and urged them to continue to scale-up mobilised climate finance. The conference also noted with appreciation the 2016 biennial assessment by the Standing Committee on Finance, which highlighted an increase in climate finance flows. Adaptation Fund: EU countries showed their commitment to supporting their most vulnerable partners in dealing with the impacts of climate change. Several EU Member States (Germany, Belgium, Sweden and Italy) announced new contributions to the Fund which now stands at USD 81 million. The EU pledges account for more than 90% of the total amount available under the Adaptation Fund, which directly supports developing countries in their efforts to cope with the effects of climate change. Capacity Building:The final elements were agreed to enable the ParisCommittee onCapacity Building to begin its work in 2017. The work of the committee will play an important part in helping to develop and strengthen the skills and expertise needed in developing countries to implement their domestic climate plans. Warsaw International Mechanism on loss and damage: A Decision was adopted on the review of the mechanism addressing the issues related to loss and damage associated with climate change impacts. This will result in increasing its potential and effectiveness, for example through collaboration with a wide range of bodies and entities inside and outside the UNFCCC process. The Decision confirms the shared commitment of Parties to address the concerns of the most vulnerable countries. Action Agenda In Marrakech countries, states, regions, cities and companies together came together under the Global Climate Action Agenda to showcase inspiring climate action initiatives. The European Union made a number of announcements during the two week conference including a contribution of EUR 40 million from Germany and EUR 20 million from the European Commission to the InsuResilience initiative. This G7 initiative aims to increase access to direct or indirect insurance coverage against the impacts of climate change for up to 400 million of the most vulnerable people in developing countries by 2020. The European Union reaffirmed its leading role in supporting the African continent in the fight against climate change and in the promotion of renewable energies. By 2020, the EU has promised to facilitate investments that will increase the renewable electricity generation capacity of at least 5 GW. This is already half of the 10 GW goal of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative for 2020. Morocco, Germany, France, Spain and Portugal signed a roadmap for sustainable electricity trade which aims to identify barriers to trade in renewable electricity between the five signatory countries and suggest ways to overcome these barriers. The EU continues to make significant efforts to scale up support to climate-relevant action. In 2015, the EU and its Member States provided EUR 17.6 billion to help developing countries tackle climate change. The European External Investment Plan, announced this autumn, is expected to trigger public and private investments of up to EUR 44 billion in African and in the EU Neighbourhood area. The Parties to the Paris Agreement will meet again in 2017 to review progress and outcomes on the implementation of the work programme. The deadline for completion of the work is 2018. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India390","Five-year : Warmest five-year period on record","November 11, 2016 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 11 -- The period from 2011 to 2015 has been the warmest five-year period on record globally. The average temperature in 2015 had already risen by more than one degree (with 2016 on track to be even warmer) since the pre-industrial period. While there's a growing fear that 2015's record-breaking temperatures will be normal by 2030, this year has already seen record-breaking heat for nine consecutive months. The early effects of climate change have been consistently visible in the form of increased global temperature-both over land and deep ocean-sea-level rise and the widespread melting of Arctic ice. A study by the World Meteorological Organization analyses this five-year period for a better understanding of multi-year warming trends and extreme events. According to the study, the period 2011-2015 began with a strong La Nina event and ended with a strong El Nino. The high temperatures in 2015 were influenced by the El Nino event that developed during that year but the primary impact of the 2015-2016 El Nino on annual global temperatures was felt in 2016. Many of the worst disasters between 2011 and 2015 involved extreme weather and climate. For instance, the drought in 2010-11 led to the famine in the Horn of Africa, which caused more than 250,000 deaths. Besides drought, heat waves and tropical cyclones in South Asia and hurricanes in the US caused huge casualty. In the midst of all this, the study revealed that the concentration of major long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continued to increase during the period 2011-2015. As global leaders deliberate on the modalities of Paris Agreement at COP22 taking place in Marrakech, the ulterior objective of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels will guide every decision. The findings of the study will compel the policymakers to reflect on changing climate conditions and strengthen the implementation of the climate deal.

The facilities would be fitted out with LED lighting, photovoltaic systems, and solar water heaters. The Government of Morocco would eventually put in place regulations, which would enable for a tariff to be paid for rooftop solar electricity fed into the grid, though PV market of Morocco has been restraint by regulatory shortfalls, positive signs are emerging in advance of COP22 . The program, named Energy Efficiency in Mosques, began in 2015, operating up to March 2019 and has a financial volume of 5 million ($5.62 million). The objective of the program is to develop the energy utilization of Moroccos mosques, and in its first stage running up to 2019 at least 600 mosques would be fitted out with LED lighting, PV systems, and solar water heaters. This would ensue in substantial savings for the Moroccan Ministry of Religious Affairs, who pays the electricity bills of 15,000 mosques across the country. However, the chief aim of the program is to raise public awareness of renewable energies and energy efficiency in Morocco and to create jobs, said the GIZ. The idea is to use mosques as a starting point for the diffusion of these technologies, hereby creating a market for private services in the field of energy efficiency that could afterwards be enlarged towards other public buildings in sectors such as education or health. The creation of a market for renewable energy and energy efficiency although needs domestic firms which offer these services. Indeed, demand for services in this area remains low, and only a few local companies provide them, often with a workforce that lacks the skills to plan, install and maintain plants appropriately, notes the GIZ. The design of the program is grounded on energy-saving contracts for this reason. \"

Mr. Amara was in Paris to deliver a keynote speech at an IEA forum on Integrating Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, recognising Morocco's early successes in this field. ""Morocco's leadership and commitment to a sustainable energy policy can be a model for other countries in North Africa , sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, particularly in the electricity sector,"" Dr. Birol said, adding that the IEA considered Morocco to be among its key partner countries. Speaking at the high-level forum, Dr Amara said Morocco has been able to exceed its renewable energy targets thanks to the strong commitment to a sustainable energy policy by King Mohammed VI. In 2009, the government adopted a national energy strategy, setting clear targets for wind, solar and hydropower. It was one of the first countries in the Middle East and North Africa to reform most of its fossil-fuel subsidies while adopting energy efficiency measures to reduce energy demand. The IEA has also been providing support to Morocco in its preparations to host the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakech in November. Dr Birol wished the Moroccan government success in hosting the important climate talks, which follows the landmark Paris agreement to limit harmful carbon emissions. The basis of the IEA's collaboration with Morocco began in 2007, focusing particularly on the areas of energy policy, statistics, and R&D.; The IEA's 2014 energy policy review of Morocco was the first dedicated to a country in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Je remercie Sa Majest le Roi Mohammed VI et le Gouvernement du Maroc davoir runi la COP22 un moment aussi crucial. Merci de votre leadership. This is a new dawn for global cooperation on climate change. The Paris Agreement is one of the most complex and ambitious and far-reaching visions ever reached by the United Nations, by the international community. I thank all Heads of State and Government who are present here for leadership and strong commitment for their vision. This Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November, years ahead of expectations. It entered into force years ahead of expectations. We have now 109 countries who have ratified accounting for more than 75 per cent of greenhouse?gas emissions. Countries have strongly supported this Paris Agreement because they realize their own national interest is best secured by pursuing the common good. Now we have to translate these words into concrete effective policies and actions. This is critical to protect our planet, safeguard the most vulnerable and drive shared prosperity. Low-emission development and climate resilience will advance all the Sustainable Development Goals which were adopted September last year by you distinguished leaders of the world. The United Nations will help countries implement this Agreement. The quicker we act, the more we gain. Before I begin to say a few more words, I would like to express my deepest thanks to the Government and people of France and President Franois Hollande for his leadership of the French Presidency of COP21, and also Laurent Fabius, the President of COP21. Thank you for their leadership. After a decade giving top priority to climate change, visiting its frontiers and speaking to everyone I could reach, I have learned during last 10 years at least six important lessons which I would like to share with you today. First, multilateral solutions work. Acting together, countries achieve more than they ever could alone. This is true for the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and recent achievements on mitigation. The United Nations is the best forum to forge solutions. Second, Heads of State and Government must lead. Political and moral leadership of you distinguished heads of State and Government that is the key in implementing these words. I have spoken with nearly every and each leader of the world about climate change. The more they understood, they more decisively they acted. And I thank you for your leadership. Third, we need whole societies to engage. Millions of people from all sectors contributed to the Paris Agreement. They are indispensable for realizing its full potential. The global climate action agenda generated collaboration among Governments, businesses, finance and civil society. They demonstrated the power of partnerships. Fourth, the United Nations must continue to champion the science. The current intended nationally determined contributions, INDCs, will not get us out of the danger zone. The mechanisms within the Paris Agreement to continuously raise ambition based on the best available science is critically important. We need to get on a global emissions pathway that limits warming this century to well below 2C and as close down to 1.5C. This means that global emissions need to peak by 2020 and decline rapidly from then on. 2015 was the warmest year on record. This year is virtually certain to be even hotter. Today, more than 150 million people live on land that could be submerged or suffer chronic flooding within this century, possibly causing massive waves of migration and instability. The choices we make today and in the coming decades could lock in catastrophic climate impacts for thousands of years to come. This is an enormous responsibility and an enormous opportunity to do what is right for our future. I strongly urge all countries to increase the mitigation ambition of their national climate plans by 2018. The private sector must also do much more. And I call for the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies to accelerate the transition to clean energy. We have to face the facts and be ready to manage a range of risk scenarios. We have no right to gamble with the fate of future generations or imperil the survival of other species that share our planet. Number five: we have to fund and expand solutions. Local communities and cities are reducing their carbon footprint. Clean energy sources are being scaled up around the world. Last year, for the first time, renewables represented more than half of the new power capacity globally. We need to better anticipate and absorb climate risks and reshape development to be more resilient. The Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction will advance progress. I have also launched a climate resilience initiative. Investing in resilience now will reduce future losses and generate huge dividends. Number six: the United Nations must continue advancing the moral case for action. I am confident my successor, Antnio Guterres, will continue to be a strong champion for the most vulnerable. They did the least to create the climate crisis and should not suffer its worst effects. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India398","France : Emissions data critical for targeted climate action","November 11, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo","This week NASA announced it had produced global maps of CO2 emissions using its Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite, which will provide more detailed and location-specific emissions data than has ever been possible. This information will be available to policy-makers in coming years. Knowing exactly how much carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere and from where better enables countries to act on their climate commitments. The higher quality the data, the more targeted and effective the action. These actions will be critical to meeting global climate commitments. With the successful ratification of the Paris Agreement, much of the discussion at COP22 in Marrakech, starting this week, will focus on implementation. The action will mostly take place within the energy sector, responsible for two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions and 80% of CO2 emissions. Thankfully promoting sustainable development and combating climate change have become integral aspects of energy planning, analysis and policy making within IEA member countries and beyond. Such policy actions must be based on accurate data. For years, the IEA has been working with countries around the world to improve their reporting of energy data resulting in more accurate estimations of CO2 emissions. The IEAs annual CO2 emissions from fuel combustion provides over forty years of data from more than 150 countries and regions worldwide the most comprehensive estimates of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion across the world and across the sectors of the global economy. This information has allowed the IEA to show that global greenhouse gas emissions are starting to decouple from economic growth. In other words, while economies are growing and standards of living are improving, CO2 emissions are growing at a relatively slower pace. China and the United states, in particular, have seen reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases due to a variety of factors, including a switch from coal to natural gas for power generation and increasing energy efficiency.

As the world largest solar module producer and one of the leading global solar power plant developers, JinkoSolar has played the role as an advocate of renewable energy and has supported proactive government approaches to achieving the Paris Agreement in every occasion since last year. Mr. Xiande Li, Chairman of JinkoSolar, commented on this landmark agreement, ""It is a moment to celebrate, it is also a milestone that the world ends the path to inevitable climate disaster and sets off with determination towards a sustainable future."" ""And what does this agreement entering into force mean for companies. The business world should prepare and divert to a low-carbon growth path. If you are investing in carbon reduction and energy efficiency and implementing shifts towards an environmentally friendly portfolio, implementation of the Paris Agreement is a strategic business advantage. Now that the Agreement is in force, countries and companies that embrace and support that reality will thrive; those that don't will be left behind."" ""The Paris Agreement has made great headway, and there will be more progress in Morocco at COP22 in November. Although we have a long way to go, I know that many in the business world are well prepared to make the journey to a thriving, low-carbon economy. Nowadays, solar power is undercutting coal fired electricity to become the cheapest, the cleanest and safest power source. Every industrial and commercial rooftop should be used, every idle land could be utilized for solar energy. It is the easiest and most feasible way for companies to fulfill their carbon reduction commitment as well as to drive growth simultaneously. So it will future-proof your climate efforts and ensure your company is not disadvantaged as the rest of the economy decarbonizes. "" Source: JinkoSolar Holding \"

More significantly and in keeping with the new climate position taken on Sunday, India's environment ministry is also now close to agreeing on another key climate treaty -the Montreal Protocol to limit ozone depleting gases. The Union Cabinet will have to give its approval for the ratification of the Paris agreement before October 2. The agreement regime and every country's related climate targets will come into effect from 2020. It is gathered that India may agree to a HFC phase out cycle of 2024-26 instead of the 2028-3031. It is negotia ting hard to gain significant benefits so that a phase down cycle of 2024-26 comes as close as possible to the 20283031in terms of financial impact on India. Even with an earlier phase down cycle, India is pitching to be permitted to keep the freeze year on use of HFCs at 203031. Meanwhile, India will now ready its instrument of ratification of the Paris agreement with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ahead of the next COP22 meeting in Morocco. The Obama administration has been strongly pursuing both the ratifi cation of the Paris agreement as well as the amendment to the Montreal Protocol globally to ensure it leaves behind a lasting legacy . It has consistently been nudging India on the issue. The same has found reflection in the Indo-US Joint Statement issued after Modi's US visit earlier this year.

The report, the 12th edition of the Global Climate Risk Index, said: ""India faced several types of extreme weather events in 2015."" ""After floods in February and March due to unseasonal rainfall, it suffered from one of the deadliest heat waves in world history killing more than 2,300 people in May, followed by a much weaker monsoon than normal,"" it said. But it said Africa is the continent that was hit hardest by extreme weather events in 2015. According to the report, four out of the 10 most impacted countries globally are African. They are Mozambique (rank one), Malawi (rank three), Ghana and Madagascar (both rank eight). ""Especially flooding affected the hosting continent of this year's climate summit,"" an official statement quoting Germanwatch's main author of the Index S\'f6nke Kreft said. Heat waves claimed most lives last year. More than 4,300 deaths in India and more than 3,300 deaths in France show that both developing and developed countries, respectively, are impacted by extraordinary temperatures.

""EU ETS""). They organised a public hearing with members of the European Parliament. The companies welcomed the ratification of the Paris agreement and its entering into force before the COP22 . This shows once again the leadership of the European Union in the fight against climate change. The EU must now turn its long term climate commitments (80-95% of greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to 1990 by 2050) into concrete measures in order to align the EU ETS with the objectives agreed in Paris. The reform proposed by the European Commission, whilst welcome, will not be sufficient to live up to Europe's ambitious low-carbon agenda and to secure the shift to low carbon technologies. A functioning EU ETS is critical to make the energy transition possible in a cost effective way while providing the private sector with clear and robust price signals to invest in low carbon and carbon free technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) investments of almost USD 2.5 trillion are required in the EUs power sector over the period 2015-2040 to reach its climate goals. The energy sector accounts for almost 60% of greenhouse gas emissions covered by the EU ETS. Policymakers must go beyond measures taken so far to strengthen ETS (""backloading""1' Market Stability Reserve) and the current proposal under discussion. The negotiations of its ""4th phase"" (2021-2030) provide a unique opportunity to fix the European carbon market. In this context, a combination of short and long term measures to fix the EU ETS is needed, no single measure being able to do that alone. Therefore, new initiatives must go beyond the current texts under discussion with the aim of: Strengthening the structure of the carbon market and restoring the investors' confidence by providing visibility and predictability: Fostering robust price signals on the market a significant increase in CO2 prices is necessary to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of the power sector in the future. \"

BMCE has established a reputation as a leader in Morocco and is known for its pioneering initiatives in the field of sustainable finance. Through its 75% shareholding in Bank of Africa Group, BMCE has a banking network in 18 countries in Sub Saharan Africa. The facility is dedicated to support BMCE's initiatives towards improvement of solid waste management practices and standards, one of the major environmental challenges in Morocco. Management of municipal solid waste is lacking proper infrastructure and suitable funding in areas outside of major cities. In response to these challenges, the Moroccan government developed the National Solid Waste Program (PNDM), which aims to upgrade the management of municipal solid waste. With the proposed facility for BMCE, FMO and EIB will support the PNDM objectives and targets, which include, among others, ensuring household waste collection rates of 100% by 2030 and rehabilitating or closing all existing disposal sites by 2020. The facility consists of: a term loan facility of EUR 20 million to fund the pre-identified solid waste management projects. The loan facility is provided in partnership between FMO and EIB, with both institutions providing a EUR 10 million loan. a comprehensive Technical Assistance package that include both sectoral studies on waste management as well as expert studies for the pre-identified projects. The package also facilitates a mission of BMCE, its waste management clients and Moroccan regulators to The Netherlands to get introduced to best international waste management practices. The Technical Assistance program will be provided by FMO. As part of the proposed facility, BMCE has identified a number of projects which will be carried out by specialist companies in the management of solid waste for the creation of disposal and treatment facilities in several Moroccan cities. The new waste management facilities enable, among others, increased recycling and energy generation from landfill gas, and will have positive impacts on environment and climate.

"COP22","India","COP22_India405","Morocco : Major countries commit to increase the share of electric vehicles in government fleets","November 19, 2016 Saturday","TendersInfo","Recognizing the importance of reducing carbon emission in the transportation sector, eight major nations Canada, China, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America signed a Government Fleet Declaration today, pledging to increase the share of electric vehicles in their government fleets and calling for other governments to join them. The Declaration was announced at the Marrakech Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) and was developed under the aegis of the Clean Energy Ministerials Electric Vehicles Initiative (CEM-EVI). The Declaration emphasises the renewal of government fleets and showcases specific and voluntary commitments of these countries to accelerate the introduction of low-emission vehicles in their vehicle fleets. Through this Declaration, the eight signatory governments are taking a leadership role in this movement and sending a strong signal for the need to speed up the transition to a low-carbon transport. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector today account for nearly a quarter of total emissions. The share will increase significantly in the coming decades unless high-impact actions are taken. Changing the trajectory of emission in road transportation involves a global shift towards low-emission vehicles, along with the adoption of broader sustainable transportation principles. The voluntary commitments taken by these countries will reduce fleets greenhouse gas emissions and help accelerate the transition to low-emission vehicles, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The members of the Clean Energy Ministerials Electric Vehicles Initiative cooperate to facilitate the global deployment of 20 million electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, by 2020. This Declaration is also in line with the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change and Call to Action released at COP21 during the Lima Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) Transport Focus, which specifies that at least 20 percent of all road transport vehicles (cars, 2 and 3-wheelers, trucks, buses and others) globally should be electrically powered by 2030 to respect a less-than 2-degree pathway. This Declaration also aims at encouraging non-state actors, such as cities, regional and state governments, companies, sectorial federations and other organizations, to accelerate the energy transition with the introduction of clean vehicles in their fleets, including transit buses, taxi fleets, as well as municipal and corporate fleets. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India407","United Arab Emirates : The Power and Potential of Education for Climate Change Awareness","November 21, 2016 Monday","TendersInfo","The focus of the global community at the recent Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) negotiations was on addressing progress to-date on the ambitious goals set in the Paris Agreement. To meet these goals over the coming years, we will need significant action from government, industry and communities in the short term, and interventions and innovations from the next generation of sustainability leaders in the medium- and long-term. And to ensure todays youth become tomorrows sustainability leaders, we must fully leverage the power and responsibility of education to raise awareness and empower young people to address climate change challenges. This is precisely the purpose of Masdar Institute. As the worlds first graduate-level university dedicated to providing real-world solutions to issues of sustainability, the Institute is leading the way in youth engagement to build the next generation of climate change leaders. Education has two obvious effects on the fight against climate change. Firstly, it impacts individuals general awareness of the issue, and secondly, it determines how enabled they are to develop the necessary solutions and innovations to overcome climate change. In fact, so important is education to the fight against climate change that Article 6 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is wholly dedicated to education, training, public awareness and access to information related to climate change. The link between education and awareness is obvious. A Yale University research paper based on a Gallup World Poll survey of residents of 119 countries found that 40% of adults worldwide reported never having heard of climate change. That figure rises to more than 65% in some countries like India and Egypt. While national factors behind these figures are as diverse and complex as the polled nations, the report authors asserted that: educational attainment tends to be the single strongest predictor of public awareness of climate change. And while awareness of climate change is important, general awareness does necessarily equate to concern, especially in countries where climate change is part of the political debate, like in the US. This solidifies the importance of ensuring that the information shared about climate change is as accurate as possible, and that the public is educated enough to understand the scientific concepts at its core. A high basic scientific literacy in the population can help increase a communitys ability solve and adapt to climate change by enabling members to make informed decisions about climate, and the factors that impact it, like pollution. The second effect of education on the fight against climate change our ability to solve and mitigate its impacts is more difficult to remedy. This requires the development of a quality educational infrastructure, from primary through to higher education, that has a strong focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). A STEM-focused education will provide students with both the understanding of the cause and effects of climate change, and also, the tools and knowhow to solve them. Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO, and Christiana Figueres, former Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, beautifully articulated the economic value of education in a comment piece, saying: education provides the skills people need to thrive in the new sustainable economy, working in areas such as renewable energy, smart agriculture, forest rehabilitation, the design of resource-efficient cities, and sound management of healthy ecosystems. Additionally, new research published in the journal Science suggests that investing in education could even be a better way to reduce vulnerability to climate change-related disasters, like cyclones and floods. The report asserted that improving education can give people the skills and knowledge to better prepare for and recover from natural disasters. The paper cited how improving the education of people in Cuba helped them more quickly respond to hurricane alerts and recover from the impact of the storm. The reports authors conclude that educated people have a better awareness of risk, which gives them the knowledge and skills to adapt flexibly. An example of the link between education and climate change awareness is Japan, where 46.4% of the population has undergone tertiary education and 98.9% are climate change aware. These benefits of education, and the impact they have on awareness and the response to global climate change, is why Masdar Institute has put such a strong emphasis on developing the UAEs capacity to understand and tackle climate change. The Institute contributes to the development of the UAEs next generation of climate change talent through its graduates, students and outreach programs such as the Young Future Energy Leaders (YFEL), which is enhancing the expertise of young sustainability leaders through real world engagement. Select Masdar Institute students and members of YFEL attended the COP22 meetings to learn from the negotiations and develop the skills and networks needed in their future roles as energy leaders in decarbonizing the environment. More critically, Masdar Institute focuses on developing the human and intellectual capital required to solve the diverse set of problems posed by climate change. We require all our faculty and students to continue with their engagement in research that respond to real-world sustainability challenges, like the need to capture and sequester carbon in an affordable and efficient manner, and the value of developing sustainable and efficient energy supplies. The result so far is nearly 550 highly-trained graduates, 14 patents, five spin-off companies. We also engage with industry and academic leaders from around the world in research of direct relevance to known and anticipated issues of sustainability in areas of water, energy, advanced materials and smart systems. \"

We need everyone. And we need action from the local to the global. Partnerships should focus on results on Thursday and make progress for the long-term. We have no time to waste, and much to gain, by acting now, Ban told a High-Level event on Accelerating Climate Action. The President of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, noted that without minimizing the eminent responsibility of States, the contribution of non-State actors serves as a structuring supplement to multilateral action against the impacts of climate change. Last December at the previous Conference, known as COP 21, 196 Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved. It aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. The Global Climate Action Agenda, launched formally in 2014 at COP 20, in Lima, Peru, aims to mobilize non-State actors in addressing climate change. In Paris the next year, two Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana, French Ambassador for climate change negotiations, and Hakima El Hait, Moroccan Minister for the Environment, were appointed to accelerate joint action on the Agenda. We have found committed partners, partners on the move, cooperative partners, said El Hait at the high-level meeting. The business community understands that this is where future growth lies. Investors have realized that this is where sustainable returns can be found. Tubiana announced on Thursday the launch of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, with the aim of ensuring that efforts are more coherent, more continuous, and stronger. The Partnership belongs to everyone, all those who seek to extend climate action. It will seek to create space for everyone to work together, remove barriers, understand solutions and see the future in a much more active and optimistic way, she added. For his part, Ban said the Action Agenda is central to this effort to implement the Paris Agreement on the ground. We need to immediately drive a radical transformation of the global economy, he said, adding that the private sector has a key role to play. The Secretary-General went on to stress the importance of adaptation. Climate resilient innovations are needed to help billions of people adapt to increasing droughts, floods, temperatures and other impacts. Adaptation is not a luxury. It is a prudent investment in our future, he said. The UN chief said he was pleased to see so many African countries mobilizing climate action, taking as an example the Adaptation of African Agriculture initiative. This partnership will help create more resilient food systems on the continent and advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), he stated. Tuesday, at the opening of the high-level segment of COP 22 , dozens of Heads of State and Government showed a strong support for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Before the Conference wraps up on 18 November, parties hope to define the rules for the accord and to lay out a viable plan for providing at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to support climate action.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz released the following statement: Passing the threshold for the Paris Agreements entry into force is a historic moment, marking a new era of global consensus on climate change action. This agreement will further accelerate development of a multi-trillion dollar market for clean energy technology solutions that reduce heat-trapping emissions. While the Agreements entry into force is cause for celebration, our work has just begun. The central challenge for this new era will be to accelerate the deployment of energy technologies, develop new innovative low-carbon solutions quickly, meet the goals our nations have declared before the world, and encourage even greater ambition. Thats why, on the first day of COP21, President Obama announced Mission Innovation, an initiative in which 20 countries plus the European Union have now pledged to each seek a doubling of clean energy R&D investments over a five-year period. Private sector leaders announced the parallel Breakthrough Energy Coalition, again aimed at accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy. As we have already seen in the United States, building a clean energy economy creates jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities, lowers energy costs for families and businesses, enhances energy security, and has the potential to expand access to electricity to billions worldwide. The United States is committed to lead by example on clean energy and energy technology innovation. As I travel across the country, the innovation I see taking place in every state convinces me that America has the workers, the entrepreneurs, the scientists, the engineers, and the desire to be the global R&D leader for clean energy technology, research, development, and deployment. With each country doing their part to meet the Paris Agreement, we can leverage science and technology to combat climate change, improve quality of life around the world, and create unprecedented opportunities through a low-carbon economy. \"

"COP22","India","COP22_India419","France : Paris Agreement formally enters into force","November 5, 2016 Saturday","TendersInfo","With the entry into force of the historic Paris Agreement today, the world is finally committing to tackling climate change. The agreement was ratified last month, less than a year after it was approved by 197 countries under the French Presidency at COP21 last December. The agreement marks an unprecedented milestone in the global effort to combat climate change. Under the landmark agreement, nations have agreed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and focus efforts and investments toward a low-carbon, resilient and sustainable future. The goal is to keep global average temperatures from rising well below 2C with the aim of working to limit it to 1.5C. The question now turns to implementing the terms of the agreement, helping nations meet their goals and, more critically, ratchet them further. Next week, the world meets in Marrakesh, Morocco, during COP22 to do just that. The International Energy Agency will soon release World Energy Outlook 2016, which will highlight the various pathways to reach these targets. The report this year looks at individual country pledges and examines how close or far nations are from reaching these goals. It outlines a course that would limit the rise in global temperature to below 2C and, for the first time, it also plots possible pathways for meeting the much more ambitious 1.5C goal. Lets not underestimate the task ahead, said Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA. Limiting carbon emissions and changing our energy systems is a monumental challenge. But the IEA is working with governments around the world to help identify solutions and show how it can be done. The Paris Agreement will transform the global energy system for decades to come. WEO-2016 will examine how a post-Paris world redefines the idea of energy security, particularly in the power sector, the frontline in the fight against climate change. WEO-2016 offers the most comprehensive analysis of what this transformation of the energy sector might look like, thanks to its energy projections to 2040. It reviews the key opportunities and challenges ahead for renewable energy, the central pillar of the low-carbon energy transition, as well as the critical role for energy efficiency.

Sensing that Trump might sign an executive order that would unwind Obama's climate policies, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Erik Solheim has previously said that ""even if the US pulls out of the Paris Agreement, we will bank on India, China and the European Union for the success of the accord"". Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order rolling back Obama-era rules aimed at tackling global warming. The order seeks to suspend, rescind or flag for review more than a half-dozen measures in an effort to boost domestic energy production from fossil fuels. As part of the roll-back, Trump will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plan, which was aimed at restricting greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, among other things like considering the cost of carbon in all federal decision making. The regulation, which was the former president's signature effort to curb carbon emissions, has been the subject of long-running legal challenges by Republican-led states and those who profit from burning oil, coal and gas. Reacting to Trump's order, Gore, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, said: ""Today's executive order, directing the Environmental Protection Agency to begin rolling back environmental protections and policies, including the Clean Power Plan, is a misguided step away from a sustainable, carbon-free future for ourselves and generations to come."" ""It is essential, not only to our planet, but also to our economic future, that the United States continues to serve as a global leader in solving the climate crisis by transitioning to clean energy,"" he said in a statement. ""Should this see the light of day, it will hurt the vast majority of Americans as it will propel the economy backwards so that it resembles something from the 19th century,"" she said. Even so, Tubiana was optimistic. ""The good news is that it will take much more than today's order to stop domestic climate action in the US - indeed, this document is likely to spend years in court."" British charity Christian Aid described Trump's order as a ""maliciously irresponsible"" act that will only damage the US' global standing. ""The proposed executive order by Donald Trump is irresponsible, short-sighted and completely unacceptable,"" Christian Aid's International Climate Lead Mohamed Adow said in a statement. An optimistic UNEP Head Solheim has said: ""I am optimistic of whatever happens in the White House. India, China and European Union and other major players have decided they will move (go ahead). They are long past from the point of return. The idea is now to provide global leadership. Solheim told IANS in an interview during a visit here on March 9 that the US private sector will also participate in the efforts to climate change. The private sector also will move whatever happens in the White House. Companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft will participate. Also, companies like WalMart will do it for customers and for their own benefit,"" Solheim maintained. At the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change talks ( COP22 ) in Marrakech in Morocco last November, 197 nations, including the US, reaffirmed their political commitment to a global climate momentum that they say is ""urgent"" and ""irreversible"". ""We call for the highest political commitment to combat climate change, as a matter of urgent priority,"" 197 parties to the UN's climate convention stated in the Marrakech Action Proclamation, issued on the penultimate day of the talks on November 17. Our climate is warming at an alarming and unprecedented rate, and we have an urgent duty to respond,"" it said.

Minister Rattenbury said that during a time where the Australian Federal Government is dragging its heels on climate action, and many are worried about the future Trump Administration, now more than ever cities, states and territories like the ACT must lead the way with ambitious climate action. I hope that the pioneering work the ACT has done will be taken up and mirrored by other cities and jurisdictions across the country and the world who can see from our success that a renewable energy powered future is possible, Minister Rattenbury said. The Davids are showing the Goliaths how it is done. We cannot wait for the Prime Minister of Australia, or the President of the United States to decide that the long term interests of our communities, our economy, our Pacific neighbours or our environment are more important that the interests of the coal lobby. Having recently returned from the Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco I was inspired by the strong action that cities are taking on climate change around the world, and the keen interest that businesses and regions showed in the ACTs plan to reach100 per cent renewable electricity by the year 2020.

"COP22","India","COP22_India428","Issues in financing climate resilience","January 20, 2017 Friday","Business Line","Mumbai, Jan. 20 -- Despite the progress made on several technical fronts at the UN's climate summit in Marrakesh ( COP22 ) last November, a deadlock persists over climate finance which, despite several international commitments remains marginal to global capital flows. Urgent action is needed not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to help countries become resilient to adverse climate change impacts. Developed countries, however, are fiscally constrained and momentum is gathering around the need to mobilise private and institutional finance in meeting the commitment of $100 billion a year for adaptation and resilience in the developing world. The World Bank estimates that some $158 trillion worth assets - double the total output of global economy - could be in jeopardy without preventable action. Understanding climate risks therefore is vital to ensure capital is allocated efficiently and optimally. Ground report Many actions to improve climate resilience take place within local markets where there is a supply and demand for products and solutions that protect assets from climate risks - such as water-efficient irrigation technologies, storm resilient building materials, water harvesting services, flood control, climate resilient crops and seeds. However, these private transactions are rarely accounted for under labels such as ""climate resilience"" or ""climate adaptation."" Nor are the local financial markets, in developing countries, deep and robust enough to offer a broad range of financial instruments and products to support these transactions, leading to their imminent failure in securing viability-gap funding either from governments, or multilateral development banks. As much of these market activities related to climate resilience remains ""hidden in plain sight"", products and solutions that help assets to adapt to climate risks, remain largely unrecognised. Beyond the obvious What is needed is a deeper understanding of the benefits offered by climate resilience to better inform business decisions regarding climate risk transfer schemes such as insurance. No industry has done more analysis on the issue of climate-related risks than the insurance sector, and promising models such as parametric insurance schemes are being piloted across the globe. But insurance against climate risks is prohibitively costly, unavailable or likely to disappear without a strong government support. Here the Government should intervene in facilitating privately-funded risk mitigation activities by establishing sound regulatory framework, and market- enabling policies. Such regulations should help ensure solvency, while facilitating licensing, product innovation and reinsurance placement and international risk pooling and diversification. In addition, public vehicles can be efficiently designed to allow the private sector to insure a large portion of risk, while leaving only a residual risk (in very extreme circumstances) to public sector funding. Projects to adapt to climate change rarely offer a clear rate of return due to high upfront cost, a longer gestation period capacity constraints and technological limitations. Due attention should be given for improving capacity for bankable project development, implementation and monitoring, and evolving commonly acceptable technical standards. The financial sector globally needs to develop markets for instruments to invest in resilience main streamed projects. Instruments such as catastrophe risk insurance, contingency fund, disaster-relief fund, restoration fund, contingent credit at preferential rate, micro-credits; climate bond, social protection-bond need to be soundly designed and rightly targeted to beneficiaries' needs. Where change is needed Even for the Indian State governments climate finance is evolving as an important avenue to finance their climate change action plan. However, climate finance, in its current form, is just the cumulative costs of projects identified under this plan, whereas technically it refers to the incremental cost of 'climate proofing' of the investment that takes into account potential climate risks and, the costs of making the infrastructure more resilient to such risks. Thus an analytical framework is necessary to combine potential climate risks with a systematic cost-benefit analysis which can help decision-makers prioritise adaptation measures. Favourable policy and institutional actions are important preconditions for successful introduction or scaling up of financial instruments. Such actions, through public-private partnership, can help tackle the underlying drivers of inadequate insurance, especially lack of risk awareness or experience with risk management products and practices; unaffordability, especially among lower-income households or small enterprises; and fundamental limits to insurability. Continued and careful use of donor support, such as for the initial capitalisation of risk pools may also be necessary to accelerate the closing of coverage and preparedness gaps. Policy actions need to focus on how the Government can encourage financiers and investor to 'take the long-term view' on climate financing by harnessing the public balance sheet, market incentives, blended finance, environmental legislation, market coherence, encouraging cultural transformation and, enhanced information flows among the stakeholders. Majority of the capital intensive items in the State climate plans are mixed actions and contribute to conventional development activities. Examples include agricultural research and extension, irrigation, forestry conservation and urban infrastructure. So, a complementarity between climate finance and conventional development funding will have dual benefits, firstly by improving the quality of proposals for securing international funds and, secondly helping in better bargaining for the share of the State budget as the State budgeting process will assign higher priority to development actions that also deliver climate resilience.

"COP22","India","COP22_India429","Morocco : For renewable energy, Morocco leads the way in Africa","December 7, 2016 Wednesday","TendersInfo","In the field of renewable energy, Morocco leads the way for Africa. During last year, the country imposed a ban on plastic bags, initiated plans to extend tram networks, launched Africas first city cycle hire scheme and has also begun with the process to replace its fleet of old, high-emission buses and taxis. Marrakech also served as the host of the COP22 climate change conference and was keen to make it the African COP. Morocco with no fossil fuel reserves is almost totally reliant on imports. In 2015 King Mohammed VI committed the country to raise its share of renewable electricity generation to 52% by 2030. The country plans installation of 10 gigawatts of new renewable energy sources with 14% of that coming from solar, the rest from wind and hydro-dams. Moroccos Intended Nationally Determined Contribution plan is equally ambitious and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions mainly in agriculture by 32% by 2030. Additionally, Morocco remains committed to plant 200,000 hectares of forest and greatly increasing irrigation. However, this commitment depends upon accessing climate financing, but translates to a cumulative reduction of 401 megatonnes of C02 over the period 2020-30. Facilitating renewable sector, Morocco opened the Noor solar complex in February 2016, which uses, in place of photovoltaic solar panels, concentrated solar power technology (CSP) where giant mirrors are placed to reflect the suns rays on to tubes containing liquid which is super-heated to drive turbines. Even, Morocco has carried out investment in wind. In the month of March, a consortium of Enel Green Power, Nareva (owned by King Mohammed VIs investment company) and Siemens received a bid for construction of five new wind farms at different sites across Morocco. The total capacity of these new wind farms will be 850MW, which facilitates the country in achieving its goal for 2020. Also, Noor Two, close to the site of Noor One, is being constructed at present, which will use the same CSP technology, but on a bigger scale with the hope of storing electricity for seven hours. However, as per plans Noor Three will make use of a new variant on CSP technology the solar tower, where the mirrors are directed at a central point. \"

COP 22 on Friday, Saudi Arabias Chief Climate Negotiator, Khalid Abuleif, said that the region is going to see a lot of challenges from an ecosystem point of view and from a socio-economic point of view. The challenge is not only about reducing gas emissions but also about raising our resilience. Abuleif stressed that as Saudi Arabia is diversifying its economy, any new sector will be put under regulations that will address sustainability and climate resilience. He added that his country is focusing especially on water management, making sure we are using water in a sustainable manner, and on the protection of coastal zones. Tunisia has announced a 41 per cent emission reduction by 2030. Most importantly, 13 per cent will be based on national efforts, while the rest will come from support provided by the international community. A week after COP 22 concludes, Tunisia will host an international investment conference (29-30 November) to mobilize $2.4 billion dollars, 40 per cent of which will be allocated to projects pertaining to the green economy, with a focus on renewable energy. In Morocco, to meet the countrys commitments on climate action, the Bank Al Maghrib (Central Bank of Morocco) recently unveiled the road map of the Moroccan financial sector in climate financing. That country has also taken steps to adapt its agriculture, with better water management and more climate-resistant crops, while also lowering its emissions by eliminating most energy subsidies and with the construction of the large solar plant in Ouarzazate, World Bank senior official Hafez Ghanem noted. This is the kind of comprehensive climate action we will support across the region, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, he added. The World Bank Group announced on Tuesday a new plan to ramp up support for countries in the MENA region by nearly doubling the portion of Bank financing dedicated to climate action, taking it to around $1.5 billion dollars per year by 2020. The plan focuses on four priorities: food and water security; sustainable cities adapted to new climate conditions; the transition to low-carbon energy; and the protection of the poorest that are most exposed to the impacts of climate change. The current Conference follows the adoption by 196 UNFCCC States Parties last December, of the Paris Agreement, so-named after the French capital where it was approved, which aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since 7 November. Before the meeting wraps up on Saturday, 18 November, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action.

"COP22","India","COP22_India433","Why the US should quit the Paris Agreement","November 30, 2016 Wednesday","Down To Earth","India, Nov. 30 -- The main story emerging from the 22nd Conference of Parties ( CoP22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Marrakech is that the countries have agreed to frame the rulebook of the Paris Agreement by 2018-a full two years before the provisions of the agreement kick in. But the real story is the disquiet about the future of international climate negotiations post Donald Trump's election as the US President. I was in Marrakech for the last week of CoP22 and the discussions at Bab Ighli village-the venue of the conference-were all about the Trump presidency and the chances of American withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. There were two strands of narrative on Trump and the US withdrawal-one was straightforward while the other was a spin-doctored version of reality. The straightforward narrative centred on speculation on how quickly and in what manner will Trump withdraw, and the implications of this withdrawal on the climate treaty. Within the climate change networks, legal documents were exchanged about the possible route that Trump would take to leave the agreement. Reports were being circulated on the impact of the US withdrawal on the funding of the UN Secretariat which organises these meetings. There were discussions on the fate of the Green Climate Fund and the proverbial mirage of billions of dollars that the developed countries promised to pay to the developing countries to combat climate change in Paris last year. Then there was the spin-doctored version. Led by some US-based non-profits, academics and their supporters, this narrative suggested that the US withdrawal was not that important. They claimed that even without Trump, industry along with a few ""climate-friendly"" cities and states would ensure significant climate mitigation action in the US. They were assuring everyone that the Paris Agreement would be alive and kicking even without the US. But these arguments are hollow and misleading. The following facts show the disconnect between US presidential candidates and the reality of climate change: The US currently produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, more gas than Russia and more coal than India. And a Trump presidency would ensure that the fossil fuel production and consumption in the US will only go up. This will end Obama's Clean Power Plan and with this, the US commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. It is important to understand that this commitment itself was insufficient. On a 1990 baseline, the US would have reduced emissions by a mere 13-15 per cent by 2025. Let us now consider the argument that even if the US withdraws, it would have little effect on the Paris Agreement. The facts tell a different story: In a nutshell, without the US the Paris Agreement, as it stands today, is as good as dead. So, what is the way ahead? Should we try to convince Trump to remain with the Paris Agreement (as UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon and many other leaders have reportedly alluded to) or should we allow him to leave? Whether the US stays or leaves, Trump's presidency would be extremely destructive to the agreement. For instance, he may not provide the funds pledged. He may go back on the US commitment to cut emissions. He may demand disproportionate contributions from developing countries or demand a change in rules to suit US businesses. This would slowly finish the Paris Agreement and even the UNFCCC. At a time when 2016 has been declared as the hottest year on record (with the global temperature about 1.2degC above the pre-industrial era) and there is a huge mitigation gap to meet the 2degC target, we need countries to cut more emissions and quickly. And we need the US to take leadership in emissions cuts. But Trump's presidency would not allow this to happen. It is in this context that I think it might be better that the US leaves the Paris Agreement. The world has invested too much in these negotiations for the past quarter of a century to be destroyed by a climate change denier who at the maximum would be the US president for the next eight years. Once the US withdraws, countries would have the time to do a reality check vis-a-vis the Paris Agreement. The US withdrawal might strengthen solidarity among the countries. They might like to make agreement stronger and incorporate economic sanctions so that Trump and his likes cannot walk away. They might decide to abrogate the agreement entirely and work on a new one. We can only speculate the reaction of the remaining 194 countries, but what is clear is that the Paris Agreement without Trump is better than the Paris Agreement with Trump. At least we will know who the enemy is! But as the saying goes, those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. During the Kyoto Protocol negotiations, the US under Bill Clinton pushed everybody around and reduced the emissions cut target for the developed countries from 20 per cent to mere 5 per cent. The US argued that the Republican Party and the US Congress would not agree to a treaty with stiff targets and hence a weak Kyoto deal came into existence. Then George Bush came and walked away from the Kyoto Protocol. Obama and his team used the same tactics from Copenhagen onwards to dilute UNFCCC and a weak Paris Agreement was signed. And now, Trump is planning to withdraw from this Agreement as well. We should not let this happen. The international community should never agree on an agreement just for the convenience of one country, even if that country happens to be the most powerful (and polluting) country of the world. We should agree on a climate treaty which is in the best interest of all, especially the poor and the vulnerable communities of the world.

"COP22","India","COP22_India434","United Arab Emirates : Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is the first government organisation in Dubai to establish a 24/7 cyber defence centre, in a....","August 23, 2016 Tuesday","TendersInfo","In April, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), a United Nations body, released its latest Status of the Global Climate report, which detailed the string of climate and weather records that were broken in 2015 worldwide. Given the upward trend weve seen in recent years, its unsurprising that 2015 shattered all previous records, including global temperature records, with exceptional rainfall, devastating droughts, unusual cyclone activity and intense heatwaves around the world. The year 2015 will stand out in the historical record of the global climate in many ways, said WMO experts. These shocking statistics serve as a timely and critical reminder of the sheer scale of destruction climate change is having on our planet and the stark outlook for its future. It is imperative that action is taken now. Finding solutions to these problems is not always clear, particularly when improving energy security and addressing climate change may seem to be two conflicting goals. Countries are challenged with achieving reliable and affordable energy supplies, while at the same time reducing emissions into the atmosphere. In December 2015, a historic agreement to combat climate change was reached at COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. For the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, all 195 country members reached a universal agreement on climate change, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2C. As a member of the UNFCCC, the GCC has pledged to implement a number of green initiatives to drive the global green agenda which include; renewable energy initiatives, R&D in technology, water conservation and energy efficiency improvements. More recently, in April this year, representatives of States from all around the world, visited New York to sign the original text of the Paris agreement on Climate Change which was first adopted at Decembers Conference of the Parties (COP) 2015. Some 171 countries signed the landmark deal, which sets the ambitious goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius; a record number for a new international treaty. The participation of states this time around was truly overwhelming and proved the willingness of parties to commit to common processes which will in turn lead to the agreement at an international level. However, for the agreement to come into force, 55 states need to accept the agreement and those 55 ratifications need to come from States that represent 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This is also against the World Banks estimate that over the next 15 years, the global economy will require $89 trillion in infrastructure investments and $4.1 trillion in incremental investment for the low-carbon transition to keep within the new international sub-2 degrees Celsius goal. Following the landmark Paris COP21 meetings, a further meeting of the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) with the UNFCCC will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November this year, at which many of the top decisions struck in the French capital will be fleshed out into action plans. This includes continued work on the determined commitments for reducing country carbon emissions and an even stronger emphasis on the action plans for regions, cities, businesses and the civil society, where the World Green Economy Summit 2016 will be a key contributing platform. For two years now, Dubai has hosted the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) to continue its steady and forward march aiming to achieve its ambition to become The Global Capital of the Green Economy, facilitate a platform for green leaders to come together to discuss partnerships and develop cleaner and green initiatives to create a sustainable future. This year WGES 2016, under the new theme of Driving the Global Green Economy, will help the region follow up on commitments made through the Dubai Declaration and create strong links to the UN Climate Agreement 2015 and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 following the directions set at COP22 in Marrakech. Dubai is taking major strides to drive the green economy, with a series of initiatives announced over the past 12 months. In November 2015, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, announced the launch of Dubais Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which sets a target for the provision of 7 per cent of Dubais energy from clean energy sources by 2020, increasing to 25 per cent by 2030 and 75 per cent by 2050. To further the regions green economy, DEWA announced in January 2016 that it has opened consultancy tenders for a Dh100 billion green fund the Dubai Green Fund. As part of the regions wider green energy investment programme, the Dubai Green Fund will provide financing for investors in Dubais clean energy, and affirms the Emirates commitment towards pioneering green initiatives and sustainability. In addition to the Green Fund, Dubais Clean Energy Strategy 2050 will also see the planned capacity of Dubais Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park upgraded to 5,000 megawatts from 3,000MW previously. The Solar Park, which is the largest single-site strategic renewable energy project of its kind in the world, is a testament to the regions commitment to building and developing a greener economy, to achieve the UAE Vision 2021 of a truly sustainable environment with the lowest carbon footprint in the world. We are very proud of the UAEs achievements. We have accomplished significant success in photovoltaic energy. Energy, sustainability and new sources of power are all themes that are on the global agenda, as the world faces growing challenges with fluctuating oil prices. We have identified sustainability as a key theme in our upcoming Dubai Expo 2020 in recognising the undisputable fact that all economies have to focus on green strategies. \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India435","Morocco,United Kingdom : Developing sustainable value chains in Morocco","April 22, 2017 Saturday","TendersInfo","Agriculture contributes significantly to Moroccos economy and employs 40 per cent of the countrys workforce. But the sector continues to face major challenges and important steps need to be taken to make it more sustainable. Working with the private sector to pave the way is key. With this in mind, the International Center for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) organised a forum on sustainable value chains on 20 April 2017, in partnership with the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forests. The forum gathered participants from all segments of the value chain agribusinesses, producers associations, financial institutions to examine opportunities for improving the economic, social and environmental sustainability of Moroccos agrifood sector. Held in Meknes, the forum capitalised on the ever-increasing audience of the Salon International de lAgriculture au Maroc of which the 12th edition is held under the theme ""agribusiness and sustainable value chains"". The exhibition has now become one of the largest international fairs in Africa and in the world, bringing together more than 1,220 companies and attracting over one million visitors. The forum also built on the achievements of the governments Green Morocco Plan (PMV) and the role that Moroccan producers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), large agribusiness companies and policy-makers play in making the sector more dynamic and sustainable. In his opening speech on behalf of the Minister, Mohamed Sadiki, General Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forests, said: Interaction with the private sector has been the backbone of the PMV since its inception. Aggregation, which is one of the foundations of the Plan, is an innovative model for organising farmers around private actors or professional organisations with a strong managerial capacity. It is a win-win partnership between the productive upstream and the commercial and industrial downstream, which helps overcome land fragmentation and enables farmers to access modern production techniques, finance and markets. Agribusiness leading the way Private sector companies in Morocco have already started taking concrete steps towards more inclusive and environmentally friendly business models. For example, Lesieur Cristal, a leading vegetable oil company, invested in two biomass boilers to produce steam from olive waste and managed to reduce its fuel consumption by up to 40 per cent. Another example is Frulact, a major international player in fruit preparations for the food industry and present in Morocco for 10 years. It has created significant value in the Larache region by sustainably sourcing strawberries from local farmers and processing them locally into high value-added fruit preparations for yoghurt and other dairy products for the domestic and export markets. In Casablanca, Maghreb Industries, a leading Moroccan confectionery producer, provides a good example of concrete actions in the use of renewable energies: the company built a modern, energy-efficient facility that is powered by a 1.4 megawatt rooftop solar plant, one of the first of its size in Morocco. These are just some of the many examples that can be replicated in the country. Working together along the value chain The event also focused on interprofessional organisations and how they can support a more inclusive and efficient agriculture sector by fostering a common vision among value chain players and working to improve essential services. The promotion of public-private dialogue and cooperation between value chain players is essential for a stronger and more productive agriculture sector in Morocco. In this context, inter-professional organisations play an essential role by promoting a unified vision of the sectors development. They can combine the efforts of all operators in key areas such as research, extension and technology transfer, interact with public authorities on sectoral policies and offer shared services to their members, said Michael George Hage, FAO representative in Morocco. Among the many interprofessional and professional organisations supported by FAO in Morocco, Interprolive, an interprofessional organisation involving all of Moroccos major private sector players for table olives and olive oil from production to marketing is already moving quickly to promote and defend the interests of the olive sector in Morocco. Among other initiatives, the organisation has launched an advertising campaign to encourage consumers to buy olive oil in bottles rather than in bulk, and has started a series of technical trainings to help members improve productivity in olive production. First we have focused on organising ourselves better and ensuring good representation of the players all along the value chain. With the signature of a Contrat programme with the government we have been able to start providing services to our members, such as technical assistance and communication strategies to increase consumer awareness. We have also been collaborating with FAO and the EBRD on olive oil quality systems and productivity along the supply chain, said Rachid Benali, President of Interprolive. Disseminating climate knowledge Climate change is affecting Moroccos agriculture, with lower-than-average rainfall and increasing drought and groundwater depletion. Adapting Moroccos agriculture to climate change while also enhancing the sectors ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was debated at length during the COP22 global climate talks in Morocco in November 2016. \"

The European Energy Efficiency Mortgage initiative, launched today by a consortium led by the European Mortgage Federation European Covered Bond Council (EMF-ECBC) aims to create a standardised energy efficient mortgage based on preferential interest rates for energy efficient homes and/or additional funds for retrofitting homes at the time of purchase. The project represents the first time a group of major banks and mortgage lenders, as well as businesses and organisations from the building and energy industries have come together to address the concept of energy efficient mortgages. The project partners are the CaFoscari University of Venice, RICS, European Regional Network of Green Building Councils, E.ON, and SAFE Goethe University Frankfurt. Creating a private bank financing mechanism to encourage the energy efficient improvement of households is a key means of helping the EU to meet its energy saving target of 20% by 2020, and to deliver on the ambition of the historic climate change deal, known as the Paris Agreement, which was reached at COP21 last December. It is also particularly timely given the growing global institutional and investor interest in climate finance and private sector investment required to fund low carbon initiatives, which will be the main focus of COP22 , the next major climate change conference which takes place in Marrakech in November. The European Energy Efficiency Mortgage initiative is significant in that it will explore the link between energy efficiency and borrowers reduced probability of default and the increase in value of energy efficient properties. For banks and investors, this could lead to loans which represent a lower risk on the balance sheet and could therefore qualify for a better capital treatment. It could also ensure that banks are able to recognise energy efficient assets in their risk profiling, which would begin to help the market to price-in the added value of energy efficient real estate. The initiative is launched today at the World Green Building Councils BUILD UPON Leaders Summit in Madrid, where 200 renovation leaders are gathering to discuss how to tackle energy efficiency in Europes existing buildings. \"

In a statement, PIDF Secretary-General Francois Martel said he was extremely concerned at the low level of ratification of the Paris Agreement to date, with only 22 countries and 1.0 percent of emissions. ""The report confirms our worst fears that time is not on our side and that projections on climate impacts were very much underestimated. ""This is why Pacific leaders need to remain vigilant and champion the ratification and implementation of the Paris agreement globally,"" said Martel. The report released online by the American Meteorological Society also enclosed on how important it is for Pacific leaders to continue their advocacy for climate action at COP22 and beyond. Martel added Pacific nations together represent nearly one-fifth of the planet and this would send a strong message to the rest of the world if such a treaty could be agreed upon and ratified by the most vulnerable nations on Earth. ""Pacific leaders did it before to pledge allegiance against nuclear arms so we should now look at fossil fuels in the same light. ""This report for the Pacific reminds us of the urgency and confirms that climate induced impacts will destroy our nations. The Pacific Islands should continue to be at the forefront of that battle,"" he said. 'Broke records' The report also confirmed that 2015 surpassed 2014 as the warmest year since the mid-to-late 19th century. Climate indicators in the report show patterns, changes, and trends of the global climate system, several markers such as land and ocean temperatures, sea levels and greenhouse gases broke records set just one year prior. Last year's record heat resulted from the combined influence of long-term global warming and one of the strongestEl Nio events the globe has experienced since at least 1950. Furthermore a Guardianarticle published this month stated that limiting globaltemperatures to below the 1.5 degree target, negotiated in Paris last year, and measured in relation to pre-industrial temperatures, would be extremely difficult. The article published figures based on Met Office data by meteorologist Ed Hawkins of Reading Universitythat showed the average global temperatures have been more than one degree above pre-industrial levels for every month except one this year. ]] \"
"COP22","India","COP22_India440","To Build The 170 Mw Noor Pv I Program","November 25, 2016 Friday","TendersInfo - Contract Awards","Contract Awarded to build the 170 MW NOOR PV I Program in Morocco, which, upon completion, will be one of the largest solar PV complexes in North Africa. A consortium led by ACWA Power won the rights to develop the NOOR plant, and has contracted the worlds largest EPC company, Sterling and Wilson, to construct it. The NOOR PV I Program will actually be made up of three different projects, including the 80 MW NOOR Laayoune, the 70 MW NOOR Ouarzazate IV, and the 20 MW NOOR Boujdour. Once completed, it will be one of the largest PV constructions in North Africa. These projects have been won after an intense competitive bidding process, commented Renewable and Electric President Bikesh Ogra. Morocco has been one of our most important target markets and these projects would hopefully enable us to consolidate our positioning for all forthcoming opportunities in the country and the region as a whole. The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (Masen) has issued green bonds in the amount of 1.15 billion dirhams (USD 118 million) for the project, and will also fund the plants. The green bonds mature on 15 December 2019 and have a semi-annual fixed rate. The agreement between Sterling and Wilson and ACWA Power was signed at COP22 , which was hosted in Moroccos capital city, Marrakech, earlier in the month. Sterling and Wilson is planning to begin construction on the project soon, which is expected to take a total of 12 months, while the company is also planning on training local workers on the specialized nature of solar plant developed. We will work earnestly towards embracing socially and economically inclusive equitable work methods, skills development and employment for the local community in order to achieve best standards in performance, and a belief in contributing to a reliable and sustainable energy supply. It is a good time for solar developers to start looking at the North African nation, as it is embracing renewable deployment. In fact, it set an ambitious target of having renewable energies make up 52% of its energy mix by 2030. AWARDED : November, 2016 Contractor name : STERLING AND WILSON PVT. LTD.

"COP22","India","COP22_India441","India lauded for efforts to combat climate change","November 10, 2016 Thursday","Meghalaya Times (India)","SHILLONG, Nov. 10 -- India's efforts to combat climate change won the country international acclaim on Thursday as international bodies remarking that the rapid growth in renewable energy, combined with sustained reduction in coal imports and increasing challenges to the viability of new coal-fire power plant construction - with ultra mega coal projects cancelled, gives an indication of the transformation that is beginning in India. ""With every sign that China is now beginning to reduce its coal and carbon dioxide emission, developments in India are amongst the most important underway globally"", said the CEO of Climate Analytics and senior scientist, Bill Hare. Climate Analytics is a non-profit organisation based in Berlin, Germany, with offices in Lome, Togo and New York, USA, that brings together inter-disciplinary expertise in the scientific and policy aspects of climate change. International organisations at COP22 says that one year after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, national climate policies have made little progress, and the road ahead looks even less clear after the results of the US presidents elections. Climate Action Tracker (CAT) estimates that if governments were to fully implement their NDC global warming in 2100 of 2.8 degree Celsius above pre-industrial would result i.e there is a likely chance of holding warming below 3.1 degree Celsius. ""India could have been expected to increase its coal fired power use for decades. However, there appears to be a transition underway with an extremely rapid growth in renewable energy installations, which has begun to displace planned coal at a scale that has surprised many analysts"", said Professor Niklas Hohne, of New Climate Institute. As of December 2015, India's total installed capacity based on renewable energy was 37,415 MW. This is about 13% of the total installed capacity for power generation in the country. The country is expected to generate 175 GW of power via renewable sources by the year 2022, out of which 100 GW will be from solar energy, 60 GW from wind energy, 10 GW from bio energy and 5 GW from small hydro power projects. ""India is already set to overachieve its emissions intensity target. The likely continued expansion of renewables after 2022, for which no targets have yet been set, would result in India overshooting its 2030 non-fossil capacity target"", Hohne added.

"COP22","India","COP22_India442","EBRD joins NDC partnership to help deliver Paris climate goals","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","Pivotal Sources","Morocco, Nov. 15 -- The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has joined the NDC Partnership which has been set up to help deliver the global climate pledges of the Paris Agreement. The NDC Partnership is a coalition of developing and developed countries and international institutions working together to ensure countries receive the technical and financial support they need to achieve climate and sustainable development goals as fast and effectively as possible. The NDCs were the Nationally Determined Contributions of individual countries, the pledges on climate change that they made as they signed up to the Paris Agreement. The NDC Partnership was launched on 15 November during the United Nations COP22 climate conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, the follow-up meeting to the 2015 event which delivered the Paris accord. ""This is a key step in translating the Paris Agreement into action and results on the ground. Through its Green Economy Transition approach the EBRD will contribute its technical, policy and financing capacity to help its countries of operations develop and achieve their NDCs,"" said Josue Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change. Much of the discussion in Marrakesh - dubbed the Implementation COP - has centred on ways of putting into practice the Paris vision of a sustained worldwide effort to tackle global warming. As its contribution to the Paris Agreement, the EBRD unveiled a Green Economy Transition approach which aims to increase the share of the EBRD's annual investments to 40 per cent by 2020. This will accelerate the pace of climate finance provided by the EBRD, which over the last 10 years has invested over &#8364;21 billion in some 1,160 green energy projects worth a total of more than &#8364;112 billion. Through its Sustainable Energy Financing Facilities (SEFFs) the Bank delivers green energy projects via the banking systems of some 24 EBRD countries of operations. In addition, through its FINTECC (Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change) programme, the EBRD helps to promote the transfer of climate technology to developing countries and countries in transition, providing both finance and technical support.

American exit from COP will create a financial crisis for a certain period, but the other signatory parties will share to fill the gap.The least developing countries are counting the financial losses for environmental damages.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh20","Compensating loss and damage for climate change impacts","December 12, 2017 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 12 -- In the word of climate change negotiations, loss and damage is arguably one of the most debated issues. In the last COP23 hosted by an island nation, Fiji (largely affected by the adverse effects of climate change), the conversation on the issue gathered more attention than ever.Although a universally accepted concept of Loss and Damage does not exist; the term can be defined as the negative effects of climate variability and climate change that people have not been able to cope with or adapt to. ""Loss' refers to the complete loss of lives or species etc; while 'damage' is something that can be repaired such as infrastructures. The main idea is that the countries which are most vulnerable to climate change are entitled to economic compensation from the polluter countries.For a Least Developed country like Bangladesh, climate change can pose serious pressure for its development progress. Even though Bangladesh emits a small amount of carbon each year, it is one of the most seriously climate affected countries of the world. Each year we are slowly losing our land to sea level rise. The increased intensity of natural disaster is hard for the country to handle. The impact of climate change is only getting worse. In 2017, Bangladesh saw one of the biggest floods in its history. The number of tropical storms has also increased in past years. In an opinion piece, Dr. Saleemul Haque said, ""When residents in the coastal district of Satkhira in Bangladesh were asked a decade ago, only 2 per cent of them said increased salinity caused by sea level rise was having an adverse effect on crop yields, livelihoods and their health. Today, over 80 per cent say they are affected."" In this reality, it is imperative that we as a country rightfully demand support for facing the adverse impact of climate change.""Loss and damage"" has a long history of being neglected. Only in 2010, the words ""loss and damage"" appeared for the first time in the negotiating text of COP 16. Progress was made when in Warsaw COP 19, loss and damage got fully institutionalised into the UNFCCC through the ""Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM)"". However the progress since then has been slow. Even though ""loss and damage"" was mentioned in Article 8 of the Paris agreement, there was no provision for financial compensation. In 2016, the countries decided to work on a five-year-plan to address the slow onset impacts and migration. However, the financial part remained evasive.At COP 23COP 23, saying that there is ""insufficient statistical evidence"" that extreme weather events such as typhoons are singularly caused by climate change. Switzerland and USA are also strongly opposed to loss and damage discussion.But for countries like Bangladesh, the issue of loss and damage is an all important one. The compensation from the loss and damage can go a long way in combating climate change. In order to achieve that, we need to focus on scientific research that will support our demand at the global level. Technological support is just as important as financial support for countries like Bangladesh. Thus pressing for that is also as important as talking about compensation.Luckily, there is solidarity among major parties of the climate change negotiation regarding ""loss and damage"". The Least Developed Countries and Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) are advocating that ""loss and damage"" can be a separate agenda of its own, with the WIM being a permanent body within the convention. The G77+China group has also adopted the same position as them. They are also advocating about introducing innovative forms of finance to fund loss and damage. Bangladesh is known all over the world as a leader of climate change negotiations. Thus, Bangladesh needs to raise its voice on this issue and ask for fulfilling its rightful demands to support its efforts to combat climate change.Lam-ya Mostaque is a researcher working in the development sector.

The stakeholders of the country are talking about the topics of negotiation. The upcoming COP23 will appear with different context because America, a super power of the accord, might leave the Paris Climate Agreement.Afsan Chowdhury, faculty of BRAC University and journalist, had attended the COP conference and worked with several environment related projects, talked with the Energy and Power Magazine on COP23.He thought Bangladesh has a little space to discuss the issues directly because the country is included in the LDC group. So, Bangladesh will take part in group wise discussion. The country has no opportunity to discuss any of issues individually. They will just attend the conference.Nonetheless, the Bangladesh delegation is not eligible to present itself boldly and strongly. The relevant ministry has no proper preparation for COP. They are not sound at international diplomatic level. The officials, who are going to join to COP, have to understand that it is a political arena. So, all issues will be discussed based on politics.Moreover, the government has no policy to build up skilled manpower to negotiate our issues boldly and smartly in the conference. Officials don\' t know what should be discussed and what is not. The platform is for discussing scientific issues, so the officials should have political, diplomatic, scientific knowledge as well. Prof Afsan has doubt about the capacities and skills of the participants.The issues discussed in COP22 have not been implemented yet and Bangladesh was not attentive to implement the issues at all.The world leaders can avoid Bangladesh easily. They are not much interested about Bangladeshi environmental issues. None of the leaders is fighting for Bangladesh.Additionally, nowadays the climate projects are considered as a source of income. To mitigate the climate impacts, the government should work on the field.American exit from Paris Agreement will create an uncertainty because America takes responsibility. So, now it is a big issue to be worried. Due to economic pressure on America, Trump left the deal. And none will be willing to take the responsibility, not even China, which may create pressure on the economy.Besides, success of COP is not a short term issue. It will take more than 100 years. The world leaders should emphasis to come out of smoke industries to cut emission.\l"

This is part of a long-term warming trend,' said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.'We've witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa.Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities,' he said.'There is unprecedented and very welcome momentum among governments, but also cities, states, territories, regions, business and civil society. Bonn 2017 needs to be the launch pad towards the next, higher level of ambition by all nations and all sectors of society as we look to de-risk the future and maximize the opportunities from a fresh, forward-looking and sustainable development path,' she added.A review of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) found that, in developing countries, agriculture (crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry) accounted for 26 percent of all the damage and loss associated with medium to large-scale storms, floods and drought.Between 2000 and 2016, the number of vulnerable people exposed to heatwave events has increased by approximately 125 million.In 2016, 23.5 million people were displaced during weather-related disasters. Consistent with previous years, the majority of these internal displacements were associated with floods or storms and occurred in the Asia-Pacific region.The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook indicates that adverse consequences are concentrated in countries with relatively hot climates and which are home to close to 60 percent of current global population.Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were affected by monsoonal flooding, despite overall seasonal rainfall being near average.The most serious flooding occurred in mid-August in eastern Nepal, northern Bangladesh and nearby northern India.Mawsynram (India) received more than 1 400 mm from 9 to 12 August. Rangpur (Bangladesh) received a month's worth of rain (360 mm) on 11-12 August.More than 1 200 deaths were reported in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, while more than 40 million people were displaced or otherwise affected.The World Health Organization indicated that in Bangladesh alone, more than 13 000 cases of waterborne diseases and respiratory infections were reported during three weeks in August, whilst extensive damage was reported to public health facilities in Nepal.\l"

Deputy Minister for Environment and Forests Abdullah Al Islam Jakob, Environment and Forest Secretary Istiaq Ahmed and officials concerned were present, among others, at the press conference.Manju said various milestone initiatives have been taken in the country, including making Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), 2009, Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) and Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) and Climate Change Trust Act-2010, to enhance capacity on the climate change issue. He said the Paris accord requires all countries to devise plans to achieve the goal of keeping the rise in temperature within two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial levels and strive for 1.5 C if possible.The Least Developed Countries (LDCs) must be united by developing strong leadership to pile up pressure on the industrialized nations to take actions to stem the planet's rising temperature, he added. Manju said, 'Paris agreement should be legally binding One powerful country that has withdrawn its name from the campaign to fight global change is largely responsible for carbon emission. Leading carbon emitting countries must follow international agreements to save the planet from the adverse impact of climate change.'Bangladesh alone cannot tackle the climate change issue as it is a global phenomenon, Manju said adding it should move bilaterally as well as multilaterally with strong bargaining capacity to exert pressure on the rich nations to make them extend financial and technical supports to the climate vulnerable countries. Despite negative attitude of the developed countries on the global climate change issue, he said, it is urgent for the vulnerable countries, including Bangladesh, to participate in such global conferences to pile up pressure on them. Jakob said Bangladesh is already witnessing negative impacts of global climate change and this year's April was the most rainfall month in the past 45 years.If the current trend of sea level rising continues, millions of people in the southern parts of the country will be displaced, he added.

Since that December 2015, we all have seen countless pictures of utterly devastating floods, wildfires, hurricanes happening more and more frequently all over our planet mainly affecting the poorest among us.The pictures may appear remote to our own lives when we look at them in the safety of our houses on our screens. They are often a mere flash in the evening news. They may give rise to a family discussion, for others they induce anxiety, but none of the pictures can ever fully convey the utter devastation affected families are left with, the suffering of children left orphaned, the despondency of adolescents not seeing a future, the broken elderly person left without hope.Whilst in Bonn this week for COP23, which is scheduled to conclude November 17, I have two words at the forefront of my mind. One is a word from my own culture ' talanoa ', the Pacific Islands' word for dialogue. The other word is urgency. This for me is not yet another meeting, yet another travel, yet another series of talks.I grew up as an islander and my child has grown up an islander. The word urgency for us is a word full of action, doing and 'talanoa' brings people together to talk.As the representative of the UN Secretary- General for the world's poorest and most vulnerable 91 countries, which make up more than one billion people on our shared planet, I am in Bonn for the 23rd conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.Whilst here I am advocating for the world's poorest and most challenged countries and above all expecting to get down to the nuts and bolts of taking urgent action. And urgent it is as commitments are already faltering and yet the times have never been more critical for the world's most vulnerable nations.These 91 diverse countries span our globe, each country faces unique challenges yet all are countries that have one feature in common - they contribute the least to climate change but feel its effects the most. They range from beautiful small islands in remote areas, with fragile ecosystems and rich cultural heritage, to landlocked states in the world's mountain ranges and countries which span the length of Africa's deserts, cities and forests.Who has not marvelled at the picture perfect images of the South Seas, the beautiful mountains of the Himalayas, the imposing gold coloured sandy seas of the world's deserts? It is these countries and their peoples most in need of action , immediate, urgent action.Can we really just continue to marvel on the one hand at the beauty of their nature and then forget how our shared planet's poorest and most vulnerable increasingly suffer the life-threatening effects of climate change? Are we prepared to leave them behind?We live in times where the short-term, the 'obvious' almost appear to be the diktat of action. We live in times where the extremes draw attention.

It remains an open question how loss and damage should be taken up under the Paris Agreement.This year's COP presidency - the archipelago Republic of Fiji - as well as other Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are severely affected by climatic events.Five SIDS, including Haiti (2nd), the Dominican Republic (10th) and Fiji (13th), rank among the 20 countries world-wide most affected by weather-related catastrophes in the past 20 years. Haiti and Fiji rank first and third in the annual index for 2016.Storms and their direct implications - precipitation, floods and landslides - were one major cause of damage in 2016.According to the most recent scientific research, rising sea surface temperatures seem to play a key role in intensifying storms.Most of the affected countries in the Bottom 10 of the long-term index have a high ranking due to exceptional catastrophes.Of the ten most affected countries (1997-2016), nine were developing countries in the low income or lower-middle income country group, while only one was classified as an upper-middle income country.The climate summit in Bonn is continuing the development of the 'rule-book' needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidel"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh37","Climate crisis, de-growth and Bangladesh","December 10, 2017 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 10 -- Climate crisis is now in the forefront of public debate to chart a future for humankind to live in a sustainable planet Earth. Despite last four decades of political discussions about the gravity and the urgency of climate crisis, progress so far remains very patchy not to speak of that there are still many climate sceptics. The 2015 United Nations was held in Paris. Nearly 200 countries joined together to strike a deal on climate change and agreed for the first time to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emission (CO2). This agreement known as the Paris Agreement will come into effect in 2020. The agreement requires all countries, not just industrialised developed countries, to deal with climate change. The goal is very modest, to stabilise global warming below two degrees above pre-industrial levels, if possible even less. Despite the Paris Agreement described as humankind's last chance to respond to climate crisis, the USA, the world's second largest emitter of CO2, has already decided to opt out of it.The predominant climate crisis discourse at least in the developed world is centred around the issue that the crisis is fundamentally ""anthropogenic''; therefore universalising the culpability to ""human being''. So the rising global human population is marked as the principal cause of climate crisis. This is because they use energy by burning fossil fuels, deforest to clear land for crop and meat, even bio-fuel production. But the ""anthropogenic'' argument is fundamentally flawed because it will apportion the responsibility in proportion to the size of global population. We now know that empirical evidence clearly indicates that is not definitely the case.But where is the starting point in this debate? It is well recognised that it is industrial production that has caused a multitude of environmental problems over the last two and a half centuries in general and since the mid-nineteenth century in particular. This resulted in accumulating huge environmental problems which now manifest as a crisis. If not addressed immediately, this crisis can prove to be catastrophic for humankind.Industrial production is inextricably linked to the idea of economic growth which has become a mantra for material progress for humankind for a considerable period of time. That in turn results in rising affluence (at least in industrialised developed countries) leading to increased demand for food, meat and other consumer items such as cars, domestic appliances, holidays, etc. All these make increasing demand on the nature to supply them including fossil fuels. Economic growth has also been seen as a way to alleviate poverty but we now know that one per cent largely benefitted from such growth.What do these people do with such huge accumulated wealth? Conventional economic theory has little to say about this phenomenon. Thorstein Veblen answered that question. He described these super rich as belonging to the ""leisure class'' who strive to gain social recognition by demonstrating - through ""conspicuous consumption'' . Veblen further said that this conspicuous consumption filtered down to the lower and middle classes. He described conspicuous consumption as a waste diverting resources from producing goods people need to producing goods what they can show off. The result is a treadmill of dissatisfaction as they continue to consume more to keep up. Veblen even described ""the captains of industry'' as parasites, only interested in making money and completely ignorant of the industrial processes.In a period of high unemployment, especially youth unemployment and rising poverty in many parts of the world including developed world, growth is considered the key to address these problems. If these economies start to grow again at the same rate as before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the goal to achieve decl"

Environmental groups claim that a number of business participants in these talks are funded by the fossil fuel industries. They demand a strong restriction on their participation. Otherwise, they fear, it will be difficult to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degree or even 2.0 degree Celsius. They allege that some of the giant fossil fuel companies are driven by their corporate greed for profit. Their continued profit making from the environmentally destructive projects, they point out, resulted in environmental crisis in many countries.There is an allegation that the fossil fuel industry influences the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) through its many trade associations. As Business/Industry Non-Governmental Organisations (BINGOs), these associations take part in negotiations and lobby governments. Also, these associations are allowed to act as observers at the UNFCCC.Corporate Accountability International, a Boston-based voluntary organisation, has published a new report which shows the connections between fossil fuel industries and business non-governmental organisations regarding UN climate talks. The report has stated, ""Despite what major fossil fuel corporations may insist about their support for the Paris Agreement, these corporations have consistently used their presence at the UNFCCC to weaken policy rather than strengthen it. Hundreds of BINGOs, many of which have direct links to the industry and its interests, have been granted access to attend UNFCCC negotiations. Under current UNFCCC policies, industry representatives like the World Coal Association, which aggressively promotes a coal-centred agenda, sit in the very rooms where delegates discuss policy options to avert climate disaster.""

On May 09, an in - session workshop on opportunities to further enhance the effective engagement of non-Party stakeholders with a view to strengthening the implementation of the provisions of decision 1/CP. 21 was held there.The issue of conflicting interest among non-party stakeholders was raised in that workshop. The workshop discussed whether or not fossil fuel companies should be allowed to attend the UNFCCC as observers. From the minutes of the workshop, some discussion points related to conflict of interest may be seen below [source: HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resourcehttp://unfccc.int/resourceA panelist and other participants called for a legal framework to enable the better engagement of non-Party stakeholders. This would require the development of a set of rules and principles, as well as procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest. With regard to potential conflicts of interest, some participants called for a process for guaranteeing that all non-Party stakeholders participating in the process are committed to the objectives of the Convention and share a common view on their urgency. Others stressed that more observers joining the UNFCCC process was a positive development, because as many groups as possible will be needed to achieve transformational change on a global level.On conflicts of interest, some participants stressed that enhancing the engagement of non-Party stakeholders must not undermine the legitimacy and integrity of the UNFCCC process. To that end, one group proposed that the UNFCCC process adopt a definition of conflict of interest. The framework for engagement adopted by the World Health Organisation in its efforts on tobacco control was cited as an example. Some participants expressed concern regarding public-private partnerships being viewed as the only driver for climate action. Others countered that businesses and industry play an important role in meeting the climate challenge and all groups will benefit from an open and transparent process. Another speaker noted that excluding groups, such as the private sector, fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of this convention, as the entire negotiating process is about hearing competing views.The discussion also addressed potential conflicts of interest. Some called for a clear process for addressing conflicts of interest and stressed that corporations should not be involved in policy making. Others noted that all sectors should be included and cited the success of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer as an example of positive industry involvement.Part of the debate centred on the need to develop a policy to address conflicts of interest for non-Party stakeholders. Some participants strongly expressed support for this approach, while others stressed the importance of diversity and inclusiveness.The writer has appeared in the Masters of Science in Disaster Management examination, Department of Geography and Environment, University of Dhaka HYPERLINK mailto:sakibimage@gmail.comsakibimage@gmail.comPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Despite having little contribution to global carbon emission, the LDC are bearing the brunt of excessive carbon emissions caused by industrialised nations which are mainly responsible for global warming-- a great threat for the planet. The Paris Accord requires all countries to devise plans to achieve the goal of containing global temperatures within two degree Celsius and strive for 1.5 degree Celsius, if possible.The Least Developed Countries must be united backed to put pressure on industrialised countries to take action to curb the planet's rising temperatures. Bangladesh is already facing adverse impact of global climate change and it is urgent to raise its voice to get adequate support from green climate fund to make it a climate resilient country. Many people across the country have become refugees due to various reasons, including floods, river bank erosions and cyclones. Basically, they are climate change victims. Bangladesh alone can not face climate change as it is a global phenomenon. It should move bilaterally as well as multilaterally along with strong bargaining capacity to build up pressure on advanced countries to extend financial and technical assistance to climate-vulnerable countries.The United Nations has expressed grave concern saying that the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere grew at a record rate in 2016, not experienced ever before-- potentially fuelling a 20-metre rise in sea levels and adding 3 degrees to temperatures.

Basically they are climate change victims.""Bangladesh alone cannot face climate change issue as it is a global phenomenon, he said, adding it should move bilaterally as well as multilaterally along with strong bargaining capacity to pile up pressure on rich nations to extend their financial and technical supports to climate vulnerable countries, he added.\l"

Envoys from nearly 200 country signatories to the Paris Agreement kept a close eye on Washington throughout their 10-day huddle for any signal about President Donald Trump's intentions. On the campaign trail, Trump had threatened to ""cancel"" the hard-fought pact in which his predecessor, Barack Obama, played an instrumental role in dragging it over the finish l"

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh44","Raise Voice for Climate Fund","November 30, 2017 Thursday","Energy & Power","Bangladesh should highlight the need for financing and mitigation measures in the upcoming global climate conference, experts said at a recent seminar. They said rising temperature would cause extreme events like flood, cyclone, and forest fires more frequently than ever, and it was already seen in different parts of the world. As one of the worst victims of climate change, Bangladesh should play an important role in the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP 23), they said. The seminar was organized by Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) in association with Islamic Relief Bangladesh in the capital to identity the role of civil society on COP 23. Speaking on the occasion, environmental scientist A Atiq Rahman warned that global temperature would rise by more than three degrees Celsius by the end of the century although most countries set the target to limit the rise to two degrees Celsius. This rise is triggered by excessive carbon emissions, he said.The atmospheric carbon dioxide has reached 403 parts per million (ppm) this year from 400ppm last year, which is alarming for the climate, said Atiq Rahman, also executive director of BCAS, citing a recent study.\l"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh45","EDITORIAL","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Energy & Power","The 2015 Paris Agreement represents a historic turning point in global cooperation on addressing climate change and its global goal of limiting warming to well below 2\'b0C or 1.5\'b0C provide direction and help to frame climate change action. Through the process of preparing national contributions and their implementation, countries demonstrate that they are increasingly introducing national policies and related instruments for low emission and climate resilient development. Financial support, technology development and transfer as well as capacity-building at scale continue to be urgently needed. Related institutions need strengthening to enable them to plan for and implement adaptation and mitigation in an effective and sustainable fashion. In this backdrop, governments of countries from across the world will gather from November 6-17 in Bonn, Germany for the 23rd annual UN climate change conference (COP 23).\l"

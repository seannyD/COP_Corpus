Environment and Forests Minister Anwar Hossain Manju will deliver his speech at the meeting at 10 pm (Local Time). A guideline will be made during the high-level segment meeting aiming to start the implementation process of Paris Climate Agreement by 2020, said Environment and Forests secretary Ishtiak Ahmed, also part of the Bangladesh delegation here. After discussing for nine days without any break, the participating countries on Tuesday identified three major issues out of total five and issued an informal note in this regard. These issues will be discussed in detail during the next conference in Poland. Meanwhile, after nearly five years of discussion, the member states of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) have reached a consensus on the effect of climate change on agriculture. The 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) started on November 6. The High-level Segment will be held from November 15 to November 16 and the closing session will be held on November 17. \"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh2","COP23: Moving Ahead Sans USA","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Energy & Power","The governments of countries from across the world will gather from November 6-17 in Bonn, Germany for the 23rd annual UN climate change conference ( COP 23 ) amid increasingly visible climate change impacts. Over the course of two weeks, negotiators will attempt to design a set of implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement - a long-term global strategy to address climate change - ahead of a 2018 deadline. Negotiators in Bonn, not far from Germany's largest brown coal mine, will be tasked with hammering out the nitty-gritty details of the Paris Climate Agreement\' s Rulebook. The Rulebook will have to include details on:  the enhanced transparency framework, which is meant to formalize the way countries measure and report their progress towards achieving the climate action goals and the support they provide to developing countries;  the global stocktaking of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, also every five years, that will assess collective progress towards the agreed goals. The Rulebook - which some countries prefer to call Implementation Guidelines because it sounds less binding \- is due to be finalized at the next COP meeting in Poland in 2018. This is required because in 2020 the countries must start submitting their data for the 2023 stocktake, so a set of rules on how this should be done must be in place by then. The summit in Bonn is expected to produce a draft text, which will still be riddled with brackets and multiple options. While much emphasis has been placed on the  well below 2\'b0C global warming target, it is the other landmark achievements in the 2015 treaty that now have to be cast into applicable rules to ensure that the key climate targets are reached. The Pacific island nation of Fiji will be making history as the first-ever small island state to hold the COP presidency. The German government has agreed to provide technical support. Germany will host the momentous climate talks \- which produced the 2015 Paris Agreement. While implementing the Paris Agreement will take center stage under the presidency of Fiji, the host country Germany should be ready for uncomfortable questions about its climate and coal-burning record, but will also showcase its renewable energy success stories. Fiji earlier stated that the interest of small island nations will be prioritized. Its presidency would keep the interests of all nations  including those that are low-lying and vulnerable  at the forefront of our negotiations. Germany and the European Union member states will be represented at the Bonn summit by the Estonian EU presidency, and will follow a pre-coordinated negotiation strategy. Traditionally, the EU pushes for ambitious guidelines that are detailed, binding, transparent, and ensure a high level of comparability. Other topics on the negotiating agenda in Bonn will include adaptation measures and their communication, as well as climate finance and loss and damage associated with climate change. During the preparatory sessions for COP23 , some old fault lines between industrialized nations and developing countries have resurfaced, despite the fact that the Paris Agreement is for the first time obliging all parties to make plans for their climate change mitigation efforts, according to the Clean Energy Wire. The European Council has adopted conclusions on the Paris Agreement and preparations for the UNFCCC meetings, outlining the negotiating position of the European Union (EU). On global action under the Paris Agreement, the Council underscores the importance of a  rules-based global order, stressing that the treaty is  irreversible. It underscores that every country\' s contribution is essential for achieving the long-term goals in the context of sustainable development, poverty eradication, food security, gender equality, respect for human rights, respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, and protection of biodiversity. On advancing implementation, the Council notes that the EU is on track to meet its target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, and welcomes progress towards implementation of the EU\' s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target for 2030 of reducing domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% in reference to 1990 levels. On COP 23 COP 23 with sufficient clarity on how the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue will be conducted. In Bonn, the German leaders will have to answer some difficult questions about their approach to coal-fired power generation, and will also have to explain the country\' s overall stagnation in greenhouse gas reductions over the past years. Jochen Flasbarth, state secretary at the federal environment ministry and a member of the German negotiating team in Bonn, reportedly said that while Germany clearly has some success stories \- for example that it generates 35 percent of its electricity from renewable sources - the fact that it still uses coal means that its carbon footprint remains significant. The US withdrawal from the Paris Accord remains to be the biggest issue confronting the global climate negotiations, and preparations for COP 23 is moving amid a backdrop of climate change disasters in Florida, Louisiana and Puerto Rico. COP 23 moved apace. At the COP 23 headquarters, however, the mood is one of hope and optimism that the implementing rules for the Paris Accord, which came into force on 4 November 2016, would be finalized this year.  Our presidency will keep the interests of all nations  including those that are low-lying and vulnerable  at the forefront of our negotiations. We are also focused on turning the words and commitments of the Paris Agreement into measurable actions on the part of all nations, and are calling for transparent systems of accountability and practical outcomes to ensure the agreement is a success, said Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. Bainimarama identifies climate adaptation finance, effective monitoring of adherence through the rulebook to the Paris Agreement, and the object vies of the Climate Action Agenda, as key issues for his presidency. COP 23 In particular, clarification of the 2018 FD refers to agreement reached in Paris for a dialogue  to take stock of the collective efforts of Parties in relation to progress towards the long-term goal of the Paris Accord and  the preparation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) . COP 23 also provides opportunity for developed countries to revisit their commitment to support the Paris Accord  particularly their own emission reductions and the US$100 billion per year they promised to help developing countries with their own emission reduction programs. Developing countries want developed countries to make good on their commitment to mobilize US$100 billion a year in public and private finance by 2020 to establish a Green Climate Fund which would finance mitigation and adaptation projects. But developed nations want to have more donor countries so the burden is not entirely on them. Existing requirements for the reporting of country efforts are two-tiered, with a more rigorous system for developed countries than for developing ones. Developed countries are pushing for a common framework for all parties. Key messages for Policymakers 1. The 2015 Paris Agreement represents a historic turning point in global cooperation on addressing climate change and its global goal of limiting warming to well below 2 \'b0C or 1.5 \'b0C provide direction and help to frame climate change action. 2. Addressing global climate change goes hand in hand with ensuring sustainable development. 3. Through the process of preparing national contributions and their implementation, countries demonstrate that they are increasingly introducing national policies and related instruments for low emission and climate resilient development. 4. Financial support, technology development and transfer as well as capacity-building at scale continue to be urgently needed. 5. Institutions need strengthening to enable them to plan for and implement adaptation and mitigation in an effective and sustainable fashion. 6. The UNFCCC process offers a platform to scale up cooperative action. A ministerial meeting in Fiji on Oct 17 stressed the urgent need for progress to meet the pressing schedules of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and build a global  Grand Coalition of action between all levels of government, business and civil society.  Nations cannot protect themselves individually without all the parties to the Paris Agreement doing what they have already agreed to do and more, COP23 President and Prime Minister of Fiji told delegates from 68 countries at the two-day  pre-COP in Nadi. Meanwhile, ministers and Heads of Delegation from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group met in Addis Ababa on October 5 to discuss the priorities of the LDC group in preparation for the international climate negotiations in Bonn. Mr. Gebru Jember Endalew, Chair of the LDC Group, said it had been a very successful meeting, with Ministers discussing all of the key issues of the negotiations and expressing their countries' dedication to ambitious climate action. ""It is clear that LDCs face unique and unprecedented challenges in working to lift our people out of poverty while achieving sustainable development. Ministers here in Addis Ababa have identified the need for global solidarity and the support of the international community to help LDCs achieve our ambitious climate plans. Ministers have also highlighted that the global response to climate change must be fair and equitable, with countries acting in a manner that is consistent with their responsibility for climate change and capacity to respond."" The LDC group is fully committed to supporting Fiji to reach successful outcomes this November. Although the Paris Agreement set a goal to limit global average temperature rise to 2\'b0C, scientists have warned it is 95% likely that average global temperatures will pass this threshold by the end of the century. The challenge facing governments is to raise ambition and accelerate actions before the narrow window of opportunity closes. For COP 23 to capture progress toward these objectives, several substantive issues must be resolved, according to Climate Justice. The United States In June, President Trump announced the United States' intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, throwing into doubt its role at UN climate talks, and related bodies like the Green Climate Fund. At COP 23 , attention will turn to whether the United States (and its allies in the ""Umbrella Group"") will continue to advance a narrow agenda focused mainly on mitigation, carbon markets and transparency of action, while neglecting or foot-dragging on other key issues such as adaptation, loss and damage, finance, technology transfer, capacity building, transparency of support, compliance, and the global stock take. In Bonn, civil society organizations will release a major report exposing corporate interference in the climate negotiations, including a focus on the close ties between the Trump Administration and major polluters. In fact, it might be difficult to collectively aim for the tougher 1.5 degrees Celsius without the US commitment. However, under the rules of the Paris Agreement, the process of the US withdrawal could take at least three years, which by then it\' s possible that a new US president would be sworn in and might reconsider the decision to opt out. For now, the US government has indicated that it will be joining the COP 23 talks. Immediate Action The window to avoid breaching the aspirational 1.5\'b0C threshold is closing fast - by some estimates less than four years remain - yet countries' actions pre-2020 have remained minimal. In recent years countries have focused on constructing the Paris Agreement, a long-term strategy, instead of immediate action. Now with the Agreement out of the way and the sense of urgency mounting many developing countries and civil society organizations are putting the emphasis back on pre-2020 action. Increasing Ambition Even with scaled-up action in the immediate term, countries must still bridge an alarming ambition gap, as the pledged ""Nationally Determined Contributions"" would result in over 3\'b0C of warming, with risks of much higher temperatures. The Paris Agreement provided a mechanism to continually strengthen pledges in an equitable manner. The first part consists of a 2018 ""Facilitative Dialogue"" whose design countries must refine in Bonn. Developing countries will be adamant that the only way the Facilitative Dialogue can work is if it assesses countries' pledges on the basis of equity and in light of what support has been offered to realize conditional pledges. Developed countries will push for a more ""mitigation centric"" approach which considers only the reporting and emissions reductions components of the pledges. Loss and Damage Although the COP is being held in Bonn, technically it is being hosted by Fiji - the first Pacific nation to do so. As such, civil society and many developing countries hope that issues like loss and damage and climate-induced displacement will be elevated. While the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage has already launched into its 5 year work plan, it has not yet been designated a permanent source of finance, nor has it been fully incorporated into the Paris Agreement negotiation track. Developed countries remain reluctant to discuss financing for loss and damage as they see this as risking an admission of liability for climate change disasters occurring around the world. Instead they prefer insurance measures, which are unsuited for slow-onset climate impacts. Provision of Support As the emphasis of negotiations shifts to implementation of the Paris Agreement, questions around the implementation by developed countries of obligations to provide finance, technology and capacity will necessarily take on more urgency. In Bonn, developing countries will be asking developed countries to elaborate on their plan to mobilize a minimum of $100 billion annually by 2020, and seeking assurances of increased support in the longer-term, post-2025. One controversial issue is the methodology used by developed countries to account for the financial resources they must provide developing countries as part of their contribution to curbing climate change, which observers have said inflates the real amount actually flowing to developing countries. The Green Climate Fund has so far received pledges of $10.3 billion which pales in comparison to the trillions of dollars it will cost for developing countries to fulfil their pledges. With other funds such as the Adaptation Fund also short on resources, developing countries are unable to implement their share of the Paris Agreement and have to divert resources for adaptation efforts. They will therefore be insisting on progress on this issue as a matter of priority. Cross-cutting Issues The general fault lines between countries largely remain the same, and major divergence over key questions which were not wholly addressed in the May session will reappear. Chief among them is how the guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement will reflect differentiation between countries, and what information countries will be required to include in their Nationally Determined Contributions. Generally, developing countries are concerned that transparency and mitigation are being given priority over adaptation and finance issues. If they feel that issues are not being treated in a balanced manner there are likely to be problems taking the process forward. Global Climate Movements In addition to the official negotiations, thousands of activists will descend upon Bonn for mobilizations, taking aim at the German coal industry. A Climate March on November 4th as well as the direct-action group Ende Gel\'e4nde's planned occupation of coal mines on November 5th will set the scene for a counter-summit called the People's Climate Summit.

'This recognises the role of women in climate action,' President of COP 23 and Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama announced at a press conference saying the States Parties had finalised the plan. Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will be attending the high-level segment of COP 23 , on November15-16. 'It is about integration of gender into all the work around climate policy - both nationally and internationally,' Chief Negotiator for the COP 23 Presidency Nazhat Shameen Khan was quoted as saying in UN news. Also Sunday, countries and corporations announced new initiatives to cut emissions from forest use and establish sustainable forestry management programmes. 'The forests have this incredible ability to store carbon and we have underinvested in that,' said Inger Andersen, Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), at a press conference on Sunday. 'Protecting and restoring the forests is absolutely key to achieving the Paris Agreement [as well as] the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).' The UN World Health Organisation (WHO), in collaboration with the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC) and in partnership with the Fijian Presidency launched an initiative to protect people living in small island developing States from the health impacts of climate change. The vision is that, by 2030, all small islands developing States will have health systems that are resilient to climate change. \"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh4","Civil society group outlines expectations from COP23","October 30, 2017 Monday","United News of Bangladesh","An umbrella group of civil society organizations on Monday urged the government delegation to take a position for easy access to Green Climate Fund (GCF) in the upcoming COP23 Bonn Climate Conference in view of Bangladesh's vulnerability to climate risks. They also asked the Bangladesh delegation to play a transparent and coordinating role in COP23 , scheduled to be held November 6-17 in Germany. Eleven civil society organizations (CSOs), including the likes of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (BAPA), Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS), Brac University, EquityBD and COAST, jointly made the call from a national seminar titled ' COP23 Bonn Climate Conference: Expectations from CSOs in view of Implementing Paris Agreement' held at the Jatiya Press Club, said a press release. Noted climate expert Dr Atiq Rahman, Executive Director of BCAS, said, 'We have been suffering and paying most despite not being responsible for climate change.' He said the Paris Agreement has become £ loose agreement' as the concept of 'Common but Differentiated Responsibility' was not applied. He said Bangladesh should develop a special ministry so that it can continue chronology of global negotiations over climate change issues and get expected output over time. Chairman of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment and Forests Ministry Dr Hasan Mahmud urged developed countries to raise their ambition in respect of mitigation. He urged global CSOs to raise their voice in this regard. Official Coordinator of Bangladesh Government Climate Negotiation Team and also PKSF Chairman Dr Qazi Kholikuzzaman Ahmad said the GCF authority has been changing the rules and processes frequently bypassing the funding principles, which is a problem for most vulnerable countries. Bangladesh should take a position over implementation of commitments by developed countries through the Paris Agreement. 'Access to GCF is very complicated and we of course should take a position on this issue at COP23 ,' he added. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of EquityBD moderated the seminar, while Syed Aminul Hoque of the same organisation made the keynote presentation. \"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh5","COP-23 stumbles along as USA backtracks on Paris Agreement","November 27, 2017 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 27 -- COP-23 negotiations came to an end on November 18 in Bonn, Germany. One thing was clear. Negotiations were partially deflated but not completely derailed as many had suspected because of Trump's rejection of the Accord (that had been supported by his predecessor, Barack Obama) and defence of fossil fuels. The US approach nevertheless cast a long shadow on the proceedings. There were key disagreements that revolved round how to share responsibilities for drawing down greenhouse gas emissions and the money required for achieving this through adaptation and mitigation. The media, always alert about the evolving dynamics, did not fail to draw attention to the fact that White House Officials had hosted a sideline event with energy company bosses on November 13 to defend the continued use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas - that emit planet-warming and climate-altering gases when used. This approach, according to some analysts, did not help in the making of enough progress in developing the much-awaited ""rules-book"" for executing provisions in the Paris Agreement which enters into force in three years. One, however, needs to note here that White House Special Adviser on Climate Change, George David Banks, after the sideline meeting told the media that President Trump was still open to staying in the Paris Pact. It may be recalled that the Paris Treaty calls for limiting average global warming to 'well under' two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Farenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels or 1.5 degree Centigrade, if possible. Experts believe that anything over 2.0 degrees Centigrade dooms the world to calamitous climate change with more extreme superstorms, droughts, floods and land-grabbing sea level rise. A report, published while the COP-23 was in progress, warned that emissions of Carbon dioxide, the main planet-warming gas, was set to rise by two per cent in 2017 after three years of hardly any growth. Nations have submitted voluntary emissions-cutting commitments under the Paris Pact. Scientists pointed out at COP23 that current pledges were not being upheld. This was placing the world on course for warming of 3.0 degree Centigrade or more. The scientists have advised to make an an urgent upgrade of the global commitment to phase out or reduce greenhouse gases produced from fossil fuel. Environmentalist activists in separate meetings held on the sidelines have also stressed on this issue and underlined the need for countries to review and rachet up their commitments to cut carbon. Fiji, holding the responsibility of Presidency of this meeting in Bonn, has proposed what is being called - the Talanoa Dialogue. It is understood that over the next year, a series of discussions will take place to help countries review the promises they made earlier under the Paris Pact. Results from such review will eventually be discussed in the next Climate Conference to be held in Katowice, Poland in December, 2018. There is general agreement that many governments can now see a clean energy future that is not only achievable but also affordable. But most industrialized countries -from Europe to Japan to the USA - are not on track to meet their emission goals. This in turn is creating the risk of destabilizing ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more destructive heat waves and droughts. This anxiety has been reflected in the comment made by Maldives Environment Minister Thariq Ibrahim. While addressing the Plenary he stated ""while the Paris Agreement represents a remarkable diplomatic achievement, it will be judged by history as little more than words on paper if the world fails to take the level of action needed to prevent the loss of entire island nations."" The COP23 This was followed by French President Macron announcing the hosting of the ""One Planet Summit"" in Paris on December 12, 2017. Nearly 100 Heads of State and Government, as well as business leaders have been invited to this meeting. President Trump has, however, been left out. It is hoped that this Conference will be able to identify challenges common to all countries and then suggest steps and measures on how to overcome them. Germany has already pledged Euro 50 million to the Adaptation Fund this year. The summary of the outcomes titled ""Bula Momentum for Implementation"" issued at the conclusion of the Conference agreed on many aspects but significantly could not agree on how to cover climate change-induced Loss and Damage in vulnerable developing countries. Instead of arranging financing from the funds promised by developed countries, a proposal, named Insu-Resilience Global Partnership, was put forward that would provide 400 million poor and vulnerable people with insurance. Apparently, 25 large insurance companies have joined the Global Partnership with the supposed aim of reducing climate vulnerability. Such a step, as expected, has been received with severe criticism from activists who have pointed out that poor and vulnerable people, who have done nothing to cause the climate crisis, should not have to pay for the climate insurance. Some activists have, instead, suggested that a climate damage tax should be introduced to help out the vulnerable people and this should be paid for by the fossil fuel industries. The participants at the COP23 Conference agreed on one simple fact. They stressed that the world needed to have Germany, France, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Japan stepping up and providing real leadership. They felt that this would actually help deliver the ambition unfurled earlier in Paris. It would be pertinent to refer to certain comments made by our Environment Minister Anwar Hossain Monju in this Conference. He pointed out quite correctly that Bangladesh was looking forward to a simple procedural format regarding the Adaptation Fund and noted that ""the Fund would be very important for the vulnerable developing countries and particularly LDCs and the SIDs"". He drew attention to the need for countries like Bangladesh to be able to address the issues of adaptation with the technologies that can deal with protecting its population by providing early warning and by minimizing the potential economic and livelihood damages from the extreme climate change impacts. Consequently, effective implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by developed countries was critical. It was also underlined that although adaptation was Bangladesh's priority, nevertheless, it was also focusing on energy efficiency, energy conservation and use of renewable energy. We have difficult days ahead in resolving the differences of opinion among States regarding how to tackle climate change and what measures need to be taken to avert this growing crisis. However, we should also try, as underlined by President of COP-23 Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji, to work out a functional matrix through which this Global Partnership can make a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change. This will enable countries like Bangladesh to make a more resilient form of development and also be able to adapt to the great challenge of climate change.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh6","Bangladesh, Low Carbon Economy and COP23","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","Energy & Power","Bangladesh economy is growing appreciably over the past decade at the rate of 6% plus. The nation is steadily advancing to achieving its vision of mid income country status by 2021 and developed economy by 2041. But bottom line of achieving the national vision is ensuring sustainable energy future. In the context of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) it states providing access of quality power and energy to all citizens at affordable cost and ensuring no adverse impacts on environment. Bangladesh must be extremely careful in its choice of fuel and adoption of appropriate technology in power generation. Though the present carbon footprint of Bangladesh is negligible yet as one of the major vulnerable country to global GHG emissions induced climate change. Bangladesh can\' t afford going uncontrolled in fossil fuel dominated power generation. The strange nature of weather pattern in 2017 in Bangladesh must have given wake up call for Bangladesh policymakers for reviewing its energy plan and fuel options towards achieving low carbon economy. Bangladesh experienced much colder winter, early flooding, too much rain, and extreme hot weather happening in the same year. As a lower riparian country Bangladesh had more frequent visits of flash flooding causing damage to life and property. In this situation Bangladesh must not increase carbon footprint in its backyard in uncontrolled manner to worsen the situation. Of course given the paucity of own limited primary fuel resources and lack of capacity for exploring and exploiting these to the fullest extent Bangladesh has no option now but to go for importing primary fuel coal and LNG and import power from neighboring countries to feed its booming economy. These have to be realistically balanced and modern technologies ensuring least emissions need to be guaranteed towards achieving low carbon economy. But low carbon and renewable energy prospects need to be exploited to the fullest extent avoiding extensive use of polluting fossil fuel as far as practicable. Solar power (Roof top solar, solar irrigation, mini and micro grid), nuclear power utilization as far as practicable may be preferred option. Import of power from neighboring countries must get top priority national attention. What is Low Carbon Economy? Low carbon economy is low fossil fuel based power generation economy or decarbonized economy. We are all aware that non-renewable fossil fuels -- coal, oil, gas create carbon emissions. Does not matter whatever modern technology is used for extraction of these fuel and use in power generation these will create emissions of Green House Gas (GHG) - CO2 into the biosphere. This GHG emissions due to anthropogenic activity are the dominant cause of observed global warming since the mid 20th century. Continued emission of greenhouse gases causes further warming and is creating long-lasting changes around the world, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. That is why climate change conference had meeting of minds among nations of the world to limit fossil fuel use. Countries committed to adopt balanced fuel mix making contributions of renewable fuel solar, wind, hydroelectricity and nuclear power higher. Bangladesh as a signatory of COP agreement is obligated to get carbon neural as much as possible. Bangladesh Challenges In a country of over 160 million people living in a small area of limited own fuel resource, the challenges of providing access of energy to all at affordable cost is very different than many developed and developing countries. Bangladesh is not the best country for importing fuel (Coal and LNG) for absence of deep-sea port and shallow draft in its coastal areas. Until in the recent past Bangladesh remained almost exclusively dependent on own natural gas for energy generation. Gas dependent power generation could keep the carbon footprint negligible. But lack of appropriate initiatives for exploring and developing petroleum prospects have created major deficits in gas supply. Demand grew exponentially out stripping supply. The proven recoverable reserve may be exhausted soon if not replenished with fresh discovery soon. Natural gas still contributes over 60% of power generation now. Bangladesh has substantial reserve of high quality coal lying at mineable depth. But no government so far had political will to exploiting that resource taking up the challenges of mining coal. Hence Bangladesh is now in a serious dilemma how to plan its fuel option for energy generation given that it has national vision of achieving mid income country status by 2021 and developed country status by 2041. The bottom line is supplying quality power and energy to all at affordable cost. Bangladesh can neither become exclusively dependent on imported fossil fuel dependent country nor it can continue relying on limited discovered own fuel resources. It has to strike the right balance in the fuel mix, exploring and exploiting all avenues of renewable and low fossil fuel based power generation opportunities. Energy conservation and energy efficiency are other key areas, which must get priority attention. What is Bangladesh Plan? The Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2010 provision of coal contributing 50% of the targeted 40,000 MW generations has been lowered to 35% in the draft PSMP 2016. There are talks of further reducing it in appreciation of the fact that neither mining own coal nor relying on imported coal would be cost effective and as easy as was thought earlier. Though at present about 61% contribution comes from own gas the new proposal prescribes for 35% reliance on gas and LNG for generating the 57,000 MW power by 2041. Bangladesh has plan to import 4,000 MMCFD LNG by 2025. With that end in view government is entering into agreement with different developers for setting up FSRUs and land based LNG terminals. Government has already signed agreement with Qatar for supplying LNG. It is also negotiating with Oman, Indonesia and Switzerland for supplying LNG. Definitely LNG is low fossil fuel compared to oil and coal. But we are not sure how many of the present FSRUs and Land based LNG terminals will be feasible for Bangladesh. Would suggest for expediting exploration of own petroleum resources and rely more on own gas as far as practicable. The present over 37% reliance on imported liquid fuel would also be brought down in phases. Nuclear, Renewable and Power Import (mostly hydropower) would make 30% contribution. Government is implementing a 2X1200 = 2400 MW Rooppur Nuclear Power generation project now as a major low carbon power generation initiative. There are thoughts of constructing another such nuke project somewhere in the southern Bangladesh. Bangladesh now imports 660 MW power from India. There are opportunities for importing up to 10,000 MW power from Bhutan, Nepal and India is the BBIN initiative for cross border power trading in South Asia is successful. Most of this power will come from Hydro Electricity prospects in Nepal, Bhutan and North-Eastern parts of India. Bangladesh Must Keep An Eye On Global Situation We are not sure Bangladesh did enough research when it planned to go big in imported coal based power generation. The current plan is about 20,000 MW coal power by 2041. Conspicuously from 2010 till end 2017 it could not add even 1 MW new coal based power. Of the present initiatives only Rampal Power Plant at Bagerhat, NWPGCL Power plant at Payra and JICA supported 1,200 MW power plant at Matarbari are in implementation stage. These may also have issues of coal transportation apart from the JICA funded Matarbari plant. The planned 8,000 MW capacity 6-7 power plants at Matarbari-Maheskhali energy hub would require importing 40 million tones of coal per annum for which investment to the tune of 20 billion US$ would be required. With BP forecast predicting global use of coal peaking by 2025 and then gradually diminishing no investor would risk investing 20 billions in Bangladesh coal port/coal transfer terminal. On the other hand, whether Bangladesh uses Super Critical or Ultra Super Critical technology the combined emissions of 20,000 MW coal based power plants would not be negligible. Bangladesh must realistically review its coal based power generation option. Setting up mine mouth 5,000-8,000MW coal based power plants would be much cheaper and affordable than going for 20,000 MW imported coal based power program. COP 23 Would Give Major Clues The Conference of the parties ( COP23 ) to UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is scheduled to be held a UNFCCC secretariat head quarter in Bonn Germany from November 6-17, 2017. It includes 23rd session of COP as COP23 , 13th session of the CMP serving as meeting to parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP13) and the 47th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 47) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 47).

Some Headline News Three Major Economy Announces Phasing Out Coal Power In the fist week Of October 2017 three countries Canada, Netherlands and United Kingdom announced for major plans to phase out energy generation facilities fuelled by coal, with Netherlands announcing the decommissioning of all coal power plants by 2030 and UK and Canada announcing they will champion a global alliance on the transition from coal during the upcoming COP23 . President Trump administration\' s move to abolish the Clean Power Plan has provoked multiple reactions from States, businesses and environmental groups questioning the rationality of the decision from both moral and economic perspective. Bangladesh has to keep feeding its economy with sustainable supply of power and energy. It is impossible to avoid relying on non-renewable fossil fuels over short term. Neither it can avoid importing primary fuel to complement its own fuel. But the energy mix must not create major carbon footprint in own backyard as global climate change has already started creating alarming disasters. Bangladesh must learn lessons from COP23 and SIF2017. \"

The opening of the conference ( COP23 , November 6-17) takes place against this year's background of destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice and impacts on agriculture which threaten food security. 'All over the world, vast numbers of people are suffering - bewildered by the forces ranged against them. Our job as leaders is to respond to the suffering with all means available to us,' said newly elected COP23 President, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. 'This means to meet our commitments in full, not back away from them.' Bainimarama said that Fiji is working to build a 'Grand Coalition' throughout the year between governments at every level, civil society, the private sector and faith-based organizations, according to the UN Climate Change News. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary of Patricia Espinosa said, 'Together with the Sustainable Development Agenda, we have a clear path forward to truly address climate change and sustainable development.' Espinosa outlined the work governments will be looking to address in Bonn - above all to take the next essential steps to ensure that the Paris Agreement's operating system is completed in time and ways and means to implement it are strengthened. This is essential so that the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement can be achieved - to hold the global average temperature rise from pre-industrial time to well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Espinosa underlined that immediate progress was urgent. 'We need to move forward to fulfil the commitments that are due in 2020. In this regard, finance and pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions are key,' she said. COP23 , the Government of Germany is providing the substantial and generous logistical resources. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks reiterated her countries support for the UN and pointed out that as the home of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, Bonn is evolving into a global center of climate action and an international hub for sustainable development. The German Minister also had some good news with regard to finance for developing countries. She announced that Germany would support the UN's Adaptation Fund with an additional 50 million Euros in 2017.

According to the experts and Bangladeshi representatives, no significant progress has been made so far in the conference, that prior to the high-level segment saw 11 days of lower level negotiations. Particularly notable is the lack of progress on the five major issues that go into building a rule book to implement the Paris Climate Agreement - the major achievement of the entire COP process that came in 2015 in the French capital. Till Wednesday, an informal text of 300 pages has been published in this regard but nothing can be said until it is briefed into 40/50 pages, which is not possible in this year's conference, they added. Ziaul Haque, member of Bangladesh representative team told UNB that it has been demanded to include the matter of loss and damage in the Paris rule book. In the 300-page text, it has been mentioned that a separate fund must be formed for compensating countries that suffer loss and damage, Haque said, adding that strong demand has been voiced from the affected countries so that the provision makes it into the final text. An agreement is needed regarding how the Adaptation fund will function under the Paris deal but till now the member countries of UNFCCC could not agree on this.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh15","Climate change: Insurance for 'Loss and Damage' is a puzzle","December 11, 2017 Monday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 11 -- The UN climate talks, the COP23 concluded in November without deciding how climate adaptation measures will be funded in vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh. The discussion on the matter was put on hold until next year's climate summit. Also, the parties attending COP 23 expressed the need for another year to finalise the guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement by 2020. This followed a rejection by the developed countries of a demand for finance to cover climate change-induced Loss and Damage in vulnerable developing countries. However, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) finally integrated 'Loss and Damage' in its current agenda, considered as a third pillar in the worldwide effort to combat climate change, along with mitigation and adaptation. The issue of 'Loss and Damage' has emerged because the existing mitigation commitments and actions are inadequate to prevent dangerous climate change-related impacts. Like other vulnerable countries, the Bangladesh delegation expressed its dissatisfaction with the slow pace of progress at this year's COP. ""Many things were supposed to be fixed here, including the source of climate finance, but that did not happen,"" said Dr. Hasan Mahmud, a former environment minister of Bangladesh and a member of the country's delegation to the climate summit. The COP23 The Warsaw International Mechanism for 'Loss and Damage' in 2013, got embedded institutionally within the international climate regime - providing a platform to explore and identify effective responses to climate change-induced loss and damage. 'Loss and Damage' is a multifaceted concept for the vulnerable countries, especially those disproportionally affected by climate change. However, developed countries have sought to limit discussion of liability and compensation by framing loss and damage as a matter of adaptation. COP23 launched another major global initiative to provide insurance to 400 million poor and vulnerable people around the world by 2020. The project, called the InsuResilience Global Partnership, aims to provide insurance against the damage increasingly being caused by global warming. The first Partnership Forum of this project brought together signatories and aspiring members in a joint effort to lay the foundation for effective collaboration in the field of financial protection against climate change. More than 30 partners from governments, civil society, international organisations, academia and the industry have already expressed their support and commitment. This Partnership Forum will take place annually to facilitate communication and exchange of information and knowledge among its members. ""The global partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change,"" said Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji. But, international NGO ActionAid said that insurance is not a safety net for all. ""Insurance might turn out to be a piece of the puzzle, but we can't pretend that it's a safety net for everyone,"" said Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid International. ""Insurance does sometimes help people who are impacted by floods or cyclones, but it won't be an option for those facing certain losses."" The premium for the insurance schemes for the various global initiatives has not been finalised yet. There is also no estimate of how much money is required for the severely affected countries suffering climate change-induced loss and damage in future. Hence, it is difficult to say that the insurance policy for vulnerability to climate change impacts is on the right track.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh20","Compensating loss and damage for climate change impacts","December 12, 2017 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 12 -- In the word of climate change negotiations, loss and damage is arguably one of the most debated issues. In the last COP23 hosted by an island nation, Fiji (largely affected by the adverse effects of climate change), the conversation on the issue gathered more attention than ever. Although a universally accepted concept of Loss and Damage does not exist; the term can be defined as the negative effects of climate variability and climate change that people have not been able to cope with or adapt to. ""Loss' refers to the complete loss of lives or species etc; while 'damage' is something that can be repaired such as infrastructures. The main idea is that the countries which are most vulnerable to climate change are entitled to economic compensation from the polluter countries. For a Least Developed country like Bangladesh, climate change can pose serious pressure for its development progress. Even though Bangladesh emits a small amount of carbon each year, it is one of the most seriously climate affected countries of the world. Each year we are slowly losing our land to sea level rise. The increased intensity of natural disaster is hard for the country to handle. The impact of climate change is only getting worse. In 2017, Bangladesh saw one of the biggest floods in its history. The number of tropical storms has also increased in past years. In an opinion piece, Dr. Saleemul Haque said, ""When residents in the coastal district of Satkhira in Bangladesh were asked a decade ago, only 2 per cent of them said increased salinity caused by sea level rise was having an adverse effect on crop yields, livelihoods and their health. Today, over 80 per cent say they are affected."" In this reality, it is imperative that we as a country rightfully demand support for facing the adverse impact of climate change. ""Loss and damage"" has a long history of being neglected. Only in 2010, the words ""loss and damage"" appeared for the first time in the negotiating text of COP 16. Progress was made when in Warsaw COP 19, loss and damage got fully institutionalised into the UNFCCC through the ""Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM)"". However the progress since then has been slow. Even though ""loss and damage"" was mentioned in Article 8 of the Paris agreement, there was no provision for financial compensation. In 2016, the countries decided to work on a five-year-plan to address the slow onset impacts and migration. However, the financial part remained evasive. At COP 23 COP 23 , saying that there is ""insufficient statistical evidence"" that extreme weather events such as typhoons are singularly caused by climate change. Switzerland and USA are also strongly opposed to loss and damage discussion. But for countries like Bangladesh, the issue of loss and damage is an all important one. The compensation from the loss and damage can go a long way in combating climate change. In order to achieve that, we need to focus on scientific research that will support our demand at the global level. Technological support is just as important as financial support for countries like Bangladesh. Thus pressing for that is also as important as talking about compensation. Luckily, there is solidarity among major parties of the climate change negotiation regarding ""loss and damage"". The Least Developed Countries and Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) are advocating that ""loss and damage"" can be a separate agenda of its own, with the WIM being a permanent body within the convention. The G77+China group has also adopted the same position as them. They are also advocating about introducing innovative forms of finance to fund loss and damage. Bangladesh is known all over the world as a leader of climate change negotiations. Thus, Bangladesh needs to raise its voice on this issue and ask for fulfilling its rightful demands to support its efforts to combat climate change.

Afsan Chowdhury, faculty of BRAC University and journalist, had attended the COP conference and worked with several environment related projects, talked with the Energy and Power Magazine on COP23 . He thought Bangladesh has a little space to discuss the issues directly because the country is included in the LDC group. So, Bangladesh will take part in group wise discussion. The country has no opportunity to discuss any of issues individually. They will just attend the conference. Nonetheless, the Bangladesh delegation is not eligible to present itself boldly and strongly. The relevant ministry has no proper preparation for COP. They are not sound at international diplomatic level. The officials, who are going to join to COP, have to understand that it is a political arena. So, all issues will be discussed based on politics. Moreover, the government has no policy to build up skilled manpower to negotiate our issues boldly and smartly in the conference. Officials don\' t know what should be discussed and what is not. The platform is for discussing scientific issues, so the officials should have political, diplomatic, scientific knowledge as well. Prof Afsan has doubt about the capacities and skills of the participants. The issues discussed in COP22 have not been implemented yet and Bangladesh was not attentive to implement the issues at all. The world leaders can avoid Bangladesh easily. They are not much interested about Bangladeshi environmental issues. None of the leaders is fighting for Bangladesh. Additionally, nowadays the climate projects are considered as a source of income. To mitigate the climate impacts, the government should work on the field. American exit from Paris Agreement will create an uncertainty because America takes responsibility. So, now it is a big issue to be worried. Due to economic pressure on America, Trump left the deal. And none will be willing to take the responsibility, not even China, which may create pressure on the economy. Besides, success of COP is not a short term issue. It will take more than 100 years. The world leaders should emphasis to come out of smoke industries to cut emission. \"

Finance for climate is flowing at a greater pace than ever, with vibrant and growing markets for renewable energy, electric vehicles, green buildings and climate-smart agriculture seeing aggressive growth, backed by exponential advances in innovative green financial instruments, indices and markets, according to the UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat. Equally, the finance sector is recognizing to a much greater degree where and how climate change presents risks to its existing investments and the need to adjust their portfolios away from carbonintensive assets to reduce that risk. \"

'I'm encouraged to see climate action taking hold, at all scales, at all levels, involving an ever-wider coalition of actors and institutions,' said the Secretary-General at a press stakeout at the UN Headquarters, in New York. 'But we need to do more,' Guterres underlined. Guterres said he will convene a Climate Summit to mobilise political and economic energy at the highest levels in September 2019, according to UN News Centre. The UN chief said he will be travelling to Bonn to participate in the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), where, he will urge efforts to accelerate climate action as well as to raise ambition to do more. 'The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less - and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees,' he said, noting the need for a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. The UN chief informed that before Bonn, he will visit the Philippines to attend the UN-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit, and after participating at COP23 , he will deliver an address at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London on counter-terrorism and human rights on November 16. 'As the world responds to modern terrorism, our goal must be to win the fight while upholding our values,' he said. \"

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh25","2017 set to be in top 3 hottest years on record: WMO","November 6, 2017 Monday","United News of Bangladesh","It is very likely that 2017 will be one of the three hottest years on record, with many high-impact events, including catastrophic hurricanes and floods, debilitating heatwaves and drought. Long-term indicators of climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, sea-level rise and ocean acidification continue unabated, says the World Meteorological Organization's provisional statement on the State of the Climate. Arctic sea ice coverage remains below average and previously stable Antarctic sea ice extent was at or near a record low. The World Meteorological Organization's provisional statement on the State of the Climate says the average global temperature from January to September 2017 was approximately 1.1\'b0C above the pre-industrial era. As a result of a powerful El Nino, 2016 is likely to remain the warmest year on record, with 2017 and 2015 being second and/or third, and 2013-2017 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. The WMO statement - which covers January to September - was released on the opening day of the United Nations climate change conference in Bonn. It includes information submitted by a wide range of UN agencies on human, socioeconomic and environmental impacts as part of a drive to provide a more comprehensive, UN-wide policy brief for decision makers on the interplay between weather, climate and water and the UN global goals. 'The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long-term warming trend,' said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. 'We've witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. Many of these events - and detailed scientific studies will determine exactly how many - bear the tell-tale sign of climate change caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities,' he said. 'There is unprecedented and very welcome momentum among governments, but also cities, states, territories, regions, business and civil society. Bonn 2017 needs to be the launch pad towards the next, higher level of ambition by all nations and all sectors of society as we look to de-risk the future and maximize the opportunities from a fresh, forward-looking and sustainable development path,' she added. A review of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) found that, in developing countries, agriculture (crops, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry) accounted for 26 percent of all the damage and loss associated with medium to large-scale storms, floods and drought. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of vulnerable people exposed to heatwave events has increased by approximately 125 million. In 2016, 23.5 million people were displaced during weather-related disasters. Consistent with previous years, the majority of these internal displacements were associated with floods or storms and occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook indicates that adverse consequences are concentrated in countries with relatively hot climates and which are home to close to 60 percent of current global population. Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were affected by monsoonal flooding, despite overall seasonal rainfall being near average. The most serious flooding occurred in mid-August in eastern Nepal, northern Bangladesh and nearby northern India. Mawsynram (India) received more than 1 400 mm from 9 to 12 August. Rangpur (Bangladesh) received a month's worth of rain (360 mm) on 11-12 August. More than 1 200 deaths were reported in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, while more than 40 million people were displaced or otherwise affected. The World Health Organization indicated that in Bangladesh alone, more than 13 000 cases of waterborne diseases and respiratory infections were reported during three weeks in August, whilst extensive damage was reported to public health facilities in Nepal. \"

Since then in France, one major issue has drawn our attention: the fact that the world was unaware of the immensity and richness of the oceans, which account for 71 per cent of the Earth's surface, produce half the oxygen we breathe and absorb one-third of the carbon dioxide we produce. More and more people are convinced that the oceans must be considered as the key priority for the coming years: oceans are truly climate regulators and they represent untold wealth for the entire planet. Unfortunately, human activities are increasingly damaging the oceans. Their decline can be observed today, with a negative impact on the lives of millions of people who directly depend on maritime activities to live and prosper. More than 8 million tons of plastic are released into the ocean. Overexploitation threatens numerous fish species. From a security standpoint, many island nations are threatened by rising waters. We need an overall perspective as international negotiations are just beginning to consider the oceans. Such a perspective cannot exist without scientific consensus. That is why France participated actively in the first UN conference on Oceans held in New York, in June of this year, by hosting and supporting four side events as part of the conference; and that is why France strongly supports the IPCC Panel decision to prepare a special report on climate change and on the oceans. We need to make sure that awareness will lead the international community to take the right decisions with regard to the oceans, as it is each and everyone's global responsibility to work for a sustainable world.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh31","Anger over US coal role at climate talks","November 5, 2017 Sunday","Bangladesh Business News (BBN)","Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- Plans by the Trump administration to promote coal as a solution to climate change at a major UN meeting have angered environmentalists. An adviser to the president is expected to take part in a pro-coal presentation in Bonn next week, reports BBC. Separately, a group of governors will say that the US is still committed to climate action despite Mr Trump's rejection of the Paris agreement. The talks begin on Monday and aim to flesh out the rules for the Paris pact. This meeting, officially known as COP23 , will be the first full gathering of climate negotiators since President Trump vowed to take the US out of the Paris treaty. ""The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,"" he said last June, announcing the US intention to withdraw. However under the rules, the US cannot leave the agreement until 2020 so they will be sending a team of negotiators to this meeting. However the official US delegation, mainly career civil servants, may well be overshadowed by other groups with very different visions for how the US should combat climate change. According to reports, members of the Trump administration, will lend their support to an event to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power as solutions to climate change. Speakers from coal giant Peabody Energy, among others, will make a presentation to highlight the role that coal and other fuels can play in curbing the impacts of rising temperatures. A White House spokesman said in a statement that the discussion aims to build on the administration's efforts to promote fossil fuels at the G20 meeting this year. ""It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean,"" the spokesman said. Representatives of US coal companies are due to present at this year's climate talks. Photo: Getty Images 'BEYOND ABSURD' The prospect of fossil fuel industries making their case at this meeting has angered some who will attending. ""Fossil fuels having any role in tackling climate change is beyond absurd. It is dangerous,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""These talks are no place for pushing the fossil fuel agenda. The US needs to come back to the table and help with the rapid cuts in emissions that the situation demands."" ""It's not a credible solution, but that doesn't seem to bother them,"" said long time talks participant Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""They might even welcome some of the reaction to show to their base that they are fighting for America's interest and not this globalist malarky."" 'Much of America supports Paris deal' COP23 , is clear that CO2 from these fuels is the key cause of climate change. US climate report at odds with some in Trump team The report says ""that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence."" Other groups, opposed to the Trump perspective, will also be paying for a large pavilion at the talks. Delegations of US governors, mayors and business people, under the We Are Still In coalition umbrella, will be in Bonn to tell negotiators that below the Federal level, much of America still supports the Paris Agreement. The US Climate Alliance, which represents 14 states and one territory, says that it speaks for around 36% of the US population and if it were a nation state would be the third biggest economy in the world. One of the governors who will be on the ground in Bonn is Washington's Jay Inslee. ""We need to make sure that world maintains confidence in our ability to move forward,"" he told reporters. ""So far, not one single nation state, city or county, municipality or school district have followed Donald Trump into the ranks of surrendering to climate change since he pulled out of Paris - his decision has energised our efforts."" This determination to remain part of Paris is also being reflected at city level in many parts of the US. ""Whatever 'America first' is supposed to mean, it absolutely does not mean America alone,"" said Mayor Lionel Johnson from the city of St Gabriel in Louisiana. ""My fellow mayors and I stand united and we stand with the international community to pursue solutions to the dramatic climate challenges we are facing together. Count us in!"" Apart from the confusion over who is speaking for the US, the talks will focus on establishing rules and guidelines for the Paris pact. These need to be agreed by the end of 2018. The talks are being chaired by Fiji, which is the first time a small island developing state has taken this role. As such questions of climate impacts are likely to in the spotlight, including the tricky question of loss and damage. This is a potential area of significant disagreement as the richer countries are strongly opposed to any implied legal liability for the damages caused by climate related extreme weather events. Around 20,000 delegates and visitors will attend the meeting over two weeks. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Bangladesh Business News.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh32","Dhaka to mobilize resourcesto fight climate change","November 3, 2017 Friday","The News Today (Bangladesh.)","Bangladesh will raise its voice at the Conference of the Parties ( COP-23 ) to mount pressure on the global communities to make them extend financial and technical supports to the developing countries for coping with the negative impacts of global climate change, reports BSS. 'Like in the previous years, we will project adverse impacts caused by global climate change at the COP-23 to mobilize resources so that Bangladesh can overcome its challenges,' Environment and Forest Minister Anwar Hossain Manju told a press conference at his ministry here. Deputy Minister for Environment and Forests Abdullah Al Islam Jakob, Environment and Forest Secretary Istiaq Ahmed and officials concerned were present, among others, at the press conference. Manju said various milestone initiatives have been taken in the country, including making Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP), 2009, Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) and Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF) and Climate Change Trust Act-2010, to enhance capacity on the climate change issue. He said the Paris accord requires all countries to devise plans to achieve the goal of keeping the rise in temperature within two degrees celsius above the pre-industrial levels and strive for 1.5 C if possible. The Least Developed Countries (LDCs) must be united by developing strong leadership to pile up pressure on the industrialized nations to take actions to stem the planet's rising temperature, he added. Manju said, 'Paris agreement should be legally binding One powerful country that has withdrawn its name from the campaign to fight global change is largely responsible for carbon emission. Leading carbon emitting countries must follow international agreements to save the planet from the adverse impact of climate change.' Bangladesh alone cannot tackle the climate change issue as it is a global phenomenon, Manju said adding it should move bilaterally as well as multilaterally with strong bargaining capacity to exert pressure on the rich nations to make them extend financial and technical supports to the climate vulnerable countries. Despite negative attitude of the developed countries on the global climate change issue, he said, it is urgent for the vulnerable countries, including Bangladesh, to participate in such global conferences to pile up pressure on them. Jakob said Bangladesh is already witnessing negative impacts of global climate change and this year's April was the most rainfall month in the past 45 years. If the current trend of sea level rising continues, millions of people in the southern parts of the country will be displaced, he added. COP-23 is scheduled to be held in Bonn, Germany from November 6 to 17, this year. Other officials said countries responsible for global carbon emissions should provide sufficient financial and technical supports to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), including Bangladesh, to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change. Despite having little contribution to global carbon emission, LDCs, including Bangladesh, are bearing the burden of excessive carbon emission caused by the industrialised nations, which are mainly responsible for global warming, a great challenge for the planet, they added. \"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh33","The poor will judge effectiveness of climate change actions","November 23, 2017 Thursday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 23 -- Two years ago, 197 parties came together in Paris and agreed to the historical Paris Framework. Since that December 2015, we all have seen countless pictures of utterly devastating floods, wildfires, hurricanes happening more and more frequently all over our planet mainly affecting the poorest among us. The pictures may appear remote to our own lives when we look at them in the safety of our houses on our screens. They are often a mere flash in the evening news. They may give rise to a family discussion, for others they induce anxiety, but none of the pictures can ever fully convey the utter devastation affected families are left with, the suffering of children left orphaned, the despondency of adolescents not seeing a future, the broken elderly person left without hope. Whilst in Bonn this week for COP23 , which is scheduled to conclude November 17, I have two words at the forefront of my mind. One is a word from my own culture ' talanoa ', the Pacific Islands' word for dialogue. The other word is urgency. This for me is not yet another meeting, yet another travel, yet another series of talks. I grew up as an islander and my child has grown up an islander. The word urgency for us is a word full of action, doing and 'talanoa' brings people together to talk. As the representative of the UN Secretary- General for the world's poorest and most vulnerable 91 countries, which make up more than one billion people on our shared planet, I am in Bonn for the 23rd conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Whilst here I am advocating for the world's poorest and most challenged countries and above all expecting to get down to the nuts and bolts of taking urgent action. And urgent it is as commitments are already faltering and yet the times have never been more critical for the world's most vulnerable nations. These 91 diverse countries span our globe, each country faces unique challenges yet all are countries that have one feature in common - they contribute the least to climate change but feel its effects the most. They range from beautiful small islands in remote areas, with fragile ecosystems and rich cultural heritage, to landlocked states in the world's mountain ranges and countries which span the length of Africa's deserts, cities and forests. Who has not marvelled at the picture perfect images of the South Seas, the beautiful mountains of the Himalayas, the imposing gold coloured sandy seas of the world's deserts? It is these countries and their peoples most in need of action , immediate, urgent action. Can we really just continue to marvel on the one hand at the beauty of their nature and then forget how our shared planet's poorest and most vulnerable increasingly suffer the life-threatening effects of climate change? Are we prepared to leave them behind? We live in times where the short-term, the 'obvious' almost appear to be the diktat of action. We live in times where the extremes draw attention. I must though caution you that many of the climate change effects on human lives and our very existence are not always as obvious as they may seem. Yes, extreme weather events make our news headlines. But what about the affects of slow onset events such as sea level rise concerning all of the island nations, the glacial retreats, advancing desertification and biodiversity loss ? These are slow events but affecting the lives and livelihoods of communities. The island nation of Fiji is the COP23 president in Bonn. This is the very first time an island nation has presided over the UN's annual climate conference. Fiji's presidency is not merely symbolic but represents a critical juncture in which some of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, the small island developing States, will be centre stage. Island countries have been at the forefront of the strong push for greater ambition in global climate action. At the Paris climate conference in 2015, islanders were among those that led the charge for greater ambition through the aptly named 'High Ambition Coalition.' There is a very simple, existential reason for this. Island countries are well aware that the difference between a 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees goal of warming potentially means the loss of their islands and displacement of their people. It simply means a continued rise in sea levels and more destructive storms. Sea level rises coupled with the warming of oceans means more than just submerging islands, this deeply impacts overall extreme weather event occurrence. Fiji knows first hand what climate change means. Fiji suffered from the destruction of Cyclone Winston in 2016, the most severe cyclone to ever make landfall in the Pacific and which left more than USD1 billion in damages. And yet, progress in achieving the individual pledges which were made towards achieving the Paris Agreement are not on track to halt, let alone reverse climate change. It is highly alarming that the nationally determined contributions by countries currently amount to only a third of the emissions cuts needed by 2030. Our window for reversing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid exceeding the 2 degrees Celsius upper limit which leaders agreed to in Paris is closing rapidly. Studies indicate that we have until 2020, a mere three years, to implement mitigation action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. If we continue as we do right now, we may miss this opportunity to radically reduce global emissions in the next couple of years. This has a very serious bearing on how we go about achieving the UN's wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, there also are signs for hope. After all, Paris managed to bring together 197 parties to adopt the Paris Agreement. Importantly, it is the most vulnerable countries themselves working urgently to make a stand. Bhutan, for example, implements an initiative linking climate data with public health for greater resilience to climate change and more advanced warning systems for climate sensitive diseases. Mali, where climate change has led to more and ever more severe droughts, works with women's cooperatives in agricultural communities to clear plots for food gardens, helping to access clean water and solar power in an effort to ease the social and economic consequences of climate change, which can often also lead to conflict. The time is now to 'walk the talk' and be consistent with our noble ambitions commitments is now. We must scale up support to the world's most vulnerable countries. The world's poorest will judge us by action. For the world's most vulnerable countries, urgency is not a buzzword but an active state of mind and reality. Real lives and whole countries are at stake. The situation cannot get more urgent than this. Let us together walk the talk.

It suffered on an average 187 incidents a year, with economic losses worth nearly 0.68 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP). Some 642 people died in the incidents on an average a year in the country. Germanwatch, a German think-tank, disclosed these at its latest Global Climate Risk Index 2018 report, launched on the sidelines of COP23 in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday. The 13th edition of the analysis further confirms the fact that the less developed nations are more vulnerable to climate risk. The Global Climate Risk Index 2018 analyzes to what extent the countries have been affected by impacts of the weather-related events, like - storms, floods, heat-waves etc, referring to the available data of 20 years from 1997 to 2016. Its Long-Term Climate Risk Index (CRI) includes the 10 most affected countries from 1997 to 2016 (annual average), where Honduras, Haiti and Myanmar top the list. The top three countries in the long-run (1997-2016) have been measured due to Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998, Hurricane Sandy in Haiti in 2012 and Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008. Pakistan is ranked seventh, with a death toll of 523.1 lives per year with 10,462 lives lost in 20 years and economic losses worth $ 3.8 billion, equivalent to 0.605 per cent of its GDP in the 20-year period. Furthermore, of the ten most affected countries during the 1997-2016 period, nine were developing ones in the low income or lower-middle income country group. Nine were developing countries in the low income or lower-middle income country group, while only one (Thailand) was classified as an upper-middle income country. These results highlight particular vulnerability of the poor countries to climate risks, despite the fact that absolute monetary losses are much higher in the rich countries. Loss of life, personal hardship and existential threats are also much more widespread in the low-income countries. Dr A Atiq Rahman, executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies - an independent research organisation on sustainable development, told the FE that Bangladesh is ranked sixth because the country is beset with multiple vulnerabilities. ""We are vulnerable for floods, quakes, seawater surge and even food shortage... so we are so up in the list."" He, however, said the government and the international organisations concerned have been working on the measures to minimise the losses through various mitigation strategies.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh36","BD among 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events","November 13, 2017 Monday","United News of Bangladesh","Bangladesh is among the 10 most affected countries in the period of 1997-2016 due to extreme weather events with its 6th position, says a global report. Honduras, Haiti and Myanmar were identified as the most affected countries in this 20-year period. They are followed by Nicaragua, the Philippines and Bangladesh, said the Global Climate Risk Index 2018 that analysed to what extent countries have been affected by the impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves). The most recent data available - for 2016 and from 1997 to 2016 - were taken into account, according to the report a copy of which UNB obtained. Altogether, more than 524 000 people died as a direct result of more than 11 000 extreme weather events; and losses between 1997 and 2016 amounted to around US$ 3.16 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities). The countries affected most in 2016 were Haiti, Zimbabwe as well as Fiji and for the period from 1997 to 2016 Honduras, Haiti and Myanmar rank highest. This year's 13th edition of the analysis reconfirmed earlier results of the Climate Risk Index: less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialised countries. Regarding future climate change, the Climate Risk Index may serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change, said the report. While some vulnerable developing countries are frequently hit by extreme events, for others such disasters are a rare occurrence. It remains to be seen how much progress the Fijian climate summit in Bonn will make to address these challenges, the report observed. The COP23 A new 5-year-work plan of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage is to be adopted by the COP. It remains an open question how loss and damage should be taken up under the Paris Agreement. This year's COP presidency - the archipelago Republic of Fiji - as well as other Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are severely affected by climatic events. Five SIDS, including Haiti (2nd), the Dominican Republic (10th) and Fiji (13th), rank among the 20 countries world-wide most affected by weather-related catastrophes in the past 20 years. Haiti and Fiji rank first and third in the annual index for 2016. Storms and their direct implications - precipitation, floods and landslides - were one major cause of damage in 2016. According to the most recent scientific research, rising sea surface temperatures seem to play a key role in intensifying storms. Most of the affected countries in the Bottom 10 of the long-term index have a high ranking due to exceptional catastrophes. Of the ten most affected countries (1997-2016), nine were developing countries in the low income or lower-middle income country group, while only one was classified as an upper-middle income country. The climate summit in Bonn is continuing the development of the 'rule-book' needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidelines. The economic damages are estimated at US$ 2 billion, with Roanu also causing damage to India and Bangladesh. \"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh37","Climate crisis, de-growth and Bangladesh","December 10, 2017 Sunday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Dec. 10 -- Climate crisis is now in the forefront of public debate to chart a future for humankind to live in a sustainable planet Earth. Despite last four decades of political discussions about the gravity and the urgency of climate crisis, progress so far remains very patchy not to speak of that there are still many climate sceptics. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in Paris. Nearly 200 countries joined together to strike a deal on climate change and agreed for the first time to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emission (CO2). This agreement known as the Paris Agreement will come into effect in 2020. The agreement requires all countries, not just industrialised developed countries, to deal with climate change. The goal is very modest, to stabilise global warming below two degrees above pre-industrial levels, if possible even less. Despite the Paris Agreement described as humankind's last chance to respond to climate crisis, the USA, the world's second largest emitter of CO2, has already decided to opt out of it. The predominant climate crisis discourse at least in the developed world is centred around the issue that the crisis is fundamentally ""anthropogenic''; therefore universalising the culpability to ""human being''. So the rising global human population is marked as the principal cause of climate crisis. This is because they use energy by burning fossil fuels, deforest to clear land for crop and meat, even bio-fuel production. But the ""anthropogenic'' argument is fundamentally flawed because it will apportion the responsibility in proportion to the size of global population. We now know that empirical evidence clearly indicates that is not definitely the case. But where is the starting point in this debate? It is well recognised that it is industrial production that has caused a multitude of environmental problems over the last two and a half centuries in general and since the mid-nineteenth century in particular. This resulted in accumulating huge environmental problems which now manifest as a crisis. If not addressed immediately, this crisis can prove to be catastrophic for humankind. Industrial production is inextricably linked to the idea of economic growth which has become a mantra for material progress for humankind for a considerable period of time. That in turn results in rising affluence (at least in industrialised developed countries) leading to increased demand for food, meat and other consumer items such as cars, domestic appliances, holidays, etc. All these make increasing demand on the nature to supply them including fossil fuels. Economic growth has also been seen as a way to alleviate poverty but we now know that one per cent largely benefitted from such growth. What do these people do with such huge accumulated wealth? Conventional economic theory has little to say about this phenomenon. Thorstein Veblen answered that question. He described these super rich as belonging to the ""leisure class'' who strive to gain social recognition by demonstrating - through ""conspicuous consumption'' . Veblen further said that this conspicuous consumption filtered down to the lower and middle classes. He described conspicuous consumption as a waste diverting resources from producing goods people need to producing goods what they can show off. The result is a treadmill of dissatisfaction as they continue to consume more to keep up. Veblen even described ""the captains of industry'' as parasites, only interested in making money and completely ignorant of the industrial processes. In a period of high unemployment, especially youth unemployment and rising poverty in many parts of the world including developed world, growth is considered the key to address these problems. If these economies start to grow again at the same rate as before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the goal to achieve decline in CO2 emission will come to a halt. Surprisingly, it has been observed that only times there have been halt in rise in CO2 emission are during periods of economic recessions. But politicians and mainstream economists consider economic growth is essential to face multi-frontal problems faced by both developed and developing countries. More importantly, it is the key yardstick of economic success. China now has emerged as the single largest emitter of CO2 as the economy has been growing at a very fast rate over the last four decades, but much of this increase has also come from outsourced production from the USA and European countries. Given the relationship between economic growth and environmental crisis, many such as the Club of Rome have challenged what they described as ""growth fetishism''. Any suggestion otherwise such as a planned reduction in economic growth or steady state of economic growth keeping in tune with ecological sustainability are outright rejected on the ground that it would hurt the little people notwithstanding enormous wastage involved in the current system of industrial production as Veblen has pointed out. Such ideas are summarised as the idea or concept of ""de-growth''. Such a concept underpins an inexorable link between climate crisis and economic growth which, in turn, promotes industrial production (the main source of CO2 emission) including green technology product such as solar panels. De-growth suggests to make choice and sacrifice to mitigate the catastrophic risks arising from climate crisis by reducing the size of the economy. Yet many fear that economic growth is so much an integral part of the global economic system, any pushback to it will cause global economic dislocations. Now there is a general consensus that climate crisis will result in catastrophic consequences for countries like Bangladesh. A World Bank Report published in 2013 predicted that the world would become 4 degree centigrade hotter during this century in the absence of deep and fast cuts to global carbon emissions. Bangladesh is already prone to flooding encompassing two-thirds of its area every three to five years, drought every five years and catastrophic cyclones every 7-10 years. Under this circumstance Bangladesh will experience hotter local temperature, higher levels of flooding and cyclones and lower crop yields. It is estimated that one meter rise in sea level would submerge almost 20 per cent of the country and displace more than 30 million people in the Southern Bangladesh. But the actual rise of the sea level is expected to be much higher by 2100. Northern Bangladesh will move to a new climatic regime with temperature much higher than in the last century. More ominously, the report further warns that a sea level rise of 5 meters or more in coming centuries could pose an existential threat to Bangladesh. Within the debate on growth and de-growth, for a country like Bangladesh with acute poverty and squalor and facing catastrophic consequences as climate crisis deepens, how climate change will impact on economic growth and hence future welfare of the people? The question should not be put in the reverse order for a country like Bangladesh. The prognosis looks very dire. We are told that we are all in the same boat so far as climate crisis is concerned. But that is not true. While sea levels are rising for everyone, people are being flooded in a country like Bangladesh but a country like Holland, having geographic features similar to those of Bangladesh, is building floating cities with resources accumulated over centuries. That resource accumulation was made possible by those very activities that have landed us in climate crisis now. Countries like Bangladesh which have contributed least to climate crisis are going to pay the heaviest price for it and those who have contributed the most will suffer the least. Overall, the impact of climate crisis is more acutely felt in developing countries like Bangladesh than developed countries. As developed countries contributed to the environmental degradation through increased industrial production and consumption not to speak of waging wars over resources and economic predation by very rich and powerful countries, a global transfer payment system will help to a great degree to mitigate the climate crisis for developing countries. As climate crisis is deepening and decisive corrective measures are not taken, it may reach a point when there will be no option left out except forced de-growth for the developed world. The final irony is even the very rich, whether in the developed or developing world, will also be affected by climate crisis.

While many lament the US\' decision of 1 June 2017 to leave the Paris Agreement, UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim captured a common sentiment by noting that it  in no way brings an end to the  unstoppable effort of climate action. In his statement, Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and Incoming President of the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the UNFCCC, highlighted the commitment being shown by China, India, the EU, Canada, Mexico and the  vast majority of other nations. In an open letter to the international community titled, \' We Are Still In,\' US state, local and business leaders declared their continued support for climate action and the Paris Agreement  no matter what policies Washington may adopt. At a press encounter in Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres urged governments to  stay the course and remain committed to climate action. He also expressed his conviction that US federal states, cities, the business community and the civil society, will remain engaged and  bet on the green economy. \"
"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh39","Conflict of interest at UN climate talk","May 17, 2017 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, May 17 -- Since the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in 2016 in Marrakesh, Morocco, environmentalists are very much worried about the influence of fossil fuel industries in climate change negotiation. Environmental groups claim that a number of business participants in these talks are funded by the fossil fuel industries. They demand a strong restriction on their participation. Otherwise, they fear, it will be difficult to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degree or even 2.0 degree Celsius. They allege that some of the giant fossil fuel companies are driven by their corporate greed for profit. Their continued profit making from the environmentally destructive projects, they point out, resulted in environmental crisis in many countries. There is an allegation that the fossil fuel industry influences the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) through its many trade associations. As Business/Industry Non-Governmental Organisations (BINGOs), these associations take part in negotiations and lobby governments. Also, these associations are allowed to act as observers at the UNFCCC. Corporate Accountability International, a Boston-based voluntary organisation, has published a new report which shows the connections between fossil fuel industries and business non-governmental organisations regarding UN climate talks. The report has stated, ""Despite what major fossil fuel corporations may insist about their support for the Paris Agreement, these corporations have consistently used their presence at the UNFCCC to weaken policy rather than strengthen it. Hundreds of BINGOs, many of which have direct links to the industry and its interests, have been granted access to attend UNFCCC negotiations. Under current UNFCCC policies, industry representatives like the World Coal Association, which aggressively promotes a coal-centred agenda, sit in the very rooms where delegates discuss policy options to avert climate disaster."" [ HYPERLINK https://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/sites/default/files/resources/insidejobcai.pdf https://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/sites/default/files/resources/insidejobcai.pdf ] A 15-day preliminary session of the upcoming COP23 , from May 08 to May 18, is now in session at Bonn, Germany. On May 09, an in - session workshop on opportunities to further enhance the effective engagement of non-Party stakeholders with a view to strengthening the implementation of the provisions of decision 1/CP. 21 was held there. The issue of conflicting interest among non-party stakeholders was raised in that workshop. The workshop discussed whether or not fossil fuel companies should be allowed to attend the UNFCCC as observers. From the minutes of the workshop, some discussion points related to conflict of interest may be seen below [source: HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource http://unfccc.int/resource A panelist and other participants called for a legal framework to enable the better engagement of non-Party stakeholders. This would require the development of a set of rules and principles, as well as procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest. With regard to potential conflicts of interest, some participants called for a process for guaranteeing that all non-Party stakeholders participating in the process are committed to the objectives of the Convention and share a common view on their urgency. Others stressed that more observers joining the UNFCCC process was a positive development, because as many groups as possible will be needed to achieve transformational change on a global level. On conflicts of interest, some participants stressed that enhancing the engagement of non-Party stakeholders must not undermine the legitimacy and integrity of the UNFCCC process. To that end, one group proposed that the UNFCCC process adopt a definition of conflict of interest. The framework for engagement adopted by the World Health Organisation in its efforts on tobacco control was cited as an example. Some participants expressed concern regarding public-private partnerships being viewed as the only driver for climate action. Others countered that businesses and industry play an important role in meeting the climate challenge and all groups will benefit from an open and transparent process. Another speaker noted that excluding groups, such as the private sector, fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of this convention, as the entire negotiating process is about hearing competing views. The discussion also addressed potential conflicts of interest. Some called for a clear process for addressing conflicts of interest and stressed that corporations should not be involved in policy making. Others noted that all sectors should be included and cited the success of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer as an example of positive industry involvement. Part of the debate centred on the need to develop a policy to address conflicts of interest for non-Party stakeholders. Some participants strongly expressed support for this approach, while others stressed the importance of diversity and inclusiveness.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh40","Forging unity of vulnerable countries on climate issues","November 1, 2017 Wednesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 1 -- Countries responsible for global carbon emissions should provide sufficient financial and technical support to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), including Bangladesh, to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change. Despite having little contribution to global carbon emission, the LDC are bearing the brunt of excessive carbon emissions caused by industrialised nations which are mainly responsible for global warming-- a great threat for the planet. The Paris Accord requires all countries to devise plans to achieve the goal of containing global temperatures within two degree Celsius and strive for 1.5 degree Celsius, if possible. The Least Developed Countries must be united backed to put pressure on industrialised countries to take action to curb the planet's rising temperatures. Bangladesh is already facing adverse impact of global climate change and it is urgent to raise its voice to get adequate support from green climate fund to make it a climate resilient country. Many people across the country have become refugees due to various reasons, including floods, river bank erosions and cyclones. Basically, they are climate change victims. Bangladesh alone can not face climate change as it is a global phenomenon. It should move bilaterally as well as multilaterally along with strong bargaining capacity to build up pressure on advanced countries to extend financial and technical assistance to climate-vulnerable countries. The United Nations has expressed grave concern saying that the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere grew at a record rate in 2016, not experienced ever before-- potentially fuelling a 20-metre rise in sea levels and adding 3 degrees to temperatures. The UN World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin said that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main man-made greenhouse gas, hit 403.3 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.0 in 2015. That growth rate was 50 per cent faster than the average over the past decade, driving CO2 levels 45 per cent above pre-industrial levels. The WMO bulletin said, ""Today's CO2 concentration of 400 ppm exceeds the natural variability seen over hundreds of thousands of years"". The latest data add to the urgency of a meeting in Bonn in November 2017, when environment ministers from around the world will work on guidelines for the Paris Climate Accord endorsed by 195 countries in 2015. The agreement is already under pressure because the United States President Donald Trump has hinted to pull the US out of the deal, which seeks to limit the rise in temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). The WMO said human CO2 emissions from sources such as coal, oil, cement and deforestation reached a record in 2016, and the El Nino weather pattern gave CO2 levels a further boost. The world has never experienced a rise in carbon dioxide as in the recent decades, which has happened 100 times faster than when the world was emerging from the last ice age. Scientists know prehistoric levels from tiny air bubbles found in ancient Antarctic ice cores, and they can derive even older data from fossils and chemicals trapped in sediments. The last time carbon dioxide levels reached 400 ppm was 3-5 million years back, in the mid-Pliocene era. The WMO bulletin said, ""During that period, global mean surface temperatures were 2-3 Celsius warmer than today, ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica melted and even parts of East Antarctica's ice retreated, causing the sea level to rise 10-20 metres higher than that today"". Since 1990, the global warming effect of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases have risen by 40 per cent. The two other main gases - methane and nitrous oxide - also grew to record concentrations last year, although at a slower rate of increase than carbon dioxide. The green activists of low emission countries like Bangladesh unequivocally demand adequate compensation for the climate change victims. They urge upon the developed and industrialised countries to fulfill their commitment towards climate funding and ensure transparency in the use of the green climate fund. They also demand compensation, not loan, from the industrially developed countries, which are solely responsible for climate change and global warming. The demand came afresh ahead of the programme of the twelve-day 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 The writer is a retired Professor of Economics, BCS General Education Cadre.

"COP23","Bangladesh","COP23_Bangladesh42","Bonn Climate Talks Conclude Under Threat of US Exit","June 15, 2017 Thursday","Energy & Power","UN climate negotiations conclude in Bonn recently with delegates putting on a brave face despite the threat of an American exodus hanging over their global pact to stem global warming. Envoys from nearly 200 country signatories to the Paris Agreement kept a close eye on Washington throughout their 10-day huddle for any signal about President Donald Trump's intentions. On the campaign trail, Trump had threatened to ""cancel"" the hard-fought pact in which his predecessor, Barack Obama, played an instrumental role in dragging it over the finish line in 2015. On the second day of the Bonn talks, the White House announced the postponement of a meeting to discuss America's future in the deal, compounding the uncertainty. A historically small US delegation at the annual round of technical negotiations was thus also left in the dark. ""I personally have met with the head of the (US) delegation a couple of times and... he's just very open in repeating: 'Our position is under review',"" UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said. But delegates insisted that work continued on outlining a nuts-and-bolts ""rule book"" for implementing the agreement's goals, despite the ever-present ""Sword of Damocles"", as one put it. Observers pointed to the importance of coming meetings of the G7 and G20, strategic country groupings of which the US is a member, in putting pressure on Trump, who has described climate change as a ""hoax"" perpetrated by China. The ""rule book"" the Bonn participants started work on is meant to guide countries in implementing the Paris Agreement's goals -- what type of information to include in their emissions-curbing updates, for example. The rules must be finalized by next year, leaving just over 18 months for what appears set to be a difficult negotiation. The Climate Change Conference convened from 8-18 May 2017 in Bonn, Germany devoted much work to advancing efforts to operationalize the Paris Agreement through technical discussions under the three subsidiary bodies. This work proceeded in incremental steps, leaving considerable work for the 23rd session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP in November 2017 when delegates are scheduled to come back to Bonn under Fiji\' s Presidency. The conference included the 46th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 46), and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 46), and the third session of the first meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-3). The conference brought together over 3900 participants, including over 2000 government officials, 1800 representatives from UN bodies and agencies, intergovernmental organizations and civil society organizations, and 70 members of the media. The APA adopted conclusions outlining inter-sessional and pre-sessional work under each substantive agenda item. The SBI adopted conclusions on: public registry/ies referred to in Paris Agreement Articles 4.12 (Nationally determined contribution (NDC) registry) and 7.12 (adaptation communications); matters related to least developed countries (LDCs); national adaptation plans; scope and modalities for the periodic assessment of the Technology Mechanism in relation to supporting the Paris Agreement; review of the functions of the Standing Committee on Finance; third review of the Adaptation Fund; matters related to capacity building; arrangements for intergovernmental meetings; and various administrative and financial matters. The SBSTA adopted conclusions on: the Nairobi work program; the Technology Framework under the Paris Agreement; agriculture; research and systemic observation; various methodological issues under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol; matters relating to Article 6 (cooperative approaches) under the Paris Agreement; modalities for accounting of financial resources provided and mobilized through public interventions under Paris Agreement Article 9.7; and cooperation with other international organizations. The SBI and SBSTA adopted joint conclusions on response measures and scope of the next periodic review of the long-term goal under the Convention and progress toward achieving it, which also contained a Conference of the Parties (COP) decision. The minds of many were overshadowed by the uncertainty regarding US participation in the Paris Agreement going forward. However, the  elephant in the room at the start of the meeting soon became a non-issue as the US administration delayed its decision, allowing negotiators to settle back into a  business as usual mode of work. The Bonn meeting was the first official UNFCCC session since the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 22) in Marrakech, Morocco, which had set 2018 as the deadline for the adoption of the Paris Agreement  rulebook \- the operating manual on how the Agreement will be implemented in the decades to come. With this deadline looming, the technical work required to put flesh on the bones of the Paris Agreement took center stage in Bonn. The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) stole most of the limelight, moving attention away from the  routine work of the permanent subsidiary bodies. These two bodies also ended up devoting a substantial amount of time to efforts to build the post-2020 regime. Incremental Steps Towards Textual Elements As discussions delved into the details of the Paris outcome, the underlying differences that had existed among parties in the lead up to Paris continued to resurface. While on most APA agenda items these differences hindered the shift to more textual negotiations, on other issues parties were able to set aside the political divergences and focus on technical aspects. Stemming from the lingering question of differentiation between developed and developing countries, calls were heard for adopting a binary approach in the development of the modalities of the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, and in guidance related to mitigation and transparency. The divergence between those wishing to introduce a differentiated treatment within the Paris Agreement\' s modalities and others arguing that the nationallydetermined nature of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) provides for sufficient differentiation hindered agreement on the  skeletons of the decisions on the rulebook that are expected to be adopted in 2018. However, as one seasoned observer noted, delegates were not expected to  resolve things in Bonn, and the rich discussions under all APA agenda items, captured in the Co-Facilitators\' informal notes, arguably had the merit of laying out the issues. Parties were able to engage in technical discussions on a number of issues where there was agreement to carve out a  safe area in which to focus on technical or legal aspects, while avoiding political pitfalls. The two discussions on a public registry\- for NDCs and adaptation communications\- had been polarized over whether to create one or two registries. In Bonn, parties managed to focus on technical aspects, such as registry user features and accessibility, even if the seemingly mundane and slowpaced deliberations made one observer question whether it was the best use of negotiators\' time. Useful exchanges also took place in finance-related transparency discussions. While many developing countries felt that the support aspects of the transparency framework received inadequate attention under the APA, many others felt that the discussions on exante and ex-post finance information (Paris Agreement Articles 9.5 and 9.7, respectively) convening under the SBSTA and a special in-session COP roundtable helped move the discussions forward. Another area where progress was made in Bonn was agriculture. Here again, instead of polarized debates on whether to include mitigation in the discussion, the SBSTA focused on substantive agricultural activities, enabling parties to set the scope of future negotiations. Incremental progress was also evident under the APA in clarifying the options on the so-called  orphan issues, which have not yet been explicitly included on the agendas of the subsidiary bodies. For instance, the inputs provided by the UNFCCC Legal Affairs team on the legal requirements for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement, related arrangements and modalities, and transitional measures helped move the debate beyond whether or not the Fund  should serve the Agreement, but also clarified that this issue may require more time than some developing countries had initially hoped for. Steps that Get Us Closer by Ensuring Coherence Parties also sought to address sequencing among the various agenda items in various ways, for example by postponing consideration of the scope of the review of the long-term global goal under the SBSTA until 2019 to allow for the modalities of the Global Stocktake and the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue to be completed under the APA. For similar sequencing reasons, SBI discussions on the review of the Clean Development Mechanism and of the capacity-building framework, and on national adaptation plans were deferred to November 2017 or even December 2018. The need to advance in a coherent manner, in light of the complexity of the task, is uncontested. However, the calls by some parties in Bonn for balanced progress illustrated the resurfacing of another dividing line that existed in the lead up to Paris, namely the balance between action and support. During the session, various developing countries argued repeatedly that mitigation was allotted more  bandwidth than other issues. These concerns culminated in the final days, which saw parties engage in protracted debates over which APA items to prioritize for the limited slots of roundtables to be held before COP 23 , and in particular on the need for the roundtable on transparency to give equal treatment to transparency of action and of support. Many recognized, however, that there are elements of the Paris rulebook that require more work because they are  newcomers to the UNFCCC world. Two such issues are the Global Stocktake and some elements of cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Without the benefit of years of proceedings to draw from, delegates spent considerable time exchanging views, often far apart, on these two items. On Article 6, many felt frustrated by being unable to agree on how to capture the 36 hours of discussions, which included an in-session roundtable, let alone on the headings under which to structure further negotiations. While many also lamented the lack of agreement on headings for the Global Stocktake, some pointed out that Bonn had kicked off positively the shaping of the 2018 Facilitative Dialogue, dubbed by some as an  initial stocktake. Encouraged by the good spirit and openness of the consultations held in Bonn by the Moroccan COP 22 Presidency and the incoming Fijian COP 23 Presidency on this dialogue, one long-term observer expressed hope that it would help build confidence on a partnership beyond 2020. Thousands of Steps by Growing Number of Actors In designing both meetings, attention was given to convening stakeholders from a variety of sectors and making the events more interactive. However, some still felt more work remains to better connect the TEMs both to the formal negotiating process, as well as to the broader Global Climate Action Agenda and the work of its High-level Champions. Non-party stakeholder engagement is another crucial enabler of the implementation of the Paris outcome. The Bonn meeting made progress on this front in two ways. First, a well-received multi-stakeholder dialogue convened to initiate discussions on operationalization of the local communities and indigenous peoples\' platform, established in Paris. Second, discussions under the SBI explored concrete means of enhancing the engagement of non-party stakeholders, including at a dedicated in-session workshop. The issue of whether or not to  differentiate between different stakeholder groups through a conflict of interest policy or participation criteria, first proposed by one developing country group at SBI 44, continued to spark controversy. While recognizing the concerns over stakeholders whose interests might be in conflict with the objectives of the Convention, the majority of parties agreed that one party\' s textual proposals on  safeguarding the  integrity of these objectives would not be the right message for communicating openness and transparency. As pointed out by one delegate advocating for bringing everyone into the room,  those who are not part of the solution are part of the problem. Many welcomed the SBI conclusions on this item, which mandate UNFCCC presiding officers, COP Presidencies and the Secretariat to undertake several tasks to enhance non-party stakeholder participation. Keeping the Focus on Progress Many felt that parties were able to progress\- even if only incrementally\- by beginning to map out options for the skeletons of the decisions that will need to be adopted at COP 24 in 2018. The meeting also provided some reassurance to parties that all the elements of the Paris work program are advancing in a coherent manner. While one party suggested that  moving meaningfully was more important than moving fast, the slow pace disappointed those stressing the urgency of tackling climate change. Leaving Bonn, many hoped that the numerous informal notes prepared by the Co-Chairs and Co-Facilitators, together with the calls for focused submissions on all APA items and the five pre-sessional and in-session APA roundtables, would enable parties to further shift to textual negotiations at COP 23 . COP 23 , but for the future of the regime. Even so, one optimistic delegate suggested that momentum behind the Paris Agreement is already too strong to be stopped by any single country. \"

It suffered on an average 187 incidents a year, with economic losses worth nearly 0.68 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP). Some 642 people died in the incidents on an average a year in the country. Germanwatch, a German think-tank, disclosed these at its latest Global Climate Risk Index 2018 report, launched on the sidelines of COP23 in Bonn, Germany, recently. The 13th edition of the analysis further confirms the fact that the less developed nations are more vulnerable to climate risk. The Global Climate Risk Index 2018 analyzes to what extent the countries have been affected by impacts of the weather-related events, like storms, floods, heat-waves etc, referring to the available data of 20 years from 1997 to 2016. Its Long-Term Climate Risk Index (CRI) includes the 10 most affected countries from 1997 to 2016 (annual average), where Honduras, Haiti and Myanmar top the list. \"

They said rising temperature would cause extreme events like flood, cyclone, and forest fires more frequently than ever, and it was already seen in different parts of the world. As one of the worst victims of climate change, Bangladesh should play an important role in the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ), they said. The seminar was organized by Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) in association with Islamic Relief Bangladesh in the capital to identity the role of civil society on COP 23 . Speaking on the occasion, environmental scientist A Atiq Rahman warned that global temperature would rise by more than three degrees Celsius by the end of the century although most countries set the target to limit the rise to two degrees Celsius. This rise is triggered by excessive carbon emissions, he said. The atmospheric carbon dioxide has reached 403 parts per million (ppm) this year from 400ppm last year, which is alarming for the climate, said Atiq Rahman, also executive director of BCAS, citing a recent study. \"

Through the process of preparing national contributions and their implementation, countries demonstrate that they are increasingly introducing national policies and related instruments for low emission and climate resilient development. Financial support, technology development and transfer as well as capacity-building at scale continue to be urgently needed. Related institutions need strengthening to enable them to plan for and implement adaptation and mitigation in an effective and sustainable fashion. In this backdrop, governments of countries from across the world will gather from November 6-17 in Bonn, Germany for the 23rd annual UN climate change conference ( COP 23 ). \"

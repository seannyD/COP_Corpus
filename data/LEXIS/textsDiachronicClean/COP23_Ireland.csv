"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland1","Greater use of coal will push emissions to record high, Bonn talks told","November 14, 2017 Tuesday","The Irish Times","Stronger Chinese economic growth and greater use of coal will push global greenhouse gas emissions to a record high in 2017, according to a report issued at the UN climate talks in Bonn. After remaining flat for three years, hopes of a turning point in the world's efforts to curb climate change have been set back by the findings of the report by the Global Carbon Project, an international research consortium. ""The plateau of last year was not peak emissions after all,"" conclude the researchers, a group of 76 scientists based in 15 countries. Speaking at COP23 , Glen Peters of the Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo said China's emissions of CO2 were set to rise by 3.5 per cent, driven by more coal demand and stronger economic growth. US emissions were set to decline by 0.4 per cent in 2017 - a smaller fall than in recent years, also reflecting more burning of coal. Coal's gains were linked to a rise in the price of natural gas that made coal more attractive in power plants, Mr Peters said, rather than the effects of US president Donald Trump's pro-coal policies. EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said Europe had been steadily reducing its emissions and has one of the most ambitious climate plans. ""If other countries were as ambitious as us, perhaps emissions would not have risen so much,"" he said. Protesters temporally interrupted a US event to promote ""the role of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and nuclear power in climate mitigation"". Panellists at the event argued renewable energies such as wind and solar power were insufficient to meet the world's energy needs. David Banks, Mr Trump's special assistant on energy and environment, told the meeting the panel was only controversial ""if we choose to bury our heads in the sand"" by ignoring the continued need for fossil fuels and nuclear power. In response to coal lobbyists appearing alongside the US delegation at COP23 , the climate spokesman for Christian Aid, Mohamed Adow, said: ""Coming to a climate summit to promote coal is an act of vandalism against our common home. It is offensive to millions of people living with the impacts of climate change."" Meanwhile, 18 multinationals came together at COP23 to launch a strategy for adopting hydrogen as a fuel for the ""world energy transition"".

"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland2","World pushes ahead with climate action; US isolated and there is no indication Ireland is in the vanguard of change","November 20, 2017 Monday","The Irish Times","The latest round of UN talks on the global response to climate change made steady progress on implementing the Paris Agreement. COP23 in Bonn showed determination to push on without the US, a major backer of the accord up to recently. But there is much unfinished business. The US sent a small ""rump delegation"" to Germany. White House officials hosted a shambolic event on ""the role of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and nuclear power in climate mitigation"" - with an emphasis on coal. It prompted the UN climate envoy and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to remark: ""Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit."" It had a galvanising effect on almost all others present, while the high-level talks were bolstered by Syria and Nicaragua finally endorsing the 2015 agreement, ensuring the US was truly isolated on the world stage. In the tricky final days of negotiation, senior American diplomat Judith G Garner said the US would remain engaged in global climate-change negotiations, although planning to exit the Paris Agreement ""at the earliest opportunity"". COP23 was billed as an interim, largely technical round of talks to agree ""the Paris rule book"" to come into force in 2020. But the backdrop of a year of extreme weather events, further indications of a warming world and the throwing of an environmental scud into the room by Trump in June when he announced he was pulling the US out of Paris ensured the agenda was broadened. New urgency Former Irish president Mary Robinson Their case was that to have any hope of achieving a 1.5-degree limit to the rise in global temperatures this century, action was necessary immediately. Latest analysis from the Global Carbon Project charted greenhouse gas emissions rising in 2017 after three consecutive flat years. And so ""pre-2020 actions"" forced their way into discussions. A number of European countries agreed to accelerate emissions cuts even before 2020, when compliance targets begin to take effect. There is no indication that Ireland is in that vanguard. The question of how to pay for problems relating to changes in climate already being experienced by many poor nations went unanswered again. While wealthier countries had previously promised $100 billion annually to vulnerable countries, there were indications of an awareness that this will not be enough. Adoption of a gender action plan was ""a major achievement as it recognises the critical role of women in climate action"", said Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which hosted COP23 . A local and indigenous peoples platform was also put in place, ending years of stalling on both fronts. Biggest advance The biggest advance was on the creation of a formal process under the Paris Agreement in which states and their leaders would regularly and publicly detail the efforts they were making to address climate change, pinpoint areas where they were falling short and push each other to do more. The monitoring, reporting and verification of nationally determined contributions - states' emissions-cutting pledges - will be critical to this process. UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres cited signs of progress. Massive economies such as China and India are on track to surpass their Paris promises. Talanoa, a Fijian concept in which people listen to each other and seek solutions that benefit everyone, was the hosts' calling card. The Talanoa Dialogue has been added to the pre-2020 agenda to reflect a process of inclusion, process and transparent dialogue that will lead to the rule book being adopted at COP24 next year. Minister for Climate Action Denis Naughten outlined Irish successes in reducing emissions across sectors such as renewable energy, food waste, dairy and even beef production, but the latest Climate Change Performance Index ranked Ireland as the worst-performing country in Europe when it comes to action. COP23 put down a big marker on how regions, cities and businesses are now ""vital actors"" in decarbonising the world. A total of 20 US states, 110 US cities and more than 1,400 American businesses pledged in Bonn to ensure the US meets its commitment under the Paris Agreement even if the Trump administration pulls the US out. Currently, the world is on track for at least 3 degrees, which would bring catastrophic outcomes. \"

It is a steady, irresistible thrum that won't destroy the ozone layer, and could power the planet for decades: former United States vice-president Al Gore's boundless determination to prick consciences about the effects of global warming. The avuncular messiah of the modern age loudly bangs a drum for action and words on climate change, spreading his message during a turbulent period of political upheaval including the election of Donald Trump, who lambasted global warming as a 'very expensive hoax' and withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord. 'With all these new threats, there's never been a more important time to speak truth to power,' Gore sombrely observes, providing a snappy subtitle for the sequel. Like its predecessor, the film incorporates segments from Gore's slide-show lectures, which have been updated with scenes from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and flooding in Florida, the state which famously denied him the keys to the White House in the 2000 presidential election against George W Bush. There's no sense of lip-smacking Schadenfreude as Gore wades through water-logged streets and engages with local dignitaries. Breathtaking footage of the statesman atop a rapidly melting glacier in Greenland are intercut with snappy soundbites that anoint Gore as the lone voice of reason capable of deviating us from self-destruction. 'Big money has so much influence now,' he laments. 'Our democracy has been hacked.' Nowhere in the film is this more pronounced than footage from the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where consensus is countered by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. An unflustered Gore heads backstage to makes a few calls to powerful friends. Lo and behold, a few tense hours later, the accord is salvaged. Aside from lionising Gore, the sequel is blessed with scenes of undeniable emotional power. His 24-hour reality broadcast on November 13, 2015, in Paris is interrupted by shocking news of suicide bombings and shooting in the French capital, including an assault on the Bataclan theatre during an Eagles Of Death Metal concert. With glistening eyes, Gore stands before the largely French production crew and delivers a heartfelt pledge of solidarity. These simple, unscripted words resonate clearly and remind us of the undeniable power of strangers, from different cultures and backgrounds, to pull together in pursuit of a common goal - our survival.

Nowadays, he's a little older and greyer and more philosophical about ""the supreme court decision"" that put George W Bush in the White House. As the film ends, there's a definite touch of John Wayne's displaced, deliberate, departure in The Searchers. As with that character's efforts, one wonders if we require rescuing. Again. What more can be said about climate change that wasn't succinctly and eloquently covered in the original film's Futurama sketch on global warming, ""None Like It Hot!""? Book of Revelations Quite a bit, actually. Extreme weather, Gore notes, is now so commonplace that nightly news has come to resemble the Book of Revelations. These conditions, as demonstrated by the 2006 Syrian famine, breed political unrest. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris gives the former US vice-president an opportunity to tackle the crisis anew. Before the conference, we've already encountered India's articulate power minister Piyush Goyal, who rejects Gore's push for solar energy, saying: ""I'll do the same thing after 150 years."" \~ In Paris, Gore's last- minute negotiations, linking potential holdout India and renewable energy company SolarCity, offers both an immediate solution and a larger blueprint to solve the climate change crisis. Whether one agrees with Gore's assessment - that businesses, local government and individuals can work towards the emission targets set in Paris regardless - there's no doubting his sincerity and passion. The most urgent superhero film of the summer. Not bad for a PowerPoint presentation. We await An Inconvenient Threequel: Rise of the Electric Cars with great interest. \"
"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland5","France and Germany seek tougher measures","November 16, 2017 Thursday","The Irish Times","The leaders of France and Germany have moved to reinvigorate the UN climate change talks by committing to more demanding measures to reduce carbon emissions. In addresses to the high-level plenary session of the UN Climate Change Conference 2017 (known as COP23 Mr Macron said the UN's scientific expert panel would not be a euro short of what was required to do its work. The Trump administration, which is withdrawing from the Paris accord, has said it will cut funding for the group, known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provides guidance on global warming to governments. He said climate change brought ""unfair injustice for vulnerable underprivileged people"" and paid tribute to countries like Ireland who have joined the climate action body that supports developing countries. Dr Merkel said ""climate change will determine the destiny of all of us"". As a consequence Germany was going to double public financing of climate actions by 2020. She expected private business and banks to follow suit. ""We stand by Paris. We now have to stand together in implementing it, and we need appropriate rules,"" she added. Earlier, without naming the US, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier told national leaders and ministers that ""some who today have left the ship's bridge for the dinghy may return to our big ship in a couple of years."" Minister for Climate Action and Environment Denis Naughten, who is to address the COP23 session today, confirmed progress was being made, especially in supporting developing countries. While Ireland was ""in for criticism"" as it was not going to meet its 2020 emissions reduction targets, he said the country was a global leader in generating electricity from renewable sources, energy efficiency, and ""smart farming"", was achieving reductions of up to 10 per cent in emissions. \"
"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland6","'Marshall Plan' needed on climate, says Robinson","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Climate justice campaigner Mary Robinson has said she has become more optimistic about the global response to climate change and has urged a ""Marshall Plan"" to aid the process. Speaking in Bonn at a COP23 debate on actions required up to 2020 on implementing the Paris climate change agreement, the former president of Ireland said there was better understanding of climate change and its effects, and the landmark accord of 2015 was a major turning point. But there was a need to recapture the spirit of Paris, and ""to understand how we get to the 'no brainers'"", she added. These should include ending fossil fuel subsidies and implementing a ""Marshall Plan"" to ensure access to renewable energy, which was also critical to tackling global poverty. Johan Rockstr\'f6m, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said decarbonising the world's energy system was realisable, but his biggest concern was ""negative feedbacks"" in the Earth's atmosphere. The planet, because of its resilience, might have been ""man's best friend"" up to now, but he feared that if a tipping point was reached this century it would become a much more hostile place in which to live. The adviser to the pope on climate, John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said while he did not favour technologies to remove CO2 from the upper atmosphere to ensure Paris targets were achieved, he believed widespread adoption of innovation would enable a limit of 2 degrees to be achieved - and there was ""a whisper"" of a chance of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Climate Change Centre at Manchester University said the energy transition needed a Marshall Plan approach, and not just a focus on electricity from renewable sources. It required ""closing down incumbents"" - notably the use of peat, coal and gas in power generation. The scale of the problem was indicated by the need to retrofit the housing stock in the UK and Ireland, which was a job that would take up to 30 years. Speaking after the debate, Tr\'f3caire policy adviser Cliona Sharkey said the participants, who were ""heavy hitters"" in favour of climate justice, had countered the political viewpoint that said taking this route was ""a romantic illusion"". They had demonstrated the need for urgency, as ""every month matters"". ""The transition can be smooth. Nobody is saying it won't be challenging,"" she added. Developed countries had to accept trade-offs in the face of what other vulnerable countries were facing, Ms Sharkey said. A new global partnership to bring affordable insurance and other financial protection cover to millions of vulnerable people was announced by COP23 president Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji. The InsuResilience project was set up by G7 countries to insure 400 million people against the effects of climate change by 2020. \"
"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland7","Alliance signals end to use of coal in power generation; Group of 25 nations including Canada and UK aims to double in size by next year","November 17, 2017 Friday","The Irish Times","A dramatic announcement predicted to herald the end of coal use in power generation across much of the world was made by a new alliance of 25 states and regions at the United Nations climate talks in Bonn. The development yesterday was outside the high-level COP23 negotiations between more than 190 countries which conclude today. Details of the alliance, which aims to have 50 members by next year, were outlined by the UK and Canada. Notable absentee Chancellor Angela Merkel told delegates that withdrawing from coal use was on the agenda in talks to form a new government. ""The case against coal is unequivocal,"" said UK climate minister Claire Perry, This was, she added, on environmental and health grounds - air pollution from coal kills 800,000 people a year worldwide. ""The alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed."" The UK was the first state to commit to ending coal use - by 2025 - but the electricity generated by coal has already fallen from 40 per cent to 2 per cent since 2012. ""There is a human cost and an environmental cost but we don't need to pay that price when the price of renewables has plummeted,"" said Catherine McKenna, Canada's environment minister. ""I'm thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy - and this is only the beginning."" Breakthrough Full implementation of the Paris agreement, which dominated the talks, will not be realised until next year but Moroccan diplomats have helped broker a breakthrough, with wealthy countries accepting the need for further actions on carbon cuts up to 2020. There was also acceptance of the urgent need for a greater amount of ""climate finance"" to be provided to help countries cope with the effects of global warming. Climatologist Prof John Sweeney of Maynooth University said the acid test of today's COP23 outcome would be ""the extent to which pre-2020 actions are agreed"". Through much of the discussions, he understood there was a lack of a sense of urgency among wealthier countries in embracing the kind of emissions reductions needed. Likewise, financial pledges to developing countries did not reflect what was required, he said, given what was happening to them due to climate change. \"
"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland8","Wealthy states under pressure in climate talks; Developing countries insist limit on global temperature rise is critical","November 18, 2017 Saturday","The Irish Times","Heads of state and government representatives at the UN climate change talks have agreed a series of measures designed to put pressure on wealthy countries to step up ambitions in reducing CO2 emissions. This will involve greater focus on trying to keep global temperatures to 1.5 degrees; a key element of the 2015 Paris agreement. Developing countries, including small island states, said it was critical to them in staving off the worst effects of climate change. However, campaigners voiced disappointment on progress on funding for poorer nations to deal with the fallout from climate change. Delegates said the meeting had made progress on several important technical issues left unresolved in the Paris deal, such as how to measure and compare the individual contributions made by states around the world to limit carbon dioxide emissions. Participants and observers also hailed advances in the talks on how to increase emission-reduction commitments. On track There was relief that the effort to combat global warming remains broadly on track despite the US administration's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. Fiji, which hosted this COP23 conference, is to convene a year-long process with Poland, the hosts of COP24 in 2018, designed to maintain momentum up to 2020. The process will be informed by a UN report on world efforts to contain global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees this century as referred to in the Paris accord. The approach is ""anchoring that, and not 2 degrees as the target"", according a source close to the EU negotiating team. Progress under COP23 had been helped by the US being ""the dog that didn't bark"", one negotiator said. Its presence ""was not destructive in the real sense"" despite President Donald Trump's announcement in June that the US intends withdrawing from the Paris accord. 'Earliest opportunity' State department acting undersecretary Judith G Garner, told leaders meeting in plenary session the US would remain engaged in global climate change negotiations though it planned to exit the Paris agreement ""at the earliest opportunity"". It was a more conciliatory message than a presentation earlier in the week by White House officials promoting fossil fuels. Ms Garner said the US was reducing emissions and pursuing clean energy solutions through innovation. She also acknowledged the contribution being made by US states, cities and businesses, which had a major presence in Bonn. ""President Trump has made clear the US position with respect to the Paris agreement,"" Ms Garber said. ""Although he has indicated that the US intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favourable to the American people."" The former state department climate envoy under President Barack Obama Todd D Stern, who helped design the Paris agreement, also speaking in Bonn, said he believed America's absence from the global accord would be short-lived. - Additional reporting: The Financial Times \"

We need a radically new approach. We have no hope of achieving our 2020 climate agreement targets. Intermittent renewables pursued without recourse to other low-carbon baseload power, such as provided by nuclear and hydro, has proven to be an abject failure in climate terms and also leads to very expensive electricity for consumers. The climate leaders in Europe are countries with large elements of nuclear and/or hydro, such as France, Sweden and Switzerland. Dr James Hansen , the grandfather of the climate change movement, recently spoke at COP23 , the informal name for the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Bonn, and advocated for the adoption of more nuclear power to aid decarbonisation. Germany has opened two new coal plants in the last three years. Its emissions have been flat or rising for seven years.

Frank McGovern, the Environmental Protection Agency's chief climate scientist, said the talks had confronted ""tricky issues that had hung around for years"" - notably, from an Irish perspective, agriculture emissions. Food security There was now a greater understanding among EU and global partners on what was needed to reduce carbon emissions associated with farming, he said. In recent years, he said, Ireland had worked outside the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change process with New Zealand and Latin American countries with large farming sectors in assessing best approaches while maintaining food security and protecting food production. Technology While Ireland was facing a challenge in addressing its agricultural emissions, it had invested in technology and research, and accepted more needed to be done. The parties have agreed to work on mitigation approaches to reduce agricultural emissions and identify adaptation measures to counter climate change's impact on farming. These will be informed by a special report on land use and food production from the UN's scientific advisory body, known as the IPCC, in 2019. Land management would be the key element in reducing emissions, he said. That included improving livestock and managing manure appropriately. While forestry importance in providing carbon sinks was known, the issue of carbon in soils, and how it is measured, needed further work. As Ireland had committed to ""carbon neutrality"" in agriculture, it would have to look at use of land resources for food, energy and ""ecosystem services"" to store carbon - and ensure it had robust systems to quantify associated emissions. \"

The former president cited the case of small island states which risked literally going under because of rising sea levels and countries threatened with mass migration caused by the impact of climate changes. Not enough progress had been made on the issue, but there was another round to go in December with a summit in France, she said. The intervention of French president Emmanuel Macron had been ""very strong"", similarly that of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, she said. Both had underlined they were not put out by the absence of the US. ""They both mentioned Trump [and] 'it's not going to disturb us'. That was good to hear,"" she added. While Fiji's presidency of the COP23 talks had facilitated meaningful engagement, the high level negotiations had not gone as well, she said. There had been a very big Chinese influence, which had slowed decisions. That may have been to do with the absence of the US, and a view that decisions would be pushed on to next year, she suggested. Mr Macron and Dr Merkel, however, showed leadership on the need for sharper declines of carbon emissions, which may be an attempt to seize that ground, she said. 'Not doing well' ""Ireland, within the European countries, is not doing very well and that is not good,"" Mrs Robinson added. ""We still have not got the right mindset - all of us - to say anything we can do now, we must do it, because we have the time - just about - to do it. If we don't, that time is gone and nature will begin to have these bad impacts,"" she said. Local and indigenous women's voices especially were absent from decision- making on climate change, she said. They needed to be heard and allowed to participate in the collective global response. As a consequence she was ""very pleased"" by the adoption of the gender action plan to address this inequality and adoption of the UN Local and Indigenous People's Platform.

The State has fallen 28 places to 49th out of 56 countries ranked in the 2018 Climate Change Performance Index. The report, produced by Germanwatch and the New Climate Institute (NCI), says ""greater efforts have been made globally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions"" and highlights positive developments on switching to renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. However, it says ""no country is doing enough to prevent dangerous greenhouse gas emissions"". Progress on this front was was still not in line with the commitments contained in the Paris Agreement on climate change and all countries must deliver much stronger policies to reduce polluting emissions, the report adds. In light of steps taken by the Trump administration, the US is placed 56th on the index but the report points to positive action being taken by individual US states, cities and companies in reducing CO2 emissions. The index ranks the 56 countries whose combined emissions account for 90 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases. The analysis is based on evaluating emissions; adoption of renewable energy; energy use; and climate policy. Report co-author Jan Burck told The Irish Times that rising emissions were Ireland's difficulty, even though performance on this front had improved in the past five years. The State was ""nowhere close to being on track"" in its commitments to keep global temperatures to within 2 degrees"" currently and up to 2030. However, he did note ""a very positive trend in the development of renewable energy"". The report, which comes as delegates from 200 nations gather in Bonn to discuss climate action at COP23 Agricultural emissions Dietary changes in livestock and more efficient fertiliser use could play their part in reducing agricultural emissions, added Prof Niklas H\'f6hne of NCI. Ireland's polluting emissions are rising and the State is failing to meet EU obligations, he added. ""The Government is not supporting greater EU ambition and, despite some positive noises, there is little indication that this situation is likely to change any time soon. This hypocrisy on climate change not only has significant reputational damage for Ireland but brings with it extremely negative impacts for our economy, our local environment and our health."" Cara Augustenborg of Friends of the Earth Ireland said the Citizens' Assembly put forward 13 concrete recommendations for climate action to allow Ireland to catch up with our European neighbours ""and end nearly a decade of dithering and delay"". ""Yet at national level, we've seen a new climate action plan which does not guarantee any immediate reductions in pollution. And at EU level, we've seen repeated Government efforts to have loopholes inserted into EU legislation currently under negotiation which would hinder greater climate action."" \"
"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland15","Key climate change updates after Bonn; Some pertinent answers to current climate change questions","November 30, 2017 Thursday","The Irish Times","An important international meeting about climate change took place in Bonn, Germany earlier this month. Attended by more than 10,000 delegates, it received relatively little attention in the world's press - with some exceptions - but it laid down an important marker in global politics. Climate change shows every sign of becoming the defining issue of our time. So what are the key updates? Yet another climate meeting - what was it all about? Bonn was the 23rd UN Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ), an annual international meeting to agree plans to address climate change. Two years ago, the Paris meeting made history by establishing an agreement to prevent global warming of more than two degrees by the end of the century - and 1.5 degrees if at all possible. Bonn represents the next phase of the project. In what way? The purpose of the Bonn meeting was to draw up rules and guidelines to implement the Paris Agreement, due to come into force in 2020. This amounted to each nation agreeing to a roadmap to achieve necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across different sectors such as agriculture and transport. Yet the US is pulling out of the Paris Agreement? Yes, US president Donald Trump has declared he will remove the US from the Paris accord. It's disappointing, but no great surprise. For many years now, most Republican senators have refused to accept the scientific verdict of a link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Since Trump's election, we have seen the appointment of fossil fuel advocates and climate sceptics to almost all key US governmental positions concerned with the environment, so the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement was predictable. In fact, the official US delegation at Bonn hosted a meeting extolling the virtues of coal. Won't the loss of the US scupper the Paris Agreement? Ironically, the White House stance seems to have concentrated political opinion. Another urgent prompt is we are beginning to experience the first effects of climate change manifest as an increased frequency of severe storms, heat waves and flooding. Now that the general public is beginning to take the issue more seriously, politicians will follow. And the media? It's curious climate change shows every sign of becoming the defining issue of the 21st century, yet media coverage of the issue remains sporadic. Worse, large sections of the tabloid press have been peddling climate scepticism for years. However, the public mood is changing and will change further as global warming manifests itself. What about Ireland? There's no denying Ireland's emissions are increasing in major sectors such as transport and agriculture. Indeed, we are ranked lowest of all European countries in terms of our action on climate change. Aren't we bound by EU targets? We are, but we will probably miss our 2020 targets and face a hefty fine. You can expect this to be portrayed as bureaucrats imposing unreasonable targets. We're hardly the only ones? That's true, but not much of a consolation. The latest studies suggest even if each country meets its commitments under the Paris Agreement, our planet will likely warm by more than two degrees by the end of the century, the limit beyond which impacts of climate change are expected to become very severe. How trustworthy is that forecast? There is no doubt the earth's climate is sensitive to certain greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and no doubt an increase in the concentration of such gases is beginning to have an effect. If the phenomenon continues unchecked, we can expect a continuing rise in surface temperatures and sea levels, resulting in increased drought in many parts of Africa and increased flooding in many parts of Asia, to mention just two outcomes. We can also expect a rise in political instability in climate-vulnerable regions, accompanied by a global refugee problem, so it's not a problem we can ignore.

"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland16","Prince meets hurricane victims","November 20, 2017 Monday","Belfast Telegraph","THE Prince of Wales has praised the ""resilience"" of the people of Dominica as he witnessed the damage caused to the Caribbean island by Hurricane Maria. Charles stood among the ruins of Pichelin village, which was battered by torrential flooding and high winds in September, and sympathised with the residents who have remained. With a mangled car behind him, the heir to the throne chatted to locals who were standing in front of the village general store. The front of the store was swept away by the deluge that brought trees, boulders and other debris down from hill tops. Marilyn Leatham (53), from a neighbouring village, said: ""The Prince told me 'you're resilient people - hold on'. It means the world to us to have him here and it means the world that he is thinking of us. The Prince makes us feel proud as people."" Charles, with international development secretary Penny Mordaunt, walked through the village shaking the hands of locals, stopping to chat briefly and watched a dance performance by local school children. Khalin Thomas (26), whose grandmother's store was washed away, said: ""We managed to survive the hurricane somehow, the village is between two rivers but luckily we're still here. ""The car next to my grandmother's store was across the street and the water just picked it up and tossed it across the street."" Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit met with Charles during the visit. Speaking last week at Cop 23 , the UN's climate change talks, the PM said of the natural disaster: ""When dawn broke, the scenes of utter devastation across this once lush green island were heartbreaking.'' He told delegates at the global summit in Bonn, Germany: ""In some areas where houses once stood there lay mounds of dirt and debris, others had their roofs blown off, landslides scarred the landscape, trees were uprooted or laid bare and flood waters raged. Mr Skerrit added: ""Two months later 95% of the country remains without electricity, our water systems are compromised, and many citizens remain displaced and in shelters.'' \"
"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland17","Climate change revolution is coming - it's up to us not to get let left behind economically","November 4, 2017 Saturday","Irish Independent","Adamage is still being cleared after Ophelia, the worst storm to hit us in 50 years. But the destruction caused by this extreme weather event should make us all sit up and realise that this was not extreme: unless we act, this will soon be normal. The other morning, I walked to work in Dublin and saw people dressed in T-shirts. It's the first week of November and winter has barely made a whimper, a scene that is beginning to fit a familiar pattern. We were also told last week that carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is at the highest levels in more than 800,000 years - that's according to a new report by the World Meteorological Organisation ( W MO) . We're literally in danger of losing the air that we breathe. That's why the 11 days of Cop 23 talks that begin in Bonn, Germany, next week matter. Ireland, along with 197 other parties to the historic 2015 Paris UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (Cop 21), will meet and try to work out how to implement that deal. Two years ago, the world agreed a plan that would limit global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius by the year 2100 compared to average temperatures at the start of the industrial era - with hopes to even limit the increase to 1.5 degrees, if possible. The 2C target means the world can produce 3.6 trillion tonnes of greenhouses gases annually and no more. And that's just to have a 66pc chance of hitting the 2C mark. The deal also aims to remove these gases from the atmosphere between 2050 and 2100. Can we do it? We must try to - and if we don't, we can expect more catastrophic storms, rising sea levels, devastation of food crops and huge pressures on the Earth's scarce resources such as fuel and water. We all know that Barack Obama, when he was president, pledged the US to meet these climate change targets. We also now know that Donald Trump is trying to reverse this by ramping up fossil fuel production in the US, just as the world moves away from these negative practices. So why does it matter to Ireland? board, is there any point trying to implement the Paris deal? The answer is an emphatic yes. Despite his pronouncements, corporate America and states such as California are part of a We Are Still In campaign. Indeed, among those present in Bonn will be dozens of America's climate champions including state governors, key business leaders and academics. They will stand in solidarity with nations including Ireland, showing the world that US leadership on climate change extends beyond federal policy. They are stepping up because their very future is at stake. In simple terms, to implement the Paris agreement, hard cash is required - and lots of it. There will be winners and those who will get left behind. Paris binds all countries to undertake economy-wide measures to reduce emissions. These efforts require significant finance to build and scale projects that can Relevant, recent examples that spring to mind include:  Finance: Dutch tech giant Philips has agreed a deal with banks that links its sustainability performance to the interest rate on a (EURO)1bn loan. Insurance giants Axa and Allianz are to stop financing companies whose businesses are based on coal.  Energy efficiency: Bloomberg last week opened a new \£31bn European HQ in London, the world's most sustainable office building using 70pc less water and 40pc less energy than a typical office block.  Innovation and Cleantech: Irish firms are world leaders. HUB Controls Ltd was this week named in the World's Top Three Cleantech companies at an event in London. So, regardless of how much progress is made in Bonn, the direction of travel to a sustainable, low-carbon economy is unstoppable, with or without US leadership. At home, up to (EURO)28bn in green financial activities, including (EURO)11bn in green bonds, is managed from, domiciled or listed in this country. That figure is growing as Ireland, in line with the Government's IFS 2020 Strategy, becomes a financial centre at the vanguard of this transition. Sustainable Nation Ireland, which promotes Ireland as a hub for sustainable business and investment, last month signed the Casablanca Declaration - an important United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) initiative, which aligns major financial centres including Dublin as key hubs for green money and investment. Pursuing this agenda will be extremely rewarding, making Ireland a 'go-to' destination for green and sustainability-themed business and capital, as well as helping to safeguard the planet's ecosystem for future generations. On a global level, green and sustainable finance is booming, in line with advances in technology, the increasing competitiveness of renewables, innovation in energy storage and electric vehicles and the internet of things, which helps energy to be used more efficiently. These trends are both a massive opportunity and threat to Irish and global firms, which can choose to position themselves as leaders, or risk being left behind as the sustainability agenda spreads to all sectors of the global economy. Cop 23 in Bonn represents the promise of bright future. Green finance and innovation in cleantech is a growth story, presenting an exciting and lucrative opportunity for Ireland. We would be foolish not to grasp it with both hands. Stephen Nolan is CEO of Sustainable Nation Ireland \"

""The plateau of last year was not peak emissions after all,"" conclude the researchers, a group of 76 scientists based in 15 countries.Speaking at COP23, Glen Peters of the Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo said China's emissions of CO2 were set to rise by 3.5 per cent, driven by more coal demand and stronger economic growth.

COP23 in Bonn showed determination to push on without the US, a major backer of the accord up to recently. But there is much unfinished business.The US sent a small ""rump delegation"" to Germany. White House officials hosted a shambolic event on ""the role of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuels and nuclear power in climate mitigation"" - with an emphasis on coal. It prompted the UN climate envoy and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to remark: ""Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit."" It had a galvanising effect on almost all others present, while the high-level talks were bolstered by Syria and Nicaragua finally endorsing the 2015 agreement, ensuring the US was truly isolated on the world stage.In the tricky final days of negotiation, senior American diplomat Judith G Garner said the US would remain engaged in global climate-change negotiations, although planning to exit the Paris Agreement ""at the earliest opportunity"". COP23 was billed as an interim, largely technical round of talks to agree ""the Paris rule book"" to come into force in 2020. But the backdrop of a year of extreme weather events, further indications of a warming world and the throwing of an environmental scud into the room by Trump in June when he announced he was pulling the US out of Paris ensured the agenda was broadened.New urgency Former Irish president Mary RobinsonTheir case was that to have any hope of achieving a 1.5-degree limit to the rise in global temperatures this century, action was necessary immediately.Latest analysis from the Global Carbon Project charted greenhouse gas emissions rising in 2017 after three consecutive flat years. And so ""pre-2020 actions"" forced their way into discussions. A number of European countries agreed to accelerate emissions cuts even before 2020, when compliance targets begin to take effect. There is no indication that Ireland is in that vanguard. The question of how to pay for problems relating to changes in climate already being experienced by many poor nations went unanswered again. While wealthier countries had previously promised $100 billion annually to vulnerable countries, there were indications of an awareness that this will not be enough. Adoption of a gender action plan was ""a major achievement as it recognises the critical role of women in climate action"", said Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which hosted COP23.A local and indigenous peoples platform was also put in place, ending years of stalling on both fronts.Biggest advance The biggest advance was on the creation of a formal process under the Paris Agreement in which states and their leaders would regularly and publicly detail the efforts they were making to address climate change, pinpoint areas where they were falling short and push each other to do more.The monitoring, reporting and verification of nationally determined contributions - states' emissions-cutting pledges - will be critical to this process.UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres cited signs of progress. Massive economies such as China and India are on track to surpass their Paris promises. Talanoa, a Fijian concept in which people listen to each other and seek solutions that benefit everyone, was the hosts' calling card. The Talanoa Dialogue has been added to the pre-2020 agenda to reflect a process of inclusion, process and transparent dialogue that will lead to the rule book being adopted at COP24 next year.Minister for Climate Action Denis Naughten outl"

The Trump administration, which is withdrawing from the Paris accord, has said it will cut funding for the group, known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provides guidance on global warming to governments.He said climate change brought ""unfair injustice for vulnerable underprivileged people"" and paid tribute to countries like Ireland who have joined the climate action body that supports developing countries.Dr Merkel said ""climate change will determine the destiny of all of us"". As a consequence Germany was going to double public financing of climate actions by 2020. She expected private business and banks to follow suit.""We stand by Paris. We now have to stand together in implementing it, and we need appropriate rules,"" she added.Earlier, without naming the US, German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier told national leaders and ministers that ""some who today have left the ship's bridge for the dinghy may return to our big ship in a couple of years.""Minister for Climate Action and Environment Denis Naughten, who is to address the COP23 session today, confirmed progress was being made, especially in supporting developing countries.

"COP23","Ireland","COP23_Ireland6","'Marshall Plan' needed on climate, says Robinson","November 15, 2017 Wednesday","The Irish Times","Climate justice campaigner Mary Robinson has said she has become more optimistic about the global response to climate change and has urged a ""Marshall Plan"" to aid the process. Speaking in Bonn at a COP23 debate on actions required up to 2020 on implementing the Paris climate change agreement, the former president of Ireland said there was better understanding of climate change and its effects, and the landmark accord of 2015 was a major turning point. But there was a need to recapture the spirit of Paris, and ""to understand how we get to the 'no brainers'"", she added. These should include ending fossil fuel subsidies and implementing a ""Marshall Plan"" to ensure access to renewable energy, which was also critical to tackling global poverty.Johan Rockstr\'f6m, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said decarbonising the world's energy system was realisable, but his biggest concern was ""negative feedbacks"" in the Earth's atmosphere. The planet, because of its resilience, might have been ""man's best friend"" up to now, but he feared that if a tipping point was reached this century it would become a much more hostile place in which to live.The adviser to the pope on climate, John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said while he did not favour technologies to remove CO2 from the upper atmosphere to ensure Paris targets were achieved, he believed widespread adoption of innovation would enable a limit of 2 degrees to be achieved - and there was ""a whisper"" of a chance of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees.Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Climate Change Centre at Manchester University said the energy transition needed a Marshall Plan approach, and not just a focus on electricity from renewable sources. It required ""closing down incumbents"" - notably the use of peat, coal and gas in power generation. The scale of the problem was indicated by the need to retrofit the housing stock in the UK and Ireland, which was a job that would take up to 30 years.Speaking after the debate, Tr\'f3caire policy adviser Cliona Sharkey said the participants, who were ""heavy hitters"" in favour of climate justice, had countered the political viewpoint that said taking this route was ""a romantic illusion"". They had demonstrated the need for urgency, as ""every month matters"". ""The transition can be smooth. Nobody is saying it won't be challenging,"" she added. Developed countries had to accept trade-offs in the face of what other vulnerable countries were facing, Ms Sharkey said. A new global partnership to bring affordable insurance and other financial protection cover to millions of vulnerable people was announced by COP23 president Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji. The InsuResilience project was set up by G7 countries to insure 400 million people against the effects of climate change by 2020. \l"

This will involve greater focus on trying to keep global temperatures to 1.5 degrees; a key element of the 2015 Paris agreement. Developing countries, including small island states, said it was critical to them in staving off the worst effects of climate change. However, campaigners voiced disappointment on progress on funding for poorer nations to deal with the fallout from climate change.Delegates said the meeting had made progress on several important technical issues left unresolved in the Paris deal, such as how to measure and compare the individual contributions made by states around the world to limit carbon dioxide emissions. Participants and observers also hailed advances in the talks on how to increase emission-reduction commitments. On track There was relief that the effort to combat global warming remains broadly on track despite the US administration's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. Fiji, which hosted this COP23 conference, is to convene a year-long process with Poland, the hosts of COP24 in 2018, designed to maintain momentum up to 2020.The process will be informed by a UN report on world efforts to contain global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees this century as referred to in the Paris accord. The approach is ""anchoring that, and not 2 degrees as the target"", according a source close to the EU negotiating team.Progress under COP23 had been helped by the US being ""the dog that didn't bark"", one negotiator said. Its presence ""was not destructive in the real sense"" despite President Donald Trump's announcement in June that the US intends withdrawing from the Paris accord.'Earliest opportunity' State department acting undersecretary Judith G Garner, told leaders meeting in plenary session the US would remain engaged in global climate change negotiations though it planned to exit the Paris agreement ""at the earliest opportunity"". It was a more conciliatory message than a presentation earlier in the week by White House officials promoting fossil fuels. Ms Garner said the US was reducing emissions and pursuing clean energy solutions through innovation. She also acknowledged the contribution being made by US states, cities and businesses, which had a major presence in Bonn.""President Trump has made clear the US position with respect to the Paris agreement,"" Ms Garber said. ""Although he has indicated that the US intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favourable to the American people.""The former state department climate envoy under President Barack Obama Todd D Stern, who helped design the Paris agreement, also speaking in Bonn, said he believed America's absence from the global accord would be short-lived. - Additional reporting: The Financial Times\l"

We need a radically new approach. We have no hope of achieving our 2020 climate agreement targets. Intermittent renewables pursued without recourse to other low-carbon baseload power, such as provided by nuclear and hydro, has proven to be an abject failure in climate terms and also leads to very expensive electricity for consumers. The climate leaders in Europe are countries with large elements of nuclear and/or hydro, such as France, Sweden and Switzerland. Dr James Hansen , the grandfather of the climate change movement, recently spoke at COP23, the informal name for the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Bonn, and advocated for the adoption of more nuclear power to aid decarbonisation. Germany has opened two new coal plants in the last three years. Its emissions have been flat or rising for seven years.Ireland needs to realise the wonder of carbon-free energy on tap though modern nuclear power generation.

In recent years, he said, Ireland had worked outside the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change process with New Zealand and Latin American countries with large farming sectors in assessing best approaches while maintaining food security and protecting food production. Technology While Ireland was facing a challenge in addressing its agricultural emissions, it had invested in technology and research, and accepted more needed to be done.The parties have agreed to work on mitigation approaches to reduce agricultural emissions and identify adaptation measures to counter climate change's impact on farming. These will be informed by a special report on land use and food production from the UN's scientific advisory body, known as the IPCC, in 2019.Land management would be the key element in reducing emissions, he said. That included improving livestock and managing manure appropriately. While forestry importance in providing carbon sinks was known, the issue of carbon in soils, and how it is measured, needed further work.As Ireland had committed to ""carbon neutrality"" in agriculture, it would have to look at use of land resources for food, energy and ""ecosystem services"" to store carbon - and ensure it had robust systems to quantify associated emissions.\l"

And that's just to have a 66pc chance of hitting the 2C mark. The deal also aims to remove these gases from the atmosphere between 2050 and 2100.Can we do it? We must try to - and if we don't, we can expect more catastrophic storms, rising sea levels, devastation of food crops and huge pressures on the Earth's scarce resources such as fuel and water.We all know that Barack Obama, when he was president, pledged the US to meet these climate change targets.We also now know that Donald Trump is trying to reverse this by ramping up fossil fuel production in the US, just as the world moves away from these negative practices.So why does it matter to Ireland? board, is there any point trying to implement the Paris deal? The answer is an emphatic yes. Despite his pronouncements, corporate America and states such as California are part of a We Are Still In campaign.Indeed, among those present in Bonn will be dozens of America's climate champions including state governors, key business leaders and academics.They will stand in solidarity with nations including Ireland, showing the world that US leadership on climate change extends beyond federal policy.They are stepping up because their very future is at stake.In simple terms, to implement the Paris agreement, hard cash is required - and lots of it. There will be winners and those who will get left behind.Paris binds all countries to undertake economy-wide measures to reduce emissions. These efforts require significant finance to build and scale projects that can Relevant, recent examples that spring to mind include:  Finance: Dutch tech giant Philips has agreed a deal with banks that links its sustainability performance to the interest rate on a (EURO)1bn loan. Insurance giants Axa and Allianz are to stop financing companies whose businesses are based on coal. Energy efficiency: Bloomberg last week opened a new \£31bn European HQ in London, the world's most sustainable office building using 70pc less water and 40pc less energy than a typical office block. Innovation and Cleantech: Irish firms are world leaders. HUB Controls Ltd was this week named in the World's Top Three Cleantech companies at an event in London.So, regardless of how much progress is made in Bonn, the direction of travel to a sustainable, low-carbon economy is unstoppable, with or without US leadership.At home, up to (EURO)28bn in green financial activities, including (EURO)11bn in green bonds, is managed from, domiciled or listed in this country.

Neither an explicit commitment on countries\' carbon neutrality by 2050 nor a promise to end fossil-fuel subsidies was made, which had been placed high on the agenda of COP26 . Given that 82% of the world\' s greenhouse-gas emissions were generated by G20 countries as of 2020, the very weak consensus at the Rome summit clearly does not bode well for COP26 and, more important, the world\' s action against climate change. One needs to realize that the largest  blockers on climate issues are either the world\' s largest emitters (China, the US and India) or the largest exporters of HYPERLINK https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiN9KaFj_nzAhUHzzgGHeN5AMsQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBrown_energy&usg=AOvVaw1ASQGYwFPms0h6Hntp5UfB brown energy (Australia, Russia or Saudi Arabia). China and Russia have pushed their net-zero targets to 2060, and India even further, 20 2070. This is much later than the mid-century target thought to be necessary to keep the increase in global warming over pre-industrial levels to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Australia has only recently pledged net zero by 2050 under mounting peer pressure, while Saudi Arabia aims for 2060, but will still try to retain its primacy in oil production.\~ Beyond the still relatively late commitments for carbon neutrality and the lack of concrete plans for the use of coal in the energy mix, two important issues seem to have been absent from the discussion so far. One is the decarbonization of global supply-chain plays given that eight key supply chains account for 50% of total emissions. One potential path would imply greening but also shortening supply chains toward a more regional rather than global model, which obviously has important economic but also geopolitical consequences. The second missing point is a strategy for global carbon pricing. While the momentum for carbon pricing is increasing, with an extension to new sectors in Europe but also a new national-level emission-trading system in China since July, it is still far from complete. Beyond increasing the scope (with the US as a huge missing point), it is also important to coordinate these efforts, so as to avoid carbon leakage.\~\~ Two more issues to explain the very minimal consensus reached on climate by the G20. First is the increasingly serious power crunch in Europe and China, and now moving beyond those regions. The second issue is geopolitics, as shown clearly in the absence of key leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping from the summit, notwithstanding their crucial roles in reaching a coordinated solution to climate change. In short, the limited breakthroughs at the G20 Summit foreshadowed the difficulties of reaching consensus at COP26 . Beyond the obviously different national interests, the power crunch is clearly not helping, let alone the very tense relations between the US and China. Moving forward, COP26 could mark a change in strategy as regards finding a solution to climate change by moving from a cooperative approach to one based on leverage. In that scenario, one should not dismiss the possibility of an alliance among the US, the UK and the European Union on taxing carbon, including overseas carbon, following the steps of the EU\' s newly approved HYPERLINK https://economics.rabobank.com/publications/2021/july/cbam-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-eu-explained/ Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism Alicia Garcia Herrero is senior research fellow at Bruegel and chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis .

From simple encounters in a shopping mall to (international) politics, we no longer have the time or patience for other human beings, as we are so self-centered that the  me syndrome appears to be the only pattern that our egos are willing to follow. Gains and losses are measured only according to our short-term objectives, and others\' feelings or opinions are taken out of the equation, as we simply cannot be bothered to look at the grand scheme of things and be decent enough to do the right thing. Sadly, the same applies to climate change. Although it is apparent that we are in this together, some of us still want to play the blame game and choose to be cynical about the future of this planet and the next generations. Let us take Prince Charles, who HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/uks-prince-charles-deliver-opening-address-cop26-2021-10-27/ delivered the opening address at COP26 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference now under way in Glasgow, for example.

Notably, bearing in mind that the British heir to the throne, who has spent 50 years  trying to raise awareness about climate change, allegedly HYPERLINK releases more than 430 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year by traveling with private\~jets and helicopters, the fact that he HYPERLINK https://www.topgear.com/car-news/retro/prince-charles-aston-martin-db6-runs-wine-and-cheese converted his 51-year-old Aston Martin DB6 to HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/11/prince-charles-car-runs-on-cheese-wine-byproducts run on  surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process is a bad joke. Another questionable star of the COP26 show was European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who, as usual, did\~not\~miss\~a\~chance\~to\~voice\~her\~solidarity\~with the US by HYPERLINK parroting President Joe Biden and condemning China and Russia in an interview with CNN.  If we look at China, I think we should remind them that they have the ambition of global leadership. That should match with global climate leadership, HYPERLINK said von der Leyen, adding that  we would have liked to see China and Russia being here. What is especially ironic about the president of the EC lecturing others on  climate leadership while urging  all of us to do whatever it takes now to limit global warming, because nature can no longer pay the price of humans\' carbon emissions, during her COP26 HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_5741 speech , is that she is a hypocrite, as her lofty words do not match her HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/11/02/revealed-air-miles-ursula-used-private-jet-travel-just-31-miles/ actions .

According to a recent HYPERLINK https://institute.eib.org/2021/10/eib-climate-survey-climate-change-biggest-challenge-of-the-century/ survey conducted by the European Investment Bank, we European citizens are under no illusions that our governments will fail to handle the climate crisis that 81% of us view it as the  biggest challenge of this century. The sad truth is that 75% of respondents are more HYPERLINK https://www.eib.org/en/surveys/climate-survey/4th-climate-survey/skepticism-reduced-carbon-emission-targets.htm concerned about the climate crisis than their governments, and 58% believe their own country will not drastically reduce its CO2 emissions by 2050. The question is: Why does the European Union brag so much about its (over)ambitious climate plan known as  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/green-deal/eu-plan-for-a-green-transition/ Fit for 55  and put so much effort into condemning Beijing and Moscow?

We do this because we believe this is the way we gain economic and technological advantage, said De Croo, adding that  we also do it because we will use it almost as a trade weapon against big polluters such as China and Russia. While European leaders are busy weaponizing their climate policy to antagonize Beijing and Moscow, both Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin made a powerful statement by refusing to contribute to the already HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/cop26-flights-carbon-footprint-climate-b1949024.html?utm_content=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1635767961 high carbon footprint COP26 What is most frightening about European eco-cynicism is that it is proving a lack of sincerity and willingness to join hands with other great powers to tackle the common climate challenge, as well as deep contempt for its own citizens\' legitimate concerns. Whatever we may think about Russia and China, we have no other choice but to cooperate, not compete, with them on the climate. Otherwise, our shared future looks bleak. \"

The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Steering Group) (Note 1) supports the COP26 goals and on this occasion reaffirms its commitment to strengthening Hong Kong's financial ecosystem for a greener and more sustainable future and reiterates its support for Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 (Note 2) of the Government. In particular, the Steering Group welcomes:  The publication by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation of the prototype for the climate disclosure standard (Note 3). A comprehensive global baseline for climate disclosure standards can provide market participants with clear regulatory expectations and improve the transparency, comparability and reliability of corporate disclosures. As the financial risks associated with climate change are more widely recognised and environmental, social and governance investing becomes more common, a global baseline for corporate disclosures will also help investors align their investment strategies with the transition to carbon neutrality. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) will maintain their close collaboration with stakeholders including the Financial Reporting Council and the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants with a view to evaluating and potentially developing a roadmap to adopt this standard.  The publication of Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) report by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) (Note 4). The Steering Group recognises the CGT as a key driver of convergence that facilitates the scaling up of international green finance flows and will continue its work with the aim of making use of the CGT.  The global advances in building a worldwide carbon market including voluntary carbon market. The Steering Group recognises the associated opportunities for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and will continue efforts, under its Carbon Market Work Stream, in capitalising on Hong Kong's unique position in driving global capital flows with a view to developing Hong Kong into a regional carbon trading centre. The Steering Group will continue to monitor international developments in green and sustainable finance and support international initiatives, contributing to efforts to promote climate-related disclosures and climate-focused scenario analysis through active participation in various international fora, such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions Sustainable Finance Task Force, the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System and the IPSF. Co-Chair of the Steering Group and the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Mr Eddie Yue, said: "" COP26 once again highlighted the critical role that finance plays in accelerating and supporting the transition to net zero. The Steering Group will continue to focus on the key enablers to scaling up sustainable finance, including consistent and comparable disclosure, harmonised standards, talent and data, as well as explore the opportunities, such as in the carbon markets."" Co-Chair of the Steering Group and the Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Mr Ashley Alder, said: ""Hong Kong's pivotal role in connecting vast amounts of global capital with the Mainland market, together with its adoption of a climate reporting standard, will help significantly advance green and sustainable finance development regionally and globally. We will continue working closely with our fellow regulators, the Government and the industry to ensure that Hong Kong continues to develop as a leading international sustainable finance hub."" The Steering Group will discuss further steps to advance Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance agenda in its next meeting in December 2021.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong5","Why progress at COP26 is crucial","November 3, 2021 Wednesday 4:46 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","COP26 , which is taking place in Glasgow, is the latest in a series of meetings through which the world\' s governments attempt to deal with climate change. COP stands for  Conference of the Parties : these 197 parties are the United Nations member countries, plus a few small non-UN member countries and the European Union, all of which support the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This was set up in 1992 to organize a global response to what most people then called the  greenhouse effect. It\' s COP26 simply because this is the 26th meeting. The location of COP meetings changes each time. The last meeting was in Madrid in 2019. There was no COP in 2020 because of Covid-19. The most important COP so far was the 2015 meeting in Paris, which HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement agreed to  limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees, over pre-industrial levels. It\' s possible to set a target like this because scientific research has recognized a HYPERLINK https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide close relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide in the global atmosphere and its average temperature. In order to achieve the target of  well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees, the Paris Agreement HYPERLINK committed to  reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century. The main task for COP26 is to follow through on this commitment and produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that hold 21st-century global warming as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. As you can imagine, getting 197 different countries, all with their own circumstances and interests, to agree to such plans isn\' t exactly straightforward: After all, it took 23 years to get to the Paris Agreement. Most famously, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement when president, although it returned after Joe Biden\' s election. So there is some uncertainty about how successful COP26 will be. The main method for reducing emissions is the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country: These are individual countries\' climate action plans. For example, the UK\' s HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-nationally-determined-contribution-communication-to-the-unfccc most recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. The main problem facing COP26 is that the combined NDCs of all the parties aren\' t enough to meet the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement. If you combine all the current plans and promises contained in the NDCs, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, and if you look at actual emissions now, they would lead to a global temperature increase HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/global/cat-thermometer/ of 2.9 degrees by 2100. So there is a need for much-improved NDCs, plus effective ways to ensure that countries actually cut all the emissions they pledged to. One of the most important ways is for wealthy countries to provide https://theconversation.com/wheres-the-money-climate-fight-podcast-part-1-transcript-169287 financial support to enable less wealthy countries to cut emissions, which was an important part of the Paris Agreement but hasn\' t been fully acted on yet. Why this matters COP26 matters because the window is quickly closing on the Paris Agreement\' s 1.5-degree target: If emissions don\' t fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will have been added to the atmosphere to keep the temperature from rising higher. Current emissions need to be HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ halved by 2030 to have about a 50:50 chance of keeping to 1.5 degrees. The longer the world delays before cutting emissions, either the harsher the cuts will need to be to meet the target, or the target will be missed altogether. The Paris Agreement matters because a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/what-will-the-world-actually-look-like-at-1-5-c-of-warming-68763 1.5-degree world is safer than a 2-degree world. For example, the proportion of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every five years is almost three times as high at 2 degrees compared with 1.5 degrees. The reduction in corn (maize) harvests in the tropical regions is more than twice as great at 2 degrees, and HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/insights/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15c-and-2c-warming coral reefs would be largely eliminated . If COP26 COP26 as part of the long-term project to keep Earth as safe and habitable as possible for all its people, and the more successful it is, the easier that will be.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong6","Next decade will reveal if COP26 succeeded","November 13, 2021 Saturday 2:00 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","At COP26 Countries that in past years fought tooth-and-nail against stronger action stepped up with new commitments. Many of them joined an array of new partnerships and alliances struck in the first week. As I write, negotiators are locked in tense talks to try to land the final COP26 agreement. But whether the summit succeeds or fails doesn\' t depend solely on the decisions reached this week. From the outset, COP26 was seen not as an endpoint, but a kick-start to a decade of truly transformative action. Only in coming years will we know if the event was a real game-changer for the planet, or just empty promises and spin. COP26 : a journey, not a destination The UK government, as the conference host, knew early on that most countries would bring new climate ambition \- known in COP-speak as  nationally determined contributions. But it also knew these pledges would never be enough. For COP26 First were a series of side deals to kick things along. These came in the form of a new global pledge to reduce emissions of methane \- a highly potent greenhouse gas \- as well as deals on coal phase-out, deforestation, climate finance and more. Second, countries would have to ratchet up their commitments in coming years. That means the final negotiated outcome of COP26 , which was due on Friday Glasgow time but HYPERLINK saw that deadline extended As I write, that outcome is uncertain at best. The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3.pdf first draft of the final agreement urges countries that didn\' t bring a new and stronger 2030 target to Glasgow to do so within a year. Negotiators have spent countless hours arguing over the minutiae of the final text, and there\' s still a way to go yet. But if the final agreement is too weak, the 1.5-degree goal is at serious risk. The draft wording is weaker than that sought by a group of 50 of the world\' s most climate-vulnerable countries, HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-fate-of-our-planet-depends-on-the-next-few-days-of-complex-diplomacy-in-glasgow-heres-what-needs-to-go-right-171501 which want national commitments to be reviewed and strengthened each year between now and 2025. However, the wording is still stronger than many observers anticipated. And while COP26 Australia outdid itself Being an Australian at international climate talks is rarely a comfortable experience. Australia long ago cemented its reputation as a drag on global climate cooperation \- known for its weak targets, obstructive approach and demands for special treatment. However, even seasoned observers have been taken aback by Australia\' s actions before and during COP26 . Australia went to Glasgow as just about the only developed country without a new and significantly stronger 2030 emissions reduction target. The government then proceeded to use the Australia pavilion inside the COP venue to promote the interests of fossil-fuel companies such as Santos. Australia also refused to sign up to two signature deals at COP26 \- the global pledge to cut methane emissions, and one to HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/end-of-coal-in-sight-at-cop26/ phase out coal-fired power. Despite Australia\' s recalcitrance, the coal pledge, in particular, is a big step forward in global terms. In years past, nations HYPERLINK agreeing to a coal phase-out were not particularly reliant on coal. This time, signatories included big coal-using nations such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Poland, Ukraine and South Korea. One energy-related announcement in Glasgow was particularly important for Australia. Japan and South Korea, the second- and third-biggest buyers of Australian liquified natural gas (LNG), both signaled their desire to HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/korea-japan-signal-rush-to-exit-lng-but-woodside-boss-still-upbeat-20211109-p5974f shift to hydrogen and renewables. This development, among others, makes one thing abundantly clear: The world is moving fast while Australia stands still. Sooner rather than later, Australia will feel the cost of its inaction \- not just in the hit to our international reputation, but in forgone economic opportunities in the clean industries of the future. \' Try harder. Try harder\' International climate talks can feel far removed from the urgent reality of the climate crisis. But at every COP, someone invariably manages to cut through the noise with a brutally honest and rousing contribution. This year it was Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley, who at the outset of the conference HYPERLINK https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/barbados-pm-mia-mottley-climate-change-speech-glasgow-cop26-biden-modi-johnson-4402184.html excoriated leaders for failing on the promises of the Paris Agreement. Mottley\' s commanding eight-minute speech was a show-stopping moment. As world leaders including US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looked on, Mottley declared that a 2-degree increase in global temperatures would be a  death sentence for small developing island nations. HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/embed/PN6THYZ4ngM?wmode=transparent&start=0 She went on :  For those who have eyes to see. For those who have ears to listen. And for those who have a heart to fee. We do not want that dreaded death sentence, and we have come here today to say, \' Try harder. Try harder.' So did the world try harder in Glasgow? The progress we\' ve so far seen during the conference, and in the lead-up, would have been unimaginable only a few years ago. The HYPERLINK surprise pact between the US and China \- in which the two nations recognized climate change as an  existential threat \- is a case in point. But the summit\' s final outcome is still likely to fall massively short of what the science demands. The real test of COP26 is whether pledges are honored, and if the talks have triggered a virtuous cycle of increased ambition and action over the next decade.

The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Note 1) supports the COP26 goals and on this occasion reaffirms its commitment to strengthening Hong Kong's financial ecosystem for a greener and more sustainable future and reiterates its support for Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 (Note 2) of the Government. In particular, the Steering Group welcomes:  The publication by the IFRS Foundation of the prototype for the climate disclosure standard (Note 3).A comprehensive global baseline for climate disclosure standards can provide market participants with clear regulatory expectations and improve the transparency, comparability and reliability of corporate disclosures. As the financial risks associated with climate change are more widely recognised and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing becomes more common, a global baseline for corporate disclosures will also help investors align their investment strategies with the transition to carbon neutrality.The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) will maintain their close collaboration with stakeholders including the Financial Reporting Council and the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants with a view to evaluating and potentially developing a roadmap to adopt this standard.  The publication of Common Ground Taxonomy (CGT) report by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) (Note 4).The Steering Group recognises the CGT as a key driver of convergence that facilitates the scaling up of international green finance flows and will continue its work with the aim of making use of the CGT.  The global advances in building a worldwide carbon market including voluntary carbon market. The Steering Group recognises the associated opportunities for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and will continue efforts, under its Carbon Market Work Stream, in capitalising on Hong Kong's unique position in driving global capital flows with a view to developing Hong Kong into a regional carbon trading centre. The Steering Group will continue to monitor international developments in green and sustainable finance and support international initiatives, contributing to efforts to promote climate-related disclosures and climate-focused scenario analysis through active participation in various international fora, such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions Sustainable Finance Task Force, the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System and the IPSF. Eddie Yue, Co-Chair of the Steering Group, Chief Executive, HKMA said: "" COP26 once again highlighted the critical role that finance plays in accelerating and supporting the transition to net zero. The Steering Group will continue to focus on the key enablers to scaling up sustainable finance, including consistent and comparable disclosure, harmonised standards, talent and data, as well as explore the opportunities, such as in the carbon markets."" Ashley Alder, Co-Chair of the Steering Group, Chief Executive Officer, SFC said: ""Hong Kong's pivotal role in connecting vast amounts of global capital with the Mainland market, together with its adoption of a climate reporting standard, will help significantly advance green and sustainable finance development regionally and globally. We will continue working closely with our fellow regulators, the Government and the industry to ensure that Hong Kong continues to develop as a leading international sustainable finance hub."" The Steering Group will discuss further steps to advance Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance agenda in its next meeting in December 2021. Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group Notes: I. Established in May 2020, the Steering Group is co-chaired by the HKMA and the SFC.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong8","Why COP26 ended in failure and disappointment","November 15, 2021 Monday 5:47 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","After two hard-fought weeks of negotiations, the Glasgow climate change summit is, at last, over. All 197 participating countries adopted the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact, despite an 11th-hour intervention by India in which the final agreement was watered down from  phasing out coal to  phasing down. In an emotional final speech, COP26 president Alok Sharma apologized for this last-minute change. His apology goes to the heart of the goals of COP26 in Glasgow: the hope it would deliver outcomes matching the urgent  code red action needed to achieve the Paris Agreement target. At the summit\' s outset, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/un-secretary-general-cop26-must-keep-15-degrees-celsius-goal-alive urged countries to  keep the goal of 1.5 alive, to accelerate the decarbonization of the global economy, and to phase out coal. So, was COP26 But among the failures, there were important decisions and notable bright spots. So let\' s take a look at the summit\' s defining issues. Weak 2030 targets The goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 . Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters. But HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/ new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1 \- or 2.4 if only 2030 targets are met. Despite the Australian government\' s recent climate HYPERLINK https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/australia-welcomes-positive-outcomes-cop26 announcements , the nation\' s 2030 target HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/All.aspx. remains the same as in 2015. If all countries HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/targets/ adopted such meager near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3 . Technically, the 1.5 limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year\' s time. However, as Sharma said,  the pulse of 1.5 is weak. And as Australia\' s experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/India-coal-power.jpg?resize=780%2C521&ssl=1 Link to Image Phase down, not out India\' s intervention to change the final wording to  phase down coal rather than  phase out dampens the urgency to shift away from coal. India is the world\' s HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-india third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The country relies heavily on coal, and coal-powered generation is expected to HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2019 grow by 4.6% each year to 2024. India was the most prominent objector to the  phase out wording, but also had support from China. And US climate envoy HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/climate/john-kerry-fossil-fuel-subsidies.html John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further, to trap emissions at the source and store them underground. Carbon capture and storage is a controversial proposition for climate action. It is not proven at scale, and https://bv.fapesp.br/en/publicacao/157440/an-assessment-of-ccs-costs-barriers-and-potential/ we don\' t yet know HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01175-7 relatively few large-scale underground storage locations exist. And it\' s hard to see this expensive technology ever being cost-competitive with HYPERLINK https://blog.csiro.au/2020-gencost cheap renewable energy. In a crucial outcome, COP26 also finalized rules for global carbon trading, known as Article 6 under the Paris Agreement. However, under the rules, the fossil fuel industry HYPERLINK will be allowed to  offset its carbon emissions and carry on polluting. Combined with the  phasing down change, this will see fossil fuel emissions continue. It wasn\' t all bad Despite the shortcomings, COP26 led to a number of important positive outcomes. The world has taken an unambiguous turn away from fossil fuel as a source of energy. And the 1.5 global warming target has taken center stage, with the recognition that reaching this target will require rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions of HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma3_auv_2_cover%20decision.pdf 45% by 2030 , relative to 2010 levels. What\' s more, the pact emphasizes the importance of mitigation of nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity. This comes on top of a side deal struck by Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030. The pact also urges countries to fully deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage. It also HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_L16_adv.pdf emphasizes the importance HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/enhanced-transparency-framework#eq-9 of transparency in implementing the pledges. Nations are also invited to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022. In support of this, it was HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma3_auv_2_cover%20decision.pdf agreed to hold a high-level ministerial roundtable meeting each year focused on raising ambition out to 2030. The HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/12/us-china-cop26-climate-carbon-superpower US and China climate agreement Despite the world not being on track for the 1.5 goal, momentum is headed in the right direction. And the mere fact that a reduction in coal use was directly addressed in the final text signals change may be possible. But whether it comes in the small window we have left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen.

It\' s a complex process that can be hard to make sense of from the outside, but it\' s how international law and institutions help solve problems that no single country can fix on its own. I worked for the United Nations for several years as a law and policy adviser and have been involved in international negotiations. Here\' s what\' s happening behind closed doors and why people are concerned that COP26 might not meet its goals. What is COP26 In 1992, countries agreed to an international treaty called HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-convention/history-of-the-convention#eq-1 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which set ground rules and expectations for global cooperation on combating climate change. It was the first time the majority of nations formally recognized the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change need to control greenhouse gas emissions , which cause the global warming that drives climate change. That treaty has since been updated, including in 2015 when nations signed the HYPERLINK Paris climate agreement HYPERLINK COP26 stands for the 26th Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC. The  HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/parties-non-party-stakeholders/parties-convention-and-observer-states parties  are the 196 countries that ratified the treaty plus the European Union. HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/ The United Kingdom, partnering with Italy, is hosting COP26 Why are world leaders so focused on climate change? The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\' s latest report, released in August 2021, warns in its strongest terms yet that HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf human activities have unequivocally The IPCC\' s scientists explain how HYPERLINK climate change has been fueling HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-water-cycle-is-intensifying-as-the-climate-warms-ipcc-report-warns-that-means-more-intense-storms-and-flooding-165590 weather events and flooding HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/extreme-heat-waves-in-a-warming-world-dont-just-break-records-they-shatter-them-164919 heat waves and droughts HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/protecting-half-of-the-planet-is-the-best-way-to-fight-climate-change-and-biodiversity-loss-weve-mapped-the-key-places-to-do-it-144908 extinction of species HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/ipcc-climate-report-profound-changes-are-underway-in-earths-oceans-and-ice-a-lead-author-explains-what-the-warnings-mean-165588 melting of ice sheets and the rising of sea levels . UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called the report a HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362  code red for humanity. Enough greenhouse gas emissions are already in the atmosphere, and they stay there long enough, that HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#SPM even under the most ambitious scenario of countries quickly reducing their emissions, the world will experience rising temperatures through at least mid-century. However, there remains a narrow window of opportunity. If countries can cut global emissions to  HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/more-companies-pledge-net-zero-emissions-to-fight-climate-change-but-what-does-that-really-mean-166547 net zero  by 2050, that could bring warming back to under 1.5 C in the second half of the 21st century. How to get closer to that course is what leaders and negotiators are discussing.

During the first days of the conference, about 120 heads of state, like US President Joe Biden, and their representatives will gather to demonstrate their political commitment to slowing climate change. Once the heads of state depart, country delegations, often led by ministers of environment, engage in days of negotiations, events and exchanges HYPERLINK to adopt their positions, make new pledges and join new initiatives . These interactions are based on months of prior discussions, policy papers and proposals prepared by groups of states, UN staff and other experts. Nongovernmental organizations and business leaders also attend the conference, and HYPERLINK https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainability/cop26/what-is-cop26 COP26 has a public side with sessions focused on topics such as the impact of climate change on small island states, forests or agriculture, as well as exhibitions and other events. The meeting ends with an outcome text that all countries agree to. Guterres HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1053561 publicly expressed disappointment HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/27/cop26-climate-talks-will-not-fulfil-aims-of-paris-agreement-key-players-warn signs of trouble heading into COP26 .

Countries are required under the Paris Agreement to update their national climate action plans every five years, including at COP26 . This year, they\' re expected to have ambitious targets through 2030. These are known as HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs nationally determined contributions, or NDCs . The Paris Agreement requires countries to report their NDCs, but it allows them leeway in determining how they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The initial HYPERLINK set of emission reduction targets in 2015 was far too weak to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. One key goal of COP26 is to ratchet up these targets to reach HYPERLINK net zero carbon emissions Another aim of COP26 is HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/finance/ to increase climate finance HYPERLINK whose people bear the largest burden HYPERLINK $100 billion a year HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/statement-from-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-on-climate-finance-in-2019.htm a goal that has not been reached HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-seeks-double-climate-change-aid-developing-nations-biden-2021-09-21/ US , UK and HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-pledges-extra-4-billion-euros-international-climate-finance-2021-09-15/ EU , among the largest historic greenhouse emitters, are increasing their financial commitments, and banks, businesses, insurers and private investors are being asked to do more. HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/ Other objectives include phasing out coal use and generating solutions that preserve, restore or regenerate natural carbon sinks, such as forests.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong10","China and India end up as COP26 fall guys","November 17, 2021 Wednesday 3:39 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","Greta Thunberg, the famous Swedish climate activist, summed up that the deal reached at COP26 at Glasgow last Saturday was  very, very vague with several loopholes. She told the media in Glasgow that the pact only  succeeded in watering down the , blah , blah.  There is still no guarantee that we will reach the Paris Agreement. The text that it is now, as a document, you can interpret it in many, many different ways. We can still expand fossil-fuel infrastructure, we can still increase the global emissions. It\' s very, very vague, Thunberg said.\~ The delegates at Glasgow failed to produce more finance or even new guidelines to support developing economies\' gradual switch to renewable energy, known as the  just transition. Among developing country delegates, many said that COP26 had failed those countries most affected by climate change: the small island states and zones in Africa hit hardest by extreme weather such as the Sahel and the Horn. Most striking were the shortfalls and ambiguities on climate finance. Group of Twenty countries\' contributions to the US$100 billion fund for developing economies to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate are now set to reach the initial target by 2023. European and North American delegations resisted calls for the immediate establishment of a fund to compensate those countries suffering loss and damage caused by climate change. Instead, they proposed discussions on such a fund\' s structure and mechanism.\~ At the end of the day, however, the British hosts did a smart thing by creating the narrative that the COP26 would have been hunky-dory but for China and India imposing a consensus at an 11th-hour change to  phase down coal use, rather than  phase out. \~ HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Greta-Thunberg.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image India, China backed into a corner What really happened was that the EU, US and UK agreed and presented the new wording to the rest of the world on the phase out of coal power as a fait accompli, which of course backed India and China into a corner, with the eyes of the world watching. This sparked fury from poor nations and climate activists, egged on from behind by the UK that a small cabal of powerful polluters \- India and China \- in essence, held the world to ransom. India in particular has been lambasted and made the fall guy. The game plan is to pressure India and China to come back and commit to further emissions cuts by next year\' s UN meeting. Neither China nor India has 2030 targets anywhere near in line with a 1.5-degree-Celsius pathway, and so will be on the target list of nations under pressure to return next year with more ambition. The UK still holds the COP presidency for another year, so Alok Sharma will remain a key diplomatic player.\~ British Prime Minister Boris Johnson took center stage to brag before the House of Commons that COP26 Johnson was to tell business leaders and diplomats at the Lord Mayor\' s Banquet in London on Monday evening:  I have been watching politics a long time now and I know when a tipping point is reached. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Boris.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image Finger-wagging and blackmail This is blackmail Johnson-style \- hunting down the contender. The notorious rabble-rouser knows very well that both China and India are heavily reliant on coal power. Their leaderships are keenly aware of the role of the coal industry in pulling some of the poorest citizens in the two countries out of poverty. The domestic politics of phasing out coal is highly sensitive for both countries, particularly in the midst of a global energy crisis and a pandemic.\~ The ugliest part of Johnson\' s finger-wagging and blackmail is that he or his ilk in the rich industrial West have done nothing by way of offering the practical and financial support that developing countries may need for the transition.\~ The mother of all ironies is that both India and China went to Glasgow with good intentions. India\' s 2070 net-zero announcement made headlines, and even more significant was Prime Minister Narendra Modi\' s pledge to set the 2030 goal to ensure 50% of India\' s energy comes from renewables. Ahead of Glasgow, Chinese President Xi Jinping also made a sweep of important commitments: that China would reach net zero emissions by 2060, that coal production would peak by 2026, and that China would stop funding the construction of coal plants overseas.\~\~\~ Despite these significant moves, India and China are being vilified and browbeaten. The British Broadcasting Corporation went to the extent of soliciting the Pakistani energy minister attending COP26 to badmouth India \- with the latter of course gleefully obliging with the powerful metaphor of a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy who still wants to smoke a pack of cigarettes.\~ The poor chap didn\' t know that even Europeans and North Americans are chain-smokers. Bloomberg reported over the weekend, quoting coal mining chief executives, that the fuel they produce is far from being consigned to history, and  it will be two to three decades before there\' s a dramatic change in coal\' s place in the energy space. \~ HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Indonesia-Coal-Power-Plant-Thermal.jpg?resize=780%2C517&ssl=1 Link to Image Big demand for coal The Bloomberg report said demand remains robust in Asia and has picked up in Europe and North America as well this winter, with US coal prices surging to the highest in more than 12 years on Monday.\~ By the way, the Japanese government and the electric-power industry too are relieved to see the COP26 Japan plans to continue utilizing coal-fired thermal power (which accounts for about 30% of its electricity source) while trying to reduce its dependence on coal and suspend or abolish low-efficiency power plants. For India, an equal relationship with Britain is never possible. The guileful British mindset surfaced at Glasgow. India should not be delusional about duplicitous characters like Johnson.\~ Equally, it is crucial at the present stage of India\' s development that it has a selective engagement with China at least on such profound issues of common interest like climate change. An all-of-government hostility is neither warranted nor agreeable for a mature country.\~ COP26 highlighted that when it comes to the creation or transfer of wealth, high stakes are involved and the West collectively safeguards its interests and will not hesitate to tap into the divisions among the developing countries.

The language we had agreed on coal and fossil-fuel subsidies has been further watered down as a result of an untransparent process, she\~ HYPERLINK https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/compromise-cop26-deal-disappoints/47108826 said . Sommaruga is correct. The process had been  untransparent. Only a handful of world leaders \- from the most powerful countries \- had the opportunity to put pen to paper on this pact; the majority of world leaders only saw a draft of the Glasgow Climate Pact and were then provided the final document. Civil-society associations were barely allowed to enter the hall, let alone to have the opportunity to sit with the pact and give their input on it. As the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, put it\~ HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_5807 bluntly ,  never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few.

It would take an army of lawyers to scour through the text of these documents and make sense of them. Most of them are submissions made by a range of governments, corporations and corporate-funded platforms as well as civil-society organizations. It was clear from the first day of COP26 that the\~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign focus \~of achieving  net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was going to be on coal and not on all fossil fuels.

It is far easier to blame India and China for their reliance on coal than to agree to\~ HYPERLINK https://www.actionaidusa.org/news/fossil-fuels-in-the-cop-decision-text-why-the-u-s-not-india-is-the-problem/ phase down \~all fossil fuels. Climate finance On November 15, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian\~ HYPERLINK https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1919201.shtml said \~China  attaches high importance to energy transition. But he specified that there are some issues that need to be looked at before that. First, no energy transition can take place without awareness that  not everyone has access to electricity, and energy supply is not adequate. Cutting coal tomorrow would condemn billions of people to a life without electricity ( HYPERLINK https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/ about \~1 billion people still have no electricity connection, with most of them living in the Global South). Second, Zhao said,  We encourage developed countries to take the lead in stopping using coal while providing ample funding, technological and capacity-building support for developing countries\' energy transition. The developed countries had agreed to fund the\~ HYPERLINK https://www.greenclimate.fund/ Green Climate Fund \~to the tune of US$100 billion per year by 2020, but the actual amounts disbursed have\~ HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3 been \~far smaller. No agreement on finance was reached at the COP26 .  We need concrete actions, said Zhao,  more than slogans. Glasgow\' s COP26 was filled with corporate executives. They swarmed the hotels and the restaurants, holding private meetings with government leaders and with Prince Charles. The International Chamber of Commerce\~ HYPERLINK https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/global-business-tells-governments-at-cop26-put-a-price-on-carbon-but-do-it-the-right-way/ told \~governments to  wake up, while the US Business Roundtable\~ HYPERLINK https://www.businessroundtable.org/a-call-to-action-from-the-global-business-community-global-businesses-support-climate-action-that-enhances-competitiveness said \~that  the private sector cannot shoulder the burden alone. The implication here is that the corporations are on the right side of the climate discussion, while the governments are being hesitant. But this is partly the work of the spin doctors. Most corporations that have made  net-zero \~ HYPERLINK https://www.zerotracker.net/ pledges \~have done so in a nonbinding way and without a timetable. At the conclusion of the conference, it seemed that neither the powerful governments nor their corporations were willing to tie their hands to a real agreement to mitigate the climate crisis. People\' s Summit Just some blocks down from the grand halls of the official summit, people\' s movements, indigenous organizations, trade unions, youth groups, migrant groups, environmentalist organizations, and many more met as part of the\~ HYPERLINK https://cop26coalition.org/peoples-summit/ People\' s Summit for Climate Justice \~from November 7-10. Their message was simple: Corporations and their pliant governments would not do the job, so people need to find a way to set the agenda  for system change. The more than 200 events organized as part of the People\' s Summit addressed a range of topics, from the role of militarism in emissions, to building a global Green New Deal, and\~ HYPERLINK https://cop26coalition.org/peoples-summit/people-and-nature-vs-the-unfccc-a-peoples-tribunal-on-the-united-nations-framework-convention-in-climate-change/ even \~holding a People\' s Tribunal to put the ineffective UNFCCC on trial. Emotions at the People\' s Summit oscillated from excitement over being together in the streets after nearly two years of confinement due to Covid-19 to dread at the\~ HYPERLINK imminent \~disappearance of the low-lying island states. Participants from Tuvalu and Barbados talked about the impact of the inaction by the Global North as they see their islands disappear, their homes flood, and their present vanish.

Ahern will head the World Carbon Neutrality Forum (WCNF), which aims to elicit expert advice on the challenging task of mobilizing trillions of dollars of investment capital and new technologies to achieve carbon neutrality by the United Nations\' proposed deadline of 2050. It will invite political leaders, multinational companies, research institutions and scientists to advance and discuss new ideas for carbon neutrality and promote public awareness of environmental goals. In parallel with the World Carbon Neutrality Forum, a platform for political and thought leaders, Ahern will work with a new broadcasting initiative, the World Carbon Neutrality Media Network (WCNMN). The broadcasting venture will build a global media and cloud video-conferencing platform on the model of TED, with a focus on international cooperation to achieve decarbonization targets, and will commence conferencing activities in January 2022. One of China\' s best-known media personalities, Yang Lan, will serve as chief moderator for WCNMN conferences. The new media platform will address topical issues on climate change. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-4.png?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image Yang chairs the Sun Media Group and the Sun Cultural Foundation. She is the host of China\' s longest-running television interview program, Yang Lan One on One , and has conducted more than 1,000 interviews with world political and intellectual leaders. She has interviewed among many others Jimmy Carter, George Bush, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, HRH Prince Charles, Gerhard Schroeder, Lee Kuan Yew, Fukuda Yasuo, Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton, Ban Ki-moon, Christine Lagarde, Condoleezza Rice and David Cameron, with an average audience of 10 million viewers. Ms. Yang is the recipient of numerous journalism awards. She holds a master\' s degree in international affairs from Columbia University\' s School of International and Public Affairs. The announcement of the new public-private forum and media platform comes at a time when COP26 , the United Nations-sponsored international forum, is under pressure for two reasons. First, the scientific consensus has added a new sense urgency about climate change. A HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_08_adv_1.pdf report released on September 17 by the United Nations Secretariat warns that \- given current country pledges under the Paris Agreement \- carbon emissions in 2030 will be 16% higher than in 2010, putting the world on track for severe climate compromise by the end of the century. To keep global warming within acceptable limits will require a 45% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. There now is the specter of an increase of global temperatures of 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century instead of the targeted maximum increase by 1.5 degrees. Already on September 15, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had told Reuters in an interview at UN Headquarters in New York,  I believe that we are at risk of not having a success in COP26 . Second, the nations that comprise the Conference of Parties (COP) have lagged far behind on their previous financial commitments to facilitate transition to carbon neutrality. The world\' s industrial nations at the 2015 Paris Accord pledged US$100 billion a year to help poorer countries reduce carbon emissions, but contributions have fallen far short of the goal. An HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/statement-from-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-on-climate-finance-in-2019.htm OECD report estimated that industrial nations\' contributions to carbon-neutrality financing had fallen short of commitments by more than 20%. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-3.png?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1 Link to Image  Climate finance continued to grow in 2019 but developed countries remain $20 billion short of meeting the 2020 goal of mobilizing $100 billion, OECD secretary general Mathias Cormann said in a September 17 statement.  The limited progress in overall climate finance volumes between 2018 and 2019 is disappointing, particularly ahead of COP26 . Meanwhile, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also reports that its member countries still rely on fossil fuels for about 80% of their energy supply, notably for industry and transportation uses that are the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Recent OECD data show that use of fossil fuels in 2019 rose by 10% to $178 billion, reversing a five-year downward trend. Despite their collective pledge to act against climate change at the 2015 Paris Accords, the industrial nations have been drifting in the wrong direction. If the scientific consensus reported by the United Nations is correct, the opportunity to avoid disruptive global warming will have passed by 2030. Fresh ideas and convincing appeals to public opinion will be required to reverse the drift. Commenting on the new public-private initiative, Ahern said,  Without doubt climate change is the central issue challenging world leaders economically, politically and socially. What is required of a single generation is a scale of change ordinarily phased in over several decades. The politics to deliver that change will require political courage and skill.  Throughout my career I have always tried to cultivate the spirit of partnership and consensus. I am delighted to be chair of the World Carbon Neutrality Forum because I believe collaboration, cooperation and coalition are key to substantial change. When it comes to climate action, we need borderless dialogue.  The World Carbon Neutrality Media Network will provide an opportunity for industry leaders and governments to listen to each other and take practical solutions from each other if we are to collectively realize global decarbonization targets. Ahern noted that  as part of the European Green Deal, the Commission proposed in September 2020 to raise the 2030 greenhouse-gas emission-reduction target, including emissions and removals, to at least 55% compared with 1990. It looked at the actions required across all sectors, including increased energy efficiency and renewable energy, and started the process of making detailed legislative proposals by July 2021 to implement and achieve these ambitious goals. He believes that a  paradigm shift is under way in climate politics.  Recent announcements from China as well as the recently renewed commitment by the United States to the Paris Agreement means that policy and political momentum are moving in the same direction on carbon neutrality, Ahern said.  The activity amounts to a paradigm shift, and I believe there is an opportunity for a leadership voice to emerge to articulate the value of net zero-carbon target. The World Carbon Neutrality Forum will seek to find our collective voice through a network for like-minded political and business leaders and will provide a collaborative forum to motivate and share experience. The requirements for achieving carbon neutrality are daunting. The International Energy Agency proposes $100 trillion in investment by 2050 to achieve zero emissions. In the IEA\' s playbook, renewable energy will provide 90% of global electricity generation by 2020, with solar power and wind power contributing 70%. That will require $4 trillion of green investment by 2030, three times the present level. Over the next 30 years, the cumulative total will come to $100 trillion. That figure, $100 trillion, is a staggering sum. The combined free cash flow of the 4,100 companies worldwide with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion was $332 billion in the first quarter of 2021, or $1.33 trillion annualized, according to Refinitiv Data. To put this in context: $92 trillion is nearly 70 times that sum to be spent over 30 years. The entire free cash flow of the world\' s private corporations would barely make up a third of the Global Reset investment budget. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ma-Jun.jpg?resize=200%2C252&ssl=1 Link to Image New ideas will be key to securing the financing demanded by the goal of carbon neutrality. One of the experts who will contribute to the World Carbon Neutrality Forum is Chinese economist Ma Jun, who directs the Center for Finance and Development at Tsinghua University. Professor Ma (left) is a former senior official of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, has served as chief economist of China\' s central bank, currently chairs China\' s Green Finance Committee and serves on the Monetary Policy Committee of the People\' s Bank of China. China\' s green lending program burgeoned by 26.5% in the year ended in June 2021, according to PBOC data. The volume of green loans reached 13.92 trillion yuan ($2.15 trillion). Two-thirds of the loans financed projects to reduce carbon emissions. In an interview with Asia Times, Ma Jun commented,  It\' s a very, very strong growth rate compared with the past few years. Also, green bond issuance in the first half of this year went up 181% compared with the same period last year. So all these were very largely because of the impetus from the carbon neutrality push of the government and the financial sector responded very swiftly to that call for innovations in the product category.  Carbon neutral bonds were introduced for the first time this year and at the central bank incentives are being developed. A major one forthcoming is what the central bank calls a decarbonization facility, which I think in substance is similar to the green bond facility. But it\' s a refined version, and it\' s a larger-scale facility which will provide cheap financing for local transition through the banking system for decarbonization projects.  That\' s forthcoming, but not there yet, but it was announced by the central bank governor already that sometime soon they will formally launch the new facility. Ma added that China is working with the European Community to create a common regulatory standard for green financing.  This platform is called International Platform for Sustainable Finance,  he said.  It was launched in October 2019 by Europe and China and a few other countries.  Specifically, the working group is given the mandate to develop a common ground taxonomy based on the Chinese taxonomy and the European taxonomy. I am a co-chair of this group, together with my colleague from the EU, and we\' re expecting the first version of the common bond taxonomy to be released before the end of this year. Ma heads a Chinese effort to identity innovative financial instruments for decarbonization finance, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and structured credit products. His work is an example of the new ideas that the World Carbon Neutrality Forum hopes to elicit from experts and promote among government officials and the public. Asia Times will publish the full interview with Ma Jun on China\' s financial carbon neutrality initiatives in coming days. \"

He added,  The tragedy is this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real. The dire assessment of the state of the planet\' s climate was not lost on US President Joe Biden, who called on world leaders to take aggressive action immediately to stave off the climate crisis in his remarks at the summit\' s opening day.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong14","COP26 leaves too many loopholes for fossil fuel industry","November 13, 2021 Saturday 3:35 PM GMT","Asia Times-English","For the Glasgow climate summit to be judged a success, a key outcome had to be that parties agree the majority of the world\' s fossil-fuel reserves need to be left in the ground. As HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03821-8 recent research suggests, 89% of coal and 59% of gas reserves need to stay in the ground if there\' s to be even a 50% chance of global temperature rise staying under the crucial limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius this century. The summit, COP26 Some promising proposals have been put forward, including the HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/australias-refusal-to-sign-a-global-methane-pledge-exposes-flaws-in-the-term-net-zero-170944 pledge to cut methane HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/cop26-global-deforestation-deal-will-fail-if-countries-like-australia-dont-lift-their-game-on-land-clearing-171108 to deforestation , and ending some overseas funding of fossil fuels. On Thursday, 13 countries launched HYPERLINK https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297225-cop26-new-alliance-commits-to-ending-oil-and-gas-extraction/ a new alliance to end gas and oil production within their borders, led by Denmark and Costa Rica. But most proposals suffer either from a lack of ambition or a lack of participation from key countries. Take the pledge to cut methane emissions. Some of the biggest methane emitters such as Russia, China and Australia failed to sign up. Similarly, the plan to phase out coal allows some signatories such as HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/small-print-gives-indonesia-a-way-out-in-cop-coal-pledge Indonesia to keep building coal-fired power plants. What these proposals and, indeed, the whole COP process suffer from is an inability to address the fact that if we\' re to avoid the worst of climate change, we simply can\' t keep extracting fossil fuels. Subsidies and finance Much has been made of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of financial institutions that aims to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy. But many of its efforts will be undermined while governments continue to subsidize the fossil-fuel industry. With fossil-fuel subsidies globally running at US$11 million HYPERLINK every minute , GFANZ is insufficient to halt emissions because subsidizing the cost of production and sale of fossil fuels continues to make the industry feasible. Moreover, GFANZ is voluntary, when we need commitments to be binding. It also includes banks that have recently provided https://www.ran.org/the-understory/the-net-zero-banking-alliances-40-billion-exxon-problem/ $575 billion in fossil-fuel finance to some of the world\' s biggest polluters. Governments should not wait for future COPs to address this issue. Countries should immediately start reining in the subsidies that make the industry profitable and should not entertain new subsidies. Despite the overwhelming evidence that most of the world\' s fossil-fuel reserves must stay in the ground, governments are still approving new projects. The UK government has 40 fossil-fuel projects in the pipeline despite being the host of HYPERLINK https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/28/the-uk-has-40-new-fossil-fuel-projects-in-the-pipeline-what-does-this-mean-for-cop26-credi COP26 . Australia, too, continues to approve new gas and coal developments. The New South Wales government has approved eight new projects since HYPERLINK 2018 , despite the state\' s target of HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-29/nsw-new-carbon-emissions-reduction-target-for-2030/100498444 50% emissions reduction Until future climate negotiations put a ban on new fossil-fuel projects and agree to a clear and rapid phase-out of current production levels, the fossil-fuel industry will continue to thrive. Business as usual A further loophole for the fossil-fuel industry is how it\' s being allowed to continue its huge levels of production because it has committed (in some cases) to making its operations greener. Measures such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting have been touted by some governments as solutions to bringing the industry\' s emissions down. But these HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/big-business-greenwash-or-a-climate-saviour-carbon-offsets-raise-tricky-moral-questions-171295 are not real solutions While offsetting will have to HYPERLINK play a role in reducing emissions in some hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and agriculture, it is not a substitute for genuine cuts to fossil-fuel use and misleadingly gives the impression fossil-fuel companies are HYPERLINK https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/revealed-9-examples-of-fossil-fuel-company-greenwashing/ going green . Influence These loopholes that allow fossil-fuel production are, of course, no accident. The largest group of representatives at COP26 were from the https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484 fossil-fuel industry One of the striking and disturbing characteristics of government approaches to climate change is the impact of fossil-fuel companies on HYPERLINK decision making . It\' s hard to think of other issues (smoking, peace negotiations) where we tolerate this kind of influence. The industry\' s influence on successive Australian governments has been well documented, with more than https://publicintegrity.org.au/political-donations-and-the-resources-sectors-influence/ A$136.8 million (US$100.35 million) in donations recorded between 1999 and 2019. Having a display by gas company Santos ( HYPERLINK https://www.marketforces.org.au/politicaldonations2020/ a major donor to Australian political parties ) at Australia\' s COP26 pavilion rightly provoked ridicule. Decoupling production The failure to address these loopholes will mean the production of fossil fuels will continue for much longer than it should. The fact there are still willing buyers for fossil-fuel assets such as HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bhp-sell-stake-metallurgical-coal-jv-stanmore-up-135-bln-2021-11-07/ BHP\' s Queensland coal mines HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/bhp-is-selling-its-dirty-oil-and-gas-assets-but-hold-the-applause-166333 and few climate liabilities COP26 . One of the most glaring failures of COP26 is the failure to connect emission cuts with production cuts. Nowhere is this more apparent than in countries https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/norway/ such as Norway , which has impressive domestic reduction targets (55% by 2030) yet continue to champion HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58896850 fossil-fuel production A key to progress at future COPs and domestically is ending the false idea that one can make progress on climate by cutting domestic emissions while simultaneously supporting fossil-fuel production. If countries such as Australia and Norway can\' t come together to agree on cutting support for production, then we will continue to see loopholes that allow the industry to flourish. Some countries are taking positive steps. The HYPERLINK http://www.beyondoilandgasalliance.com/ Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance Multilateral action such as this, whether as part of COP or outside it \- and, crucially, the pressure from below that causes it \- must be a focus if we\' re to avoid climate change.

Scientists tell us that greenhouse gas pollution must fall by HYPERLINK nearly half globally by the end of this decade if there\' s any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a point beyond which all hell will break loose: super storms, millennial droughts, rampant wildfires, unbearable heatwaves, rising (and dying) seas, and pestilence of catastrophic proportions that will bring suffering to billions and death to millions. Nowadays, global greenhouse gas emissions are about HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions 40 per cent higher than they were when governments first came together three decades ago to negotiate an agreement intended to lower them, thanks in very large part to the dramatic economic rise of China.

For those who take countries\' climate-related promises seriously (something that one could be forgiven for not doing, given experience), COP26 was not a total washout. Several countries strengthened pledges to limit their emissions and decarbonise their economies. That said, too few of the major emitters have concrete plans for making progress this decade. Several side agreements were announced during the summit. Two dozen countries HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/global-coal-to-clean-power-transition-statement/ stated that they would stop building coal plants and stop financing their construction abroad. More than 100 countries HYPERLINK https://www.globalmethanepledge.org/ pledged to reduce methane emissions 30 per cent by 2030. Even more countries HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/ declared their intentions to halt deforestation by 2030. A small group of countries \- only about 5 per cent of those represented at COP26 \- HYPERLINK promised to phase out oil and natural gas production.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the COP26 climate summit. Photo: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing Street, via Flickr. The reality of the pact\' s value going forward is probably somewhere between empty words and the end of coal, although much closer to the former. United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres \- hardly an activist, but clearly someone greatly concerned about climate change \- declared at the end of COP26 that the world is  HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/sgsm21022.doc.htm still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe . The pact  resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees, although at the same time it  reaffirms the goal of limiting it to  well below 2 degrees (the latter being more realistic but justification for Guterres\' s warning of climate catastrophe). The pact calls on countries to accelerate the  phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, wording that is open to wide interpretation and amounts to going slow on cutting back on coal. The pact also recognizes that protecting ecosystems must be an integral part of mitigating climate change. It notes agreement on rules to standardize the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions, limitations and trading (a boring topic for laypersons, to be sure, but one that has major importance because so many countries tend to cook the books when reporting their emissions). United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres at the COP26 climate summit. Photo: Karwai Tang/ UK Government. via Flickr. The pact mentions that funding to help poor countries adapt to climate change is insufficient and  notes with deep regret that financing to help those countries mitigate their emissions remains below what developed countries have promised for more than a decade. The pact  urges developed countries to double their financial aid packages and calls on the private sector to do its part. \~Importantly, despite strident demands from poor countries, the pact failed to create a fund to pay reparations for the harm that they are experiencing due to climate change. The Glasgow Climate Pact was HYPERLINK https://enb.iisd.org/Glasgow-Climate-Change-Conference-COP26-summary hailed by some as a breakthrough because it is the first climate agreement to mention fossil fuels. That\' s one way to interpret the first-time explicit reference to coal, but the pact says nothing about the rising production of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Another interpretation is to see this belated reference to one fossil fuel as a devastating indictment of decades of climate summitry: it took 30 years before governments agreed to mention, let alone implement, the desirability of cutting back on the biggest cause of the climate crisis. While the pact demonstrates growing concern around the world about climate change, and growing willingness to take action, it also showcases the enduring power of vested interests, not least those of powerful industries that are most addicted to coal and other fossil fuels, and which do not wish to forgo the benefits \- the profits \- that come from burning them.

With these trends in mind, one could be forgiven for expecting China to take a leadership role in Glasgow to strengthen global efforts to eliminate greenhouse gas pollution. It did just the opposite.

But this view would miss the point. So many world leaders went to Glasgow, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, because their presence sent a powerful message.

President Xi\' s failure to attend the summit sends a signal to the world that the climate crisis is not much of a personal priority for him and not an overriding priority of China under his leadership.

Adding insult to injury, Xinhua, China\' s official state-run news agency, proudly HYPERLINK https://www.news.cn/english/2021-11/11/c_1310305399.htm proclaimed during the Glasgow summit that on a single day more coal was produced in China than at any time in the country\' s history. Burning that one day\' s output of coal will result in HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59277977 more climate-changing pollution yearly In short, mirroring its behaviour at previous climate summits, at COP26 China pulled its weight to ensure that the resulting agreement would not undermine its national priorities. At least for now, those priorities are wedded to coal. Through its actions in Glasgow, and through its continued devotion to coal, China has completely turned its back on the poor countries of the world most threatened by climate change. The Chinese century will be by far the hottest in human history. Tianjin\' s integrated gasification combined cycle power plant, hailed as the  greenest coal plant in China. Photo: Asian Development Bank, via Flickr. One of the supposed bright spots of the summit was a HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/ declaration by China and the United States that they intend to cooperate on climate change. For long-term observers of climate diplomacy, this will look familiar. The two countries have made similar declarations in the past, most prominently in HYPERLINK https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/11/us-china-joint-announcement-climate-change 2014 . Alas, there is little evidence that those declarations restrained China\' s emissions. The latest declaration is unlikely to be any different. It includes plans to reduce methane emissions, but China\' s failure to join the Glasgow methane pledge suggests its real intentions. More generally, China is likely to interpret the China-U.S. declaration to mean whatever it wants it to mean, just as it has done with many other international agreements. Some proof seemed to come surprisingly quickly. Only three days after the Glasgow summit, Presidents Biden and Xi had a short virtual summit, during which Xi apparently HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/world/asia/biden-xi-usa-china.html reaffirmed what Chinese officials have been HYPERLINK https://hongkongfp.com/2021/07/21/beijing-ties-climate-cooperation-to-health-of-us-relations/ saying for months: that improvement in bilateral relations on other issues is a precondition for Chinese cooperation with the United States on climate change. Once again, we see that effectively addressing the climate crisis is not China\' s priority. The COP26 COP26 to block more aggressive international action on climate change, along with its continued \- indeed still-growing \- reliance on coal to power its rise, stokes the climate crisis. The Grim Reaper of climate change waves the flags of many countries. Its preferred ensign was once the Stars and Stripes, but these days its favourite depicts five glowing stars on a blood-coloured background. \"

The statement comes at a time when China is intensively issuing top-down documents on reducing carbon emission heading into the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference . Fast facts Chang Zheng, head of business strategy and R&D at SEEE, said at the Wanxiang Blockchain Summit last week that blockchain technology can be essential for use in the carbon trading market. The authenticity of carbon emission data is the foundation of carbon trading and blockchain can help ensure the reliability of the carbon emission and trading data. Chang said China currently relies on manual verification of carbon emissions data, including critical data on power generation and fuel purchases. Since the application of blockchain in carbon trading is still rare, it is hard to guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and transparency of carbon emission data, she continued. Chang said the Internet of Things and blockchain will be technologies to monitor and store critical data from power plants to determine carbon emissions in the future. Applying carbon cap-and-trade is one of the measures taken by China to reach\~ peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and thereby attain carbon neutrality by 2060, as proposed by President Xi Jinping. China's first nationwide carbon emissions trading market was launched by SEEE HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/shanghai-carbon-emissions-exchange-0715-idCNKBS2EL166 in July this year, and the HYPERLINK http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-07/22/content_5626497.htm first batch of carbon trading companies were mainly power generation companies with total HYPERLINK http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-07/22/content_5626497.htm carbon emissions of 4.5 billion tons.\~ The carbon cap-and-trade system is a method of mitigating total carbon emissions. In the system, a total target of carbon emissions is set, and emission credits are allocated among companies. Those enterprises whose carbon emissions exceed their quotas must purchase additional emission permits from companies with excess credits. In theory, such a system can strictly limit carbon emissions and encourage companies to explore production methods with lower carbon emissions. Previously, two Chinese cities, Huzhou and Tianjin, HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/headlines/chinese-city-blockchain-carbon-emissions/ announced the use of blockchain to track emissions data for carbon trading. On Thursday, the State Council of China issued a white paper, ""China's Policies and Actions to Address Climate Change,"" which pointed out the carbon emissions trading system has entered the legislative process. Last week, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a top-level document, "" http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2021-10/24/content_5644613.htm Opinions on reaching peak carbon emissions and carbon neutralization ."" It gives 11 orders to realize the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 18% from 2020 levels in the next five years. Speeding up the national carbon emission trading market's expansion and improvement is also listed as one of the orders. The ongoing 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow is meeting to advance goals set by the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.   Carbon trading is already a widely adopted system globally for reducing carbon emissions.

The UK has reduced its carbon emissions by switching from coal power to natural gas. Coal generated 41% of the country\' s electricity in 2012, while natural gas made up 25%. A decade later, coal is https://theconversation.com/britains-electricity-since-2010-wind-surges-to-second-place-coal-collapses-and-fossil-fuel-use-nearly-halves-129346 almost non-existent HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/britains-electricity-use-is-at-its-lowest-for-decades-but-will-never-be-this-low-again-152360 largest source . More than half of the 30% reduction in the UK\' s carbon emissions during the past decade was due to this switch from HYPERLINK coal to gas , with the rest driven by HYPERLINK https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1032260/UK_Energy_in_Brief_2021.pdf rapid increases in renewable generation . Why natural gas burns cleaner than coal is due to a quirk of chemistry. The amount of CO produced when a given fuel is burned is largely a function of the elements it\' s comprised of. Natural gas is mostly carbon and hydrogen. This combination has a very high energy content relative to other fuels, and so, it produces relatively less CO emissions for each unit of energy burning it generates. Impurities such as sulphur, which are common in coal, increase how much CO is generated for each unit of heat. This means even the highest quality coal produces double the CO emissions of natural gas per unit of energy. Energy demand is closely linked with productivity. As economies like China and India rapidly grow and develop, their energy demand is expected to HYPERLINK rise in tandem . But their ability to follow the UK in switching from coal to natural gas as a primary source of electricity generation is limited because they have comparatively less natural gas. The UK produces more than half its natural gas from the North Sea and has made a lot of progress in ditching coal. No mitigation without aid Per person, emissions in both China and India are still substantially lower than HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use almost all developed countries Close to a HYPERLINK quarter of all carbon emissions HYPERLINK 4% of global emissions Labeling India and China as the chief villains of COP26 is a convenient narrative. The financial aid which rich countries promised yet failed to deliver as part of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015 was supposed to help developing countries dump coal for cleaner sources of energy. And while the world berated India and China for weakening the Glasgow Climate Pact\' s coal resolution, few questioned the fossil fuel projects being floated in developed nations, like the UK\' s https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-57762927 Cambo oilfield and the HYPERLINK https://abcnews.go.com/US/opponents-line-pipeline-project-threatens-bidens-climate-legacy/story?id=80844864 Line 3 oil pipeline Switching from coal to gas offers a quick and partial win for reducing CO emissions, but doing it depends on geology and geography. A rapid switch to renewable energy sources is easier when energy demand isn\' t growing as fast as it is in rapidly developing countries. These countries need financial assistance from richer countries to make that leap. Until that is delivered, developed countries have no right to lay the disappointment of COP26 at the feet of China and India.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong19","US, China must find a way to cooperate at COP26 and beyond","October 26, 2021 Tuesday 4:38 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","A week out from the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow, all eyes are on two nations: China and the United States. Together, the superpowers are responsible for HYPERLINK more than 40% of global carbon emissions. US-China relations have been fractious in recent years, and whether they can cooperate on climate action is crucial to success at COP26 and beyond. US progress on climate change went backwards under the Donald Trump administration, but President Joe Biden has brought the nation back to the table. Biden wants to cooperate with China in this critical policy sphere, raising hopes of a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/trumps-trade-war-what-was-it-good-for-not-much-147247 less adversarial bilateral relationship. Throughout 2021, however, US-China relations have become increasingly strained. And China\' s cooperation at COP26 is far from guaranteed \- President Xi Jinping is HYPERLINK reportedly unlikely to attend the negotiations. Together, China and the US could supercharge global progress on climate action. But if they fail to cooperate, the two nations risk a race to the bottom on climate change \- with dire consequences for all. China currently accounts for HYPERLINK https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions 28% of global carbon emissions HYPERLINK improve energy security China made its first international commitments on climate change at the 2015 Paris climate talks, including a pledge for carbon emissions to peak by around 2030. In 2017, Trump pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, giving China the chance to take the global leadership mantle on climate action. It looked like China might assume this role when, last year, it HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/china-just-stunned-the-world-with-its-step-up-on-climate-action-and-the-implications-for-australia-may-be-huge-147268 pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2060. China is HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/ on track to achieve its 2030 renewable-energy and carbon-intensity targets. But the targets are considered inconsistent with the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century. In the US, Biden has pledged to reverse the climate policy HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/ damage wrought by the Trump presidency. He will pursue ambitious national initiatives and international cooperation, including with China. On again-off again In April this year, Biden sent US climate envoy John Kerry to China to discuss collective climate action. During the visit, the two countries released a HYPERLINK joint statement declaring a commitment to cooperation. But by September, China\' s tune had changed. Last month, during Kerry\' s second visit to China, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi HYPERLINK declared that cooperation on climate change cannot be divorced from the overall situation of China-US relations. This statement implied that China would withhold cooperation on climate change until the US gave ground on https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/during-latest-exchange-china-presents-us-with-2-lists-of-grievances/ broader strategic issues But as ever, the relationship is complex. Shortly after Kerry\' s visit to China, Biden and Xi HYPERLINK https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1906035.shtml spoke on the phone covering topics including climate change. Two weeks later, Xi announced that China will no longer build new coal-fired power projects abroad. But we cannot deduce from this announcement that China has decided to cooperate with the US on climate. China has been scaling back its financing of coal-fired power stations abroad HYPERLINK https://pekingnology.substack.com/p/guest-post-does-chinese-funding-really for years . Fork in the road Cooperation between China and the US will remain highly unpredictable. The key question is whether competition between the two nations on climate action will be constructive or destructive. Under a HYPERLINK https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3826681 constructive scenario, the US and China would compete to ramp up their investments in clean energy, advance their technological capabilities and build internationally competitive industries. They would also compete to help emerging countries reduce their emissions. China and the US would both seek to prove the superiority of their respective governance models by making rapid progress on climate change. In other words, does China\' s party-state, quasi-communist model offer the most desirable path forward? Or is the US model of democratic capitalism the better option? By contrast, destructive competition between the US and China would have dire consequences for the climate. First, it would make the international flow and diffusion of green technologies difficult. For example, the US controls advanced semiconductor technologies required for electric vehicles while China is leading the world in EV battery technologies. If the nations began restricting tech exports to each other, advancement in electric vehicles would significantly slow. It may also become more complex to establish global standards for new major clean energy technologies such as offshore wind systems. Global markets for particular clean energy technologies would become fractured and much smaller than they would otherwise be. With a reduced market size, new climate technologies and products would then take longer to become affordable, slowing their global uptake. Second, an effective system for global climate governance requires most nations, if not all, to participate. Yet without trust between the US and China, such a system would be untenable. Finally, the domestic climate actions of both the US and China may be adversely affected if tension between the two countries intensifies. In the US, HYPERLINK https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-plays-the-climate-card-john-kerry-wang-yi-11630620246 hawkish politicians and media The ruling CPC would likely face rising nationalist sentiment against further climate actions which would be viewed as caving in to US demands.

Flight BA1476 flew from London to Glasgow and produced 62% less carbon dioxide emissions than a similar flight a decade ago, HYPERLINK British Airways said in a press statement.\~ It\' s hard to say if the event would have pleased eco-activist  Glum Greta Thunberg, but the airline said that it was the combination of the fuel used  partly made from recycled cooking oil  and, these factors: British Airways used\~an Airbus A320neo, which it calls  the quietest and most fuel-efficient short-haul aircraft in its fleet;   British air traffic control provider NATS directed the plane in continuous climb and descent to avoid unnecessary fuel burn, leveling off; An electric\~Mototok vehicle, powered by\~Heathrow\' s bank of renewable energy, was used to push the plane back;   Only one engine was used to taxi along the runway for takeoff. The second engine was also turned off after landing; Aircraft computer systems determined the perfect flying altitude for fuel efficiency, given the plane\' s weight and wind data, and climb speeds were optimized in advance. Although the 1 hour 30 minute flight still produced 6.4 tons of carbon dioxide, the flight demonstrated the progress that the aviation industry has made in its attempts to decarbonize ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2021 (known as Cop26 ) in November.  This flight offered a practical demonstration of the progress we\' re making in our carbon reduction journey, British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle said.\~  This marks real progress in our efforts to decarbonize and shows our determination to continue innovating, working with governments and industry, and accelerating the adoption of new low-carbon solutions. While this\~scheduled commercial flight was considered a success, British Airways customers\~shouldn\' t expect this on other flights in the immediate future. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The airline is aiming to\~achieve\~net-zero carbon\~emissions across the board by 2050. BA is not the only airline that has chosen to use eco-friendly fuels to power its fleet. In May of this year, Air France has carried out an Airbus A350-900 service to Montreal powered by a biofuel sourced from waste cooking oil. Jet fuel produced from biomass or synthetically from renewable power has the potential to slash carbon emissions, albeit at a heavy cost by comparison to the price of kerosene. But traditional network airlines have sought to exempt long-haul flights, arguing that a Europe-only SAF requirement could expose them to unfair foreign competition.\~ {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par While used cooking oil is cheap and relatively easy to refine,  there is a relatively limited amount of that compared to what the need is, Jim McMillan, chief engineer at the National Bioenergy Center in Golden, Colo., said. In other words, as much as people love French fries, they don\' t eat enough of them to sustain commercial air travel with the leftover grease. To solve this problem, biofuel suppliers are starting to make fuel from cheap, abundant organic waste. That could mean waste from farms, such as corn leaves, wheat stalks and almond hulls. Or it could mean trash found in city dumps, such as paper, cardboard and leftover food. In California, officials are also looking at turning forest debris into biofuel, instead of burning the underbrush, the Joint BioEnergy Institute, said.

The launch came after Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a written HYPERLINK http://www.news.cn/english/2021-11/01/c_1310284288.htm statement to the COP26 summit on Monday that China would continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development. Xi also said China would speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. Representatives of Chinese financial institutions, including the Bank of China (BOC), China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), said in a side event at COP26 that they had taken action to contribute to the country\' s green finance sector\' s development, but their carbon neutrality work should be implemented in an orderly manner to avoid creating credit risks. In March this year, Xi announced China\' s commitment to achieving its major targets on fighting climate change, including a carbon emissions peak in 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. On September 22, he reiterated the targets when speaking via videolink to the UN General Assembly in New York. Xi did not personally attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP26 He said China would foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a fast pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects.

These measures will form a \' 1+N\' policy framework for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with a clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint. On Thursday, the PBoC said in a statement that the HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/international-platform-sustainable-finance_en International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), which has 18 members including the European Commission, China, Japan, India and the United Kingdom, had held a meeting during COP26 and released a green finance framework known as the  Sustainable Finance Taxonomy.

The PBoC said the taxonomy had an important meaning in terms of pushing forward the green finance cooperation between China and Europe, guiding cross-border climate-related investment and financing activities and lowering the costs of green product transactions. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Green-finance-seminar-in-Glasgow-.png?resize=780%2C439&ssl=1 Link to Image Prior to this, Ma Jun, chairman of China Green Finance Committee and former chief economist of the PBOC\' s research bureau, said at a seminar on Wednesday in Glasgow that an EU-China sustainable finance framework would help accelerate China\' s green transition.  This common ground taxonomy identified about 80 climate mitigation activities that are recognized by both the EU and China, Ma said.  It\' s an important step towards enhancing the ability, interworking capability and consistency of financial standards and could inspire further work in this area. Ma also said the China Green Finance Committee and the City of London jointly launched the HYPERLINK https://www.ukchinagreen.org/green-finance/green-belt-and-road/text-of-the-gip/ Green Investment Principles  The GIP is now a major global network for global institutions and more than 1,000 supporting institutions. These organizations collectively managed US$49 trillion of assets and committed to their low-carbon investments in the Belt and Road region or emerging markets in general, said Ma. At the same event, several executives of Chinese financial institutions shared their views on China\' s green finance sector. CICC\' s chief executive Huang Zhaohui said the total investment demand for China to achieve its carbon neutrality target by 2060 would amount to 139 trillion yuan, including 22 trillion yuan between 2021 and 2030 and 117 trillion yuan between 2031 and 2060.  The huge demand could not be satisfied only by public funding, Huang said.  We also need to rely on an open financial system and effective international cooperation. Huang said a globally recognized finance framework could help accelerate cross-border fund flow for green economic development. He said the CICC would continue to launch more carbon neutrality indices, support green bond issuance and set up green sovereign funds. BOC chairman Liu Liange said international financial institutions should jointly develop a global standard that could define, recognize and rate green finance products in order to boost cross-border fundings for sustainable activities. Liu said earlier this year that the BOC had joined the HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/ Principles for Responsible Banking He said the bank had also promised that from the fourth quarter this year it would stop providing finance to coal mining and coal-fired power generation projects overseas. Liu added that BOC would provide at least 1 trillion yuan ($156 billion) to support the green finance sector during the period of the 14th Five Year Plan between 2021 and 2025. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/China-Coal.jpg?resize=780%2C464&ssl=1 Link to Image At the same time, Liu stressed that the BOC would only implement its green strategy step by step in an orderly manner.  Green transition will create new industries but at the same time add a huge pressure on traditional sectors, Liu said.  The pain of transiting from traditional energy to new energy will not be reduced within a short period of time. Financial institutions must think carefully and find a balance point when they try to restructure their client bases.  People in the West are happy to see Chinese banks stop lending to coal mines and all the high-carbon sectors. But such \' stripping away\' is not like taking off your clothes or throwing away rubbish, said Fang Wenjian, the President of the BOC\' s London branch, adding that no country would like to pursue a green transition if the process created credit risks and social instability.  We have to strike a balance here and promote low carbon transformation in a steady and an orderly fashion. It\' s important to bring our clients with us on this journey, instead of leaving them behind, Fang said.

Sometimes forgotten in the ideological debate in the West about Beijing\' s motivations under Xi is that Chinese leaders are pragmatists conditioned by ruthless internal Communist Party politics. So a reasonable question now is whether Xi and his advisers have understood that the risks of overreach in China\' s interactions with the outside world outweigh the benefits.

The short answer is that it has been engaging in some creative diplomacy to lessen the risks of geopolitical isolation. This has involved: HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/politics/biden-xi-jinping-china-summit.html Xi and Joe Biden with promise of a virtual summit by the end of the year the makings of a HYPERLINK https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235276.shtml charm offensive in Beijing\' s dealings with the European Union an application to join the HYPERLINK https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/09/23/china-moves-to-join-the-cptpp-but-dont-expect-a-fast-pass/ Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on top of joining the HYPERLINK https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202103/1219113.shtml Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)   a  HYPERLINK hostage exchange  enabling the release from detention of the daughter of one of China\' s most powerful businessmen an announcement that China would HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58647481 stop funding coal-fired power stations abroad .

In Australian policymaking circles, dominated by a national security establishment wedded to seeing China as a threat, the above developments might be weighed. In the case of Xi and Biden, the issue is not so much whether there is a thaw in Sino-US relations after the wrenching Donald Trump era. It is more about whether the world\' s dominant powers can establish a relationship that enables reasonable dialogue and even cooperation. In the Xi-Biden phone call on September 9, the two agreed there was too little communication between Beijing and Washington. It was followed this month by a six-hour in-person meeting in Zurich between National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and his HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/politics/biden-xi-jinping-china-summit.html Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi The upshot is that Xi and Biden will meet  virtually within weeks.

This should be regarded as a positive development. In Beijing\' s dealings with the European Union, the several sessions with top European officials conducted in late September by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi are notable. Wang\' s strategic dialogue with Josep Borell, the EU\' s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, followed discussions with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. In another important development, Xi was due last Friday to speak with European Council President Charles Michel. On Wednesday last week, the Chinese leader held a HYPERLINK https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-angela-merkel-holds-farewell-call-with-chinese-president-xi/a-59496213  friendly phone call HYPERLINK http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2021/2021-road.html G20 summit in Rome , climate change issues ahead of COP26 and the European Union\' s HYPERLINK https://www.china-briefing.com/news/european-parliament-votes-to-freeze-the-eu-china-comprehensive-agreement-on-investment/ stalled investment agreement with China . The latter has been interrupted because of tensions between Beijing and Brussels on the Uighur issue and other stresses. This flurry of diplomatic activity could not contrast more sharply with the HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/asia/australian-business-faces-years-in-the-china-deep-freeze-20210719-p58aw9 deep freeze in relations between Beijing and Canberra, with high-level contacts at the ministerial level suspended. Perhaps most significant of recent China\' s diplomatic maneuvers has been its request to join the CPTPP, which groups 11 Asia-Pacific countries in a trade bloc. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The Obama administration originally conceived of the CPTPP as a means of pressuring China on trade and security issues.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong23","UAE must learn from UK\u8217 s COP26 when it takes climate leadership","November 18, 2021 Thursday 5:33 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","With hindsight it seems incredible that, until now, ever since COP1 in 1995 the words  coal and  fossil fuel have failed to make the cut in the final reports of any of the Conferences of the Parties to the UN\' s Framework Convention on Climate Change. That would be like a report by the World Health Organization on the global response to Covid-19 failing to mention the SARS-CoV-2 virus \- unthinkable. As every schoolchild in the world surely knows, the climate-change catastrophe looming over the planet has been generated by the unfettered burning of fossil fuels \- coal, oil and gas \- since the dawn of the coal-powered Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. The annual failure of COP delegates to acknowledge the fossilized elephant in the room has, of course, been the product not of ignorance, but of the myriad social and economic pressures, experienced by multiple countries at different stages of development. Forget elephants, the animal present at every COP for the past quarter of a century has been a giant ostrich, with its head buried deep in the ground. At Glasgow, the ostrich was finally allowed to raise its head, albeit only for a brief peak at reality. Even then, attempts to overthrow King Coal were watered down by last-minute interventions from its loyal subjects, China and India. What the world needs now, more than anything else, is compelling leadership. One\~announcement\~to come out of Glasgow was that COP28 in 2023 would be staged in the United Arab Emirates,\~home to the UN-created International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). This isn\' t the first time the COP roadshow has traveled to the Middle East \- in 2012 COP18 was held in Doha \- but a decade on the climate-change landscape has changed utterly. Doha was not insignificant. It was one of a series of dull but necessary COPs that paved the way toward the Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was the first time that developing countries signed up to a legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The Paris Agreement was to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To achieve that, the world needs to cut global greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 26 billion metric tons every year between now and 2030. To say that the total emission-reduction pledges scraped together in Glasgow of just over 6 billion tons fell short is to understate the huge gap between ambition and commitment. It highlights the monumental scale of the challenge for the country presiding over these conferences. That the UK\' s COP26 president Alok Sharma was almost in tears as he announced the watered-down deal goes some way to illustrate the personal and institutional commitments required by the host. The kind of leadership needed to rally the world\' s nations and their disparate interests to commit to an agreement often appears beyond possibility. Then there is the task of making sure the outcomes and expectations of any COP event are stuck to. The UK had to draw deep on its resources and global leadership experience just to make Glasgow happen. With more than 25,000 delegates descending on the city, the policing bill alone was estimated at the equivalent of more than US$300 million. The pandemic brought big challenges to hosting the event, but it also gave Sharma\' s team an extra year to prepare after COP26 was pushed back from 2020. The UK won the bid to host the event in September 2019, but Sharma was only appointed president in January 2020 after Prime Minister Boris Johnson fired his predecessor Claire Perry O\' Neill. The jostling showed the escalating importance placed on the herculean task of cajoling global powers into alignment on saving the planet. While many have called the COP26 outcomes a failure, Sharma won praise for his balanced leadership that involved building relations with small island states most at risk from rising sea levels while handling tricky meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. It is some of these\~skillsets\~that the UAE will have to draw upon as it prepares to take the reins in 2023. The Emirates has been entrusted to host the event based on its existing commitments toward the environment and renewable energy, including investing heavily in the new sciences of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and nuclear energy. Yet the UAE has more to lose than many countries from the inevitable transition to sustainable fuels, but much more to gain than most in shaping the elements of tomorrow\' s energy market \- and, thanks to its oil and gas revenues, it has the necessary funds to invest in the future today. But forging its own path is very different to consensus-building between nations with conflicting interests. What lessons can be learned from previous COP hosts and how the UAE can build on their efforts yet bring its own style of leadership is yet to be seen. Doubtless many voices will be raised protesting that handing control of COP28 to the UAE is akin to asking a fox to beef up the security of a chicken coop. Fingers will also be pointed at comments this week from the group chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) that  the oil and gas industry will have to invest over $600 billion every year  until 2030  just to keep up with expected demand. But to express alarm at this is to misunderstand the nature of a global energy system undergoing dramatic change. None of the world\' s countries can  simply unplug abruptly from fossil fuels. The world is recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and demand for oil and gas is rocketing \- in the process creating the essential wealth in the Persian Gulf region necessary to fund and drive the transition to renewables. For the UAE and countries such as Saudi Arabia, much of the profit being drawn out of the earth now is being plowed directly into the type of research and development that ultimately will save the planet. The UAE is working hard to curb its own domestic consumption of fossil fuels. Last month, it announced it was aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 \- an ambitious target on a par with those of the UK, the US and the European Union. How? Well, it turns out that oil was not the only economic blessing bestowed on the fossil-fuel-producing countries of the Middle East. Sunlight is the resource that gives on giving and, in the Gulf, is available for the greatest part of the year. The UAE is already leading the way with domestic solar power plants and investing in solar technology.\~ COP28 in 2023 will put one of the world\' s biggest producers of fossil fuels in charge of negotiations to wean the world from its addiction to fossil fuels. It will put the UAE under a global spotlight that will require an exemplary level of leadership and diplomacy if the climate\~negotiations will continue\~to move forward. And as the outcome of the UK meeting demonstrated, progress is incremental.\~ This article was provided by HYPERLINK Syndication Bureau , which holds copyright.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong24","HK contributes to nation's green goal","December 3, 2021 Friday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Dec. 3 --Hong Kong SAR Government issued the following speech: Chief Executive Carrie Lam The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 It would require doubling our efforts in order to reach the midterm target of 2035. The plan also sets out proactive strategies and measures to achieve our pledged goal, covering electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. We expect some $240 billion public sector investments in the next 15 to 20 years to support the measures, which will at the same time create many opportunities in green economy. In my view, Hong Kong can contribute much more than reducing our city's own carbon emissions. Ranking number three in the Global Financial Centres Index and with the world's sixth largest stock market, Hong Kong is well positioned to provide the necessary financial services support and participate actively in the global transition towards a low-carbon and sustainable economy. Over the years, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, together with our financial regulators, has been developing green and sustainable finance to boost investments conducive to reducing carbon emissions and building a low-carbon economy. To further enhance our position as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, we are now doubling our efforts to promote market development, align Hong Kong's regulatory standards with international best practices, encourage more entities to make use of Hong Kong's capital markets as well as financial and professional service, and capitalise on the enormous green finance opportunities presented by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development and the Belt & Road Initiative. And amongst those measures, the Government will take the lead where appropriate. For example, we have recently doubled the borrowing ceiling of the Government Green Bond Programme to $200 billion which will provide more room for piloting the issuance of green bonds that involves more types of currencies, project types, issuance formats and channels. We successfully issued the third batch of government green bonds last month, worth US$3.75 billion and comprising five tranches including euro-denominated bonds and renminbi-denominated bonds for the first time, which were all well received by global institutional investors. We are also planning to issue retail bonds for the participation of the general public, engaging them in the development of green finance. In addition, we have enhanced the Green & Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme to encourage issuance of more green and sustainable bonds and loans in Hong Kong, and attract more financial and professional service providers and external reviewers to expand their presence in Hong Kong. To grow the talent pool of this fast-growing market, I announced in my 2021 Policy Address to add professionals in ESG (environmental, social and governance) to the Talent List. In addition, we will endeavour to include more courses related to ESG in the list of reimbursable courses under the Continuing Education Fund and incorporate more ESG-related topics in the business and finance programmes. Meanwhile, the Centre for Green & Sustainable Finance is co-ordinating efforts of financial regulators, government agencies, industry stakeholders and academia in capacity building, thought leadership and policy development. As China is striving towards achieving carbon neutrality before 2060, Hong Kong is in a unique position to connect the flow of green and sustainable funds with the Mainland and the world to promote green investments and ecological civilisation on the Mainland. For this, the Green & Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group formed by relevant government bureaus and financial regulators will soon complete an assessment report on the feasibility of developing Hong Kong into a regional carbon trading centre and explore opportunities presented by the carbon emission markets in the Mainland and overseas. We will also promote co-operation between the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing and the Guangzhou Futures Exchange in areas such as clearing, technology, product development and marketing to drive the development of a green and low-carbon market in the region. But I would say that Hong Kong's ambitions in green finance go beyond the Greater Bay Area. For example, in my recent official trip to Hubei, I also visited the Hubei carbon emission exchange, and they are also very keen to co-operate with us. Chief Executive Carrie Lam made these remarks at the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency Symposium - Sustainable Finance & Climate Resilience on December 3. Source: Hong Kong SAR Government \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong25","At COP26, Vietnam must stress peril of rising sea levels","October 25, 2021 Monday 3:18 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","In a recent speech at the UN Security Council, Ambassador Dang Dinh Quy, permanent representative of Vietnam, reminded member nations that rising sea levels are a major threat for coastal nations, especially in the lowlands of China, Bangladesh, Indonesian islands, Philippine archipelagos and Vietnam.\~ Other delegates lauded Quy\' s initiative, since it signaled Vietnam\' s preparation for next month\' s pivotal climate change summit in Glasgow, called COP26 , that is expected to set the course of climate action for the next decade. The science on rising sea levels cannot be ignored in Asia. Millions of people live along coastal waters. For Vietnam, the Mekong River Delta is a vast spread of fertile riverbeds, islets and mangrove swamps at the end of the Mekong River. It is now among the most vulnerable regions in southern Vietnam. The delta is home to more than 20 million people, who produce almost half of the country\' s rice harvest. A million hectares of land is regularly affected by flooding due to ocean tides. Crops and people\' s livelihoods are at stake. Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has frequently warned that climate change threatens world security. In an earlier speech at the UN, he sought improved implementation of the HYPERLINK http://un.org/en/chronicle/article/un-role-climate-change-action-taking-lead-towards-global-response UN Charter in international relations and climate adaptation . Vietnam plans to borrow around US$2 billion to fortify the Mekong Delta with sustainable development in the face of climate change.\~\~ There is international agreement that rising sea levels must be considered a challenge to international peace and security. The US National Security Council and the Pentagon have warned that climate change will result in food shortages in some countries that could lead to unrest, along with skirmishes over water.\~\~ The most recent report from the United Nations\' HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), prepared by more than 100 scientists from more than 80 countries, describes a worrying scenario. Their evidence confirms that even if there are drastic cuts in carbon emissions, nations like Vietnam will be impacted by high tides. Over the past five decades, Vietnamese farmers have seen sea levels rise by about 20 centimeters. Also, climate change has made natural disasters, especially typhoons, floods, and droughts, more severe. In short, global mean sea levels will most likely rise between 30 and 110 centimeters by the end of this century. Ho Chi Minh City, home to more than 9 million people including migrants, continues to experience regular flooding due to increased storms, intense rainfall, and upstream discharges. Of the city\' s 322 communes and wards, about half have a history of regular flooding, with 40-50% of land in the city less than a meter above sea level. What\' s clear is that rising sea levels amplify storm surges and bring in additional chronic threats of tidal flooding. Riverine flooding becomes even more severe with increases in heavy precipitation. The World Economic Forum has described Vietnam\' s economy as a  miracle of growth, since it has expanded 6-7% a year over the past decade. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Vietnam\' s gross domestic product dropped 6.17% on the year for the July-September period, as draconian lockdowns in key areas, including Ho Chi Minh City, led to the first decline since 2000 on a quarterly basis. A HYPERLINK http://mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/can-coastal-cities-tunr-the-tide-on-rising-flood-risk McKinsey report details how the vibrant metropolis\' annual flooding can be compared to a tax on the economy. According to its modeling, and use of flood maps, the impacts may amount to about $1.3 billion a year, predominantly from real-estate damage. This represents about 2% of the city\' s GDP. Although the city has survived recurrent floods, it is anticipated that the costs due to regular flooding will continue to rise \- and faster than economic activity.\~ Rapid expansion has left the city vulnerable to climate change, with an increase in flood levels over the past decade. Overdevelopment and the sheer weight of infrastructure in some districts have caused the soft soil of the city to subside. Hydrologists claim that HCMC is now sinking at a rate of 1-2cm every year, while sea levels rise at the same time. Experts believe that Ho Chi Minh City should expect significant disruptions each year. While real-estate damage is still the largest cost, infrastructure assets such as on the city\' s metro, now under construction, may experience further delays associated with intense storms and flooding.\~ Despite government pledges to spend in excess of $345 million on anti-flood projects, the predicted sea-level rise and intense storm surges will require multilateral support, and breakthroughs on adaptation and resilience. Climate change remains a huge barrier to sustainable development. It also has the potential to affect millions of people around the globe through the loss of livelihoods, infrastructure, and homes, displacement, and an increased risk of statelessness. During the upcoming climate-change summit, Vietnam must stress the need to save the Mekong Delta from further devastation. \"

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong27","Hong Kong: Speech by CE at HKEX Green Asia Summit 2021 - Path to Net Zero","December 9, 2021 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Dec. 9 --Hong Kong SAR Government issued the following speech: Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, at the HKEX Green Asia Summit 2021 - Path to Net Zero today (December 9): Laura (Chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mrs Laura Cha), Nicolas (Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Nicolas Aguzin), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. It is my great pleasure to attend the inaugural Green Asia Summit organised by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today, and share with you all our strong sustainability commitments and our efforts in enhancing Hong Kong's status as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region. Before I continue, I would like to say how pleased I am to see Dr Ma Jun (Chairman and President of Hong Kong Green Finance Association) attending this summit in person from Beijing. I still remember he came to see me when I was still the CE-elect, that was more than four and a half years ago, telling me how important green finance will be for the world, and the strategic role that Hong Kong could play in promoting green finance, not only for Hong Kong, but also for the country. At the moment, we are welcoming you (Dr Ma Jun) without putting you through quarantine, but if you go back to Beijing, you still have to. So I suggest we retain you in Hong Kong until we resume some quarantine-free travel into the Mainland. Climate change is an imminent issue for all of us. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) held last month has drawn the world's attention to the pressing need for immediate actions. Among others, a number of advancements related to green and sustainable finance were made in COP26 , including the publication of the Common Ground Taxonomy report by the International Platform on Sustainable Finance, and the publication of the prototype for the climate disclosure standard. This Summit is most timely to focus our attention on this important topic as Hong Kong continues to map the way forward towards a low-carbon and sustainable economy. In my Policy Address delivered on October 6 this year, I reaffirmed the Government's commitment that Hong Kong would strive to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. The Hong Kong Climate Action Plan 2050 announced shortly thereafter sets out a series of proactive strategies and measures, and pursues more vigorous interim decarbonisation targets to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by 50 per cent before 2035 as compared to the 2005 level. The Steering Committee on Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality personally chaired by me since January this year will oversee the various actions, and we expect some HK$240 billion public sector investments in the next 15 to 20 years to support their implementation, which will create many opportunities in the green economy. As an international financial centre with a large financial market and world-class regulatory framework, Hong Kong is well positioned to provide the necessary infrastructure and connect the flow of green and sustainable funds to promote a green economy. Over the years, the Government, together with the financial regulators, has continued to develop green and sustainable finance to boost investments conducive to reducing carbon emissions. With a view to contributing to the goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2060 in the Mainland and before 2050 in Hong Kong, and elevating Hong Kong's position as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, we are doubling our efforts to promote market development, align Hong Kong's regulatory standards with international best practice, encourage more entities to make use of Hong Kong's capital markets as well as financial and professional services for green and sustainable investment, and capitalise on the enormous green finance opportunities presented by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative. HKEX has long been our close partner and I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to HKEX for their work in fostering green and sustainable finance development in Hong Kong. As one of the six members of the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, HKEX has spared no effort in promoting the enhancement of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) and climate change disclosures among listed companies. Just last week, HKEX announced two new initiatives to facilitate the industry's transition to net-zero, namely the release of the Practical Net-Zero Guide for Business and the partnership with leading ESG data providers to display listed companies' ESG metrics. HKEX also co-chairs with the Securities and Futures Commission the Carbon Market Work Stream under the aforementioned Steering Group, which will soon complete an assessment report on the feasibility of developing Hong Kong into a regional carbon trading centre and exploring opportunities presented by the carbon emission markets in the Mainland and overseas. With the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between HKEX and Guangzhou Futures Exchange in August, HKEX will further strategic collaboration with its counterpart in promoting sustainability, particularly in areas such as clearing, technology, product development and marketing to drive the development of a green and low-carbon market in the region. Last week, I visited the carbon emissions exchange in Wuhan, Hubei, and saw their sterling efforts in promoting innovation to combat climate change. I trust that the Government, together with HKEX, can work with Hubei and other places in the Mainland as well to promote the development of a carbon emission market system to support the country's target of achieving carbon neutrality. I recall that some of you joined me two months ago in the HKEX Connect Hall to celebrate the issuance and listing of offshore RMB bonds by the Shenzhen Municipal Government in Hong Kong. The issuance was remarkable, not only because it was the first time for Mainland municipal government bonds to be issued offshore, but also because some of them were green bonds. These RMB3.9 billion-worth green bonds signify the joint efforts of Shenzhen and Hong Kong to support the country's targets for carbon emission reduction as well as our unique position as an offshore RMB hub and green finance centre. We welcome and would encourage more Mainland issuers to do the same. The Government has in fact set the example and established the Government Green Bond Programme in 2018 with a view to raising Hong Kong's profile, establishing a market benchmark, and showcasing to potential green bond issuers that Hong Kong is a premier platform offering a one-stop solution for issuing green products. We have recently doubled the borrowing ceiling of the Programme to HK$200 billion, and successfully issued RMB, Euro and USD-denominated green bonds. The inaugural offering of Euro-denominated and RMB-denominated bonds by the Government has helped set an important new benchmark for potential issuers in Hong Kong and the region. The US$3.25 billion issuances attracted strong interest from a diverse group of conventional and green global investors despite market volatility at the time of offering. We will continue to issue green bonds regularly, and explore ways to involve more types of currencies, project types, issuance format and channels. We are also planning to issue retail bonds for the participation of the general public in driving together a low-carbon economy in Hong Kong. Green bonds by private issuers also constitute a large part of the green and sustainable finance ecosystem. We launched the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in May this year to encourage issuance of more green and sustainable bonds and loans in Hong Kong and attract more financial and professional services providers and external reviewers to expand their presence in Hong Kong. So far, around 30 applications have been approved under the scheme covering various kinds of green and sustainable debt instruments. Talent and professionals in ESG are key to the success of building a green and more sustainable future. I announced in my Policy Address recently to add ""professionals in ESG"" to the Talent List to attract more talent in this respect outside Hong Kong. In addition, we will endeavour to include more courses related to ESG in the list of reimbursable courses under the Continuing Education Fund and incorporate more ESG-related topics in the business and finance programmes. Meanwhile, the Centre for Green and Sustainable Finance established by the Cross-Agency Steering Group is also co-ordinating efforts of financial regulators, government agencies, industry stakeholders and academia in promoting capacity building and talent development. In short, ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is determined to collaborate with our financial regulators and the industry participants to promote Hong Kong into a green and sustainable finance hub in the region. That is not only for driving financial and economic development in Hong Kong, but also for contributing to the global efforts in tackling climate change, which is vital for our planet and our future generations. I am sure I can count on your support in this regard. Finally, I wish the summit great success and all of you the best of business, investment and health. As Christmas is approaching, I also wish you all merry Christmas, and a very happy new year. Thank you. Source: Hong Kong SAR Government \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong28","Speech by CE at Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency Symposium - Sustainable Finance and Climate Resilience","December 3, 2021 Friday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Dec. 3 -- Hong Kong SAR Government issued the following speech: Chairman Ir C S Ho (Chairman of the HKQAA, Mr Ho Chi-shing), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Good afternoon. It is my great pleasure to attend today's symposium organised by the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency (HKQAA), under the theme of Sustainable Finance and Climate Resilience. Last year I actually participated in this forum through a video speech, so I am naturally glad to be able to be here in person this year, with the event being held in hybrid format amid the stable epidemic situation in Hong Kong. I am very grateful to Mr Ho for his kind words about the work done by the Hong Kong SAR Government in combating the epidemic, but I am sorry to say that you are not allowed to do everything you want to, yet - you can't remove your mask while attending this symposium, so bear with us for a while. I hope that we should be able to further improve the Hong Kong situation and also address your aspiration for some normal travel into the Mainland without being subject to quarantine very soon. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) held last month has drawn the world's attention to the pressing need for immediate action to combat climate change. While Hong Kong is only accountable for a very small part of the world's carbon emission, we are determined to contribute to the world's efforts. I pledged in my Policy Address last year that we will reach carbon neutrality before the year 2050. This year, soon after my 2021 Policy Address, the Secretary for the Environment has published Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, under which a midterm goal of 2035 is set, at which time we hope to reduce carbon emission by 50 per cent as compared to the base year of 2005, which translates into an absolute reduction in per capita carbon emissions from 6.1 tonnes to between 2 and 3 tonnes, as compared to 4.5 tonnes in 2020. It has taken us 15 years to achieve a 26 per cent reduction in per capita emission. It would require doubling our efforts in order to reach the midterm target of 2035. The Plan also sets out proactive strategies and measures to achieve our pledged goal, covering electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. We expect some HK$240 billion public sector investments in the next 15 to 20 years to support the measures, which will at the same time create many opportunities in green economy. In my view, Hong Kong can contribute much more than reducing our city's own carbon emissions. Ranking number three in the Global Financial Centres Index and with the world's sixth largest stock market, Hong Kong is well positioned to provide the necessary financial services support and participate actively in the global transition towards a low-carbon and sustainable economy. Over the years, the Hong Kong SAR Government, together with our financial regulators, has been developing green and sustainable finance to boost investments conducive to reducing carbon emissions and building a low-carbon economy. To further enhance our position as a green and sustainable finance hub in the region, we are now doubling our efforts to promote market development, align Hong Kong's regulatory standards with international best practices, encourage more entities to make use of Hong Kong's capital markets as well as financial and professional service, and capitalise on the enormous green finance opportunities presented by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development and the Belt and Road Initiative. And amongst those measures, the Government will take the lead where appropriate. For example, we have recently doubled the borrowing ceiling of the Government Green Bond Programme to HK$200 billion which will provide more room for piloting the issuance of green bonds that involves more types of currencies, project types, issuance formats and channels. We successfully issued the third batch of government green bonds last month, worth US$3.75 billion and comprising five tranches including euro-denominated bonds and Renminbi-denominated bonds for the first time, which were all well received by global institutional investors. We are also planning to issue retail bonds for the participation of the general public, engaging them in the development of green finance. In addition, we have enhanced the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme to encourage issuance of more green and sustainable bonds and loans in Hong Kong, and attract more financial and professional service providers and external reviewers to expand their presence in Hong Kong. To grow the talent pool of this fast-growing market, I announced in my 2021 Policy Address to add professionals in ESG to the Talent List. In addition, we will endeavour to include more courses related to ESG in the list of reimbursable courses under the Continuing Education Fund and incorporate more ESG-related topics in the business and finance programmes. Meanwhile, the Centre for Green and Sustainable Finance is co-ordinating efforts of financial regulators, government agencies, industry stakeholders and academia in capacity building, thought leadership and policy development. As China is striving towards achieving carbon neutrality before 2060, Hong Kong is in a unique position to connect the flow of green and sustainable funds with the Mainland and the world to promote green investments and ecological civilisation on the Mainland. For this, the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group formed by relevant government bureaux and financial regulators will soon complete an assessment report on the feasibility of developing Hong Kong into a regional carbon trading centre and explore opportunities presented by the carbon emission markets in the Mainland and overseas. We will also promote co-operation between the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and the Guangzhou Futures Exchange in areas such as clearing, technology, product development and marketing to drive the development of a green and low-carbon market in the region. But I would say that Hong Kong's ambitions in green finance go beyond the Greater Bay Area. For example, in my recent official trip to Hubei, I also visited the Hubei carbon emission exchange, and they are also very keen to co-operate with us. HKQAA has indeed long been one of our most supportive partners in promoting green and sustainable finance. I am glad to know that HKQAA launched a new Green and Sustainable Finance Certification Scheme in May this year to cover a wider array of green and sustainable products in the market. Looking ahead, we shall continue to count on the good work of the HKQAA in quality assurance and maintenance of standards for our green and sustainable causes. We also look forward to further collaboration with the industry and stakeholders to encourage more entities, especially those in the Greater Bay Area, to make use of Hong Kong's platform for green and sustainable investment, financing and certification. I wish the symposium a great success and all of you the best of business, investment and health. And as Christmas and New Year are approaching, I take this opportunity to wish you a happy Christmas and a more rewarding and fruitful year ahead. Thank you very much.

It\' s not clear to most observers, however, if the call will serve to aggravate or alleviate tensions. Significantly, the meeting will be held after the sixth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which ends this Thursday and is expected to agree to give General Secretary Xi a third five-year term as president. Preparations for the plenary prevented Xi from attending the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference , or COP26 summit, in Glasgow, United Kingdom this month. On November 2, Biden criticized China as well as Russia for their lack of participation in the summit. If the call goes through, the two leaders will have plenty to discuss. Since last month, Chinese state media has started to HYPERLINK http://www.news.cn/politics/xxjxs/2021-10/26/c_1127995932.htm promote the Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing in February 2022. Calls for a boycott of the Games over China\' s human rights record are gathering resonance in various Western nations. Tensions in the Taiwan Strait, meanwhile, spiked this week after a delegation of US Congress members arrived in Taipei on Tuesday on an unannounced visit aboard a US Navy aircraft. The surprise visit was slammed by officials at the Chinese Ministry of Defense and the State Council\' s Taiwan Affairs Office. On September 10, Xi and Biden held a 90-minute phone call and reportedly agreed that China and the US should resume dialogue in the spirit of equality and mutual respect. The White House HYPERLINK https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-call-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/ said the phone call was part of the US\' s ongoing efforts to responsibly manage US-China competition in various realms. Earlier high-level diplomatic exchanges have ended in acrimony. Top US and Chinese diplomats openly rebuked each other at a face-to-face meeting in Alaska in March. US officials said at the time they could not discuss matters with their Chinese counterparts, who adopted  wolf warrior attitudes, while Chinese officials complained US officials spoke down to them. After the Xi-Biden phone call in September, Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of the CPC Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for six hours in Zurich, Switzerland. They reportedly discussed a possible virtual meeting between Xi and Biden for later this year. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/China-US-Anchorage-March-19-2021.jpg?resize=780%2C446&ssl=1 Link to Image Later, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He held a virtual meeting with US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on October 9 and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on October 26. State media said the Liu-Yellen meeting, which reportedly entailed deeper and more concrete discussions, was more pragmatic than the Liu-Tai one. On Tuesday, Chinese media reports acknowledged a virtual Xi-Biden meeting would be held as soon as next week but that so far no date had been fixed. On the same day, Xi told a group of US former officials and businessmen in a letter that China was ready to work with the US to address regional and international issues as well as global challenges on the condition of  mutual respect.  Right now, China-US relations are at a critical historical juncture, Xi said.  Both countries will gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is the only right choice. HYPERLINK https://www.ncuscr.org/event/2021-gala-dinner gala dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations in New York on November 9.

MOFA said it was providing administrative assistance to the delegation and coordinating with the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on relevant epidemic prevention measures. In Beijing, officials of China\' s Ministry of Defense and State Council\' s Taiwan Affairs Office, criticized the Taiwanese administration and the US congressmen for the incident. Beijing strongly opposes any official and military ties between the US and Taiwan, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office, HYPERLINK said in a media briefing on Wednesday.

Zhu said after unification the fortunes created by Taiwanese people would be used to improve people\' s livelihoods instead of buying weapons and international friendships. Tan Kefei, spokesperson for China\' s Ministry of National Defense, HYPERLINK http://www.mod.gov.cn/topnews/2021-11/09/content_4898602.htm said the US had to stop their provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, which he said interfered in China\' s internal affairs and undermined China\' s sovereignty. A few hours after the landing of the US warplane in Taipei, the Eastern Theater Command of the PLA issued a http://www.mod.gov.cn/big5/topnews/2021-11/09/content_4898608.htm statement that it had organized a patrol mission in the Taiwan Strait. On Wednesday, China\' s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a video speech during the Symposium on Global Maritime Cooperation and Ocean Governance 2021 that some countries tried to maintain maritime hegemony by showing off at sea and forming an alliance to hurt other countries\' legal rights. The United States is reportedly going to hold a Summit for Democracy on December 9-10, for which it has invited more than a 100 countries and governments including Taiwan to attend this virtual meeting.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong30","Xi\u8217 s no go to Glasgow","November 5, 2021 6:57 AM GMT","Week in China","The successes of the Paris climate summit of 2015 could not have been achieved without months of groundwork from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and former US president Barack Obama to reach an agreement on a deal.  As the two largest economies in the world and the two largest carbon emitters, we have both determined that it is our responsibility to take action, Obama would later announce, with Xi sitting next to him. United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 The chances of closer collaboration were also scotched by comments from Joe Biden, the current US president, about the absence of his Chinese counterpart at the summit.  We showed up, he told reporters shortly before world leaders departed from the Scottish city, leaving their climate change officials behind for two weeks of negotiations. Biden then described Xi\' s non-appearance at the Glasgow conference as a  big mistake .  The single most important thing that\' s gotten the attention of the world is climate, Biden added.  It just is a gigantic issue and they [the Chinese] walked away . For the Chinese that was all a bit rich, following Donald Trump\' s decision to take the Americans out of the Paris deal four years ago.  China-US joint efforts resulted in the Paris Agreement... it was hard-fought, you can't just give up, but the US gave up, China\' s climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua fired back in comments of his own to reporters.  Five years were wasted but now we need to work harder and catch up, he added. But would Xi Jinping give any signals that the Chinese were ready to help in making up some of that lost ground? He delivered his remarks to the summit in written form (China\' s foreign ministry later explained the host of the conference did not provide the option to take part by video link), confirming a number of China\' s previous commitments to combat global warming. But despite coming under pressure from leaders like French leader Emmanuel Macron to send a  decisive signal on climate change, Xi\' s message generally disappointed the attendees at the summit in lacking new pledges. Campaigners have also rued a missed opportunity to get climate change under greater control, warning that we are running out of chances to slow global warming. What is the background to China\' s climate commitments at COP26 ? The 2015 Paris agreement aims to limit the global average temperature rise to no more than 1.5\'b0C above levels that prevailed on the planet before the onset of the Industrial Revolution (when fossil fuels began to be burned in increasing quantities). The gathering in Glasgow was a chance for countries to show their commitment to the cause, primarily via non-binding NDCs, or Nationally Determined Contributions, in which signatories to the Paris accord are tasked with submitting their emission-reduction plans, and where possible volunteer to go further than earlier targets. Xi signalled a year ago that China would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 and reach peak emissions by 2030. But Beijing had missed several deadlines in publishing its latest NDC, leading to speculation that the Chinese might go on a diplomatic offensive in Glasgow by introducing a set of more ambitious goals in a bid to outflank their critics, and score political points in the wider row with Washington. When the NDC was finally submitted to the United Nations last Thursday there wasn\' t much that was new, however. The submission made a clearer commitment that Chinese emissions will peak by 2030 and China said it would increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy consumption to 25%, an uptick on the 20% share pledged previously. There was also a promise of more reforestation and to boost the installed capacity of wind and solar power to a newly specified higher level. But climate campaigners had hoped for bolder steps and were disappointed, saying that the Chinese had missed a chance to demonstrate greater leadership at a critical moment for the planet. In particular they wanted a pledge of an earlier peak in emissions than 2030, with the argument that China could do more to accelerate the spread of renewable energy, bringing the peak forward by as many as five years. And while the Chinese did give more details on proposals to cap emissions from high-polluting sectors like steelmaking and petrochemicals, campaigners wanted to see more ambition and greater urgency in the nation\' s plan.  If the world is going to have any chance of coming to grips with the climate crisis, China \- as well as all other major emitters \- needs to graduate from taking small steps to giant leaps toward a cleaner and safer future, Helen Mountford, World Resources Institute\' s vice president for Climate and Economics, told CNN. Is it fair to expect the Chinese to do more to fight global warming? Commentators say that the Chinese aren\' t alone in failing to do more to respond to climate change. The United Nation\' s latest tally of all the revised plans submitted in advance of the Glasgow summit has calculated that governments aren\' t doing enough to curb greenhouse gases and that the world is heading for warming of 2.7\'b0C \- deep into dangerous territory in climate change terms \- by the end of the century. Some countries have been rebuked more than others for the limited commitments they have made. Australia submitted its NDC without a stronger emissions target for 2030, for instance, while Brazil and Mexico have set goals that are weaker than their previous pledges. Even in cases where governments have agreed to more aggressive milestones, few will reach the thresholds needed to deliver on global warming goals, says Climate Action Tracker, a non-profit organisation that monitors efforts to achieve the targets set out in Paris. It reckons that just one country \- The Gambia \- is doing enough to meet the 1.5\'b0C target. The pressure on China to act is the greatest, however, because its share of climate-changing pollution is so high that the Paris objectives won\' t be met without rapid Chinese action to reduce emissions. China is now responsible for more than a quarter of greenhouse gas creation, with emissions that exceed the United States, the European Union, Japan and all the world\' s other developed nations combined. CREA, a Finland-based environmental research group, has even highlighted how single companies in China are bigger polluters than entire nations too. Huaneng, one of the biggest Chinese energy producers, generates similar emissions to the UK. Shanghai Auto, a leading carmaker, emits as much as Argentina. PetroChina, the largest of China\' s oil majors, pumps out more greenhouse gases than Vietnam and South Korea put together. And what about China\' s coal conundrum? Another factor in the subdued response to China\' s climate pledges is that the summit comes at a time when Beijing is turning up the dial on coal-fired power to stave off domestic energy shortages ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2021/10/power-struggle-over-coal/ see WiC559 ). More than 220 million metric tonnes of extra coal will be produced this year, a rise of nearly 6% from last year. This burning of fossil fuel will increase carbon dioxide emissions by a full percentage point on a global basis, claims Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo.  The timing is horrible, coming right before the climate summit, he earlier told the New York Times. Chinese policymakers insist that the surge in coal output is temporary. But critics have seized on the situation as another signal of how Beijing\' s commitments on fossil fuels start to fray when \- in the shorter term \- the going gets tough, as it has done with the energy crunch of the last few weeks. Indeed, China\' s dependence on coal is now a touchstone issue in the climate debate. Three-fifths of the country\' s energy comes from coal and China now accounts for more than half of the world\' s coal consumption on an annual basis. Despite a much-heralded decision in September to stop the funding of new coal-fired power plants overseas, China grew its own coal-fired capacity at a scale of three times the rest of the world combined last year. Beijing counters that it is building the most efficient and lowest-polluting plants. Critics aren\' t swayed, warning that the battle against global warming will never be won while the Chinese are pumping growing quantities of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. How do the Chinese respond to the call to do more on climate change? Beijing balks at being singled out for special attention, preferring to shift the focus to how developed nations must do more to fight climate change. Part of Beijing\' s rationale is that developed countries have been generating greenhouse gases over a much longer period. Analysis from Rhodium Group underscores how richer nations in the OECD bloc have emitted four times more CO2 than China since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s.  The citizens of developed countries have been enjoying the benefits of industrialisation at the expense of the environment for more than 200 years. When they demand the developing countries stop their industrial development to meet the climate targets, debate is sure to ensue,  the Global Times argued. China still categorises itself as a  developing country\' , and points out its per capita emissions are also lower than those of wealthier nations, especially the US, which are twice as high. But this argument is weakening, according to Paul G Harris, a professor of Global and Environmental Studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, who says per capita emissions in China are now similar to Germany\' s and well above the UK\' s. Harris told the Hong Kong Free Press last week that many urban Chinese are now bigger polluters \- based on their lifestyles and carbon footprints \- than millions of people in the US and Europe.  High-end polluters in Beijing and Shanghai are role models for hundreds of millions of less well-off Chinese people, Harris says.  This means that future efforts to reduce China\' s total emissions will struggle as more people aspire to live like their affluent compatriots. China\' s per capita emissions are now more than triple those of countries like Brazil and India as well. That makes it harder for Beijing to claim leadership of the developing nations that are demanding that richer countries do more to counter global warming. The Chinese can still be commended for making substantial changes to their high-carbon economy, with huge investments in renewable energy in recent years. Despite being criticised for relying on coal-fired power, China leads the world in deployments of wind and solar power, for instance. Chinese leaders can also make the case that they deliver on the commitments they make, sometimes surpassing their targets. As an example last month the State Council released a white paper on how China was exceeding its domestic targets in carbon intensity (a measure of energy usage per unit of GDP). Progress like this  means that China had more than fulfilled its commitment to the international community , the paper proclaimed. Where will China\' s climate policy focus most in future? Some of the improvement in emissions will come naturally as China\' s economy gravitates towards more value-added growth engines, with bigger proportions of GDP derived from sectors that have reduced carbon footprints. In the meantime the focus is more on delivering the country\' s current goals rather than dazzling the delegates at COP26 with new targets, an unnamed member of the Chinese delegation in Glasgow told the Global Times last week. Western nations would do better to meet their funding commitments to developing nations, before pointing fingers at others, the Chinese delegate added. Xie Zhenhua, the head of the Chinese team at the COP26 summit, warmed to the same theme this week, accusing developed countries of not doing more to cut emissions faster and failing to provide the $100 billion a year they have promised to help poorer countries cut emissions and cope with the impact of extreme weather. Back in China the path to a greener economy comes with a hefty price tag, with predictions from Jing Liu, a senior economist at HSBC, that an eye-popping Rmb200 trillion ($31 trillion) needs to be invested if Beijing is to reach its net-zero goal for 2060. That sounds like a daunting amount, although Liu says that finding the money shouldn\' t be too much of problem because China still has high domestic savings rates. Two-thirds of the finance will go into transforming the industrial and energy sectors, the two biggest polluters. One of the main recipients will be new sources of renewable power, with estimates from the International Energy Agency that China needs to increase its solar generation by a factor of seven, and its wind power by a factor of nine, to offset a reduced reliance on coal. Another key priority for investment is ultra-high voltage (UHV) technology that (arguably) matches supply and demand more effectively across the grid; plus new energy storage systems that tackle the problem of more volatile supply from renewable sources like wind, solar and water. Of course leadership in these new sectors could also turn out to be a boon for the Chinese, uncovering new chances to build vast new businesses from frontier technologies and exporting them. That would turn the economics of climate change policy on its head from a situation in which it is often seen today as a drag on growth and a drain on resources.  Despite all the challenges, the green transformation of China\' s economy also comes with enormous opportunities, Liu of HSBC agrees, describing the Chinese timelines for peak carbon and net-zero as  ambitious yet achievable . \"

New climate plans next year, instead of waiting another five years, can keep 1.5 degrees on life support for another 12 months, and gives campaigners another year to shift government climate policy. It also opens the door to requesting further NDC updates from 2022 onward to help ratchet up ambition this decade.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong33","China needs Middle East oil to wean itself off coal","November 9, 2021 Tuesday 10:12 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","China\' s absence from the COP26 climate summit has drawn criticism from all corners. Given President Xi Jinping\' s lack of foreign travel since January 2020, his Glasgow no-show did not come as a surprise. China has already committed to achieving peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, so perhaps Beijing thought it had little more to offer at this stage. However, as the world\' s biggest carbon polluter, questions over how China aims to complete its climate commitments loom large. China\' s push toward carbon neutrality will have a major impact on the future structure of its energy sources. This in turn will eventually alter China\' s relationship with Middle East countries that it has depended on for crude-oil supply for decades. But carbon emissions from China\' s oil use are dwarfed by the damage done from burning coal, and it is cutting out coal, not oil, that is Beijing\' s immediate concern. While the end game for everyone is renewable energy, in the shorter term, the phasing out of coal-fired power stations will lead to China buying more oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Contrary to what many at COP26 might say, the push for net-zero is likely to strengthen relations between Beijing and the Middle East based on the supply of oil. China\' s need for more oil to see it through this transition squares with Riyadh\' s plans to maintain oil production while using methods like carbon capture and planting vast forests to reach net-zero carbon emissions. This approach has been labeled the  circular carbon economy, and continuing to serve oil to its biggest customer China has been factored into the plan. As China attempts to bring down coal consumption while maintaining its economic edge, its demand for Middle East oil is likely to increase rather than decrease in the foreseeable future.\~ China is already facing a major energy crisis. The ambitious aim for carbon neutrality by 2060 was made a little more than a year ago at the UN General Assembly. At this year\' s event, China made a further pledge to stop building coal-fired power plants abroad. But these noble aims have already contributed to a severe shortage of electricity in the country this year. Millions of homes and businesses were hit with power cuts after China imposed targets for energy consumption and energy intensity. The coal-fired power plants were the first to take the hit. As winter approaches and more energy is needed, China has rushed to mine and burn more coal to ensure domestic consumption needs are met and to calm anger over power cuts. What it shows is that there is a limit to how quickly China can change its current energy-consumption structure. After all, Beijing has to rely on economic development and social stability for its legitimacy.\~ This experience was a reminder of just how much China relies on coal and why it remains China\' s primary source of carbon emissions. In 2019, fossil fuels made up 85% of China\' s energy consumption, which is roughly the same as the rest of the world. But almost 58% came from coal \- a figure far exceeding the global average of less than 30%. Consequently, burning coal amounts to about 80% of China\' s total fossil-fuel emissions, followed by 14% from oil and 7% from natural gas. This highlights the challenge China faces in reducing coal consumption alone.\~ The focus on coal temporarily eases the immediate concern to cut oil consumption, although in the long term oil will face the same fate. According to the Low Carbon Economy Lab (LCEL) of Tsinghua University, coal has almost peaked in China and will plateau for about a decade before it begins to drop sharply. Oil follows a similar graph to coal, but with additional, though limited, demand growth in the next decade, while natural gas has yet to hit its peak before it begins to decline. Other studies and reports agree that China\' s short-term imports of crude oil will continue to rise, with the majority coming from the Middle East. For example, an S&P Global report shows that China\' s dependence on Middle Eastern oil rose in June\~despite the number of global crude-oil suppliers to China narrowing to 26, down from 41 in the same month of last year.\~ How much oil China buys from a country like Saudi Arabia will continue to depend on price rather than carbon-emission concerns for the foreseeable future. One challenge to oil imports is China\' s concern for energy security. China has been seeking new energy sources to reduce threats to its economic growth. Beijing understands very well that carbon neutrality can only be achieved with a cleaner energy system. In this sense, China\' s carbon-emission reduction is not only to combat climate change but also to reduce its over-reliance on external supplies. China is concerned that supplies could be cut at shipping chokepoints such as the Malacca Strait or the Strait of Hormuz during international disputes or conflicts. Just like the developed countries, China\' s dependence on crude-oil imports will fall, eventually. The Middle East\' s oil producers will have to take that into consideration and consider a strategy of economic diversification in the long run. But in the meantime oil exports will continue to underpin China\' s economic rise and define relations between Beijing and the Middle East.

What about crypto's carbon footprint? Is technology progressing equality? A lot of really good questions here on today's episode of Word on the Block, the series that takes a deeper dive into blockchain and all the emerging technologies that shape our world at the intersection of business, politics and economy. It's what we cover right here on Forkast.News .\~ I'm Editor-in-Chief Angie Lau. Taynaah Reis grew up in Brazil. She watched her mother take daily trips to the local bank, often spending hours at a time there. Taynaah would make a play-bank at home, waiting for her mom to return. She promised that when she grew up, she would build the bank of all banks and make her mom proud - a bank that did not require all those long trips to a physical bricks-and-mortar. And now that young self-taught technologist who had a dream to build the bank of all banks is sitting with us right here today as the co-founder and CEO of blockchain financial services provider and neobank Moeda Seeds bank, which offers banking service to underserved entrepreneurs, women, farmers and many more. Taynaah Reis - named one of the 12 young most innovative leaders to watch by Forbes in 2017 - joins us now. Taynaah, welcome to the show. You grew up in Brazil and it's a real struggle. For our audience, it'd be great to understand just from your perspective, how Brazil, banking, and how that part of the world really struggled with financial services. Taynaah Reis: Thank you for having me here. It's a super-pleasure. Also, culturally, it is hard for women because Brazil is still a very 'machist' country, so many of the wallets and the banking records are in the name of the husband usually, and the land and collateral, and things that they need to have access to a larger credit, or affordable credit, are usually in the name of the man of the house. So this becomes a problem when they look for credit - and they don't get it. I've seen many women struggling and trying to get access to credit through those department stores' cards, trying to have credit to buy a machine that irrigates your coffee, or all the things that you end up paying thousands in interest rates and crazy percentages for a department store because you don't have access to a credit card or financial service from the traditional industry.\~ And also the education, the financial literacy that most don't have. When you open a bank account, that is also the first step into identity, to have an ID and then to have the education, proper education, to start a business and to build a business plan and to allocate the money for the long term. Many of them ... don't know. I grew up - even being privileged in a school that was a private school - I didn't get access to that, as well. In Brazil, the focus was not on being entrepreneurs, but to have ... careers in the government or either like in other industries, but they never focused on entrepreneurship. So for me, growing up was a struggle too. Even having access to other companies and friends, (it) was hard to raise venture capital for my business. Being young and a woman in Brazil, that's hard, too. So I found in cryptocurrencies the first way to get access to finance, to be able to finance the business that we have today, thanks to HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/what-is-blockchain-and-why-you-should-care/ blockchain . We were able to raise in an ICO - an HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/is-defi-surge-sustainable-or-ico-bubble-chyna-qu/ initial coin offer - the funding that was required to build Moeda. So that, for me... it was an opportunity, like raising US$20 million equivalent to a series-A in 2017 was hard, I think, to do. So, in two weeks we were able to raise it, and (we're) still like, going, 'Amazing.' Lau: You list all of the frustrations that you're experiencing, from traditional finance to a largely patriarchal system in Brazil and Latin America that really restricts access to finance for women. And then you place upon that ... these social expectations - that you're not necessarily expected to be an entrepreneur, and the system is not set up to support that kind of ambition. And so here you are - you're creating access to liquidity that funds ideas, a new sort of thinking of a bank. It's kind of what we're seeing with a lot of projects like Moeda. Uniquely in Latin America, help us understand, just kind of politically, what the frustrations are, as well, for the average, everyday person to be able to access funding, to be able to actually do the everyday necessity of banking. Reis: Today's a big time of uncertainty. And when Covid hit, it brought another level of uncertainty to the people. Investors that are looking to that kind of impact investment, they don't trust a lot. They want to help, but they don't know why - but they want to verify as well, as the business is going. So for the first time, like, five years ago, when I presented at the U.N. a couple of ideas related to Moeda - 'Do you want to invest in someone in Brazil, in a cooperative in Brazil and small businesses in Brazil?' And people would tell me, 'No, your politics... this, and that is too risky for me, I cannot do it.' So I told them, 'Oh, if we present this application through the app, you can see step-by-step the business, how much they will be spending, their key performance indicators... Would you invest if you trust the whole thing?' And they said, 'Yes, if I can see it in real time - what they are doing - I would invest - and where my money is going.'\~ So we created all those metrics and I started to see early, HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/bitcoin-birthday-moments-cryptocurrency/ Bitcoin and the underlying technology of blockchain to build that trust. So, the more information that we share, the more impact metrics that we have, and everything that's needed for the people to build that trust - that's where I found the most meaningful part of blockchain technology to build that along the way and to be able to measure how many jobs we made, the HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/why-blockchain-integral-net-zero-carbon-emissions/ carbon footprint , and how HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/bitcoin-mining-is-infinitely-sustainable-says-blockstream-executive/ sustainable it is - the carbon that people are investing into middlemen. So today, people can invest. You can create an account at Moeda ... in three clicks, you'll be able to invest in a woman-owned business. It's as little as US$1.50 - less than a coffee in the airport.\~ So now that there is no barrier with technology, we can make it easier and affordable for people that are looking for those kinds of investments to do good and do well. That doesn't need to be a trade-off. You can have the financial returns as well as the impact on social and HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/emons-bitcoin-energy-connection/ environmental returns. Through them all, through those years, we have proven this, and you are able to verify through the blockchain. So those things are important for building that bridge of trust in a country like Brazil, where it is too risky for most people. Lau: Tell us how Moeda actually works. When you structured the bank, how did you want it to work? What's the philosophy behind it, and what are the step-by-steps when people want to bank it? Our philosophy and our mission is to humanize finances and distributed impact. The main idea was to get access to capital and access to affordable capital and education to the ones that most need it in Brazil, particularly. And what we do - we give preference to women. We don't exclude men's preference. We curate projects. Our team can help, from business plans to co-branding, and to think through niche markets and how to put in place services and products. And we can go and guide all through the way through our partners, as well, so people can reach out to us and sign up to one of those programs. We have a 'gamified' way to do ... HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/video-audio/cardano-hoskinson-fortune500-ada-defi-cryptocurrency-blockchain/ microcredit . So even if women don't have any credit history at all, they can invite another five women and those will be the support group for her into the journey. They will receive daily... KPIs - not only financial KPIs, but also if they reinvest in the women and they hire more women, they will benefit together through this journey. So we created economic incentives with HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/tokens-nfts-tokenization/ tokens along the way, so they can receive the benefit of doing good within the ecosystem. And on the other side, for people that want to do the impact investment, (it's a) super-affordable way to do it - and easily with all the transparency and trust, they can come and look at those projects on our website, create an account and invest right away either in the cryptocurrency or, if it's in Brazil, through deposits. We also have a partnership with MasterCard. We are part of the Start Path program, so the people in Brazil receive a prepaid card, and we can track and monitor and verify all the expenses into that, too, to bring all the certainty that's needed that they are applying the money for the reasons that they are linked within the program. And we do the metrics and calculate all the gender equality aspects, and everything that's owned by the level of the transactions into that too. And on Covid, we launched a payment gateway for marketplaces, so that was the biggest line of credit that we offer, because we anticipate everything that they gain from the marketplace and also all the contracts from supermarkets that pay them. In 90 days, we anticipate for one day, so that was the biggest line of credit that grew and (it) helps them to plan crops and other things. So, from one technology, I see (it's) all connected in how we can help and support with a single account and an ID, like, how much benefit they can have, both on the marketing side and access to more capital, and guarantees that they can build upon the time, as well. They accredit with us, and have more and more opportunities. Lau: What did blockchain, tokenization and crypto allow you to do as a bank that perhaps a traditional bank could not do? Reis: The first thing is - as I mentioned - the funding that came from a non-traditional way. So, to build up, the bank was able to do so through an initial coin offer, the ICO, that we made. But after that, with the currency that we've created, and all the steps like cross-chain into different protocols, today we use the HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/what-is-ethereum-and-how-can-it-become-the-future-of-blockchain/ Ethereum protocol for the main currency. The Stellar protocol for HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/what-are-stablecoins-why-some-governments-afraid-of-them/ stablecurrency -\~ stablecurrency is easier for adoption by people, but we can measure the level of transactions, like each dollar, each euro, each Bitcoin that is going to the project, how many jobs that created and the social and environmental impact of the transaction, so (it) brings another level - an extra level - of sharing information that can help to build trust along the way. People want to help, but they want to verify that help. Even for the HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/un-goals-guiding-new-blockchain-investment-vehicles/ environmental, social and governance Lau: Totally - accountability.\~ Reis: Absolutely. For accountability. It's the key I see in blockchain. Now, we have the COP26 ( United Nations Climate Change Conference ), and many discussions on climate change to hold every country accountable and every individual accountable, as well. We can benefit from this technology over time. We see opportunities to create different economic models and assets that are sustainable over time that can embrace what we do with coffee, what we do with plantations and crops, and even Amazonia. We just launched, recently, a HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/vitalik-buterin-defi-nfts-daos/ non-fungible token . We see those types of assets like evolving to different economic models that can benefit in the long run. Lau: It's a disruptive idea - there's zero doubt about it. The adoption is incredible, especially in Latin America. And it can also be viewed as a little dangerous if you're the government. What's the view of Brazil, and what's the view of the political class, the government, as it pertains to the speed with which crypto is being embraced - and Bitcoin etc - versus what it's trying to do with its own real - and its own fiat - money? Reis: The government has been very proactive. The market regulator has created a sandbox, and there has been a lot of work done in a progressive way by the government. But it still is at a governmental pace, so it takes longer to adapt and to accept innovation than we would wish, because things happen so quickly, and especially on the crypto side of the market - NFTs, the metaverse and decentralized finance. The government will be slow to catch up. But I do see it as being beneficial to create a framework for guidance for the ones that want to do good and the use of that technology for good being highlighted, and those experiences being broadcasted into other countries that have the same challenges. People before used to see just the speculative side, with the trading and currencies, which the government is afraid of - and is still afraid of - to protect investors and really make sure that people are not taking too much risk or being scammed... like, so, the government wants to protect that, but it would be also good to create those regulatory frameworks where companies like mine feel comfortable to create and innovate and be disruptive, as we can under those frameworks. So I do say ... they should be faster. Lau: You know what? That's definitely the tension that exists right now. It's this dance, this very delicate dance between regulators and innovators such as yourself. I think both will agree that one needs the other, at the end of the day, for growth in the industry, for mass adoption in the industry. But one thing about mass adoption that I wanted to ask you about was definitely one of the biggest pieces of Bitcoin news this year - El Salvador's recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender. Since then, we've seen a lot of Latin American nations and politicians even voicing support and even hinting at the possibility of following suit and adopting Bitcoin as a currency. What is the public perception of Bitcoin and crypto in Latin America? If you could kind of share with us this perspective, and what is it growing up - even for yourself - and just also the instability of the system in Latin America that kind of lends to this interest in potentially using Bitcoin as a national currency? Reis: Now, more global institutions are looking differently at blockchain and Bitcoin. People are perceiving it in a more positive (light). After (Tesla founder) Elon Musk and also, as you mentioned, HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/el-salvador-lead-bitcoin-inspire-others-follow-suit/ El Salvador declaring But you need to prepare people with education, because it still is an environment and a market that has hundreds of thousands of coins. There are projects there that do good, and other projects that you need to study and see the risk of them, too. So I see a super-positive - that people look at cryptocurrencies now with a different eye because they see not just the speculative part, but now they see the the technology as being beneficial for accountability to track and measure products, logistics and other things that people would not have access to before ... But I do see the government supporting, and supporting the people with education and infrastructure, to join this movement today. Everybody will benefit from that. Lau: And Taynaah, you just told us that you needed to move to a secondary location, so I'm going to let you do that, but I know you're still listening, and I want to ask you this question about ESG. There's just a lot of real interest about crypto and the carbon footprint that it also has on the environment and the like, and those concerns. How are you mitigating those concerns? What are those ESG concerns? What are those carbon footprint concerns that you're trying to be thoughtful about and how you potentially could help mitigate? Reis: Especially now, with the COP26 and people being aware about the climate change consequences that will affect all of us - not only people from the government that are now deciding, but all of us - it's into the small decisions, the daily decisions that we can do the change, be they investment decisions or consumption ... So if we can look at products today that have less impact on our HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/bitcoin-mining-threat-environment/ environment and benefit more people to support our environment, those are the products that we should be buying and investments that we should be making to companies that benefit Amazonia and create benefits like protecting other areas in the world. And, yes, we can - through blockchain - share that information. I think every (piece of) information is good for the public ... being public or being given by companies in a strategic way. We have Dow Jones sustainability, we have many stock markets that are now looking to implement metrics and index stations and algorithms to support those companies and to be highlighted. But there is a lot to do to include ESG assets into common people's portfolios. And that's what we have been trying to do - being democratic in a way that people can invest and access that kind of sustainable green asset. The carbon credit is not regulated in many countries, and it's nonexistent in many countries, as well. Creating a global framework in a global marketplace for carbon credits would be amazing, but not only to compensate carbon, but also to invest in people to protect areas. We need to look into those things, as well - like, you can plant trees on a billionaire's farm, but also it will be good to help small agriculture farm-holders to protect their farms and not only plant monoculture, but also bringing in tropical and like other types of cultivation for crops that are more sustainable over time. So there is a lot to do. But technology can support and help on a daily basis. Lau: Absolutely, because there's a flexibility in the speed with which you can enter these partnerships. One of the partnerships that you mentioned is with Brazilian forestry manager 3Agro to create NFTs out of tokenizing the production of freeze-dried a\'e7a\'ed, for example - to help preserve the Amazon rainforest. These are the actual things that you could offer up customers and create a community around it, and I think that's really one of the really important aspects of of blockchain and crypto - it's that there really is a community feeling around it, and because of smart contracts and because of the smart-contract nature of the the functionality of some of these protocols, it means that I can trust that when I say that I'm investing or that I want to participate in it. It's actually being done. Reis: Absolutely. We were pioneers in that. It was the first NFT for the Amazon rainforest region. So by purchasing one NFT, the investor can get access not just to plant 1,200 a\'e7a\'ed trees in that region - equivalent to one hectare - but also participate in the revenue of the sales of the a\'e7a\'ed under production at the end of every six months. So that's one of the economic models that we can see how sustainable they can be through the future, not only to compensate carbon credits, but also to support entrepreneurs in the region to continue in their businesses in a sustainable way. They plant not only a\'e7a\'ed, but a range of other things into a syntropic (farming model), say, which is super-sustainable for the crop, brings more nutrients, and people can get to see how other practices can be sustainable. We can share that, and investors will benefit not only from the financial returns of the project, but also contribute in a sustainable way to the Amazon. So, those types of assets are passionate to build technology and to see that, to support people and individuals and businesses, especially in the areas that need it the most. Lau: I kind of want to bring it back full-circle, because it all started with the frustration you felt as a little girl growing up in a system that disenfranchised a lot of people - disenfranchised a lot of women, and kind of railroaded a lot of people into a traditional structure. You recently spoke at Hong Kong Fintech Week, along with myself and so many great leaders in blockchain. How has this become a global phenomenon that allows you to take this idea that was really seeded in Brazil and bring it to an international audience? What's your vision there, and how do you view Asia? Reis: There's a lot of courage and persistence. In our expansion plan, now we feel ready because we've developed so many beautiful technologies to be that bridge between the traditional way... and to people to get access, and the adoption to be quick with a well-designed app, but also the other way to access the crypto world, and to bring crypto to those challenges and issues in the real world, too. So... connecting and creating that bridge between the metaverse and the real world. I do see today that we have the proper infrastructure to do so, and we want to bring it to other countries... Latin America and Asia... Like, most of our investors today are from Asia, and I'm super-thankful for that, because one day I asked a question to one of our investors - ' Why did you invest in Moeda? This thing will be, like, on the other side of the world.' And he said to me, 'What you wrote in the white paper -if this works, my fourth generation can benefit from that, and that's why I invested in you.' And I found it so beautiful, because he could see - in the long term - the vision of helping not just one generation but, he told me, the fourth generation. So it was a very special moment... I do see in the long term how things that we are creating in a collaborative way and, like, being able now to share our experience and our technology with other countries. This, for me, is where my heart is today -\~ in building technology to serve people - and that is aligned with my personal mission, as well. So, I do see it as a bigger, embodied opportunity for many people that can benefit from what we do today. And I'm very excited to now expand what we've done. Lau: It's amazing to see how far you've come since those many years ago in 2017 - the ICOs. A lot of people during that phase didn't have projects that survived, and yours did. And what you've created is now starting to reach an international audience. But I think it just boils down to that dream that you had, which is, 'We can do better.' And when we think about that, it's all about access. It's, 'Can we give people better access?' And I think you've definitely started us on that journey with what we're seeing in Brazil, so good for you. What's next for you? Reis: Next, right now, is to expand. I can't wait to see our technology benefiting other people and bringing more projects from all over the world to our portfolio, and to share the learnings and experiences with people from all over the world. I do see - in Africa, in Southeast Asia and India and Latin America - (it) will do so well, like, to contribute to other companies, HYPERLINK https://forkast.news/where-are-fintech-startups-global-investments-map/ fintechs , payment providers. I do want to see the gender calculator being everywhere in other marketplaces so people can get to know the products they are buying and how it's benefiting women and how this is being sustainable. I want to see people on a daily basis not thinking about impact investment in the future - they will just do it naturally because it's part of their day-to-day portfolio of average banking products. I want to see my children and my grandchildren showing me, 'Mom, this is my NFT. See my drawing, see the music. See, I'm helping Amazonia with a ... beautiful NFT gallery.' That's what I would see in the future - connecting to many worlds and many people, and connecting them to do good together. Like, many of the challenges that can be gamified and benefit the real world in the sense of collective work towards many of the objectives that we see not only in climate change but ending poverty, hunger, and many of the things that are possible with technology and with people being the humans that are behind the technology, and supporting that to cooperate for the greater good. Lau: To say that it's rare to hear this kind of language coming from the CEO of a bank is probably a little understated, but this is what this technology brings - which is a different choice and different perspectives, and also important philosophies that a lot of people resonate with. And if that's your consumers who are sharing liquidity with you based on that, it's a whole redefinition of this space. Taynaah Reis of Moeda bank, thank you so much for sharing the story, your vision, what's happening in Brazil, Latin America, how that also translates to Southeast Asia and large swaths of Asia that we're also seeing with so many people unbanked, and really giving us a glimpse of of the future of banking. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Reis: Thank you so much for the opportunity. Lau: Taynaah, thank you so much. And everyone, thank you so much for joining us on this latest episode of Word on the Block. I'm Editor-in-Chief Angie Lau. Until the next time.\~ \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong35","The greenest gas?","December 10, 2021 6:01 AM GMT","Week in China","If you believe that the universe was formed as the result of a Big Bang, then hydrogen was the first element that was created. Physicists think that hydrogen constitutes 75% of the universe\' s matter. And if things go to plan, hydrogen might save the planet from global warming too. The H2Zero initiative ranked as one of the main achievements at the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow. A group of global energy companies led by BP, EDF, Iberdrola, Shell and TotalEnergies agreed to accelerate the usage of decarbonised hydrogen in helping the world move towards net-zero energy systems. And although there were no Chinese signatories to the deal, the country\' s leading oil and gas refiner Sinopec has just announced the world\' s biggest renewables-to-hydrogen power project as part of its own clean energy drive. Over the next few years we\' re likely to hear a lot more about fuel cells that produce electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms. We will also get a better understanding of the different hues of hydrogen, the chemical element that ranks as number 1 on the periodic table. In its natural state, hydrogen is a colourless and odourless gas. But a colour scheme flagged at COP26 The plan is to switch to using much cleaner forms of energy to make the gas, however, relying more on carbon capture (\' blue\' hydrogen) or best of all, renewables (known as \' green\' hydrogen). By 2025 Sinopec is targeting annual production of 500,000 kilotons of green hydrogen, some of it from a new 10,000 mt/year hydrogen electrolyser facility in Xinjiang. This will break water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from a 300 MW photovoltaic power station. Starting production in 2023, the power facility will service Sinopec\' s nearby petrochemical plant. The energy giant has two similar projects on the launch pad in Inner Mongolia: a 10,000 mt/year wind and solar project in Ordos and an even bigger 100,000 mt/year renewables-based hydrogen plant in Ulanqab. Overall, the company has announced Rmb30 billion ($4.71 billion) in investment to build up its green hydrogen business through to 2025. About half the total will go into hydrogen refuelling stations, with the remainder allocated to hydrogen purification facilities and materials development. Recharge magazine estimates that Chinese entities have ploughed Rmb110 billion into 35 hydrogen refuelling station and fuel cell projects during the first five months of this year alone. Sinopec already has 20 hydrogen refuelling stations but says it will have installed 1,000 by the mid-point of the decade. As of June this year, Japan had 147 hydrogen fuelling points nationwide, compared to 80 in Germany and 45 in the US. Tesla founder Elon Musk has chastised hydrogen-powered cars as  extremely silly , not least because of how combustible the gas is. But the China Hydrogen Alliance (CHA), an industry body, released a white paper recently setting out ambitious plans for 100 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030. To put that figure into perspective, there is currently 76 MW of global hydrogen production capacity through electrolysers, according to International Energy Agency figures. China accounts for 25 million tonnes of the 70 million tonnes of hydrogen production already in play. But nearly two-thirds is from coal gasification. One of the major challenges in the transition to greener hydrogen is the higher costs of production compared to use of coal and natural gas. The CHA is calling for more government subsidies to stimulate growth in green hydrogen output, speeding the path to cost parity in the energy grid in the same way other energy technologies like wind and solar power were encouraged. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong36","China, US edge closer on climate and trade","November 11, 2021 Thursday 11:53 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","China and the United States made progress in climate change and trade discussions on Thursday ahead of next week\' s virtual meeting between the two countries\' top leaders. The world\' s two largest economies surprisingly released the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Both countries said they would recall their firm commitment to work together and with other parties to strengthen implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. At the same time, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the Biden administration was gaining traction with China in talks over Beijing\' s compliance with the phase-one trade deal signed between the two sides in January 2020. Tai said the US was weighing all of China\' s shortcomings in the deal, including its lack of purchases of commercial aircraft. Despite these positive signals, Chinese state media continued to urge the US to show more  sincerity, which refers to the cancelation of tariffs imposed on Chinese goods and sanctions against Chinese companies, if it was genuine about peacefully coexisting with China. In early September, US climate envoy John Kerry made his second trip to China this year, urging the country to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After having virtual meetings with Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng and diplomatic officials, Kerry HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/special-presidential-envoy-for-climate-john-kerrys-visit-to-japan-and-the-peoples-republic-of-china/ said he had told his Chinese counterpart that  climate is not ideological, not partisan, and not a geostrategic weapon. However, he was told by Beijing officials that climate change issues could not be separated from broader political disputes between the two sides. On September 10, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden held a 90-minute phone call and agreed to resume dialogue on a range of topics. Trade and diplomatic officials held several meetings last month but did not reach any agreements. On Wednesday, media reports said the two leaders would have a virtual meeting as soon as next week. Although Xi did not attend the COP26 summit in Glasgow, the US and China unexpectedly released a joint declaration on their climate actions on Thursday. HYPERLINK Link to Image Both said they intend to cooperate on regulatory frameworks and environmental standards related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the 2020s and maximizing the societal benefits of the clean energy transition. They will also convene a meeting in the first half of 2022 to focus on the specifics of enhancing measurement and mitigation of methane, including through standards to reduce methane from the fossil fuel and waste sectors, as well as incentives and programs to reduce methane from the agricultural sector. The declaration showed that China-US cooperation was the only right choice, and that the two sides agree more than differ on climate change, said Xie Zhenhua, China\' s special envoy for climate change. Meanwhile, Tai said the Biden administration continued to talk and work with Chinese counterparts on trade issues and that progress was being made. However, Tai declined to predict an outcome while discussions were ongoing. According to the phase-one trade deal, China must boost purchases of US goods by US$200 billion during 2020 and 2021, compared to 2017 levels. As of September 30, it had only reached 60% of the target, official data shows. The climate and trade progress came after US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN on Sunday that the US was not seeking a new Cold War with China, nor any political transformation in the country, but rather the US sought a system of peaceful coexistence.  The goal here is not containment, it\' s not a new Cold War, Sullivan said.  It is rather a favorable disposition in which the US and its allies can shape the international rules of the road on the sorts of issues that are fundamentally going to matter to the people of our country and to the people everywhere. On Monday, the Global Times published an editorial entitled  HYPERLINK https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202111/1238450.shtml The US must prove it no longer seeks to change China\' s system . It said Sullivan made such a statement because the US had failed to achieve its goal of transforming China. HYPERLINK Link to Image  Not pursuing to transform China\' s system is a way for the US to shrink back from difficulties after acknowledging them, it said.  We should ask the US to put that statement into action and reduce its political interference in China\' s internal affairs. On Thursday, the state-run People\' s Daily said in an HYPERLINK https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1716096506371080594&wfr=spider&for=pc article on social media that Sullivan seemed to have shown a friendly gesture to China, but he was actually saying that coexistence relied on fulfilling the values and benefits of the US and its allies. It said Sullivan\' s statement was more like a threat that urges China to follow the international order defined by US politicians. Xin Qiang, a professor and deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, was quoted as saying in the article that Sullivan had strategically released his statement as Biden wanted China to support his economic recovery, anti-epidemic and climate change policies. Hubei-based political commentator Rong Ping wrote in an HYPERLINK https://www.163.com/dy/article/GOGTOKKK0552BOR1.html article on Thursday that it was unreasonable that Sullivan had urged China to take responsibility for climate and international trade issues. Rong said the US started a trade war that eventually hurt itself. He said after former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the US had done nothing about climate change apart from sending Kerry to China.  China has survived the trade war and US\' sanctions against Chinese companies. How can the US now order China arrogantly? wrote Rong.  China has contributed a lot and taken its responsibility. Apart from benefiting itself, when will the US take its responsibility as a superpower? On Tuesday, Biden said the US would continue a Trump-era ban to forbid US investment firms, pension funds and others from buying shares of Chinese companies that were designated by the Department of Defense as backed or associated with the Chinese military. On the same day, a delegation of US Congress members arrived in Taipei on Tuesday on an unannounced visit aboard a US Navy aircraft. China\' s Ministry of Defense accused the US of supporting Taiwanese independence forces.

Read More ""The target at the moment is to achieve 10% of sustainable aviation fuel for the whole world by 2030,'' he said. ""How pathetic is that! We can do better than that, folks."" The comments come as airlines have been urging governments to back SAF production as part of plans to reach net-zero industry carbon emissions by 2050. The industry hopes SAF will abate 65% of the 1.8 gigatons of carbon it will need to mitigate annually by the net-zero deadline. But a series of milestones released by the International Air Transport Association last month showed industry expectations are even lower than the levels criticised by Johnson. These predict SAF production in 2030 will be 23 billion litres, or 5.2% of the industry's total fuel requirements. The good news is SAF production is expected to increase to 91 billion litres, or 17% of total fuel production, by 2035. This target also is roughly the time frame that electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft are forecast to become available in the 50-100 seat regional market - for trips of 30 to 90 minutes. Johnson, who is under fire for using an aircraft to attend the conference, conceded aviation was ""a tough nut to crack"" and called on conference participants to be more ambitious. Defending his decision to fly to the conference instead of taking a train, Johnson said it was due to time constraints and added his plane used a SAF blend.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong38","China goes big, UK goes small on nuclear power","November 9, 2021 Tuesday 5:13 PM GMT","Asia Times-English","While former US president Barack Obama was bashing China\' s no-show during a lengthy, and eloquent speech at the COP26 \~Climate Summit\~in Glasgow, he neglected to mention one thing. The world\' s biggest emitter, China is planning at least 150 new reactors in the next 15 years, more than the rest of the world has built in the past 35. According to HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/green Bloomberg , the effort could cost as much as US$440 billion; as early as the middle of this decade. After decades of cost-overruns, public protests and disasters elsewhere, China has emerged as the world\' s last great believer, with plans to generate an eye-popping amount of nuclear energy, quickly and at\~relatively low cost, the report said. In contrast, the US, France and Japan have reduced interest in nuclear power. It would be the kind of wholesale energy transformation that Western democracies  with budget constraints, political will and public opinion\~to consider  \~can only dream of.\~  Nuclear is the one energy source that came out of this looking like a champion, said David Fishman, an energy consultant with The Lantau Group, told Bloomberg.  It generated the whole time, it was clean, the price didn\' t change. If the case for nuclear power wasn\' t already strong, it\' s a lot stronger now. The goal, as articulated by the chairman of the state-backed China General Nuclear Power Corp., is to generate 200 gigawatts by 2035, enough to power more than a dozen cities the size of Beijing. Furthermore, China says its plans\~could prevent about 1.5 billion tons of annual carbon emissions, more than what\' s generated by the UK, Spain, France and Germany combined. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SMR.png?resize=780%2C495&ssl=1 Link to Image And speaking of the UK, HYPERLINK reports that HYPERLINK Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy. The creation of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a \£3195m cash injection from private firms and a \£3210m grant from the government. It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050. The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce\' s SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK. Around 21% of Britain\' s electricity supply is provided by nuclear power. The plan is thought to include the construction of an initial four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) based on the technology used in nuclear powered submarines. These reactors will be capable of generating nearly 500 megawatts of power  three times as much as much as most existing nuclear submarine reactors but more than six times less than the 3.2 gigawatts that the large plant under construction at Hinkley Point will deliver. Hinkley is expected to produce enough power to supply 6 million homes. The investment is intended to fund the project up to the stage where the reactor design receives approval. No decision has yet been made on how the construction cost will be financed. At an expected ultimate cost of around \£32bn each, they should cost less than a tenth of the \£320bn each of Hinkley and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. Industry sources say they hope that these SMRs would be operational within a decade. The\~ HYPERLINK https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs International Atomic Energy Authority \~says that  prefabricated units of SMRs can be manufactured and then shipped and installed on-site, making them more affordable to build than large power reactors, which are often custom designed for a particular location, sometimes leading to construction delays.  SMRs offer savings in cost and construction time, and they can be deployed incrementally to match increasing energy demand. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to  cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people\' s homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence, he added. Sources: Bloomberg, BBC News The Register \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong39","Green lending initiative a step back for global banks","November 8, 2021 Monday 3:35 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","Over 450 of the world\' s banks HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/8f7323c8-3197-4a69-9fcd-1965f3df40a7 have committed to a new initiative at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference which is designed to decarbonize their investments. Overseen by former Bank of England supremo Mark Carney, the banks and other financial institutions signing up to https://www.gfanzero.com/ Gfanz (the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero) are pledging to report annually on the carbon emissions linked to the projects they lend to. They are also aiming to provide trillions of dollars in green finance, while committing to net zero emissions across the board by 2050. HYPERLINK Major signatories to the initiative, which was originally unveiled HYPERLINK https://racetozero.unfccc.int/net-zero-financial-alliance-launches/ in April , include Citi, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. While it\' s very encouraging to see many of the world\' s leading banks committing to sustainable lending, it\' s hard not to feel apprehensive. It certainly isn\' t the first opportunity that they have had to decarbonize their loan books, and so far the results have not been impressive. In 2019, the UN General Assembly exuberantly launched its HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/ principles of responsible banking (PRBs) with similar goals in mind. The banks that signed up agreed, among other things, to  work with their clients to encourage sustainable practices and to  align their business strategy to the HYPERLINK https://sdgs.un.org/goals UN sustainable development goals HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Climate Agreement HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5 So far , many of the biggest banks in the world have not signed the PRBs, even though the principles have been the gold standard until now for committing to decarbonizing lending. Leading signatories are also a long way from satisfying their requirements \- not to mention those of Gfanz. Greening finance Banks can contribute to solving the climate crisis from two angles: their lending and their investments. On the investment side, we saw a tipping point in 2020 when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, HYPERLINK https://ukinvestormagazine.co.uk/blackrock-to-focus-on-esg-and-climate-change-in-2020/ announced that it would concentrate its investments on securities that were focused on sustainability. Lending is still in the nascent stages of its green transition, however. And since it is well accepted that it makes up the majority of corporate finance, this area is make or break for decarbonizing the industry. HYPERLINK https://www.unepfi.org/banking/bankingprinciples/prbsignatories/ Well over 200 international banks have signed the principles of responsible banking in the past two years, but, many of the biggest banks are not among them. Of the HYPERLINK https://www.advratings.com/banking/worlds-top-banks-by-market-cap top ten banks (by market capitalization), only Citi, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China are signatories. A further six \- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, China Construction Bank, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and China Merchants Bank \- are not on the list. I should stress that being a signatory to the PRBs is a limited commitment. Signatories have four years to comply with the principles. Even then, everything is voluntary and non-binding, so signatories are not penalized or even named and shamed for failing to live up to the principles. To get a sense of the status quo, HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-78873-5 I looked at the lending practices of three major signatory banks \- Citi, ICBC and Japan\' s MUFG \- for the years 2016-19. This covers the period directly after the Paris Agreement to the year the PRBs were signed. You might have expected banks that were serious about their commitments to have been cutting back on carbon-heavy lending in this period. I focused on banks\' lending to fossil fuels extraction, because data is readily available and because this is very much the top of the pyramid when it comes to carbon emissions. I also compared three other major banks that are not signatories to the PRBs: Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. I found that Wells Fargo and JP Morgan were the world\' s largest financiers of such companies during that period (though Wells Fargo dropped to third HYPERLINK in 2020 ). Neither signed the PRBs, though both are now members of Gfanz. Both state in their annual reports that they are committed to the Paris climate agreement. Both did reduce their total fossil fuels lending each year from 2018 to 2020, by 57% and 23% respectively. Citi, meanwhile, was the third-biggest fossil fuel lender in 2016-19 despite being a signatory to the PRBs (and Gfanz), and reached second place in 2020. And MUFG and ICBC, who are also signatories to the PRBs, both grew their fossil-fuel lending over the period. MUFG is also a Gfanz member, though neither ICBC nor any of the other Chinese banks are part of the new initiative. Also note that HSBC was not a major lender to fossil fuel projects despite not being a signatory to the PRBs (though it too has signed up to Gfanz). Six banks and fossil-fuel finance 2016-19 From this, I see no discernible sign that the PRBs have so far made any difference to lending in this area. Despite the roar at the UN General Assembly, my worry is that this tiger is proving toothless \- and there is reason to fear that Gfanz will go the same way. The way forward When signatories to the PRBs are lending money, they are supposed to carry out environmental impact assessments and to measure the greenhouse gas emissions of projects. This is not a minor issue considering that such work is beyond the traditional competencies of banks and will significantly affect their operational costs. Signatories are also supposed to ensure that loans go to projects that are carbon neutral. This means that borrowers have to commit to mitigation actions that last for the whole life-cycle of the project. It is part of each signatory\' s obligation to ensure that such mitigation actions are carried out, by monitoring the project throughout its duration. Yet the suspicion is that very little of this is happening on the ground at present. To change this, we would probably need to move to a scheme by which the PRBs are compulsory and binding. Unfortunately, Gfanz does not look like that scheme. Though the annual reporting requirements on carbon emissions are a step forward, nothing in the initiative is mandatory either. It was HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/9105cc47-58fb-47dc-8233-6b622fb56ae2 also criticized in the weeks leading up to COP26 because the members refused to agree to end lending to fossil fuel projects this year. Instead, they aim to halve their carbon emissions in a decade. My own view is that it wouldn\' t make sense to abruptly forbid lending to non-green projects now since we need to avoid hitting hardest the banks that are traditionally most involved in carbon-heavy sectors. Instead, loan books need to be treated as a portfolio of projects in different tones of green, with a defined trajectory towards greener \- but it needs to be mandatory for signatories. It\' s a pity that Mark Carney and other banking leaders did not work towards strengthening the PRBs rather than come up with yet another initiative. I also worry that Gfanz muddies the waters by combining investing and lending rather than focusing purely on lending. We don\' t need more roaring; we need a tiger that actually has some teeth. We invited the banks referred to in the article to comment on their lending activities in this area. MUFG sent us links to its carbon neutrality declaration and environmental and social policy framework.

The HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/8f7323c8-3197-4a69-9fcd-1965f3df40a7 Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero says it is made up of more than 450 different banks, asset managers and insurers and represents up to US$150 trillion in assets. It is notable that this coalition of private sector firms is headed by Carney, a former senior central banker, as in recent years researchers, activists and others have HYPERLINK https://odi.org/en/publications/the-role-of-central-banks-in-tackling-climate-change/ called for central banks to do more And though central bankers have discussed the issue widely, they have generally focused on its implications for financial stability. Carney has previously warned that HYPERLINK climate change could damage the financial system , as assets are damaged by extreme weather or become unviable (and thus uninsurable) as temperatures rise and climate action is normalized. While the stability of the financial system is important, it remains a secondary objective for most central banks. Indeed, their primary goal is to maintain stable prices and HYPERLINK https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about achieve low inflation How climate change affects monetary policy Central banks have generally remained shy on this issue, as if they assume that they are immune from the effects of climate change. But my co-author Koyesha Mukherjee and I recently published HYPERLINK https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03149-2 research in which we showed that climate change does pose a threat not just to financial stability, but also to prices and inflation. We highlighted various channels through which climate change affects price stability. For example, hotter temperatures and more frequent droughts could lead to a fall in agricultural output, resulting in food shortages. This in turn would drive prices up as the demand for food would be higher than supply. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drought-Water-Faucet-Fields-iStock-e1552471550432.jpg?resize=780%2C491&ssl=1 Link to Image Climate-related extreme weather also means more demand for energy (for cooling or heating) but also a fall in supply \- thereby driving prices up. Extreme weather also affects countries\' ability to produce exported goods. For example, when people are exposed to extreme heat they are HYPERLINK https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---gjp/documents/publication/wcms_476194.pdf less effective at producing goods We found evidence of this when we analyzed the effects of temperature changes on inflation for a group of 107 countries (including 80 developing and 27 developed countries). We first gathered daily mean temperatures for each country which we then converted into an annual figure. The change in this annual figure gave us a simplified measure of temperature change, which we compared to inflation in that country in that year. After excluding some countries that had experienced hyperinflation and two periods of global inflationary shocks, we found that rising temperatures were overwhelmingly linked to an increase in inflation. Our finding was also confirmed when we undertook separate investigations for developed and developing countries. In developed countries, temperature increases lead to an increase in inflation in the short run (about a year). In developing countries, the findings were more worrying, however, as this effect persisted for at least six years after the start of the process. What do the results mean for central banks? This could have severe implications for the wider economy, making recessions and financial crises more likely. Finally, central banks face the challenge of implementing the best policy response to climate-driven changes in inflation and output. It is extremely important for central banks to understand that the impact of climate change goes beyond financial stability, and actually poses a threat to their first primary objective of keeping prices stable and inflation low. As such, they should take climate change into account in their decision-making process. It is important for central banks to understand the source of inflation in order to adopt the right response. Broader policies to reduce the speed of climate change could include green monetary policy, green financing or even HYPERLINK green quantitative easing Osman Ouattara, Reader in Development Economics, University of Manchester .

These solutions must work for all societies and economies that depend on the river to adapt to climate change, but especially for poor and marginalized communities, including the Mekong\' s female fishers, who play essential roles in the use and management of water and aquatic resources and are key contributors to local economies.\~ Such solutions include not investing in poorly planned and uncoordinated infrastructure projects that will further undermine the health of the river, the delta and the future of the millions of people who rely on it for drinking water, irrigation, fisheries and livelihoods.\~ Cambodia has already shown leadership, by committing to no hydropower dams on the mainstem at the Climate COP26 last month in Glasgow.\~However, at the 28th Council Meeting of the Mekong River Commission last week, the MRC did not take the serious step of urging the postponement of planned hydropower dams, despite scientific evidence of the negative impacts on food security for millions, agricultural land productivity, fisheries, biodiversity and a climate-resilient delta.\~ Climate change will dictate the future of the Mekong region and should be integral to all MRC discussions. Yet despite the huge global interest in COP26 , we only heard timid references to that critically important event.\~Instead, the council agreed to expedite plans for four mainstream dams so that the approval processes will be completed by December 2022. Absurdly, while the MRC is going through the approval motions for these major dams, it is simultaneously conducting a joint environmental monitoring (JEM) program that focuses on measuring the impact of the controversial Xayaburi and Don Sahong hydropower dams. The JEM ought to be completed first so that its findings can feed into the approval process for the new dams.\~ Alarm bells have been ringing loudly over the years, calling for immediate and effective action. So witnessing the MRC Council last week, I was struck and saddened by the seeming lack of urgency among those tasked with plotting the best course for the river and the communities of men and women who depend on it.\~ Like the rest of the world, the Mekong region will primarily feel the impacts of climate change through water, including food insecurity and community livelihoods. So the health of the Mekong river system, which is the mission of the MRC, must be central to adaptation and resilience.\~ The challenges of the Mekong are indeed complex and resolving these will require substantive deliberations and more collaborative governance that use the knowledge and expertise of diverse stakeholders including civil-society organizations.

The impacts of existing dams are clear with scientific evidence. The future impacts of the planned dams are obvious. The MRC\' s failure to act will further undermine the chance of building resilience along the river. It will leave societies and economies unable to adapt to the floods, droughts and sea-level rise that climate change will unleash on the region. There was also no mention of September\' s World Food Summit, which acknowledged the importance of freshwater resources for food production and freshwater fisheries for protein, nor the IUCN (International Union for\~Conservation\~of Nature) World Congress, which concluded that safeguarding biodiversity and investing in nature are critical to addressing the climate crisis. It seemed that the council was meeting in a vacuum \- unable, or unwilling, to base its deliberations on the latest facts from the Mekong or global thinking on renewable energy, nature-positive food systems, and sustainable development. Le Cong Thanh, Vietnamese deputy minister of natural resources and environment, who is vice-chairman of the Vietnam National Mekong Committee, did focus on the need to reduce impacts on ecosystems and develop funding mechanisms to do so. In particular, he highlighted erosion of the delta, which is largely due to the drastic reduction in sediment flowing down the Mekong because of hydropower dams and unsustainable sand mining. Yet no other country took up the issue and no solution was suggested. The MRC has a duty to provide advice that factors in what is best for the river and the people who rely on it, based on the strong scientific evidence it has gathered over the past 20 years.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong42","Green hydrogen: Can Australia build a new industry?","January 17, 2022 Monday 5:01 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","You might remember hearing a lot about green hydrogen last year, as global pressure mounted on Australia to take stronger action on climate change ahead of the COP26 Glasgow summit last November. HYPERLINK https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-releases/strong-potential-future-australia-germany-hydrogen-exports A$50 billion (US$36 billion) within 30 years , helping the world achieve deep decarbonization. As ever more renewable energy pours into our grid, this picture will change. By the end of the decade, the north Queensland coast could become the hydrogen powerhouse. By 2040, dirt-cheap solar should make inland areas across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia the lowest-cost producers. Can you store and transport it? Why is there so much buzz around green hydrogen? In short, because it offers us a zero-emissions way to transport energy. Take cheap renewable energy and use it to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electrolyzer. Store the hydrogen on trucks, ship it overseas or send it by pipeline. Then use the hydrogen for transport, manufacturing or electricity production. All the technology exists \- it\' s the cost holding the industry back at present. That\' s where Australia and its wealth of cheap renewable energy comes in. Making hydrogen is nothing new \- it has a long history of use in fertilizer production and oil refining. But until now, the main source for hydrogen was gas, a fossil fuel. In the last few years, however, there has been a sudden surge of interest and investment in green hydrogen, and new technology pathways have emerged to produce cheap green hydrogen. As global decarbonization gathers steam, Japan, South Korea and parts of Europe are looking for clean alternatives to replace the role fossil fuels have played in their economies. Australia is exceptionally well placed to deliver these alternatives, with world-beating renewable resources and ports set up for our existing fossil fuel exports, such as coal and LNG. In 2019, Australia sold almost $64 billion of black coal, with most going to Japan, South Korea, India and China. As these countries decarbonize, the coal industry will shrink. Green hydrogen could be an excellent replacement. How competitive is Australian hydrogen? At present, Australia is a long way from producing green hydrogen cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels, given we seem to have no appetite for taxing carbon pollution. Does that mean it\' s a non-starter? Hardly. It was only a decade ago skeptics ridiculed solar and wind as too expensive. They\' ve gone awfully quiet as renewable prices fell, and fell and fell \- as tracked by the HYPERLINK https://www.irena.org/Statistics/View-Data-by-Topic/Costs/Global-Trends International Renewable Energy Agency . Now renewables are HYPERLINK https://www.csiro.au/-/media/EF/Files/GenCost2020-21_FinalReport.pdf cheaper than coal . Battery storage, too, has fallen drastically in price. The same forces are at work on the key technology we need \- cheaper electrolyzers. By 2040, the CSIRO predicts an 83% fall in electrolyzer costs, according to its HYPERLINK https://publications.csiro.au/publications/publication/PIcsiro:EP2021-3374 Gencost 2021-22 report Which states could benefit? HYPERLINK https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/platforms-initiatives/victorian-hydrogen-hub/ Victorian Hydrogen Hub But this picture will change. By 2030, northern Queensland\' s coastal regions could be the Australian hydrogen powerhouse due to a combination of cheap solar and access to ports. Western Australia and the Northern Territory could also have similar advantages, though the modeling for these areas has not yet been done. As solar energy and electrolyzer costs continue to fall, new states could enter the green hydrogen economy. In the CSIRO\' s cost predictions, electricity from solar is predicted to become much cheaper than wind by 2040. This means sunny areas like central and northern Queensland ($1.7/kg) and inland NSW, Victoria and South Australia ($1.8/kg) could be the best locations for green hydrogen production. In making these estimates, I do not consider supply chain and storage infrastructure required to deliver the hydrogen. Transport could account for between $0.05/kg to $0.75/kg, depending on the distance. Comparing my modeling to price thresholds set out in the National Hydrogen Strategy indicates we can produce green hydrogen for trucking at a similar cost to diesel within four years. Fertilizer would take longer, becoming competitive by 2040. Does Australia have the water resources? If we achieved the $50 billion green hydrogen industry the government is aiming for, how much water would it consume? Surprisingly little. It would take only about 4% of the water we used for our crops and pastures in HYPERLINK https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/agriculture/water-use-australian-farms/latest-release 2019-20 to generate an export industry that size \- 225,000 megalitres. Much more water than this will be freed up as coal-fired power stations exit the grid. In Queensland and NSW alone, these power stations consume about 158,000 megalitres a year, according to a HYPERLINK https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-04/apo-nid303605.pdf 2020 report prepared for the Australian Conservation Foundation. Coal mining in these two states takes an additional 224,000 megalitres. As the cost of renewable energy falls and falls, we will also be able to desalinate seawater along our coasts to produce hydrogen. We estimate this would account for only about 1% of the cost of producing hydrogen, based on Australian Water Association HYPERLINK https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/14568786/Fact%20Sheets/Desalination_Fact_Sheet.pdf desalination cost estimates How can we get there faster? This decade, we must plan for our new hydrogen economy. Government and industry will need to develop and support new hydrogen infrastructure projects to produce, distribute, use and export hydrogen at scale. We\' re already seeing promising signs of progress, as major mining companies HYPERLINK https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-10/qld-palaszczuk-andrew-forrest-hydrogen-gladstone/100527670 move strongly into green hydrogen.

The representatives who gathered for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 )\~focused primarily on the much-needed transition from fossil fuels to clean energy alternatives. But as leaders return to their home countries and begin the hard work of delivering on their commitments, they need to understand that some alternative energy sources have larger ecological footprints than others.\~\~ Generally viewed as a\~\~low-carbon energy source, hydropower makes an enticing alternative to fossil fuels. And yet\~poorly conceived hydropower dams can lead to flooded communities, declining fisheries, degraded or destroyed wildlife habitats, and other major disruptions for people and nature.\~ To be clear, hydropower has played a critical role in stabilizing electrical grids and enabling the expansion of the world\' s renewable energy supply, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. But if we aren\' t smart about implementation, we risk squandering precious natural resources that have undergirded human health and well-being for millennia.\~ Infrastructure development and other man-made changes\~ HYPERLINK https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/study-just-one-third-of-the-world-s-longest-rivers-remain-free-flowing have already fragmented or disrupted They can block upstream-downstream fish migration and cause other disruptions that place pressure on ecosystems already pushed to the breaking point by destructive fishing, excessive or inefficient irrigation, toxic pollution and climate change.\~\~ It\' s hard to overstate just how dire the situation has become for Earth\' s rivers, streams and other freshwater ecosystems.

Such reviews also tend to only occur after a project has significantly progressed, thereby hamstringing efforts to avoid, minimize or mitigate negative impacts on rivers.\~\~ Given the risks involved, how can nations chart their course to a clean energy future without sacrificing the rivers and other freshwater ecosystems that sustain them? For the answer to that question, we must look to the small South Asia nation of Nepal. Nepal\' s remaining free-flowing rivers have cultural significance for its people and provide them with a wide array of ecosystem goods and services, including water supply, biodiversity, tourism, recreation and more. But the immense value of these  natural assets is rarely factored into cost-benefit analyses, and top priority continues to go to water use for irrigation and hydropower production, which generates nearly all of Nepal\' s electricity.\~\~ Last year, the government submitted\~Nepal\' s second HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Nepal%20Second/Second%20Nationally%20Determined%20Contribution%20(NDC)%20-%202020.pdf Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) \~document to the United Nations. The document, which outlines Nepal\' s climate ambitions over the next decade, includes a commitment to expand clean energy generation from less than 1,400 megawatts to 15,000MW, nearly all of which is currently planned to come from hydropower. Chance for balance in Nepal Nepal has committed to supplying 15% of the total energy demand from clean energy sources, though that term remains vaguely defined. HYPERLINK http://fwcoe.cdes.edu.np/ssp_tool/#eoa-section Technical studies \~funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and conducted by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and partners recently examined how Nepal could balance the protection of its rivers with its development of low-carbon, low-impact and low-cost power systems. The studies found that it\' s possible for Nepal to keep its rivers free-flowing with a minimal increase in financial costs for energy-system development \- but only if the government embraces early and comprehensive planning that moves away from single projects and toward whole systems.\~\~ System-level planning involves looking at different pathways for meeting a country\' s future electricity demand and comparing the costs and benefits of each pathway \- not just in terms of energy costs, but also in terms of impacts on fisheries, river-related recreation, biodiversity and other social-cultural values. The goal is not to identify a perfect solution, but rather to help decision-makers better understand the tradeoffs involved and plan accordingly.\~\~ For example, WWF\' s studies showed that keeping the Karnali River, the country\' s largest remaining free-flowing river, and its major tributaries free of hydropower development would result in only a 1% increase to the nation\' s total electricity-system costs. By comparison, a pathway that avoids dams in Nepal\' s protected areas would increase costs by 2%, while a pathway that avoids dams on all of the nation\' s free-flowing rivers would increase costs by 9%.\~\~ We hope Nepal seizes this opportunity to choose a sustainable path forward for its people. In doing so, Nepal could show the world that it\' s possible to balance scientific insights with the objectives of diverse stakeholders and forge balanced solutions for energy and development. If other nations follow their example, the world will be one giant step closer to a clean, stable future in which people and nature thrive.\~\~ \"

These would commit the two countries to reducing domestic emissions to net zero by around mid-century \- though both are expected to continue exporting fossil fuels for decades to come. For the leaders of countries and governments that produce fossil fuels, UN climate summits are a public relations boon. They get to talk up their commitments to a green and clean future without being held to account for their disproportionate role in fueling the problem. It\' s hard for experts, let alone the average citizen, to tell fact from fiction. Because it\' s only domestic greenhouse-gas emissions that are counted for the purpose of the UN climate negotiations, burning exported fossil fuels counts toward the emissions of the importing country. Accordingly, the role that major fossil-fuel exporters like Saudi Arabia (oil and natural gas) and Australia (coal and natural gas) play in stoking global heating is not accurately reflected in the talks. Unlike some areas of international cooperation, such as limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, climate-change summits aim to control something that evades easy calculation. Nuclear weapons and their production facilities are tangible, chunky and relatively few in number. Greenhouse gases are everywhere, invisible and caused by lots of different processes \- from cow digestion to steel production. These gases are also in constant flux. Emissions are produced from ubiquitous sources, but there are also natural systems \- especially forests and soil \- that suck carbon dioxide (CO ) from the atmosphere. These natural removals of carbon are known as sinks. That is why scientists and governments speak of net greenhouse-gas emissions: emissions minus removals.

Fossil-fuel infrastructure and projects are even easier to monitor. Oil rigs, gas pipelines and coal mines are large, making them easy to see both on the ground and via satellite. These features make it simpler to hold fossil-fuel-producing countries to account for their contribution to global heating, compared with the more slippery measure of net emissions. The fossil fuel production gap In a HYPERLINK https://productiongap.org/2021report/ new report , the UN Environment Program and other research institutions found that governments plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \- the goal of the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement .

The focus of the COP26 summit was to ensure a smooth (if slow) transition to a low-carbon global economy. Coal-fired power generation is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases and a major contributor to air pollution. More than 90% of planned and more than 70% of the existing coal-fired capacity is in developing countries, including China and India. The US, the second-largest emitter, has set 2050 as the deadline to reach net-zero and it says it will decarbonize its power sector by 2035. China, the world\' s largest carbon emitter, has announced it will be carbon-neutral, or net-zero, by 2060. Carbon neutrality is a state of net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions. But before the Glasgow summit, the rich countries were piling pressure on India to set a deadline to take its carbon emissions to net zero, as India had neither announced when it plans to reach net-zero nor has submitted an updated climate plan every five years as required by the Paris Agreement. Surprisingly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a bold pledge that India will achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. Calling this a  gift of five elixirs, Modi announced India\' s four other commitments, namely increasing non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts, fulfilling 50% of energy requirements from renewable sources, reducing the carbon intensity of the economy by 45%, and reducing total project carbon emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. India Inc says it welcomes Modi\' s pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. But India is at a unique crossroads. It is a developing country relying heavily on coal to meet about half of its primary energy demand. Structural changes and accelerants required to steer this transformation will be quite challenging without significant technical and financial support. As well, China had pulled more than 99% of its population out of poverty before it set the 2060 net-zero target. But India is currently in no position to meet the twin challenges of pulling hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty as well as providing clean energy to its huge population. So the cost required for the transition to a green economy is huge. The nation will need progressively to reduce coal\' s share in electricity generation, currently at about 65%, and remove it altogether by 2050. To meet its goal of net-zero, or be able effectively to eliminate carbon-dioxide emissions by 2070, India will need close to US$10 trillion, according to the HYPERLINK https://cef.ceew.in Centre for Energy Finance A total of $8.5 trillion would be needed significantly to scale up generation from renewable energy and bring together the necessary integration, distribution, and transmission of that energy; $1.5 trillion would have to be invested in the industrial sector for setting up green hydrogen production capacity to advance the sector\' s decarbonization. Green hydrogen is made from renewable energy and can be used for many things, from heating to charging batteries as well as fueling vehicles. It is no coincidence that Modi\' s two key businessman friends Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani earlier this year pledged to make their businesses carbon-negative by 2030 and 2035 respectively. Ironically, both are investing tens of billions of dollars in renewable technologies as they compete to dominate the country\' s new green economy. The idea is simple: to become the key pillar of the new green economy. Race to control India\' s future energy market Ambani is setting up four new factories in the Jamnagar district of Gujarat, one each for solar panels, batteries, green hydrogen, and fuel cells. In June, Ambani announced an investment of $10 billion in clean power and hydrogen fuel over three years. Three months later, Gautam Adani announced his own green vision, stating that the Adani group will invest $20 billion over the next 10 years in renewable energy generation and component manufacturing. But Ambani was quite late in entering into the green-energy race. For years, the Adani Group produced coal-fueled power at large plants like the one in HYPERLINK https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi5zcfh-rz0AhWB63MBHXUwCigQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adanipower.com%2Foperational-power-plants%2Fmundra-gujarat&usg=AOvVaw3ohH5iVcUfFbVjxUbLKozX Mundra , Gujarat. But in the last three and half years, Adani has swiftly assembled a 20GW solar, wind and hybrid electricity portfolio. But Ambani is catching up, aiming to capture 100GW of solar manufacturing or a third of India\' s market by the end of the decade. With a $1.14 billion acquisition for two firms in a single day, Mukesh Ambani is going ahead aggressively on green energy. He first bought REC Solar Holdings AS for $771 million and then added Sterling and Wilson Solar to his acquisition portfolio with a 40% holding. His Reliance New Energy is also planning to invest $29 million in Germany\' s NexWafe and use its technology to build photovoltaic solar-wafer plants and tie up with a Danish company to make hydrogen electrolyzers (which use electricity to break water into hydrogen and oxygen) in India. Ambani\' s efforts toward building electrolyzers are meant to compete in the power supply sector in the future, where rival Adani is stronger. Adani Power has reached the initial target of 25GW, a full four years ahead of schedule. Recently it acquired SoftBank\' s India renewable-energy unit for $3.5 billion, one of the biggest such acquisitions globally. More so, Adani\' s dominance over the transportation sector will be a bigger challenge for Ambani. With huge ambitions, the two billionaires are battling to increase their share in India\' s green economy. However, there is no denying the fact that the biggest losers will be hundreds of millions of poor people who hardly see the opportunities and growth enjoyed by their Chinese counterparts, and they are the ones who are going to pay the price of Modi\' s lofty promises. \"

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong48","Global emissions nearly back to pre-pandemic levels","November 4, 2021 Thursday 4:28 PM GMT","Asia Times-English","Global carbon dioxide emissions have bounced back after Covid-19 restrictions and are likely to reach close to pre-pandemic levels this year, HYPERLINK https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-386/ our analysis released this week has found. The troubling finding comes as the COP26 climate talks continue in Glasgow in a last-ditch bid to keep dangerous global warming at bay. The analysis was undertaken by the HYPERLINK Global Carbon Project The fast recovery in CO emissions, following last year\' s HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/global-emissions-are-down-by-an-unprecedented-7-but-dont-start-celebrating-just-yet-151757 sharp drop , should come as no surprise. The world\' s strong economic rebound has created a surge in demand for energy, and the global energy system is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Most concerning is the long-term upward trends of CO emissions from oil and gas, and this year\' s growth in coal emissions, which together are far from trending towards net-zero by 2050. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SE-Asia-Climate-Change-Vulnerability-Map-ResearchGate-e1578478592838.png?resize=780%2C523&ssl=1 Link to Image The global emissions picture Global CO emissions from fossil fuels dropped by 5.4% in 2020, compared with the previous year. But they are set to increase by about 4.9% above 2020 levels this year, reaching 36.4 billion tonnes. This brings them almost back to 2019 levels. We can expect another 2.9 billion tonnes of CO emissions this year from the net effect of everything we do to the land, including deforestation, degradation and re-vegetation. This brings us to a total of 39.4 billion tonnes of CO to be emitted by the end of this year. The fast growth in emissions matches the corresponding large increase in energy demand as the global economy opens up, with the help of HYPERLINK US$17.2 trillion in economic stimulus packages around the world. CO emissions from all fossil fuel types (coal, oil and natural gas) grew this year, with emissions from coal and natural gas set to grow more in 2021 than they fell in 2020. Emissions from global coal use were declining before the pandemic hit in early 2020 but they surged back this year. Emissions from global gas use have returned to the rising trend seen before the pandemic. CO emissions from global oil use remain well below pre-pandemic levels but are expected to increase in coming years as road transport and aviation recover from Covid-related restrictions. Nations leading the emissions charge Emissions from China have recovered faster than other countries. It\' s among the few countries where emissions grew in 2020 (by 1.4%) followed by a projected growth of 4% this year. Taking these two years together, CO emissions from China in 2021 are projected to be 5.5% above 2019 levels, reaching 11.1 billion tonnes. China accounted for 31% of global emissions in 2020. Coal emissions in China are estimated to grow by 2.4% this year. If realized, it would match what was thought to be China\' s peak coal emissions in 2013. India\' s CO emissions are projected to grow even faster than China\' s this year at 12.6%, after a 7.3% fall last year. Emissions this year are set to be 4.4% above 2019 levels \- reaching 2.7 billion tonnes. India accounted for 7% of global emissions in 2020. Emissions from both the US and European Union are projected to rise 7.6% this year. It would lead to emissions that are, respectively, 3.7% and 4.2% below 2019 levels. US and EU, respectively, accounted for 14% and 7% of global emissions in 2020. Emissions in the rest of the world (including all international transport, particularly aviation) are projected to rise 2.9% this year, but remain 4.2% below 2019 levels. Together, these countries represent 59% of global emissions. The remaining carbon budget The relatively large changes in annual emissions over the past two years have had no discernible effect in the speed at which CO accumulates in the atmosphere. CO concentrations, and associated global warming, are driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases \- particularly CO \- since the beginning of the industrial era. This accumulation has accelerated in recent decades. To stop further global warming, global CO emissions must stop or reach net-zero \- the latter meaning that any remaining CO emissions would have to be compensated for by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Carbon budgets are a useful way of measuring how much CO can be emitted for a given level of global warming. In our latest analysis, we updated the carbon budget outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf IPCC ) in August this year. From the beginning of 2022, the world can emit an additional 420 billion tonnes of CO to limit global warming to 1.5 , or 11 years of emissions at this year\' s rate. To limit global warming to 2 , the world can emit an additional 1,270 billion tonnes of CO \- or 32 years of emissions at the current rate. These budgets are the compass to net-zero emissions. Consistent with the pledge by HYPERLINK https://eciu.net/netzerotracker many countries to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, CO emissions need to decline by 1.4 billion tonnes each year, on average. This is an amount comparable to the drop during 2020, of 1.9 billion tonnes. This fact highlights the extraordinary challenge ahead and the need to increase short- and long-term commitments to drive down global emissions.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong49","Horror and hope from the climate change frontlines","November 1, 2021 Monday 8:51 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","SEOUL \- Simon Mundy has returned from the trenches of the climate change wars with a message that is both woeful and inspiring: Things are truly very, very bad, but remarkable solutions exist. Given that these solutions range far beyond  clean and  renewable energies, Mundy\' s findings hurl down a gauntlet before world leaders meeting to discuss the climate crisis at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26 , in Glasgow, UK, this week. Currently the Financial Times\'  Moral Money editor and a newly minted author, Mundy spent two years traveling around 26 nations, exploring the Amazon rainforest, trekking the Siberian permafrost and clambering into backyard cobalt mines in Congo. He met rogue scientists, cutting-edge entrepreneurs and energy ministers \- and interacted with disaster-struck herders, slash-and-burn forest dwellers and desperate child miners. The result is HYPERLINK https://www.simonmundy.com/preorder  Race for Tomorrow: Survival, Innovation and Profit on the Front Lines of the Climate Crisis, which hit bookshelves on October 28. The timing was sound: Three days prior to the opening of COP26 \- which could set critical milestones or fizzle as a damp squib. Conference attendees would benefit from speed-reading the work before taking their seat at the sessions. While climate change tends to be a doom-and-gloom discourse, Mundy met scientists and entrepreneurs who have developed some astonishing silver bullets. The challenge Mundy presents to world leaders at COP26 is this: Can the community of nations craft a political-economic framework that would permit these bullets to be fired in a burst large enough to deal with the problem \- or will matters spiral further out of control? HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mundy-at-the-office.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1 Link to Image Travel \' n tell Unusually for environmentally focused screeds, Mundy\' s book is neither a puce-faced jeremiad penned by an activist, nor a dense policy document written in scientific gobbledegook. Given that the scale and complexity of the issue presents a barrier to comprehension, Mundy chose, as his format, the travel narrative.  Many people are struggling to get their heads around this, there is so much shouting on all sides, he told Asia Times.  I thought that stories of people and places can be a starting point to get a handle on this instead of disembodied stats, you have stories of real people in real places. The idea was ignited by direct experience.  In 2016 I moved to India and did some reporting on a very severe drought \- the number of farmer suicides was abominable, it was mad, and I saw these empty, cracked, reservoirs, he recalled.  That was the first time in my life I had been exposed to the immediate impact of climate change. Despite intensifying competition between China and the US, the number and lethality of wars is falling worldwide and the nuclear genie has remained in its bottle. Global poverty is on a downward trend, and even the unprecedented Covid pandemic has come nowhere close to being an existential threat. And while some fear that runaway technologies, such as AI-dominated big tech platforms could be the end of humanity, alarmists in that space are still talking possibilities, rather than realities. All this leaves leaves climate change as the biggest actual menace to humanity\' s future.  It struck me in 2017 that the biggest story on the planet is the global struggle to respond to climate change, Mundy said.  I don\' t consider myself an activist, but I had my reporter\' s nose \- the hunger for a big story. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mundy-Mongolia.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1 Link to Image Not an activist, perhaps, but Mundy has little time for those who downplay the severity of the crisis, or downright deny its existence. Some naysayers talk down climate change by proclaiming that the Earth\' s climate has long oscillated. Mundy shoots this contention down, noting that such changes have in the past been driven by slight shifts in earth\' s orbit around the sun, solar activity and volcanic motion. Deep analyses have made clear that the climate is heating up at a dangerously unprecedented rate due to greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, it would be  extraordinary if these emissions were not driving temperatures north, Mundy said.  The conclusion that this is happening is the best-tested scientific theory ever, as it has had so many people trying to find holes in it, he said. If the science on the topic were false,  it would have to be by far the biggest conspiracy theory in the history of the world. Death and despair Mundy encountered persons dying as a result of climate change in the very midst of his research.  I met this scientist who died four days after I met him \- he fell into a crevasse in Greenland, Mundy said.  There were none of these crevasses 30 years earlier. In a completely different part of the world, he traveled to the scene of a disaster of the kind written about in the Old Testament. In northeastern Ethiopia, communities who existed on herding camels, goats and cattle for centuries, if not millennia, are seeing their way of life being virtually wiped out.  There was severe drought, so less and less grazing, he said.  Then, heavy rainfalls in Saudi and Yemen created the conditions for this enormous swarm of locusts. With their cattle dying and goats and camels tottering, the herders have become almost totally reliant upon government food handouts.  It is drought, followed by locusts \- it is Biblical, Mundy said.  These people are starving. In yet another distant geography, a people with similarly ancient habits were suffering a similar catastrophe. However their blight was the opposite of that faced by the Ethiopians: It was caused by falling, not rising, temperatures. That is a conundrum that many \- inevitably \- fail to understand is linked to the broader trend of global warming. Mongolia is facing increasingly severe winters as a result of the speed of Arctic ice melt and related flows of heat and moisture, which is  what leads to extreme winters in places like Texas and Mongolia, Mundy said. While the  exceptionally tough Mongolians themselves are leading lives on the steppes that are not far removed from those led by the hordes of Genghis Khan, their herds and mounts are dying.  They are all losing large numbers of animals and it is pushing them into poverty, Mundy said.  The animals are dying of starvation and cold as they find it difficult to get enough grass. Due to oscillations in temperature, snow melts and creates a layer of ice that prevents grazing. Severe winters have long been a feature of Mongolian existence \- they are called  dzud \- but are now becoming more and more frequent, Mundy said. As a result, herders who have lived for generations in the great outdoor spaces are being forced into urban drift. HYPERLINK Link to Image Victims and villains As the world lurches toward cleaner and more renewable energy sources, one of the many ironies Mundy encountered was how deadly and unjust the drive to secure those materials can be for those on the frontlines. Around the town of Kolowezi in the conflict-scarred and poverty-crushed Congo, he saw  enormous natural wealth \- and huge poverty and infant mortality. The area is rich in cobalt \- a key component in lithium batteries, as well as smartphones. This vast natural richness is not filtering down to the inhabitants \- even to those eking out an entrepreneurial existence by supplying it themselves.  You walk through this area, and the people have these mine shafts behind their houses and children playing around, and underground these young men are hammering away, he recalled. Conditions are perilous:  There is no health and safety regulation. While loud voices in the West demand the reform of artisanal mining and a halt to the use of child labor, the barriers to change are steep.  I met child miners but child labor is a symptom of a wider problem, he said.  The reason they are mining is that they are not in school, and they are not given school due to corruption, both local and foreign. A potentially more perilous meeting took place in Brazil\' s shrinking Amazon rainforest. It\' s a violent location. Mundy recalls sitting at an outside eatery in the town of Boca de Acre when a man staggered past. He had been severely stabbed in the gut. Before venturing into the even more dangerous jungle, Mundy acquired the services of a Brazilian private military contractor. Biking down a trail, Mundy and his bodyguard spotted  a huge plume of smoke coiling up from the forest. Warily, the two probed forward. Out of a circle of blazing trees appeared a menacing figure: A  fierce looking one-eyed man, hefting a machete in one hand and a jerry can full of fuel in the other. \~ To Mundy\' s surprise \-  I think it shows the sense of immunity under (President Jair) Bolsonaro \- the man, who identified himself as  Enzio, agree to talk to the British reporter. He explained that he was burning down forest to clear grazing for cattle, and planned to start a family in the formerly virgin location.  He said to me, \' Is not like your country, it is difficult to earn money so this is how you move up in the world. I don\' t have the options you have,\'  Mundy recalled.  I am glad I heard his story as, although his activity is so destructive, we have to listen to people like that. Mundy found himself feeling empathy.  Some people would see Enzio as a villain, Mundy admits.  But he illustrates the complexities of the issue.

Illegal deforestation and organized crime Making the supply chains for these four commodities more sustainable is an important strategy for reducing deforestation. But another industry plays an important role, especially in tropical forests: organized crime. Large, lucrative industries offer opportunities to move and launder money; as a result, in many parts of the world, deforestation is driven by the drug trade. In South America and Central America, drug trafficking organizations are the vanguard of deforestation. Drug traffickers are illegally logging forests in the Amazon and HYPERLINK https://insightcrime.org/news/intimate-relationship-between-cocaine-illegal-timber-brazil-amazon/ hiding cocaine in timber shipments to Europe .

One increasingly common theme primarily from wealthy countries \- including those HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/contributed-most-global-co2 responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions over time \- is a vow that they will cease public funding for all (or nearly all) fossil fuel projects in less developed countries, even as they HYPERLINK continue \~ HYPERLINK https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/09/climate-change-threatens-earth-us-open-nearly-200-power-plants/2155631001/ financing , and in many cases HYPERLINK https://www.brookings.edu/research/reforming-global-fossil-fuel-subsidies-how-the-united-states-can-restart-international-cooperation/ heavily \~ HYPERLINK subsidizing , fossil fuels in their own.

For example, HYPERLINK China and HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-coal-japan-finance/japan-tightens-rules-on-support-for-overseas-coal-fired-plants-idUSKBN24A0CH Japan \- two high coal-consuming nations \- have recently pledged to stop funding coal projects overseas and increase investments in renewables.

The US Treasury and the United Kingdom\' s development finance institution, CDC Group \- both countries are involved in the new pledge \- have recently taken a more nuanced approach by limiting support for overseas coal and oil-based power generation projects, but leaving a HYPERLINK https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Fossil-Fuel-Energy-Guidance-for-the-Multilateral-Development-Banks.pdf narrow window available for natural gas projects in poor countries that pass a rigorous screening process.

Tiny climate gains, major development losses Focusing on limiting the emissions of the world\' s poorest countries while emissions continue to rise in industrialized countries is clearly misdirected in our view.

My younger brother Rameez Kareem, who studies in Grade 6 in Turbat, has attained climate-change education from chapters included in books and he practiced it when we planted many trees in our new farmland, Sabir said.\~  To include chapters on climate change in the curriculum is a good initiative. I believe, like tasks associated with science subjects, climate-change education must have practical activities too. Students must plant trees inside schools as well as have to visit fields to gain education and knowledge about agriculture, Sabir added. Balochistan has the lowest tree coverage in Pakistan, HYPERLINK https://climatetracker.org/pakistans-10-billion-tree-tsunami-threat-porcupines-invaded/ at 1.4% of total land area.

A research paper titled HYPERLINK https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/2/470  Drought Trends in Balochistan shows that the province is vulnerable to climate change. In terms of prolonged droughts, the province is the most affected in the country. According to the paper, Bharkan, an arid region of the province, faced a drought lasting 22 months from 1999 to 2001. The province is also prone to low-level flash flooding. A recent record-breaking rainfall (104 millimeters) in Gwadar caused flooding in that port city.

Under the strategy, students were required to plant trees and in return earn extra marks during examinations. It was a necessary step to educate students through activities. But the policy couldn\' t last long given the dearth of interest, Sabir said with regret.According to a HYPERLINK https://therevelator.org/climate-change-education/ recent study , children born in 2020 could face seven times as many climate disasters than those born in 1960. The study reaffirms the belief that climate-change education is the need of the hour. Another HYPERLINK https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206266 study reveals a strong relationship between climate action and a course taught to university students. After taking the course, a majority of graduates reported pro-environment decisions. Their decisions reduced their individual use of carbon by 2.68 tons per year. In addition, a study further reveals that if only 16% of high-school students in high- and middle-income countries were to receive climate-change education, there could be a nearly 19-gigaton reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions by 2050. At the Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) in Scotland late last year, discussion on climate-change education also resonated.

Balochistan, after Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), is the third province to adopt the SNC.  Balochistan has adopted SNC and whatever is included in it, we will implement, said Saeed Ahmed Khan, director of the Balochistan Bureau of Curriculum and Extension.  We have adopted [the]first phase of SNC and it includes environment-related education from [Grades 1 to 5].  Apart from this, despite making it [climate change] a new subject, we have chapters on environment in both English and Urdu. To add climate-change education, we can incorporate researched articles in scientific subjects. Introducing climate change as a separate subject will take time and effort. It might be easier, according to Ahmed, to introduce climate-change subjects in universities than in colleges. Hiring staff and introducing a new subject at college level needs much effort and time. Implementing climate change education Saadia Khalid, head of the Lahore-based campaign  Climate Warriors, believes that a climate-change curriculum should be a  hidden one.  My agenda is simple. Don\' t buy bottled water. I carry my own. I walk and do not use a vehicle if the distance is coverable by walking. These steps are simple and we must train a teacher to teach these things to schools. Children understand things better. Asfand Bakht Yar is an environment educationist who administers workshop programs in schools initiated by An Taisce \- the National Trust for Ireland. Bakht believes that it\' s important to impart climate education to children in schools given the fact that schools can give formal education. The information is accurate and designed according to the age of children.  I designed a program and proposed it to the Ministry of Climate Change. But I have been waiting for the feedback. After learning the basic concepts, children can play their role and become part of the solution, Bakht said.\~ The way forward In 2018, an HYPERLINK https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/nature/slingshot-toting-teenagers-turn-conservationists-in-pakistan/ awareness campaign in KPK province had promising results. The campaign centered on educating school students about conservation of biodiversity. Similarly, an effective method, according to Bakht, is to engage students in activities that lead to awareness and are also fun. Bakht urges that there ought to be workshop programs specifically designed for junior, senior, and post-primary-school education, respectively.  Workshops must contain fun activities on concepts like climate change, recycling, water conservation, air quality and energy, he explained. For Bakht, the EU Green School Model is workable in Pakistan.  The model might need some changes in environmental and climate curriculum on our part but will run parallel to the existing education system in Pakistan. Tahir Rasheed, director and regional head WWF Sindh and Balochistan, said:  Balochistan is a very diverse region. Of nine to 10 ecological zones, six lie in Balochistan. It\' s a hyper-arid region and climate effects are high here. He added:  We need to educate and create awareness in multiple fields. We need to create awareness about protected areas, about repercussions of CPEC-related projects which might exacerbate the climate effects, and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUUF), which is a serious threat to marine ecology. According to Rasheed, Balochistan, the largest province of Pakistan, during the last 50 years has confronted droughts and below-normal precipitation that have affected 60-70% of the population directly or indirectly. Balochistan has a predominantly arid environment and thus sustainable management of natural resources, environmental as well as climate-change-related issues must receive a high priority in the government\' s planning and development processes.  Policymakers and civil society should be environmentally sensitized to take into consideration the climate agenda and ecological processes that sustain life in the province, Rasheed emphasized. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong53","Why Gulf oil producers should commit to carbon neutrality","June 30, 2021 Wednesday 9:37 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","There are growing hints the United Arab Emirates may announce a net-zero carbon-emissions target ahead of the COP26 climate conference in November. Saudi Arabia also may agree to a carbon-neutral goal for around 2050, according to the US climate envoy, John Kerry. So should Gulf oil producers truly commit to carbon neutrality, and if so how would they get there? At first encounter, even asking the question seems bizarre. The region remains the world\' s premier locus of hydrocarbon exports, the foundation of its economy. But the global winds are changing. By the end of last year, more than two-thirds of the global economy had set, or had planned to set, net-zero targets, mostly around 2050, or 2060 in the case of China. As record heatwaves sweep the Middle East and North America, eliminating net greenhouse-gas emissions is necessary to keep global industrial-era temperature rises below 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Still, setting a target could be aspirational and not much more, a sign of concordance with other leading countries. But even that would send an important signal to those fossil-fuel exporters that have lagged on the issue of climate change, notably Russia and Australia. To be somewhat cynical, if others do not achieve their goals, any shortfall from the Gulf Cooperation Council bloc will be overshadowed. If they do meet them, much of the GCC\' s hydrocarbon economy will be obsolete anyway. That said, a really effective target for the GCC, backed up by concrete goals and intermediate milestones, would help prepare the bloc\' s entire domestic and export economy for three decades of total reinvention. That would require intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040, such as that of the European Union, which is to cut 2030 emissions by 55% versus 1990. The concern is that the whole plan will quickly become infeasible if emissions are still rising by 2025 or 2030. The UAE\' s nuclear-power plan, its single largest low-carbon investment, took 13 years from conception to first generation of electricity. Fewer than three such cycles remain by 2050. The first GCC country to commit to a net-zero carbon goal would certainly be taking a big risk: of moving prematurely away from hydrocarbons while prices are still high and when reserves underground are enormous. Of course, reaching net-zero carbon would not mean stopping the extraction, use and sale of oil and gas entirely. But oil output in particular would fall precipitously. The International Energy Agency\' s plan for net-zero by 2050, albeit not the only possible route, sees OPEC oil production, mainly from the GCC and its neighbors, falling to 12.5 million barrels per day, from current capacity of some 35mbpd. The remaining oil and gas output would mostly be employed in non-emitting uses \- with carbon capture and storage, or as feedstock for long-lived materials such as plastics. Any residual emissions would be mopped up by direct removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide, or by planting trees and other biological methods. There is going to be enormous competition for a limited amount of  negative emissions, given all the users who will not have managed to eliminate their emissions or will regard them somehow as essential or unavoidable. The leading countries in such a plan would avoid locking in high-carbon infrastructure, and would encourage and enable people and companies to reorient their skills and strategies. There would be a clear direction for research and investment in startups and new technologies. Such a strategy would help protect the economy against the increasingly likely prospect, in the EU and probably the UK, the US and others, of border carbon tariffs, designed to penalize imports from countries without strict carbon-reduction policies. But what would the components of such a plan be? The electricity and desalination sector would be the easiest target, though still challenging. The UAE\' s national energy strategy already plans for renewables and nuclear power to be half of generation capacity by 2050. This share would have to increase, and be paired with batteries and other storage options for nighttime electricity demand. Wind power would complement solar across parts of Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Any remaining gas- and coal-fired plants would use hydrogen or be fitted with carbon capture and storage. Expansion of the GCC power grid, and connection to neighbors, would help balance variable renewable output across days and seasons. Ground transport would need to move away from gasoline and diesel power toward better  walkability,  cyclability, metro and railways, and electric cars. Ships would need to be converted to electric propulsion for short distances, and to use synthetic fuels made from hydrogen for ocean-going vessels. The GCC\' s large aviation industry would need to find solutions \- probably again, batteries for city hops, and biofuels or hydrogen derivatives for long-range aircraft. Such planes and their fuels do not yet exist, and international cooperation will be essential. Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE already are moving ahead with ambitious hydrogen ventures, including the alliance among ADNOC), Mubadala and ADQ in Abu Dhabi. Along with renewable electricity, hydrogen will become the essential multi-purpose fuel, as well as an export industry partly to replace oil and gas. It would also mean cleaning up heavy industry, particularly refining, petrochemicals, and iron and steel. Cement plants would need to turn to carbon capture. Energy use would need to become much more frugal by ending what remains of subsidies, by improving design and construction, by thoroughly insulating and shading buildings, by using passive cooling systems and by retro-fitting existing structures. Urban planning must be rethought for livability, climate resilience and low-carbon living. Putting a price on carbon emissions, comparable to the practice in Europe, where prices recently reached records of more than \€ 50 (US$59) per metric ton, would reward low-carbon technologies and behavior. Oman could soak up more than a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by reacting it with the minerals in its famous mountains. These negative emissions are another source of value for the Gulf region. The sheer scale and pace of the required changes are daunting. But that is all the more reason to forge ahead. The challenge is colossal for every country, and may seem especially challenging for the Gulf region, since it also demands a complete reinvention of the economy. For even tremendous success in hydrogen, renewable electricity export and carbon capture will not come close to replacing oil and gas rents. A new productive economy must emerge on the foundations of the old. This article was provided by HYPERLINK http://www.syndicationbureau.com/ Syndication Bureau , which holds copyright. \"

Japan\' s reluctance explicitly to rule out coal-fired power sees the country trailing behind other large economies on climate action.\~ Bangladesh\' s energy future lies in renewables, not in coal or natural gas. After 50 years of independence, Bangladeshi energy experts should have more of a say in preparing the energy sector master plan than foreign experts from JICA.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong55","Mine, or yours?","January 28, 2022 6:33 AM GMT","Week in China","In Chinese slang, over-indulging is described as  eyes wide, stomach narrow \- much like the English phrase  your eyes are bigger than your belly. Maybe it characterises the enormous (and growing) appetite of China\' s EV battery producers too. Hungry for success, they could have a major problem getting hold of enough of the raw materials they need to feed production, however. Capacity growth is aggressive: Benchmark Mineral Intelligence reported last November that the Chinese are constructing one giga factory per week, compared to one every four months in the United States. At the end of 2021, China had already had installed battery capacity of 154.5 GWh. But by the end of 2022 that could more than double to 350 GWh and by 2025 it will be many multiples more. CATL alone hopes to have 520 GWh installed by then. SVOLT, which ranks sixth domestically, has just announced plans for 600 GWh more production by 2025 too, up from 3.22 GWh in 2021. Where will they get the lithium from? The world\' s upstream miners are struggling to bring more projects onstream. As we reported in WiC569, there\' s already a bottleneck as most of the newer projects won\' t become operational until 2023 at the earliest. Accordingly prices for battery-grade lithium carbonate raced through $40,000 per tonne in China in initial trading this year, according to Benchmark, up from less than $6,000 18 months ago. Resource-rich countries are also trying to secure more of the windfall profits from this tight supply, including Chile, the world\' s second largest lithium producer (it was recently overtaken by Australia). The efforts have been led by the left-leaning Gabriel Boric \- recently elected as Chilean president \- who is pledging to increase mining taxes and set up a state-owned lithium mining firm in a bid to spread the profits more evenly through Chilean society. Chinese EV and battery making giant BYD could be the first major casualty. In mid-January, a Chilean appeals court suspended BYD\' s erstwhile successful bid for one of two new 80,000-tonne lithium mining contracts. Miguel Vargas, the governor of Copiapo province, had filed the original complaint, alleging that the bidding process violated environmental regulations and the rights of indigenous communities living nearby. Boric\' s incoming administration also alleges that the bidding was opaque and rushed through before the new government was formally set to take office on March 11. The former administration had been trying to boost lithium output from 18,000 tonnes in 2021 to 400,000 by 2030. But critics of the way that the BYD contract has been suspended say this is impossible if foreign investors lose faith in Chile, warning of the economic fallout from disrupting the deal. BYD\' s treatment was a terrible signal for investors, warned one of the most-liked responses to an article on the case in local newspaper El Mercurio.  Venezuela wait for us. Here comes Chile, the contributor added.  It\' s over. It will take decades to generate confidence in the country again, added another. It\' s estimated that meeting the targets from last year\' s COP 26 climate conference will require 17 times more lithium than was produced in 2021. But potential challenges in sourcing supply are yet to suppress the share prices of the world\' s major battery producers. CATL is trading at 152 times 2021 earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, while BYD is quoted at 112 times. South Korea\' s LG Energy Solutions is about to complete the country\' s largest ever IPO too, raising W12.7 trillion ($10.8 billion) on the Seoul Stock Exchange. LG ranked as the fifth largest battery manufacturer in China last year and has plans to expand capacity at its overseas plants to 430 GWh by 2025. SVOLT is not far behind with its own listing plans, with a filing expected next month. The pre-IPO investors include Sany Heavy, Xiaomi, Hans Laser and China Mobile. Its largest shareholder is Baoding Ruimao. That entity is controlled by Wei Jianjun, a tycoon who took control of a struggling car producer from the Baoding government in 1990, turning it into Great Wall Motors, one of China\' s best-known SUV manufacturers. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong56","Thinking outside the box on climate change","November 3, 2021 Wednesday 11:58 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","SEOUL \- Can mass deforestation cool the environment? Is there a real, working technology that literally reverses the CO2 emission cycle? And are there economically feasible, multinational regulatory frameworks that could de-heat the planet? The answer to all these questions, according to Simon Mundy, is  yes. He ought to know. Currently the  Moral Money editor of the Financial Times, Mundy spent two years crisscrossing the world reporting from the climate change frontlines. The result is HYPERLINK https://www.simonmundy.com/book  Race for Tomorrow: Survival, Innovation and Profit on the Front Lines of the Climate Crisis, which hit bookshelves just before the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26 , kicked off in Glasgow this week. On his odyssey, Mundy witnessed highly innovative, potential solutions. Some are on the ragged edge of scientific possibility. Others are actual working innovations whose scope and possibility extend far beyond renewable energy sources. The only things missing at present are the financial resources to upscale these innovations \- and the political will to unleash them upon greenhouse gases on a game-changing scale. Rewilding prehistoric Siberia Greenhouse gas emissions do not simply derive from human industry: A key emitter in our warming world is melting permafrost, notably in Siberia, an area larger than China. Yet Siberia used to have a global cooling, not heating, effect. Thousands of years ago, Siberia was a band of cool grasslands which reflected solar heat. Today, Siberia is shadowed by dark forest, thereby losing its reflective effect. Those responsible for this seismic environmental shift were our prehistoric ancestors. That may shock those who believe primitive humans were environmental saints. And the solution will strike many as sacrilege: grassland restoration via deforestation. Yet the science is sound. While forests in most of the world are carbon-dense plant habitats that absorb CO2, in the far north,  forests are unhelpful, Mundy explained. The proponent of this concept is extreme Russian scientistSergey\~Zimov, who oversees the Siberian research project known as  Pleistocene Park (a brand inspired by Steven Spielberg). Zimov and his team, armed with chainsaws and tanks, are very unusual environmentalists, Mundy admits. But although Zimov chain smokes and chugs vodka with every meal, he is widely cited and has won international awards in the field. And there\' s more. Zimov\' s wildest and wooliest idea is a proposed method to reverse forestation: Repopulate Siberia with resurrected herds of tree-trampling mammoth. Yes, you read that right. The original reason Siberia\' s tundra become forested is because mammoths and other huge herbivores were hunted to extinction by humans some 10,000 years ago. Could such beasts return? Mammoth DNA has, indeed, been discovered in permafrost, but not in a complete enough form to recreate the great beasts.  This is something people have been talking about for a long time, Mundy says.  We are nowhere near. Fantastical? Perhaps. But Zimov is not alone. A team at Harvard University is deploying genome engineering in an attempt to create a neo-mammoth based on modern elephants.  The idea is to create a bigger elephant, give it wool and longer tusks and more blubber so it can take the extreme temperatures in Siberia, Mundy said. Gases emitted by thawing permafrost are already equivalent to that generated by all of international aviation, but transforming Siberia back into a global air condition is hardly an immediate solution. A device or system that could literally reverse carbon generation in short order would, surely, be the Holy Grail for climate-change warriors. That is not a myth; it is a working technology. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mundy-Carbfix.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image Reverse emissions innovation A novel, integrated solution that Mundy calls  amazing is in use today by an Icelandic-Swiss academic-industrial partnership. Mundy explains it in basic terms: Swiss-based Climeworks AG uses two-meter square boxes, with fans inside, to capture carbon from the atmosphere. The fan essentially sucks the CO2 into the box, where a filter absorbs it, and the box is then sealed. When the box is heated, the CO2 detaches from the filter, so can be pumped. In Iceland, another company, Carbfix, takes the pumped CO2 and injects it into underground, volcanic bedrock. Once in the substrate, the CO2 undergoes a reaction: It is essentially turned into stone, a process that takes around two years. Research shows 95% success rates for the conversion process. It may sound magical, but is not.  It is quite elementary chemistry \- CO2 naturally forms limestone, Mundy said.  You are reversing the fossil fuel cycle. The project, which started in earnest in 2017 and came fully online this year, is backed by such luminaries as philanthropist Bill Gates, carmaker Audi and European governments. One issue is rock: Not all substrate worldwide is appropriate for the process. But the bigger issue is scale. Some 50 devices are in use, and each one sucks in around 50 tons of CO2 per year. Yet every year, some 30 billion tons of CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere. As things stand, the solution sinks a tiny crack across the vast carapace of a mighty problem. Yet its potential to go massively upscale is real \- as evidenced by existing industrial economies of scale. The potential is tantalizing: While CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas, it is the most critical.  Now we have this technology, we can talk about carbon net-zero, Mundy said. The question then becomes how a massive increase in production, and a relatedly massive global roll-out, could be funded. As a financial reporter, Mundy has also examined that question. Given that economic regulations drive economic behavior, he suggests policy changes are in order for both producers and consumers. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mundy-solar.jpg?resize=780%2C395&ssl=1 Link to Image Frameworks for the future When it comes to the generation sector, developed countries are deploying wider-than-ever shares of renewables in their energy mixes: solar, wind, hydro, wave, geothermal. At present, solar is leading the pack.  The cost of renewables, especially solar, is coming down, Mundy said.  Solar keeps outperforming as economics of scale and technologies have been advancing; this is largely driven by China.  You need a guaranteed source of power to run a factory, he said.  As it stands at the moment, a lot of industries have a problem relying on a source of energy that is not fully reliable. A further issue is the problem of storing renewable energies. Technologically,  there is scope for a big ramp up of storage technology, he said. Convergence technologies are one solution. Mundy visited a Texan startup that is using fracking technology to store water underground at high pressure, using a solar pump as the power source. At night, when the solar goes out, the pump is released and the water shoots up to drive a turbine. On the large scale, clean \- or cleaner than traditional \- fuels such as LNG and hydrogen are entering widespread use. But one of the most promising and cleanest fuels \- next-generation nuclear \- may never win acceptance. Mundy reckons that safety concerns around atomic energy mean it can never become the central power source.  Nuclear is interesting as we have a well-established zero-carbon energy source, but a large number of people are uncomfortable and it will be very difficult for governments to steamroller it through, Mundy said.  In my opinion, we should not rely on breakthroughs in nuclear technology. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fuku-e1566549201195.jpg?resize=780%2C551&ssl=1 Link to Image Shifting from energy generation to the production and consumption sectors, economics is central. Given the realities of 21 st century comforts and behaviors, Mundy does not believe that promoting changes in consumer behavior \-  fly less, eat less meat, buy fewer clothes \- is a solution.  That helps at the margins, but is not realistic, he said.  You have to put a price on carbon that creates an economic incentive that changes the rules of the game. On the big-picture level, he favors the widely debated  Carbon Club approach. Under this, large, prosperous players such as the EU and US would pioneer a set of sound and ethical rules around carbon emissions. Domestically, these rules would penalize organizations and companies which emit. Individuals who stick to rules would be granted dividends from the resultant tax base, providing an economic incentive for citizens, too, to go green. Externally, tariffs would be placed upon products imported from territories not in the  club. If the founder members of the club are prosperous nations of prosperous consumers, this tactic would compel outside countries to join. This raises the specter of injustice toward developing countries whose power generation sectors and companies cannot afford to upgrade. Mundy admits that there is  no single-sentence answer. He suggests that the Global North must inevitably support the Global South.  It is pure self-interest, as developing countries\' emissions cloud the whole planet, Mundy said. The world\' s biggest emitter is at one both a developed and undeveloped country: China, the world\' s G2 economy and  workshop of the world, comprises a coastal strip of well-to-do middle classes, and an interior of peasants. President Xi Jinping is not among the world leaders attending COP26 . At a time when China\' s image in the eyes of many developed nations is already badly frayed for diplomatic and political reasons, Xi\' s non-appearance may also make him a villain in the eyes of environmentalists. But Mundy believes that the current situation facing China needs to be examined through a wider, historical lens.  China now has the most annual emissions, but historically, it had way less, he said.  Rich countries have so much more responsibility for cumulative carbon emissions \- way more than China. This is the second part of a two-part interview. Part one can be read here. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong57","Spill the beans","November 5, 2021 6:57 AM GMT","Week in China","What was he thinking? That\' s a question often asked of the unorthodox Tesla CEO Elon Musk \- now ranked as the world\' s richest man by Bloomberg. But this week the question was a literal one, as millions tried to figure out the meaning of a cryptic tweet. So what was it that got people, especially in China but also around the world, scratching their heads? It was Musk\' s posting on Twitter and Sina Weibo of an ancient poem \- in Chinese characters \- with absolutely no explanation of why he\' d done so or what he intended it to convey. The only addition to the post was the English word  Humankind (perhaps to indicate who he was speaking to, or maybe to show who he was talking about; see photo of the tweet on next page). The poem, popularly known as the Seven-Step Verse, goes like this:  \u-29626  \u-29626 \u-31743 \u-244 \u-29626  \u-28196         \u-244  Beanstalks are burned to boil beans. The beans weep in the pot; We are born of the same root. Why are we so eager to hurt each other? It is said to have been composed by Cao Zhi, a talented poet and the favourite son of Cao Cao, a warlord who laid the foundation for the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period in the third century. His elder brother Cao Pi, after becoming the emperor of Wei, saw his sibling as a threat to the throne. As a result Cao Zhi was given a seemingly impossible task to produce a poem about brotherhood without using the word \' brother\' within the timeframe of walking seven steps, or else he would be executed. Cao Zhi came up with his verse about cooking beans, reducing his brother to tears. The poem is extremely well known in China but less so outside the Chinese-speaking world. The fact that Musk posted it in its original language meant it was ignored by many English-speaking Twitter users \- although news organisations like CNN pondered what the enigmatic tycoon might be up to. It was Chinese readers, however, that weighed in on social media platforms with by far the widest range of interpretations for the post.  He is urging us to buy dogecoin, said one weibo user, pointing to the fact that the word for bean in Chinese (dou) sounds similar to \' doge\' . There\' s something in that: Musk has been a strong proponent of the cryptocurrency, though in recent weeks another canine-themed token, Shiba Inu, has overtaken Dogecoin in value. Others suggested Musk was alluding to himself and fellow space-obsessed billionaire Jeff Bezos. When Musk took the title of \' richest man\' from Bezos last month, he tweeted a silver medal emoji aimed at riling the Amazon founder. Another theory is that the SpaceX founder was responding to the United Nations World Food Programme director David Beasley, who said people like Musk and Bezos should donate more of their wealth to fight global hunger. Others suspected he was tweeting at global leaders assembling in Glasgow for the COP26 talks on the planet\' s climate emergency. Musk has spoken passionately about China\' s  aggressive plans to curb emissions and has called on other countries to do more. Others offered limerick-style translations about how the California-based Musk didn\' t want to pay more tax in the US \- as some Democrat politicians have proposed. Some even offered the possibility that Musk was attempting to cool down heated cross-Strait relations. Former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin, it was noted, quoted the same poem in trying to achieve this end in 2000, using Cao Zhi\' s brotherly sentiment to strike a tone of reconciliation. Public figures in China often cite ancient poems to express controversial or politically sensitive views. Former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao often put his interpreters under pressure by doing just that during press conferences. That said, when business leaders do it, the gesture can backfire. It created trouble for Meituan founder Wang Xing in May when he cited a 1,000 year-old poem criticising Qin Shi Huang, China\' s first emperor. Some saw the post as a rebuke of the current government, leading to difficulties for Wang and a selldown in Meituan shares. In the case of Musk, there has been no share price backlash. Perhaps in a mischievous way he just wanted to grab more free publicity.  There are normal billionaires and then there is Elon Musk, posted one confounded Twitter user after seeing the Chinese poem. \"

It is also about figuring out how best to meet the energy needs of people across the world while working toward net-zero emissions. If fossil fuels have to be given up, which has now become an urgent need given the current environmental challenges, countries in Africa and a significant part of Asia, including India, need an alternative way of providing electricity to their people. What then is the best course for poorer countries to follow for electricity production if they do not use the fossil fuel route that is being used by rich countries? This in turn also raises questions about how much this alternative energy source route will cost poorer countries, and who will pay the bills incurred when making the switch to this new source of energy. Discussions on these issues, which are pertinent to resolving the climate crisis, were completely absent from the agenda of COP26 , which\~ HYPERLINK concluded \~on November 13.

With less than a quarter of India\' s population, the United States emits significantly more carbon than India does \- almost twice as much. It is argued that as the cost of electricity from renewables has now\~ HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/renewables-cheapest-energy-source/ fallen \~below the cost of electricity from fossil fuels, it should be possible for all countries, rich or poor, to phase out fossil fuels completely and shift to renewable energy sources without addressing the issue of funding. It is true that the cost per unit of electricity generated with renewables is lower today than that from fossil fuels. What has been overlooked here, however, is that for poor countries to make this\~ HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/how-colonialisms-legacy-makes-it-harder-for-countries-to-escape-poverty-and-fossil-fuels-today-159807 switch , they would need to build three or four times the capacity to generate electricity from renewables to supply the same amount of energy that they currently get from fossil-fuel plants. This is because the capacity factor or plant load factor (PLF) \- how much electricity a plant produces compared to what it can produce by working continuously at full capacity \- for renewable energy sources is about 20-40% that of fossil-fueled plants. The wind does not blow all the time, nor does the sun shine at night. That means that a country will have to build several times the capacity \- and therefore invest more capital \- using the renewable route to generate the same amount of electricity it would get from fossil-fueled plants. This level of investment in renewables may not be a problem for a rich country. But for a poor country trying to build its basic infrastructure of electricity, roads, railways and other public infrastructure, including schools, universities and health-care institutions, this switch to renewables will not be easy without financial support from the rich countries. This is why the rich countries asking the poor countries to make net-zero pledges without committing to providing them with any money is completely hypocritical. The rich countries can \- and most probably will \- turn around and say that the poor countries made the commitment toward ensuring net-zero emissions, and they should now borrow from the rich countries at high interest rates and make good on their promises, or else face sanctions. In other words, this would lead to a new form of green colonialism. The second problem with renewables as the main source of electricity is that there are significant additional costs for setting up the grid for short-term or long-term storage of electricity. This is to balance the daily fluctuations or the seasonal fluctuations that may arise. For example, this year, Germany saw a significant slowing down of winds in summer, leading to a\~ HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/12/low-wind-speeds-hurt-profits-at-two-of-europes-major-energy-firms.html sharp fall \~in electricity generated from wind. In its case, Germany balanced the low production of wind power by increasing the production of electricity from\~ HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/german-energy-demand-carbon-dioxide-emissions-seen-rising-2021-industry-group-2021-11-02/ coal-fired plants , leading to greenhouse-gas emissions going up significantly. In a scenario in which coal-fired plants do not exist, what will countries do when renewable energy capacity fluctuates? While daily fluctuations for countries using renewable energy sources can be met with large, grid-sized batteries, this is not feasible for seasonal variations. These countries will have to either use pumped storage schemes with hydroelectric power or store hydrogen in large quantities for use in fuel cells. A\~ HYPERLINK https://www.newsclick.in/Energy-Storage-Options-Renewable-Intensive-Future pumped storage hydroelectric scheme HYPERLINK Storing hydrogen \~in quantities large enough to meet seasonal grid requirements is another idea that still needs to be explored and assessed for its technical and economic feasibility. The point here is that shifting to a grid that is entirely based on renewable energy is still technologically some time away. We need to develop new technologies for storing energy. And we may need to use concentrated sources of energy \- fossil or nuclear \- to meet the requirement of daily or seasonal fluctuations until that time. The other possibility is using fossil fuels without greenhouse-gas emissions. It means not letting the carbon dioxide escape into the atmosphere and, instead, pumping it into underground reservoirs, or what is called\~ HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-technology-perspectives-2020 carbon capture \~and sequestration. Such\~ HYPERLINK https://www.dw.com/en/carbon-capture-technology-loses-out-in-germany/a-16999567 carbon capture projects HYPERLINK https://reneweconomy.com.au/americas-only-carbon-capture-plant-shuts-down-indefinitely/ were given up \~in the belief that renewables would solve the problem of carbon emissions. It is now clear that having renewables as the only source of energy in a grid is not enough, and the world may need to look for other solutions as well. Meanwhile, in the short term, nuclear power does not appear to be a permanent solution to moving toward cleaner energy sources as  there is not enough time for nuclear innovation to save the planet, \~ HYPERLINK https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2021-07-08/nuclear-energy-will-not-be-solution-climate-change according \~to a recent article in Foreign Affairs. This means gas, oil and coal are the only short-term solutions before us for meeting long- and short-term fluctuations in energy production. And here, the duplicity of the rich countries becomes clear. Rich countries like those in Europe and North America have enough gas resources. Poorer countries like India and China do not; they only have coal resources. HYPERLINK https://asiatimes.com/2021/11/why-our-climate-isnt-jumping-for-joy-after-cop26/ rich countries \~decided to focus on what fuel needs to be phased out. Yes, coal\~ HYPERLINK https://endcoal.org/coal-myths/myth-2-coal-is-clean/ emits \~twice the amount of carbon dioxide compared with gas-fired power plants for the production of the same amount of electrical energy. But if countries produce twice the amount of electricity from gas-fired power plants as from coal, they will still produce the same amount of carbon emissions. If the US or the EU-UK are producing more carbon emissions than India or Africa, which have larger populations, why ask for phasing out coal only, while no such targets are set by the US or EU-UK for phasing out their carbon emissions by using gas-fired power plants? This is where the energy-justice issue becomes important. US per capita energy use is nine times that of India, while the UK\' s per capita energy use is six times that of India. If we consider countries in sub-Saharan Africa such as Uganda or the Central African Republic, their energy consumption is even lower. That is, the US consumes 90 times and the UK 60 times as much energy as these countries. Why should we then talk only about which fuels need to be phased out and not about by how much countries need to cut their carbon emissions immediately? I am not raising here the issue of an\~ HYPERLINK equitable share of the carbon space The last word on hypocrisy is Norway\' s.

But if rich countries do not also find a path for the poorer countries to meet their minimum level of energy needs, they will see the collapse of huge swaths of their own countries. Is it logical to think that countries in sub-Saharan Africa can continue living on a ninetieth of the energy consumption of the US without there being consequences for all countries? Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his followers may believe that India is on the way to becoming a developed country, even a superpower. The fact is that, in per capita electricity consumption, India is closer to Africa than to China or the club of the rich nations, the US, the UK, and those in the EU.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong59","Xi\u8217 s pledge on financing coal plants overseas misses point","October 5, 2021 Tuesday 3:17 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","During his virtual speech at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to end the financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas. Many observers cheered this move, seeing it as a game changer for the coal phase-out process the world urgently needs. In reality, China\' s financing of coal-power plants overseas is quite limited compared with its own production. In 2020 alone, the country installed 38 gigawatts of new coal-fired power capacity at home, an amount that equals the entire coal-fired power capacity currently installed in Germany, to reach a total installed capacity of 1,095GW. Also read: Mixed reviews of Xi\' s promise on coal power plants This year looks even more threatening, at least from the perspective of climate policies, as China has an additional 100GW capacity either under construction or approved for construction within its borders \- and these estimates do not incorporate the likely increase in coal production as a consequence of the country\' s ongoing power crunch. This contrasts sharply with the 20GW that Chinese institutions are currently financing overseas, according to the Boston University , notably considering that many of these projects are been delayed or canceled altogether.\~ That is, the commitment to stop overseas coal funding is of course welcome, but it comes at a time of firm decline of such funding in any case. A key driver of the reduced demand for coal power plants overseas lies in\~the increasing price competitiveness of renewable energy, especially solar and wind, let alone their cheaper financing as financial institutions have gained a better\~understanding of climate-related financial risks. All in all, given China\' s dominance in solar and wind energy, Chinese institutions might actually gain from President Xi\' s pledge, as they will move from financing riskier coal plants to renewable. This is, thus, not only a win for the global fight against climate change, but also for China. The most difficult task, indeed, as regards China\' s commitments to reduce emissions, is to reduce domestic production. On this front, Beijing is clearly far from setting the right incentives. China\' s huge coal production at home is supported by generous subsidies, the full amount of which is yet to be known. As a rough reference, the International Energy Agency estimates that direct coal subsidies hovered around US$10 billion for 2019. So far, China has not really offered a detailed plan as to how to reduce coal-related emissions. In the 14th Five Year Plan presented in March, no breakthrough on China\' s existing energy mix was offered, with coal keeping a staggering poll position among the different sources of energy at 57%. On the contrary, the plan also makes several references to the further development of coal, instead of introducing a coal consumption cap.\~ In the same vein, China\' s commitments for the upcoming 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 One might wonder why a country with the largest production of solar panels on the planet cannot reduce the huge role that coal still plays in the economy. Political-economy reasons come to the forefront. First, coal mining represents one of the main economic activities in northeastern provinces, with a vast number of jobs at stake. Second, cheap electricity production remains an inherent comparative advantage for Chinese exports. China\' s current power crunch can only make matters worse. Local governments have started rationing electricity given the lack of price signals \- electricity being heavily subsidized \- while local governments struggle to reach their emission targets without enough coal imports after Australia\' s coal has been banned in the political fight between the two countries. China\' s manufacturing capacity is starting to feel the pinch of electricity constraints at a time of cyclical deceleration for the Chinese economy. Therefore it seems unlikely there will be a reduction in coal plants in China at this juncture no matter Xi\' s pledges at the UN.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong60","\u8216 Huge\u8217  move: Xi vows no more coal funding overseas","September 22, 2021 Wednesday 12:13 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","China will stop funding coal projects overseas, President Xi Jinping announced Tuesday, all but ending the flow of public aid for the dirty energy contributing to the climate crisis. Xi made his announcement at the UN General Assembly where US President Joe Biden, seeking to show leadership in a growing competition with China, promised to double Washington\' s contribution to countries hardest hit by climate change. China is still investing in coal, reducing the impact of Xi\' s commitment, but it is by far the largest funder of coal projects in developing countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh as it goes on a global infrastructure-building blitz with its Belt and Road Initiative. Xi vowed to accelerate efforts for China, the world\' s largest emitter, to go carbon neutral by 2060.  This requires tremendous hard work and we will make every effort to meet these goals, Xi said in a recorded address.  China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low carbon energy and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, he said. China\' s announcement follows similar moves by South Korea and Japan, the only other nations that offered significant funds for coal projects. The climate advocacy movement 350.org called Xi\' s announcement  huge, saying it could be a  real game-changer depending on when it takes effect. Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said it was  a historic turning point away from the world\' s dirtiest fossil fuel.  China\' s pledge shows that the firehose of international public financing for coal is being turned off, she said. But she said that private investors needed to make similar commitments. And she noted that China itself is still stepping up coal, an industry with political clout in the Asian power as well as the United States. On a visit to China earlier this month, US climate envoy John Kerry said the addition of more coal plants  represents a significant challenge to the efforts of the world to deal with the climate crisis. Non-governmental groups in a letter earlier this year said the state-run Bank of China was the largest single financier of coal projects, pumping $35 billion since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015. Biden promises more aid China\' s promise comes as momentum builds ahead of a UN conference in November in Glasgow that aims to raise the ambitions of the Paris accord. Support for action has been growing with the planet breaking record after record on high temperatures and witnessing devastating severe weather linked to climate change including fires, severe storms and flooding. One key section of the Paris accord that has lagged behind is mobilizing the $100 billion a year promised for nations hardest hit by global warming. Biden, who has put the environment high on his agenda after defeating his predecessor, climate change skeptic Donald Trump, said the United States will double its contribution.  This will make the United States a leader in public climate finance, Biden said. Experts said that the announcement would take the American contribution to approximately $11.4 billion annually. British lawmaker Alok Sharma, who will preside over the so-called COP26 conference in Glasgow, hailed Biden\' s announcement and said:  We must build on this momentum. Currently, two-thirds of the funding is for mitigation \- reducing climate change \- rather than adjusting to current and expected future changes, such as sea-level encroachment, more intense extreme weather events or food insecurity. In another climate announcement at the General Assembly, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would formally ratify the Paris agreement, which it earlier had only signed. The developments amount to rare pieces of good news on the climate front following a slew of high-level scientific reports painting a bleak future picture, as the world\' s top polluters continue to spew greenhouse gases at alarming rates. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was  encouraged by the  important US and Chinese announcements but warned that far more needed to be done to address climate change. Last week Guterres warned the world was on a  catastrophic path to 2.7 degrees Celsius heating according to a new study by UN scientists. The figure would shatter the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement, which aimed for warming well below 2C and preferably capped at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. \- AFP \"

Maybe. Given the increasing numbers of electric vehicles on the road, the rapidly declining cost of renewable energy, and fresh discussion about our warming planet, one would think that humanity was on track to change how it produces and consumes energy. Climate naysayers have in essence been discredited and excluded from debates on the future of the planet. But despite these profound changes, we are dangerously close to missing key targets in the battle to get global warming under control. According to new findings, we have likely missed the primary target of the 2015\~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement Paris Agreement \~on climate change. The goal of the Paris Agreement, the world\' s most ambitious piece of climate legislation, is to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels. While technically possible, scientists suspect that we will not manage to achieve this target. The results could be catastrophic.\~ Last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations\- led panel of scientists and scholars, released its final report, and the findings were harrowing.\~Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, announced\~ HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/ the panel\' s findings HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sgsm21228.doc.htm saying that \~ we are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5-degree-Celsius limit. The IPCC was crucial to the creation of the 1.5-degree warming target and convincing the world of its necessity. If we fail to reach this target, the IPCC conclusively demonstrated, the consequences in terms of drought, rising ocean levels, and other climate catastrophes will be dire.\~ The creation of the 1.5-degree warming target enabled the rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, diversification of corporate assets, and a spike in interest in renewables. It hasn\' t all been rosy, though. One could write several pieces about the failure of international cooperation on climate change. The United States, under then-president Donald Trump, famously\~ HYPERLINK withdrew its support The last\~ https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56901261 UN Climate Change Conference COP 26 ) was also weighed down with geopolitical infighting regarding the best paths forward to achieve tangible climate targets.

In other words, we still haven\' t hit peak oil.\~ With the scientific community ringing the warning bell on warming targets, we have to ask some difficult questions. What does missing the Paris Agreement\' s warming target mean for continued climate initiatives? This is important given what needs to change. Meeting warming targets will require unheard-of investments in new energy technologies. This also means that existing energy infrastructure dependent on coal, oil and natural gas would need to be taken offline before their scheduled decommission dates. From an economic standpoint such an action would be counter-intuitive. Given the cost involved, the only way that such actions would be carried out is with ample political cooperation and the institutional capacity of countries. The only way truly to effect change is through the power and cooperation of nations, not individuals.\~ This unavoidable reality is counter to the marketing from renewable-energy companies and electric-vehicle manufacturers that are selling a vision of the future in which individual decisions can transform climate change. It\' s wonderful that people are buying electric cars and outfitting their homes with solar panels, but these actions alone will do nothing to alter the actual direction of the climate.\~ Whether we like it or not, only nations can make (and pay for) the historic changes that will meaningfully alter our climate prospects. Certain nations have much more sway over the direction of the fight. If China, for example, were to introduce new residential development guides that required renewable-energy infrastructure, that would have a profound effect on the amount of carbon the world releases into the atmosphere. Such a serious government step would dwarf individual efforts.\~ Given the state of the international community today, this should give us pause, but at least the path forward is clear. The Paris Agreement was bound to fail but the renewed conversation it spurred could be transformed into an agreement that works.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong62","To tackle climate change, engage with Taiwan","November 22, 2021 Monday 7:45 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","At the UN climate conference in Glasgow this month, scientists were unequivocal: The only way to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change is to transition quickly away from coal, oil and gas to cleaner sources of energy such as wind, solar and hydropower. Leaders nodded in agreement. US President Joe Biden called on the world to  double down on clean energy deployment. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country would generate half of its energy from renewables by 2030, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said green technology would help Britain achieve  net zero in power generation by 2035. But there is one little-discussed yet significant barrier to those bold pledges: Without a supply chain that runs through Taiwan, one of the world\' s most vexing geopolitical hotspots, quickly flipping the switch on green power will be nearly impossible. An essential ingredient for renewable energy systems to work is the semiconductor. Made from pure elements such as silicon or germanium, semiconductors facilitate the harnessing, conversion, and transfer of renewable energy to the power grid. Without these vital chips, the efficiency of green technologies is limited, and their value diminished. Put simply, the promise of a greener future provided by renewable energy depends on high-quality semiconductors. Which brings us to Taiwan, the world\' s leading manufacturer of these essential chips (found in everything from smartphones to smart toasters). Last year, Taiwan\' s foundry market \- the outsourcing of semiconductor fabrication \- accounted for more than 60% of total global foundry revenue, with 50% attributed to just one company, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). To understand the magnitude of Taiwan\' s hold on this sector, consider what happened this spring to the auto industry. When global demand for electronics spiked and semiconductor supplies diminished, some 1.3 million vehicles were left stranded on the assembly line.\~ But while automakers generated the most headlines, the renewable-energy sector, particularly manufacturers of solar panels and wind turbines, was also hit hard. For instance, in February, US-based solar giant Enphase Energy reported that  constraints in the global semiconductor supply chain had hurt its production worldwide. Given the importance of semiconductors to clean energy solutions, and Taiwan\' s outsized role in the chip-making business, one might assume Taiwan would have had a seat at the table in Glasgow. But that assumption would be wrong. Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway province, is not part of the United Nations system that hosted the COP26 climate talks. While a delegation from Taipei engaged from the sidelines, Taiwan\' s role in solving the climate crisis was not on the official agenda. To save the planet from catastrophic warming, it\' s time to bring Taiwan into the conversation.\~ Accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is one of the most cited ways to curb the climate-change threat. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that it is still possible to achieve emission reduction targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, but only if coal and other dirty sources of power drop precipitously in the next few years. Doing that will require a significant and immediate scaling-up of renewable energy sources. It will also mean strengthening current semiconductor supply chains while developing new ones. As the chip shortage this spring demonstrated, Taiwan\' s supply-chain stranglehold is not a viable long-term solution, and governments are moving to expand their chip manufacturing capabilities. In the US, for instance, TSMC, Samsung Electronics and Intel have announced plans to open new foundries, while Abu Dhabi-controlled GlobalFoundries, the world\' s third-largest semiconductor foundry, also plans to expand production. Still, it could take years for this extra capacity to come online, leaving green-energy manufacturers reliant on existing supply chains to fill their orders. But even the existing pipeline is being squeezed, as China has gone on the offensive to limit Taiwan\' s engagement with Western governments. When a group of Taiwanese business executives \- including chip manufacturers \- visited the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Lithuania in late October, Chinese diplomats warned that  necessary measures would be taken in response. China issued a similar rebuke days later, when a group of American lawmakers flew to Taiwan in a US Navy aircraft, a provocation China called  sneaky. In Europe, this vague pressure is having an effect. Recent momentum behind a bilateral trade deal between the European Union and Taiwan \- which would have strengthened cooperation in strategic technologies such as semiconductors \- stalled at the  eleventh hour. EU lawmakers were reportedly split on how to balance business with Taiwan amid increasingly bellicosity by China, with one German politician accusing pro-China  Merkelites of derailing the deal. While Beijing\' s response to Taiwanese diplomacy is to be expected, the planetary implications of sidelining Taiwan are massive. To power a large-scale green-energy revolution, the world needs the kind of high-end semiconductors that Taiwan produces. Western governments that are serious about climate change should focus less on appeasing China and more on helping Taiwan\' s chipmakers expand capacity while building up their own capabilities. By engaging with Taiwan, and making those trade ties official, governments can secure supply chains and source a key ingredient for meeting their climate-change commitments. The climate summit in Glasgow was remarkable for its breadth. An estimated 40,000 politicians, campaigners and business representatives gathered for two weeks to hammer out a blueprint for saving the planet. But to turn those promises into action at the speed required, the world should deepen its ties with the tiny island state that wasn\' t even on the guest list. \"

And the going alternative of muddling through with a mishmash of the two is unlikely to be much better than either perspective alone.\~\~ This article was first published by The Duck of Minerva and is republished with permission.

The SBTi have also accredited the Group's plans to reduce its total scope 3 emissions by 63% within the same timeframe. This means SBTi has determined that all targets are in line with a 1.5\'b0C trajectory. \~Travis Perkins has committed to investing in its buildings to continually improve energy efficiency, using low carbon, renewable energy systems where possible, while also installing energy saving solutions such as utilising LED lighting, solar panels and electric vehicle charging points across the Group's estate. Measures have also been put in place to optimise the Group's 4,000-strong transport fleet by utilising fleet management systems, transitioning to alternative fuels and adopting low carbon technology. \~Travis Perkins will also work with suppliers and customers to reduce supply chain emissions, in particular in-use emissions from products sold and the embodied carbon in products, as part of the broader Scope 3 emissions commitment.\~ \~Alongside this SBTi accreditation, the Group also today announces that it has moved to a 100% renewable electricity tariff for all of its UK based operations. The tariff, supplied by Drax, will see all Travis Perkins businesses in the UK supplied with 100% renewable source electricity across the total UK portfolio of almost 1,700 stores, branches and offices nationwide.\~The renewable sources used to generate this electricity would typically consist of a mixture of biomass, wind and solar power, and over the four-year duration of the contract, this would save an estimated 54,600 tonnes of carbon compared to current levels; enough to power 80,000 homes.\~Commenting on the news, CEO Nick Roberts said:""Achieving SBTi recognition for our emissions targets is an important step forwards as part of our broader sustainability plans. This adds great endorsement and credibility to the work we will lead with both suppliers and customers to decarbonise our industry. The measures we have put in place with regards to our fleet, the use of low-carbon technologies and our estate are already having a tangible impact on our emissions, and I look forward to building on this positive momentum.\~ As such, I am delighted to announce that we have moved to a 100% renewable energy tariff for all of our UK operations, another key step forward as part of our long-term sustainability plans.""\~\~Drax Chief Commercial Officer Paul Sheffield, added: ""Climate Change is the biggest challenge the world faces and it's essential that businesses play their part in addressing this crisis. Drax has a world-leading ambition to be carbon negative by 2030 using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\~""Drax supplies 100% renewable electricity and the contract with Travis Perkins is testament to the high level of service we provide, supporting businesses to reach their sustainability goals. We work in partnership with our customers, creating tailored solutions that meet their sustainability needs. As we look towards a post-Covid, green recovery, it's more important than ever for businesses to build back better, helping the UK reach its net zero by 2050 goal.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong65","Biden: We will protect Taiwan if China attacks","October 22, 2021 Friday 3:33 PM GMT","Asia Times-English","If there was any doubt, it has been quashed  the message to Beijing was stark and clear. Or was it? Perhaps it got murkier. HYPERLINK CNN Politics reported. Asked twice during CNN\' s town hall whether the US would protect Taiwan if China attacked,\~Biden said it would.  Yes, we have a commitment to do that, he said. Under the  One China Policy, the US acknowledges China\' s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. In recent weeks, Beijing has sent dozens of warplanes near into Taiwan\' s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), and Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that  reunification between China and Taiwan was inevitable. A White House spokesperson later appeared to walk back Biden\' s comments, telling US media outlets that the US was  not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy. Hours after the town hall, China\' s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin reasserted the nation\' s longstanding claim that the island is its territory, whether America likes it or not.  When it comes to issues related to China\' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for China to compromise or make concessions, and no one should underestimate the strong determination, firm will and strong ability of the Chinese people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wang said at a media briefing.  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\' s territory. The Taiwan issue is purely an internal affair of China that allows no foreign intervention, Wang said. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Putin.png?resize=780%2C488&ssl=1 Link to Image The US should  be cautious with its words and actions on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signals to the separatist forces of Taiwan independence, so as not to seriously damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Wang said. However, the Taiwanese were cheered by Biden\' s statement, thanking him for his words.  Our government will continue to strengthen our self-defense capabilities to full defend Taiwan\' s democracy national security and people\' s well-being, a statement from the foreign ministry said Friday. Biden said Thursday he was not concerned about an intentional military conflict with China  but indicated he was worried about unintentional escalation.  China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in history of the world. Don\' t worry about whether they\' re going to be more powerful, he said.  But you do have to worry about whether or not they\' re going to engage in activities put them in a position where they may make a serious mistake. Citing his relationship with Xi, Biden said he wasn\' t looking to enter a prolonged conflict.  I have spoken and spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has. That\' s why you hear people saying Biden wants to start a new cold war with China. I don\' t want a cold war with China. I want China to understand that we are not going to step back and change any of our views. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin threw his hat into the Taiwan ring earlier this week. Putin, who was a no show at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, said China  does not need to use force in order to achieve its desired  reunification with Taiwan. Speaking to HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/ CNBC \' s Hadley Gamble at the Russian Energy Week conference in Moscow Wednesday, Putin pointed to Xi\' s comments suggesting the possibility of a peaceful unification, and China\' s  philosophy of statehood, to suggest that there is no threat of military confrontation.  I think China does not need to use force. China is a huge powerful economy, and in terms of purchasing parity, China is the economy number one in the world ahead of the United States now, the Russian president said, according to a translation.  By increasing this economic potential, China is capable of implementing its national objectives. I do not see any threats. Putin also addressed tense relations over the South China Sea, where Russia has tried to maintain a neutral stance toward China\' s long-standing and internationally repudiated claim to vast swathes of nearby waters.  As for the South China Sea, yes, there are some conflicting and contradictory interests but the position of Russia is based on the fact that we need to provide an opportunity for all countries in the region, without interference from the non-regional powers, to have a proper conversation based on the fundamental norms of international law, he said.  It should be a process of negotiations, that\' s how we should resolve any arguments, and I believe there is a potential for that, but it has not been fully used so far.

Comments from the two sides on the encounter, which stretched over three-and-a-half hours, indicate that not much was off the table. Both emphasized the need for ongoing dialogue. A White House https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/readout-of-president-bidens-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/ readout indicated that Biden emphasized strong US opposition to China\' s attempt to throw its weight around. President Biden underscored the United States will continue to stand up for its interests and values and together with our allies and partners, ensure the rules of the road for the 21st century advances an international system that is free, open and fair. From an Australian perspective, given the bad state of relations between Canberra and Beijing, these expressions of support for  allies and partners will be welcome. In another significant intervention, Biden called for greater cooperation to avoid possible conflict. President Biden also underscored the importance of managing strategic risks. He noted the need for commonsense guardrails to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict [ ] The Chinese  HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/biden-xi-kick-off-virtual-meeting-with-calls-to-increase-communication.html readout  came via Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, who said the meeting was  wide-ranging, in-depth, candid, constructive, substantive and productive. Chinese state media quoted Xi as describing the talks as a  new era in which the principles of  mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation should be followed. Both Biden\' s and Xi\' s words indicated a wish to improve the relationship through more frequent communication. Biden\' s HYPERLINK https://www.afr.com/world/asia/biden-opens-xi-meeting-with-message-on-avoiding-conflict-20211116-p599cn remarks before the two leaders began the talks suggested he was keen to establish a less combative relationship. He said: It seems to be our responsibility as the leaders of China and the United States to ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict whether intended or unintended, rather than simple, straightforward competition. Xi responded by calling Biden an  old friend and expressed the wish to  work with you, Mr President, to build consensus, take active steps and move China-US relations forward in a positive direction. The above sentiments expressed by both sides could be regarded as nothing more nor less than what might be expected in exchanges between US and Chinese leaders in a summit setting. But there is at least a chance that a more constructive relationship will emerge from these talks. In a complex world in which both the US and China are facing immense challenges domestically, it is in neither\' s interest for relations to spiral. Indeed, it is in their collective interest for a more workable relationship to emerge. Agreement between Washington and Beijing at the recent COP26 climate summit to HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/ work constructively towards climate targets is an example of the sort of collaboration that serves each other\' s interests. However, it would be extremely na\'efve to believe the world is about to enter a new and more benign phase following the Biden-Xi talks. Multiple structural differences between the competing powers are such that it is inevitable the two will continue to be at odds on a range of issues. Most concerning for America and its friends, one of those issues is China\' s continuing HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/d7c50283-18c8-4f2e-8731-970d9a547688 military build-up . This includes additions to its nuclear arsenal and the development of space-enabled hypersonic missiles that would pose a serious threat to US military supremacy in the Indo-Pacific. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/China-Liaoning-Aircraft-Carrier-South-China-Sea-PLA-Navy.jpg?resize=780%2C509&ssl=1 Link to Image China\' s military buildup in the East and South China Seas, despite assurances provided by Xi to President Barack Obama that Beijing\' s intentions were benign, represents a significant concern for the US and its allies. This includes Australia. China\' s use of its cyber capabilities in a provocative manner is another cause for concern. Its intellectual property theft weighs heavily on relations with Washington. Its human rights abuses represent another serious drag on the relationship. All that said, personal diplomacy between Xi and Biden may serve to smooth off some of the rougher edges of a relationship that will continue to be tested. This is because of the simple reality that China, as a rising power, will continue to disrupt the US and its allies on many different fronts. The question that should be asked about this latest attempt to restore a level of equilibrium to the relationship is whether there is a reasonable expectation a more constructive partnership will develop. There are reasons why relations might become less contentious. On the other hand, there are compelling arguments for why deep and aggravating differences are such that a dysfunctional relationship remains likely.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong68","Time to renew multilateral leadership on climate crisis","July 28, 2021 Wednesday 5:10 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","The events of the past year are a stark reminder of the need for global action on climate change and environmental protection. A global pandemic, with its likely source in increased interaction between wildlife and humans, has brought the world\' s economy to its knees, put a strain on the social fabric across the globe, and claimed millions of lives so far. In Southeast Asia and indeed across the globe, natural disasters have again taken a heavy toll. Even nations at an advanced stage of development, equipped with the best capacities and technologies, have been increasingly impacted by climate-related disasters affecting their infrastructures, food and health systems, and ecosystems. Some commentators and decision-makers have seen this unprecedented crisis as a sign of failure of international cooperation and multilateralism, and are promoting more isolationist policies. Even before the pandemic struck, an increase in commercial and geopolitical tensions was already a concern, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. These approaches are fundamentally misguided. Our economies and societies have become closely interconnected, and advances in digital and transportation technologies will only reinforce this trend. Multilateral action is complex and can often be frustrating when the national interests of nearly 200 states are at stake.\~ But we are acutely aware by now that certain challenges are global in nature and require global solutions. Environmental and climate-change issues offer plenty of examples. The oceans, our river basins, the air we breathe, and the biodiversity we rely on for our economy, our health and our scientific progress know no borders. We also know that multilateral action can work. Joint action on threats to the ozone layer, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, has led to a significant drop in ozone-depleting substances. The ozone layer is recovering and based on current trends, the World Meteorological Organization foresees an end to the  ozone hole phenomenon over Antarctica by 2060. It is worth reviewing the key success factors in this case. First, the Montreal Protocol addressed a scientifically recognized challenge of global scale, with implications for human health. Second, it benefited from increased consumer awareness of the harmful effects of ozone-depleting substances, thanks to effective education and awareness campaigns. Third, after some initial resistance, industry leaders invested in research and development and were able to deploy alternative technologies within a few years. And last but not least, the Montreal Protocol came about as a result of decisive leadership from key developed nations, in a spirit of multilateralism, which included financial and technical support for developing countries to make the shift to more environmentally friendly technologies. Many of these ingredients are again present, to address larger environmental and climate change challenges. Scientific evidence of the impacts of environmental degradation and climate change on human development is overwhelming. Global awareness of these issues is reaching unprecedented levels as impacts on health, access to water, food systems and migrations, just to name a few, are becoming more and more obvious. Particularly encouraging is the engagement of youth. In Cambodia, a recent study found that 75% of young people under 25 were motivated to take action or had already acted to fight climate change. \~ The private sector is gradually coming on board. Many industry leaders now recognize the opportunities of the green economy. Investments in the development and implementation of sustainable energies and other climate-friendly technologies are booming, and sustainable finance is gathering pace. In the last few months, we have seen encouraging signs of leadership from some of the world\' s leading economies, including announcements of carbon-neutrality targets by Japan and China, and the European Green New Deal. Most recently, the decision of the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change and its commitment to achieve net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 have the potential to re-invigorate global action on climate change. Strong partnerships with climate-vulnerable nations must be a key component of that response. Multilateral action allows all nations, no matter how small, to chip in and contribute to a solution. It has a multiplier effect, which makes possible results that leading world or regional powers may not be able to achieve on their own.\~ The Cambodian government fully appreciates the multilateral support received as the country successfully transitioned to a new era of peace and stability. We are now in a position to play an active role in these multilateral mechanisms, as demonstrated by our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and our active participation in environmental and climate-change conventions. The submission of our updated 2030 targets under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is the most recent example of this commitment, and Cambodia is currently working on its own Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy.\~ As mentioned recently by our prime minister at the P4G Summit in Seoul, Cambodia, as ASEAN chair for 2022, will work with all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to implement the agreed comprehensive Covid recovery framework, including clear commitments on sustainable, resilient and climate-smart recovery.\~ At the global level, a successful HYPERLINK https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjQrZzq54TyAhUU4zgGHV--D-8QFjAAegQIExAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fukcop26.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw1U-pDm6fIlL4_bv8jP8haE COP26 in Glasgow will be essential to increase momentum. We call on all parties to finalize negotiations on the rulebook for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Governments and private investors alike need this clear framework to get more ambitious projects moving on the ground. After a forced period of economic slowdown and self-reflection in 2020, this year must mark a new beginning on how the international community addresses the global environmental and climate-change crises.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong69","Bumbling Biden heads to Rome and Glasgow","October 29, 2021 Friday 7:21 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","In post-World War II American political tradition, foreign trips have become ways for a president to burnish his image and shore up authority at home. In the 1950s, then-vice president Richard Nixon traveled a lot with an eye on running for president in 1960. Getting stoned by mobs in Venezuela and debating Nikita Khrushchev over the virtues of capitalism at a Moscow trade fair enhanced Nixon\' s foreign policy reputation. The 1960 presidential election winner John F Kennedy made his first trip to Europe and was greeted by rapturous crowds. (The masses were also eager to celebrate his wife). The scenes elevated him to a fresh symbol of American leadership. Ronald Reagan sometimes turned his foreign visits into major diplomatic events: on a trip to then-divided Berlin, he famously commanded the Soviet Union to unify Germany, saying,\~  Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall. Presidential hopefuls, especially those with short foreign policy resumes, traveled abroad to project knowledge, even if in post-card style. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama visited US-occupied Iraq to show that he had enough credibility to take on his substantially more experienced Republican rival John McCain. Donald Trump introduced a new combative style on foreign trips to please his  America First home supporters. He notoriously upended diplomatic norms by upbraiding close allies. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Merkel-and-Trump-G7-summit-2018.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image Today, President Joe Biden is in Rome for the Group of 20 key economic powerhouses. It\' s his second chance to show some sort of global leadership skills. Just a few months ago, in a summit of Group of 7 democracies, he endeavored to persuade allies and the US public that, after the tumultuous and inward-looking Trump years,  America is back. That self-promotion fell apart with the clumsy exodus from Afghanistan, untoward diplomacy with allied France, consistent failure to get Russia to stop cyberattacks on American online networks and confusion over whether the US is committed to militarily defend Taiwan from a hypothetical Chinese invasion. With those foreign bungles scorching his early record, Biden is currently reduced to persuading world leaders that he is, at least, in charge of running the United States and not leaving it adrift. The challenge, in his own view, lies in getting the US Congress which is in control of his own Democratic Party to approve a US$1.75 trillion social welfare and climate change measure, along with a $1 trillion infrastructure package that Biden himself helped forge On Thursday, Biden laid out what, in his mind, are the stakes:  We are at an inflection point. The rest of the world wonders whether we can function, he said. In meetings with Democratic legislators, he practically begged them to pass both measures.  The House and Senate majorities and the rest of my presidency will be determined by what happens over the next week, he declared. His chief National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also suggested that foreign leaders are eyeing Biden\' s domestic abilities.  They\' ll say, \' Is President Biden on track to deliver on what he said he\' s going to deliver?\'  Sullivan conjectured.  Our allies are making their judgment, Heather Conley, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told Politico online journal. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Macron-and-Biden-at-NATO.jpg?resize=780%2C509&ssl=1 Link to Image So far, no good. His own party continued to wrangle over social programs that were excised from the original social spending package, which had been whittled down from $3.5 trillion. Biden got on a plane and left for Rome without a vote. He may not get one until next week if at all. For the G7 meeting, this means the likelihood of even less accomplishments than customary for this annual talk-fest. For one thing, the leaders of two major countries China and Russia are not attending. That will weaken Biden\' s efforts to discuss Iran\' s nuclear program. Russia and China were original mediators along with the US and Europe of an Obama-era deal to curb Iran\' s nuclear program. Trump canceled the accord and Biden wants to renew it. Because the G20 summit will be followed immediately on November 1 by the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, Biden had hoped to bring Congressional approval of more than $500 billion to speed the transition from oil and gas production to non-CO2 spewing sustainable energy. The money is the biggest single sum within his $1.75 trillion social spending plan. With China burning more and more coal to overcome a power shortage and Russia unlikely to quickly damage its own vast fossil fuel economy, Biden may lose a chance to flaunt America\' s climate change credentials. In any case, hopes that this pair of foreign meetings will resolve Biden\' s domestic political problems is probably folly. Surveys show his job approval ratings at dismal lows as talk of a mid-term election rout of the Democrats next year starts to make headlines. The US suffers from a host of issues not on the agenda in either Rome or Glasgow: uncontrolled migration across the US southern border; rising inflation; a crime wave; continued inability to safely evacuate hundreds of Afghan allies stranded in the fundamentalist Taliban-ruled country. Even a rapturous welcome in Rome there won\' t be one and a meeting with Pope Frances there is one scheduled\- won\' t relieve Biden\' s multiple political headaches. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong70","China not buying Biden\u8217 s \u8216 compartmentalized\u8217  cooperation","October 7, 2021 Thursday 6:11 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","Recent efforts by US President Joe Biden\' s administration to engage with Beijing have been little short of a disaster. A visit by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in July was met with two Chinese lists of demands for US policy changes. John Kerry, Biden\' s climate-change envoy, traveled to Beijing a month later and received a clear message that the cooperation he sought on global warming was not going to happen because of US hostility. Washington\' s hope of a leadership summit between Biden and President Xi Jinping appears improbable, though they may hold a virtual meeting before the end of the year. It is almost certain that Xi will not attend the Group of Twenty Summit in Rome in person, and there is almost no discussion in China that he will travel to Glasgow for the COP26 climate meeting. Many in China have described the current state of US-China relations as a stalemate. They say Biden has adopted a path no more confrontational or cooperative than his predecessor Donald Trump, while maintaining the focus on competition. The real wrench in the works stems from the two completely different approaches to how the superpowers want to engage. Biden\' s approach is to deal with the different issues with China separately, or  compartmentalized. The pursuit of competition, cooperation and confrontation with Beijing are being run in parallel. This approach fundamentally conflicts with the Chinese view that discussions should be interconnected across all areas, ie, through  issue linkage. Without addressing this fundamental conflict, Washington\' s desire for a relationship based on  responsible competition may not transpire. Biden\' s strategy of compartmentalizing different areas of US-China relations has been clear since he took office. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the approach as  competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be. \~ Following this logic, the US seeks to compete vigorously with China in all areas and actively counter Chinese security threats, especially on Taiwan and the South China Sea.\~ Yet the policy does not preclude cooperation. From climate change to regional challenges, including North Korea, Iran, Myanmar and Afghanistan, the US sees cooperation as feasible and desirable for both countries.\~ Thus if the US and China can compete in their comprehensive national power but still cooperate in areas of common interest, it would help shape a healthier bilateral relationship and serve the US well, goes the thinking in Washington. For the Chinese, the evidence from the last eight months show that this compartmentalized approach does not work. In their view, Kerry might repeatedly visit China to seek climate change cooperation, but it does not stop the US from continuing tariffs on Chinese products imposed by the Trump administration. Similarly, Biden can have a phone call with Xi where he discusses  the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict. But this does not stop his administration from engaging in  anti-China moves immediately after. The day after a phone conversation between the two in September, it was reported that the US was considering allowing Taipei to include  Taiwan in the official name of its Washington office. The move infuriated Beijing, which views the democratically ruled island as its own territory. Then, a week after that call, the US said it would provide nuclear-powered submarine technology to Australia. This approach creates confusion in Beijing. Chinese analysts have been grappling with what they perceive as an inconsistent and conflicting approach. For the Chinese, the competitive nature of bilateral relations is not only toxic but has determined that the two countries will seek all possibilities to gain advantages in bilateral issues. That means their diverging interests overwhelm most, if not all, converging interests. It also means Beijing perceives any cooperation with the Biden administration as  favors, with no return on investment. For Beijing, the solution for managing relations with the US has always been issue linkage. Chinese cooperation on issues from domestic market access to foreign conflict resolution was leveraged against the US to extract compromises in areas China deemed critical, such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and human rights. The quid pro quo was so prevalent over four decades that Beijing understood it could always bargain. For China, a bilateral give-and-take is the default state of US-China relations. When the Biden administration introduced a framework that compartmentalized these issues, the Chinese reaction was to shut down. The implication of this clash is twofold. First, for China the overall nature of the relationship has soured on a strategic level. Therefore, so goes the thinking, any cooperation on a tactical level is only going to benefit the Americans. Even when such cooperation is in China\' s interest, China would not give the US the satisfaction.\~ This Chinese perception is evident most recently in its handling of the climate-change issue and Afghanistan. Although Beijing recognizes the need for action on global warming and agreed to stop building new coal-fired power plants overseas, it used the UN framework to announce it rather than a bilateral US-China setting. Doing the latter would have given Biden a win. On Afghanistan, China could have answered the US call for cooperation on stability and humanitarian assistance. Instead, Beijing deliberately avoided it and chose unilateral engagement with the Taliban. The second implication is that the compartmentalized approach removes Chinese interest in tactical cooperation that could benefit China. The bar for cooperation has been raised extremely high. Neither the US nor China can force each other to accept its approach. As such, the stalemate will continue. If China is unwilling to cooperate, the US might have to abandon the strategy eventually. That will push competition and confrontation to the front line, and it may not be the healthy and responsible competition anyone had envisaged.

As the HYPERLINK https://grattan.edu.au/news/a-credible-net-zero-plan-must-be-about-more-than-technology/ Grattan Institute warned this week, this will fail unless the government rolls out other market-based policies too, including better plans to use already existing low-emissions technology for vehicles and energy. The priority technologies identified in the plan include clean hydrogen, ultra-low-cost solar, energy storage, low-emissions steel and aluminum and carbon capture and storage. But the plan is scant on detail and long-term thinking. It provides support for technology only in the early stages of research and development, not sustained support throughout the commercialization process. Many of these technologies are heavily tied to progress on renewable electricity generation, with the plan relying on 91-97% emissions reduction occurring in the electricity grid by 2050.

Framing renewables as a \' problem\' HYPERLINK https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/wem/security_and_reliability/2021/renewable-energy-integration--swis-update.pdf?la=en identifying renewable generation and rooftop solar as challenges to the stability of the electricity grid. Even the government\' s net-zero plan emphasizes the need for coal and gas for grid stability, despite including goals to boost emissions-free storage technologies, such as batteries and pumped hydro, that could likewise support this stability. This is an example of the entrenched system at work \- a transition to renewable energy will require the grid to be reimagined. This is HYPERLINK technologically feasible Indeed, the existing electricity grid is rife with problems that aren\' t fully acknowledged in the strategy. For example, coal and gas can pollute for free, with consequences falling on society at large rather than on those paid for coal-fired electricity. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RTR31AI9-scaled.jpg?resize=780%2C504&ssl=1 Link to Image 2. Securing long-term investors Renewable generation is expensive to install upfront, but has no fuel costs and so is extremely cheap to run, once built. For investors in renewable generation, being able to plan for long-range sales over the course of the generating plant\' s life is crucial. In a 2020 study, a researcher from Switzerland HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421520301816 interviewed 40 renewable energy investors in the UK, Germany and Spain. They indicated investment was riskier when they relied on variable HYPERLINK https://www.aemc.gov.au/energy-system/electricity/electricity-market/spot-and-contract-markets spot market prices rather than on fixed prices agreed on at the time of construction. In Australia, spot market energy prices are extremely volatile and change every 30 minutes. Prices can go as high as A$14,500 (US$10,870) per megawatt-hour and, when there\' s an oversupply of electricity, can go as low as A$1,000 below zero per megawatt-hour. But the net-zero plan includes no mechanisms for providing stability to renewables investors regarding return on investment. However, there are many examples of this type of mechanism HYPERLINK https://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GSR2021_Full_Report.pdf worldwide , even locally in Australia. The HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148118309637?casa_token=OeUf_ZSJPcwAAAAA:apIX9E1-zgv1TyP4nd4A7wUWEHDlCNcO504_aXkG7NFjBe6TItGhOhDleAkcI221w05M-0s98N8 Australian Capital Territory HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.08.011 A$80 per megawatt-hour HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/solar-farm.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image 3. No real plan for energy storage Solar and wind are  non-dispatchable technologies, meaning they can\' t be turned on when needed. This is an issue because the electricity grid relies on a real-time balance of electricity supply and demand, and has very little storage capacity. Without sufficient storage in the grid, renewable generation may need to be curtailed at times when there\' s too much supply, HYPERLINK adding to the financial risk More storage is key to fixing this issue and the plan rightly names storage as a priority technology to develop. However, the plan\' s focus on early-stage development can only be the first step. Australia also needs a plan to commercialize and deploy storage technology, but the plan is light on details. The two key examples it gives for this are co-investment in the HYPERLINK https://www.cefc.com.au/where-we-invest/case-studies/neoen-expands-hornsdale-power-reserve-big-battery/ Neoen Hornsdale Power Reserve battery storage program in South Australia and the HYPERLINK https://victorianbigbattery.com.au/ Victorian Big Battery Neither project represents any new action or commitment.

Little imperative without legislation The plan states  Australia will not legislate its net-zero by 2050 target. Without legislation behind the target, there will be less imperative to dig deep to mobilize sufficient resources (funding, time, effort) to meet it. The plan flags five-yearly reviews of progress towards emissions targets. The low level of detail in the plan means doing these reviews well, and acting on their findings, will be crucial to achieving actual progress on emissions reduction. However, the plan doesn\' t specify what these reviews will look like, or what will happen if reviews show progress is falling short. Without legislating its target, the Australian government has promised no consequences for failing to meet the net-zero plan. Lee White, Research Fellow , Australian National University .

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong72","The sinking Maldives and the Glasgow climate meet","October 27, 2021 Wednesday 4:11 PM GMT","Asia Times-English","The Glasgow climate summit, likely humanity\' s last shot at averting the unthinkable, is nearly upon us with a tidal wave of harrowing data and a backwash of deluded denial. For a quick look at why the outlook is so troubling, take a paddle up Schitt\' s Creek. One exchange in that incisive Canadian TV series says it all. When her veterinarian flame tells Alexis Rose (the spoiled diva who turns cool) he has a research grant to the Galapagos, she asks:  Can\' t we go someplace less spooky and scary, like the Maldives? \~ The Galapagos aren\' t scary. Neither is Maldives if you pay resort costs  up to $30,000 a night. But the hyper-spooky string of Indian Ocean atolls exports more jihadists per capita than the Mideast or Afghanistan. And it is likely to be the first state lost under rising seas. Ignorance is hardly bliss. Only informed public pressure can force governments to think beyond short-term political survival and take urgent joint action. Yet too many Alexis Roses tune out what they can\' t wear, eat, bed or talk about with friends. Maldives illustrates why so much has gone wrong since 2009 when President Mohamed Nasheed nearly united world leaders to avert climate collapse, confront Islamist extremism and nudge despots toward democracy. It is a long story; first some background. COP-26 in Glasgow is the latest  conference of the parties to a U.N. framework set up in the 1990s. I covered the last big one in Paris in 2015 and labeled it COPout-21. Most delegates\' pledges dissipated not long after the exhaust clouds from jets that flew them home. Planned fossil fuel use through 2030, largely in China and India, is twice the level agreed in Paris to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since then, heat is up by 1.1 degrees. At 2 degrees, scientists say, floods, fires and storms will overwhelm our ecosystem. Climate is only part of it. Fresh US intelligence and defense estimates warn of massive migration, financial breakdown and armed conflicts over territory, food supply and water. Major powers already face showdowns over resources as ice melts in the Arctic and Antarctic. All this was unimaginable when I visited Maldives in 1972.\~ Nasheed was five when Queen Elizabeth\' s yacht docked at the main wharf in water so clear you could see angelfish on the seafloor. Reporters flew to Gan, Britain\' s base to the south, then in a small plane to Mal\'e9. The alternative was six weeks on a Sri Lankan freighter.\~ The only hotel had no can opener. It was on Mal\'e9, as was the lone fire truck, useless to the airstrip on another island. Muezzins wailed from white-washed mosques on the 3.2-square mile islet, inches above the ocean. Veil-draped wives walked behind husbands. The lash punished minor crime. We roamed narrow streets with no hint of danger.  Paradise did not begin to describe 1,191 outer islands, jewels flung north to south for 540 miles. We barely needed snorkels, let alone scubas, to explore pristine reefs ablaze in color. Tourism portended fortunes, even if that meant bikinis, daiquiris and sex on the beach.\~ In 1978, a corrupt tyrant began a 30-year reign. Developers dynamited coral to build lavish playgrounds. Nasheed, a young politician, spent six years in jail, 18 months in solitary. Torture wrecked his back. Amnesty International called him a prisoner of conscience. Then, in 2008, a civil uprising made him president. To emphasize the threat of rising seas, he held an underwater cabinet meeting. A reporter asked what would happen if the Copenhagen summit could not agree on binding CO2 levels.  We\' ll all die, he replied. Everyone laughed. But he was dead serious among 113 heads of government and 40,000 others in Denmark. Speaking after Barack Obama, he declared:  I am not a scientist, but I know that one of the laws of physics is that you cannot negotiate . You cannot cut a deal with Mother Nature. And we don\' t intend to try. Bill McKibben, a New Yorker regular whose books and articles on climate span four decades, called Nasheed one of the only true world leaders in the fight to save the planet. Al Gore and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed. In the corridors, as summitry works, he enlisted allies and forged coalition working groups. Nasheed went beyond climate. With diplomacy and targeted aid, he said, democratic leaders could curb authoritarian excesses. And if they addressed perceived injustices at the root of Islamist fundamentalism, they could sharply reduce terrorism.\~  The Island President, a hit feature film after the conference, made him a momentary star.  You have to have a planet to have a democracy, he told reporters.  And you have to have democracy to have a planet. It goes both ways. But the old guard deposed him in 2012. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison on bogus terrorism charges but instead went to London for spinal treatment. New leaders doubled down on paving paradise. Without his efforts to find common ground, rich and poor countries alike cranked up the heat like there was no tomorrow. Today, Maldives is two-tiered: a miserable, teeming Mal\'e9 and an infidel heaven beyond. Foreign workers, many undocumented South Asians, are a third of the population. They suffer wage theft, passport confiscation and long hours in unsafe conditions. Covid-19 left many jobless and stranded. From the start of the boom, profits were banked abroad after a cut for local officials. Terrorist recruiters signed up disaffected young men, forbidden alcohol but zonked on cheaper heroin. A U.S. State Department study traces the past flow into Iraq and Syria, adding,  Some of these fighters are now returning to the islands, where there are few laws or structures to deal with the threat they may pose. \~ Italian correspondent Francesca Borri is among the few journalists to probe Mal\'e9\' s seething slums. In 2017, she traveled the archipelago with the Maldivians who barely scrape by in a country where the tourist boom raised per capita annual income to $10,000. One-time Amazon  reviewers slammed her book,  Destination Paradise, disputing her firsthand accounts of political killings, gruesome torture and muzzled journalists. Her fixer was murdered for helping her and an Al Jazeera crew.  The Maldives is the most dangerous place I\' ve ever covered, she told me in a phone call. This is after living in Syria for much of the war and reporting on conflict for decades in such places as Iraq, Libya, Kosovo and Crimea. Nasheed\' s fortunes rose in 2019 in yet another power shift. He became speaker of the Majlis (parliament) under a new president. Then in May this year, a bomb left him critically injured, a d\'e9j\'e0 vu assassination attempt. If this is fresh news, that\' s no surprise. The New York Times dismissed it with a short article on page 11, written from a distance with no background about the Island President who tried who stop climate collapse.  No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, it said,  but officials, including Mr. Nasheed, have expressed concern about Islamic State recruitment in the Maldives, a small island nation and major tourist attraction south of India. But the Times The writer agreed. Even with her complaint about a difficult walk to a seaplane, she loved the place, concluding:  In the air, once the clouds cleared, the islands below gleamed like geodes, a final dose of sensory overload. Another Times Glasgow is not promising. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has piled up damning evidence since 1990. This year\' s book-length report has a whiff of inevitability. But Vladimir Putin, for one, is skipping the summit. Major polluters stall for time. Rich countries are loath to help poor ones, which argue they did not create the crisis although Third-World deforestation, mining and population growth have taken a heavy toll. Blame and borders no longer matter. The United States was by far the worst in earlier years. Now China spews out twice as much CO2, and India is hot on its heels. Saudi Arabia\' s carbon neutral target is 2060. If Earth\' s ecosystem collapses, no one will escape. Even a massive American  green new deal would fall far short on its own, but it would set a standard. Donald Trump\' s trashing of the Paris accords gave authoritarians an excuse to cheat and renege on promises. Polls show two-thirds of Americans want action on climate change, but Republicans prioritize short-term profit based on fossil fuels. France 5, a popular TV network, just aired a documentary on how the United States was the early prime mover to thwart global warming and yet now is heavily influenced by voters who reject science, misled by corporate flimflam, political opportunists and evangelicals. It noted the 2018 National Climate Assessment, a multibillion-dollar survey by US scientific and intelligence agencies, which detailed a looming nightmare of economic and human havoc far beyond the cost of urgent mitigation. Just the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season brought $250 billion in losses and 250 deaths, the report said, and  extreme events are increasing fast. A brief clip showed Trump blowing off reporters who asked about it.  I don\' t believe it, he said, walking away with a smirk. No surprise. The man attempted a coup d\' etat and risked global war to retain power. Yet for so many Americans, climate is a vaguely understood side issue. Billionaires squander fortunes on joyrides to inner space or grand schemes to colonize distant Mars. Innovators find ways to monitor front doors at home while tanning on a distant beach, as if security systems matter when desperate parents need to feed starving families. In 2004, the Times The terms, climate change and global warming, are now so familiar that many are numb to them, like people who take a low dose of antibiotics for too long while a virulent infection gets steadily worse. McKibben and others who keep at it mostly reach those already committed. Deniers mock young Greta Thunberg, whose Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder often add a strident note to her urgent appeals. But she speaks for a generation that must live with the consequences, and she is square on the mark. At COP-24 in Poland:  You say you love your children above all else and yet\~you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes  What is the point of learning facts when the most important facts clearly mean nothing to our society?

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong73","Establishing the guard rails","November 19, 2021 6:37 AM GMT","Week in China","Ronald Reagan first met Deng Xiaoping in Beijing in April 1984 \- almost exactly 39 months after the former Hollywood star first became US president. There was a delay because Washington and Beijing had laboured for months over the details of the third and final Joint Communiqu\'e9 (that has since served as a cornerstone of the China-US relationship). Ever since that time every US president has met with the top Chinese leader during his first year in office, and vice versa. Diplomats from both sides have explained that such meetings play a crucial role, setting the stage for the leaders to get a personal feel for each other. It sets the tone for a bilateral relationship that has grown into the world\' s most important and most complicated. The face-to-face rapport between the two leaders can be vital when things go awry. President Xi Jinping has himself stuck to the tradition since taking power and even adopted a more American style early on in his tenure when he eschewed the highly conservative Chinese diplomatic protocols of prior summits for a greater informality. For instance in June 2013 the then newly installed Chinese president took off his tie and started talks with Barack Obama over a leisurely stroll in California\' s Rancho Mirage. Four years later Xi travelled to the US again, this time spending some unscripted time at Donald Trump\' s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida (where America\' s least conventional president confided to Xi over the soup course that he\' d just rained 50 missiles down on Syria). However, an intenser focus on personal diplomacy vis-\'e0-vis \' the Donald\' \- where Beijing lavished flattery on him and even granted his daughter a bunch of useful trademarks \- didn\' t work, as Trump slapped hefty tariffs on Chinese goods less than 12 months after hosting China\' s first couple in his Florida mansion. The worsening ties between the countries then spilled over from the Republican administration to the Democrat one that was inaugurated this January. The diplomatic freeze \- alongside Covid-19 travel restrictions \- meant Xi found little time for summitry with his  old friend ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2020/11/joes-china-choices/ see WiC518 ) Joe Biden. A physical meeting between the duo has proven elusive in the 12 months since Biden\' s election last November as US president. However, diplomats scraped together a \' virtual\' meeting between their leaders this week. So, how \- if at all \- has the three-and-a-half hour video call changed relations between the world\' s two biggest economies? Recapping an eventful year for bilateral ties In the opening days of 2021 the world was closer to a catastrophic military conflict than most realised. That became evident more recently when Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, revealed to author Carl Woodward (and subsequently to Congress) that he found it necessary to call his Chinese PLA counterpart twice in the waning months of Trump\' s presidency, including once in early January, to reassure Beijing that the US wouldn\' t attack China. There were hopes that Biden could at least reopen channels of communication between the two governments, which had largely broken down in the lead-up to the transition of power in Washington (with Beijing particularly vexed by the confrontational activities of Trump\' s hawkish Secretary of State Mike Pompeo). That did not happen: diplomatic channels remained frozen and dialogue was icy. Indeed, in-person, high-level talks between the two sides have become even rarer. The first official meeting between the Biden administration and China ended with both sides trading sharp rebukes in the suitably cold climes of Alaska in March. The two sides\' next in-person interaction came in late July when Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visited Tianjin and met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi \- just two days before Wang\' s scheduled meeting with Afghanistan\' s Taliban representatives in the same Chinese city. Sherman told Wang that Washington might need Beijing\' s help in the unravelling Afghan political landscape \- with the Americans\' having timetabled a hasty withdrawal from Kabul ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2021/08/capitulation-in-kabul/ see WiC552 ). But US solicitations for assistance got zero traction with the Chinese side. During their talks, Wang underlined for Sherman three  bottom lines that Beijing saw as vital for preventing Sino-US relations from unravelling. Foremost among these was that the US must not challenge or  even attempt to subvert China\' s  development path and system . Specifically Sherman brought home two \' to-do lists\' from China (namely the  List of US Wrongdoings that Must Stop and the  List of Key Individual Cases that China Has Concerns Over ) which, according to the Xinhua news agency, included an end to US visa restrictions that made life more difficult for Chinese students as well as Chinese journalists (and also to drop visa bans on members of the country\' s ruling Communist Party). Beijing also demanded that Washington abandon a variety of Trump-era sanctions including high tariffs on Chinese exports and a tech blockade imposed on exports of US semiconductor parts and equipment. It also insisted on the unconditional release of Huawei\' s CFO Meng Wanzhou (held in Vancouver at the time in a legal dispute over whether she should be extradited to the US). All this coincided with a nuanced shift in the mood music too. In the early days of the Biden administration many discussions about China focused on areas like criticising the Chinese government on its treatment of local populations in Xinjiang and other human rights issues. But a foreign policy reset button seemed to be pressed in the summer as weeks of televised rolling news covered America\' s less than ideal exit from its two-decade military presence in Afghanistan. The anger and frustration of American allies over the handling of the pullout, as well as the epic failures of US military and political intelligence \- which badly underestimated the speed of the Taliban advance and the former Afghan government\' s collapse \- put the White House onto the defensive. This event appeared to mark an unexpected turning point in the tone of China-US relations. Partly this was because of the setback to US prestige that the scrambled retreat symbolised; but also because of the messages sent to both sides of the Taiwan Strait in respect to Washington\' s long term reliability as a protector ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2021/08/ambassadors-recalled/ see WiC552 ). In the dynamic of Big Power politics, China\' s hand seemed no weaker after the fall of Kabul \- and possibly stronger \- while the US emerged more chastened According to Chinese media reports, Biden took the initiative to call Xi in September, the second time he\' d done so since phoning his Chinese counterpart on the eve of the Chinese New Year in February (when Xi also congratulated Biden on taking office). During September\' s hour-long dialogue, Biden stressed that his administration was prepared to have  constructive discussions to identify priority areas where cooperation was possible, and get bilateral relations back on track. At the same time diplomatic interactions picked up too. Qin Gang was named China\' s new ambassador to the US in late July. Last month Biden nominated Nicholas Burns as the US ambassador to China after that key post was left vacant for nearly a year (prior to that Chinese media had suggested that the vacancy was akin to an ambassadorial recall). Trade talks between the two sides have also resumed and there were even reports that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was weighing up a trip to China. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi again in Zurich last month. Following a six-hour meeting, news soon surfaced that both sides had agreed on a leaders\' summit that would take place before year-end. Which side wanted a face-to-face summit more? For instance, according to a recent report by the Americans for Financial Reform, financial service firms and trade associations spent a record $2.9 billion on political donations and lobbying in the 2019-2020 election cycle, with the sector donating 2.5 times more to Biden than Trump. This group of Biden\' s backers has immense business interests in the Chinese financial market, which Beijing has promised to open up for more foreign investment. Biden also has the midterm elections to worry about. His Democratic Party has just suffered a shock loss in the governor\' s race in Virginia. The US president\' s approval ratings also dipped into the mid-to-low 40s as inflation raced to its highest level in 30 years. According to a research report by China Everbright Securities published earlier this month, Biden was under pressure to bring back something positive from the bargaining table with China to enhance the Democrats\' election prospects. On the other hand, China has also entered a sensitive political period as the ruling Party is set to hold its 20th National Party Congress, a five-yearly gathering, in the second half of 2022 to pick a new generation of Beijing leaders. Nevertheless if the general view held by China observers is accurate, Xi\' s path to a potentially indefinite extension of his leadership role was secured after the Party\' s Central Committee passed a resolution last week enshrining him as a historically vital figure to the achievements of the CPC (Communist Party of China) over its 100-year history ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2021/09/the-big-event/ see WiC555 ). Reportedly Washington was angling for a Biden-Xi summit either at the G20 meeting in Rome in late October or, in an even better scenario, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow earlier this month. But Xi has not travelled abroad since a state visit to Myanmar in January 2020. Covid-19 offers a reason for Xi\' s lack of diplomatic jetsetting although there are also suggestions that the Chinese leader wants to stay close to Beijing\' s power centre during a politically sensitive time. Apparently a compromise was brokered at the end of Sullivan and Yang\' s meeting, with Xi agreeing to connect with Biden in cyberspace. This kept intact a tradition that leaders from the two countries would meet each other within 12 months of a US president taking office. Has Washington made any concessions to make the summit happen? This is the first ever virtual summit between the leaders of the two countries. Unlike Xi\' s first meetings with Obama and Trump, when he took the initiative to push for visits to his American counterparts, this time it is Biden who seems to have taken the extra steps to make a summit happen. The video conference started at 8:46am Beijing time and when it concluded after 3.5 hours, Washington was approaching midnight.  The meeting was arranged at the start of the day for us [China], wrote Niaodanqin, a WeChat blogger affiliated with Xinhua.  The US side obviously needed to work until midnight. So you could tell if the US was proactive or reactive in arranging the meeting. Looking back at those Chinese \' wish lists\' relayed to Sherman back in July in Tianjin, diplomacy-focused bloggers such as Niaodanqin also pointed out that Washington had actually met some of Beijing\' s demands. In September Huawei\' s CFO Meng was released and allowed to return to China following almost three years of house arrest in Vancouver. Reportedly Washington has already removed some visa restrictions on Chinese students applying to American universities as well. The US government also reported this week there was progress in talks with Chinese authorities on improving working conditions and access for journalists working on each other\' s soil. And in early October, the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) announced it plans to lift tariffs on 549 types of Chinese imports including industrial components, thermostats and medical supplies. Last month Reuters reported that Huawei and SMIC have continued to receive billions of dollars worth of licences from the Biden administration to buy US tech parts and services despite their being on various blacklists. Yet perhaps the biggest US concession is one that appears to echo China\' s \' three bottom lines that Foreign Minister Wang trumpeted in Tianjin, i.e. any attempts to subvert China\' s  system . In an interview with CNN days before the virtual summit, Jake Sullivan said one of the errors of previous administrations had been a view that the US could achieve a fundamental transformation of the Chinese  system . That\' s not Washington\' s objective now. Instead, the goal of current policy is to create circumstances in which the two major powers are going to co-exist in an international system for the foreseeable future, he explained. So what was discussed at the virtual meeting?  We were not expecting a breakthrough. There were none to report, a senior official told reporters in a White House briefing after the meeting. In the first 10 minutes of the meeting Biden told Xi he saw their responsibility as leaders to ensure that the competition between the two countries did not veer into conflict. Biden also emphasised the need to establish some  common sense guardrails so that both sides were clear where they disagree and to facilitate a working relationship in areas where interests intersect. Meanwhile, Xi, according to Xinhua, insisted that China-US relations should be defined by principles such as mutual respect, co-existence and win-win cooperation (no surprise here: this is the \' diplomatic holy trinity\' of Chinese phraseology). Whether it is setting out rules for competition or installing guardrails for a relationship, the Chinese side argued for consultation on an equal footing, rather than one side imposing conditions on the other. In other words, this was a further push for acknowledgement of a new \' G2\' encompassing the two superpowers (the drive for this began under Xi\' s predecessor Hu Jintao but till now was disdained by the US State Department). It came as a further elaboration after Yang\' s outburst in Alaska when he rebuked his American counterparts that they were not qualified to speak to China from a  position of strength . It also echoed with the so-called pingshi diplomacy that has been gaining traction. The buzzword was inspired by Xi\' s remark ahead of the Alaska meeting that China\' s younger generation \- unlike his own \- could now  view the world on level terms (aka pingshi, which can also serve as a pun on Xi\' s name). That\' s why CNN described the exchange as a  significant breakthrough for Beijing. What could China offer Biden in return? According to Hong Kong\' s Singtao Daily, Beijing also made a number of concessions ahead of the meeting. The National People\' s Congress was about to enact an anti-sanction law in Hong Kong in August \- that many US businesses feared \- although that plan was shelved indefinitely without much explanation. If Biden\' s administration had in fact made a number of concessions to make a summit happen, it didn\' t want to spend 3.5 late-night hours in idle glad-handing \- it had a bargaining agenda of its own. One item on that list could be China\' s continued buying of US treasuries, some speculated. China remains the second largest foreign holder of US bonds after Japan, although US government data showed that its holding had dropped to $1.05 trillion in August, the lowest level since 2010. Since the 2008 global credit crisis the Chinese authorities have been increasingly sceptical about investing in US sovereign bonds. Yet one group of items China is likely to purchase in more abundance are US commodities. The Phase One trade deal Beijing agreed with Trump\' s administration in early 2020 also called for China to boost purchases of US exports by $200 billion by the end of this year. According to Washington the Chinese side has lagged far behind in meeting this target (Beijing blames the pandemic for this). The Chinese to be making efforts to catch up on the schedule. In a significant but less publicised deal announced just days before the summit, China signed off a 20-year contract to buy four million tonnes annually of liquefied natural gas from the US. Then, of course, after joining hands with the US in delivering a last-minute, unexpected deal at the climate conference in Glasgow this month, China has also positioned itself as one of the two nations which will have an influential say in deciding the world\' s future energy mix. As such, it\' s not too surprising that news emerged that Biden and Xi this week discussed the merits of releasing oil from their strategic reserves to ensure stability in global energy markets. In doing so, China might be offering another concession to Biden \- helping to hold down US petrol pump prices which have contributed to the surging inflation rate that is threatening to undermine the US president\' s popularity at home. Thanks to rising consumer prices and port logjams, the Global Times reported this month that American families are set to  greet the most expensive Christmas in recent memory. Somewhat unexpectedly US banks and business groups have even lobbied Washington to lift tariffs on Chinese goods as a way to curb runaway inflation. According to Xinhua, the topic of keeping global industrial supply chains stable was discussed at the summit, although both sides have offered little detail on the outcome. Biden has promised more details in the next two weeks, as he told reporters that both sides have set up working groups on a  whole range of issues (reportedly one of those is about curbing nuclear weapons, which China has been accumulating at a rapid clip that has unnerved US generals in recent months). What about Taiwan? The mainland Chinese press claimed after the meeting that very little oxygen had been wasted on discussing Taiwan. That\' s because Beijing had insisted in advance that the status of the island is one of its \' bottom lines\' , which it regards as non-negotiable. CNN, on the other hand, said the issue had consumed  the most time of any during the summit. Xi had warned his counterpart of  playing with fire over Taiwan and that China would be compelled to take  resolute measures should forces for Taiwan independence  cross the red line . According to Xinhua\' s account, Biden reaffirmed the US government\' s long-standing One-China Policy, while also stating that the US does not support Taiwanese independence. CNN reported Biden as qualifying this with the caveat that he is also against a change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. It will be interesting to see if Taiwan\' s leader Tsai Ing-wen is now invited to the \' Leaders\' Summit for Democracy\' that Biden is arranging for the end of this year. That would be provocative \- but many now take comfort that a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait is less likely in the near future within the  guard rails that were this week shaped by the Xi-Biden virtual meeting. \"

Years in the making, the sobering report approved by 195 nations shines a harsh spotlight on governments dithering\~in the face of mounting evidence that climate change is an existential threat. Nature itself has underscored their negligence. With only 1.1C of warming so far, an unbroken cascade of deadly, unprecedented weather disasters bulked up by climate change has swept the world this summer, from asphalt-melting heatwaves in Canada to rainstorms turning city streets in China and Germany into rivers to untameable wildfires sweeping Greece and California.\~  This report is a reality check, said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, who co-led hundreds of scientists in reviewing a mountain of published climate science.  It has been clear for decades that the Earth\' s climate is changing, and the role of human influence on the climate system is undisputed. Indeed, all but a tiny fraction of warming so far is  unequivocally caused by human activities, the IPCC concluded for the first time in its three-decade history. The world must brace itself for worse \- potentially much worse \- to come, the report made clear. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/US-drought.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1 Link to Image Invisible threshold Even if the 1.5C target humanity is now poised to overshoot is miraculously achieved, it would still generate heatwaves, rainfall, drought and other extreme weather  unprecedented in the observational record, it concluded. At slightly higher levels of global heating, what is today once-a-century coastal flooding will happen every year by 2100, fuelled by storms gorged with extra moisture and rising seas.  This report should send a shiver down the spine of everyone who reads it, said Dave Reay, director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute at the University of Edinburgh, who was not among the authors.\~ Another looming danger is  tipping points, invisible thresholds \- triggered by rising temperatures \- for irreversible changes in Earth\' s climate system. \~ Disintegrating ice sheets holding enough water to raise seas a dozen metres; the melting of permafrost laden with double the carbon in the atmosphere; the transition of the Amazon from tropical forest to savannah \- these potential catastrophes  cannot be ruled out, the report cautions.  An important reason for taking urgent action on emissions is to decrease the chances that one or more of these world-changing events will be triggered over the 21st century, said Andrew Watson, Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Exeter. Our natural allies in the fight against climate change, meanwhile, are suffering battle fatigue. Since about 1960, forests, soil and oceans have steadily absorbed 56% of all the CO2 humanity has chucked into the atmosphere \- even as those emissions have increased by half.

The report offers a sliver of hope for keeping the 1.5C goal alive. The IPCC projected the increase in global surface temperature for five emissions scenarios \- ranging from wildly optimistic to outright reckless \- and identifies best estimates for 20-year periods with mid-points of 2030, 2050 and 2090.\~ By mid-century, the 1.5C threshold will be breached across the board \- by a 10th of a degree along the most ambitious pathway, and by nearly a full degree at the opposite extreme.\~ But under the most optimistic storyline, the Earth\' s surface will have cooled a notch to 1.4C by century\' s end.\~ The other long-term trajectories, however, do not look promising. Temperature increases by 2090 range from a hugely challenging 1.8C to a catastrophic 4.4C. The report\' s authors were at pains to emphasize that the 1.5C goal is not all-or-nothing.

Every tonne of CO2 matters. Part 2 of the IPCC assessment \- on impacts \- is slated for publication in February. Part 3, to be released in March, focuses on ways to reduce carbon in the atmosphere.\~ The focus now will shift to the political arena, where a non-stop series of ministerial and summit meetings, including a critical G20 in October, will lead up to the COP26 UN climate conference in Glasgow, hosted by Britain.

He is the AIIB\' s inaugural chief economist. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Erik-Berglof.jpeg?resize=200%2C242&ssl=1 Link to Image Prior to joining the AIIB in September 2020, Berglof (left) was director of the Institute of Global Affairs, London School of Economics, and chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 2006 to 2015, where he was part of creating and co-led the Vienna Initiative, a European crisis response team credited with mitigating the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis. He is an expert in transition economics and institutional transformation through private-sector development. He holds a PhD in financial economics and a Master of Arts in business and economics, both from the Stockholm School of Economics. Excerpts of an interview with Berglof, a Swedish national, follow. Adriel Kasonta: The Covid-19 pandemic has been with us for nearly two years and has managed to affect every sphere of our lives. This certainly also applies to the global economy. Can we argue that global value chains (GVCs) have not been spared by the pandemic impact either? Erik Berglof: Obviously, when much of the Chinese economy was in lockdown, the GVCs located there were affected, but what was remarkable was how quickly they rebounded as the lockdown was lifted. The current challenges have more come from the fact that economies open up at different times and to different extents. The resulting disruptions and dislocations have been amplified by the massive demand stimulus and the unwinding of savings. Most of this should be temporary, but the individual issues add up and extend over time so some of the impact could become more permanent. AK: Was the pandemic the primary reason behind publication of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank\' s recent report titled  Sustaining Global Value Chains ? Can you tell our readers a bit more about the publication? EB: The World Bank published a very rich report on GVCs in 2019 showing how important they had become for the global economy, but also pointing out that they seemed to have leveled out in importance since the global financial crisis. We wanted to see what we could learn about these arrangements from the pandemic, but also understand better their impact on economies in Asia. One thing that strikes you immediately when you look at the location of GVC activity is that their relative importance has shifted from advanced to emerging and developing economies. It is not only about China, but many other economies in the emerging world have made use of the GVCs to join global production. The fact that a country can enter a value chain with just a component, and not necessarily by producing a whole car or bicycle, has provided an important lever for a more inclusive world economy. AK: It is fair to say that the 2008 global financial crisis impacted the rules of the game concerning the global economy in a significant way, providing emerging and developing economies with more opportunities to participate? In what way, if any, does this relate to GVCs? What is the interplay between emerging and developing economies and GVCs? EB: I\' m not sure that we understand the causal links, but it is true that the relative importance of advanced and emerging [economies] in the GVCs started shifting around the global financial crisis. My own sense is that the shift was more driven by changes in information technology and related logistics, but emerging economies were less affected by the global financial crisis and perhaps this helped them get a foothold in some value chains, and they have built from there. What is clear is that the perspective has changed in many emerging economies. The  truths about how to build and run economies that come out of advanced economies are no longer accepted in the same unreflective way. AK: What are your thoughts about the current geopolitical environment? Is it favorable for emerging\~and\~developing\~economies or somehow limiting their attempts to eradicate poverty and achieve prosperity comparable to that already visible in the developing world? EB: There are several worrying aspects of the current geopolitical environment. The most immediate issue is the global vaccine situation. Most emerging and developing economies with much lower levels of immunization are facing new waves of potentially more transmissible and more deadly variants of the [Covid-19] virus. This fundamental failure of global governance is feeding a mistrust in the emerging world of core institutions and new ideas for how to provide and finance global public goods. Add to that tensions between US and China, between Russia and the rest of Europe and within geographical blocs and you have an unhelpful mix of geopolitics and geo-economics, likely to affect emerging and developing economies the most. AK: What should be done to improve supply-chain resilience in the post-pandemic period without\~deepening\~existing\~trade and geopolitical fault lines? EB: Many companies are considering changing suppliers, operating with multiple suppliers, and perhaps building larger buffers, but it is too early to say where they will come out. Having multiple suppliers and larger buffers is costly and the efficiency pressures that gave rise to the GVCs are still there. Shifting suppliers is also associated with increased costs. GVCs depend a great deal on personal relationships and trust built over many years. My hope is that these relationships and the economic values associated with them will help bridge trade and geopolitical fault lines or at least prevent them from opening up even more. AK: What are the main challenges to GVCs in the short and long terms? EB: We argue that most of the challenges mentioned so far are dwarfed by the pressures on the lead GVC firms to decarbonize along the entire value chain. Many companies have already made far-reaching commitments, and others are coming under increasing pressure to do so. While this is a challenge for the GVCs, it is also an opportunity in the fight against climate change. AK: What is the recipe for successful decarbonization of production and transportation along GVCs? EB: The combined incentives for GVC firms and potential host countries create a virtuous circle of decarbonization. A multilateral development bank like the AIIB can help translate this into high-quality infrastructure projects.\~ AK: How can GVCs help us reach the 2015 Paris Agreement\' s goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and ultimately save our planet and human species from extinction? EB: The GVCs offer an additional tool to achieve decarbonization across countries and sectors. So far, we have mostly relied on peer pressure through the Paris Agreement and now most recently COP26 . The GVCs offer a valuable complement and an opportunity to channel peer pressures into concrete action. AK: What is the role of multilateral development banks like the AIIB in achieving this goal? EB: They can work with individual companies identifying decarbonization opportunities and with governments to develop ideas for infrastructure investments and ensure that these projects meet international standards and make use of the best possible technologies.\~ \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong79","Korea\u8217 s bullet trains speeding toward a greener future","November 4, 2021 Thursday 10:43 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","SEOUL \- Zipping smoothly through landscapes at over 300 kilometers per hour, South Korea\' s KTX bullet trains are racing toward greener horizons as the country, a slow mover and latecomer in clean and renewable energies, accelerates toward carbon neutrality by 2050. The clean-and-green strategy of national rail operator KORAIL extends well beyond a switch from diesel fuel to electricity and hydrogen to power its trains. A larger part of the plan is a  modal shift to expand the use of the rail net, thereby taking cars and trucks off the roads. And as pressure increases internationally and locally to go green, KORAIL is doubling down. It has also unveiled plans to sheath its properties nationwide in a shimmering armor of solar panels \- to the point where the rail operator will generate as much energy as that produced by a standard, dedicated power plant. Noting that Korea is enhancing its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, President Moon Jae-in, HYPERLINK https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2021/11/02/national/environment/COP26-Moon-Jaein-climate-change/20211102154524400.html in an address at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or HYPERLINK COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland, this week, But he admitted it will not be easy. The objective presents,  a Herculean task that demands steep emission cuts over a very short time horizon, Moon said. Korea ratified its 2050 net-zero commitment into law in September. But the country is a slow-comer to renewables, and as home to a power-hungry heavy industrial sector, is a massive emitter. According to presentations delivered at the Jeongseong ESG forum in September this year, South Korea is currently the world\' s seventh-largest emitter of CO2; its per capita emissions are the fourth highest on earth. That puts its emissions profile ahead of its overall economic size. It is a G10 economy. And that is not all. Though South Korea is the global number eight in terms of energy usage, the percentage of renewables in its national energy mix is only 4% \- putting it in 37 th place among 38 countries studied HYPERLINK in a 2021 report,  Powering the World, by Utility Bidder. These dire metrics, and the need to improve them, are putting the civil service under pressure and it is hustling to keep up. Korea has already made major strides in LNG \- a relatively clean power source, but still a fossil fuel. Government officials told Asia Times that while phased plans for cleaner operations have long been on the drawing board, there has been an accelerated policy focus over the last two years on two specific solutions: Hydrogen (as the clean fuel of choice) and solar power (as the renewable energy of choice). \~ HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KTX-2.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1 Link to Image Fast trains, clean trains  Diesel trains which emit a large amount of greenhouse gases will be replaced with electric-hydrogen powered trains by 2050, Yun Sang-won, a director at the Rail Policy Division of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, or MOLIT, told foreign reporters this week. Most of that will happen well before 2050. Only in those areas of track where electrification is not available will around 40 diesel cars continue to run after 2030. South Korea, along with Japan, is investing heavily in hydrogen. The clean fuel is being adopted both for its generative capacity, and also for hydrogen fuel cells to power ships, trains and cars. But the bigger part of KORAIL\' s plan is less clean fuels, more expanding rail use \- a format of terrestrial travel that is environmentally friendlier than road-going vehicles. Thanks to budgeted investments in high-speed, regular and metropolitan rail lines, the  modal share of the rail system will rise from 11.5% of current land transport to 17% by 2030, Yun noted. Even so, it will not quite be a perfect system for freight delivery, admits Kim Do-han, a director at MOLIT\' s Rail Operation Division.  The merit of road is that it is point-to-point, he said. When it comes to  last-mile delivery of, say, exports, from rail carriage to an aircraft or ship, there are, a present, no rail lines direct to ports. So,  we\' re thinking of connections, Kim said. That niggle aside, the modeled expectation is that rail-transported freight will rise from 26 million tonnes in 2020 to 80 million tonnes in 2050, while reducing 3.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in the process, according to Yun\' s presentation. The shift from road to rail is environmentally significant even on a personal basis, reporters were told. According to KORAIL director Cha Chae-hwan, a passenger aboard the latest bullet train, the electric-powered KTX Eum, emits 16 grams of carbon per kilometer. Compare that with a car passenger, who emits 95 grams over the same distance, Cha said. The  low-carbon, eco-friendly KTX Eum, which started running on two lines this year, can embark 381 passengers per trip. Beyond trains per se, KORAIL is expanding into energy capture. In May, KORAIL, MOLIT and Seoul Metropolitan City signed memoranda of understanding and initiated a task force on grand-scale solar power distribution. KORAIL has vast acreage on which photovoltaic cells can be placed: The roofs of depots, marshaling yards, stations, track sides, tops of tunnels \- even train carriages and windows. In a three-phase project, to be completed by 2050, enough panels will be deployed by KORAIL facilities nationwide to generate a total of 456 megawatts of energy. By comparison, a typical Korean power plant generates around 400MW. Alas, solar is not \- at least not with present technologies \- suitable to power trains, Kim said. Still, it could be used as a power source for KORAIL\' s own facilities, thereby assisting the overall national renewable energy project. Tactically, it all looks good. But there are bigger strategic questions hanging over Korea\' s energy mix, power generation and stated emission targets. While Yun, Cha and Lim come up with workable downstream solutions, solutions for upstream \- the power generating sector \- is above their pay grade. Indeed, the future of the Korean energy mix is now in the hands of the next president, who will be elected in March 2022. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KTX-3.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1 Link to Image Decarbonizing power generation As a manufacturing-led economy, South Korea must satisfy the massive appetites that its world-class semiconductor, auto, ship, petrochemical and steel sectors generate. This swath of heavy industry cannot rely on renewables, which cannot guarantee or store stable, non-oscillating power. And the national grid at present is far from green. Generating the requisite amounts of clean, stable electricity to power up the national infrastructure \- including KORAIL\' s trains \- and its industry presents a major conundrum. This is particularly the case as the anti-nuclear Moon government has been forced to burn coal to take up the slack from a lessened share of atomic in the national energy mix.  Our coal dependency is very high, nuclear is politically polarized and though we can install huge capacity in renewables, this does not guarantee stable supply, Lim said. Lim conceded that the government\' s carbon neutrality targets are  aggressive. But, she added,  In terms of feasibility, there is a lot of skepticism about the goals. \"

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong81","The lure of 1.4 billion buyers","November 12, 2021 5:31 AM GMT","Week in China","Has life ever been tougher for international firms wanting to do business in China? Travel bans and lengthy quarantines designed to quell Covid infection rates have curbed flows of goods and people. Delay and disruption to supply chains, especially in container shipping, have created bottlenecks for trade flows. Simmering tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade tariffs and technology exports aren\' t helping much either. In this kind of context, companies could be forgiven for pressing pause on their strategies for the Chinese market. But that\' s not what they are doing, according to the latest instalment of HSBC\' s Navigator report, which was released earlier this week. The Navigator series offers an inside track into what business decisionmakers around the world are feeling and planning. This year\' s \' Succeeding in China 2021\' chapter asked a representative group of foreign firms for their views on doing business in the Chinese market. Despite the backdrop of gloomy headlines, the outlook from the companies was much more positive.  Contrary to some media reporting, our findings indicate deepening confidence and further investment in China among international firms, was the conclusion of the study\' s authors. The survey polled 2,174 companies across 10 major economies in September, suggesting that nearly nine in 10 respondents were anticipating an increase in their sales or exports to China in the next 12 months. Around 87% of the firms in the study expected an improvement in sales in the year ahead, with 63% predicting organic growth of more than a fifth in their revenues. More than half of the sample said there were plans for M&A activity in China in the same period, with six in 10 respondents expecting to expand their supply chains as well. Some of that sentiment is buoyed by hopes of better commercial conditions as the pandemic subsides further. But one in three respondents identified the strength of China\' s economic prospects as driving their decision to do more business there, alongside similar percentages that cited the scalability of the Chinese marketplace and the efficiency of its supply chains as compelling reasons to invest further. The Navigator findings came out in the same week as the latest data on Chinese exports, which rose faster than expected in October, increasing over 27% from a year ago. Imports grew at a slower pace over the period, creating a record trade surplus for the month, despite continuing disruption across the global supply chain. Sales activity from foreign firms inside China is one of the primary focuses in the Navigator survey. And this year\' s study also coincides with the latest iteration of the China International Import Expo (CIIE), which was held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. Now in its fourth year, the CIIE is a relative newcomer on the circuit, joining the better-known Canton Fair, which has been running in Guangzhou since 1957 with more of a focus on Chinese exports. The Shanghai-based expo is a different beast in offering a platform for firms to sell their goods into the Chinese market, and its organisers have been keen to send the message that China is open for business this year, with nearly 3,000 foreign companies participating at this year\' s gathering. Covid-related travel restrictions saw much of the action move online, although large numbers of local visitors did come in person. Coverage of the expo in the local media has been heavy with subtext, with headlines about the increase in floor space for American exhibitors and the loud welcome for newcomers like Amazon, which made its debut in showcasing some of the goods it sells from overseas producers. Also on display were signs of Beijing\' s policy priorities, including a newly designated zone for companies in the integrated circuit (IC) sector, an industry where the government wants local firms to develop homegrown expertise in chipmaking. Cross-border trading in semiconductors has been complicated by export restrictions on American parts and equipment but most of the leading foreign suppliers were active at the CIIE, with companies like Qualcomm, Intel and ASML displaying their products. Chinese spending on IC imports topped $350 billion last year, or double the amount it spent on oil, the Global Times added. Another hotspot was the energy sector, following a crunch in the electricity supply that has hobbled China\' s industrial sector for much of the last two months. The energy shortfalls were set to spark a reaction in deals struck at the expo, a senior official from state asset manager Sasac predicted before the event, with as many as 50 state firms lining up to sign contracts with international vendors. Contracts for oil, natural gas and coal were forecast to increase 22% in value on last year\' s expo, he added, while deals for other energy sources such as LNG would double too. Another of the trends highlighted in the Navigator report is the hundreds of millions of digitally savvy consumers at the forefront of the domestic marketplace. Indeed, there was more sign of the rapidly expanding digital economy at the CIIE, where livestreaming e-commerce was a feature at many of the booths in offering product discounts and answering questions for online viewers. Li Jiaqi and Viya \- two of China\' s top livestreamers ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2021/10/team-of-rivals/ see WiC561 ) \- also made an appearance at the expo after being enlisted for special sales sessions with state media outlets to promote imports from a group of 20 countries. The Navigator study looks at livestreaming in the broader context, with nearly half of the executives in the survey citing the growth in e-commerce and video e-commerce as significant changes in consumer behaviour after the pandemic. While overall spending by Chinese consumers fell 3.9% year-on-year in 2020, online sales grew 14.8% in the same period, the report noted. International firms that fail to respond to these trends are losing ground commercially and the survey signalled something similar in the surge in digital payments, where total transaction value increased by an impressive 24.5% in 2020. This advance towards a cashless economy is only going to accelerate as the central bank puts the newly developed digital yuan through its final stages of testing, ahead of a wider launch next year. Another section of the Navigator research looks at the investment outlook for foreign firms in China. Again the predictions are bullish with 61% of respondents saying they will invest more than a tenth of their operating profits into the Chinese market next year. Many are promising to invest much more than that, including the one in four of the American firms that say they will be dispatching a quarter of operating profits to China, trailing only Mexico and the UAE in similar intention. These kinds of commitments are underpinned by some of the other findings in the study, especially that China continues to score significantly better than any of its regional rivals as a choice of manufacturing base for foreign investors.  Though recent years have seen a developing perception that manufacturing firms are leaving China in favour of lower-cost markets such as India and Vietnam, we find our respondents to be firmly in favour of China, the report says. What also comes through strongly is the momentum around investment priorities like technological innovation, an area where 73% of respondents now believe the Chinese to be more advanced than their home market (this group includes firms from high-tech nations like Germany and the United States, the report notes). Revelations like these are putting the onus on company executives to invest more in their own capabilities in disciplines like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, which are identified as key areas of interest in China. Sustainability is another major area for investor attention. President Xi Jinping and his colleagues in the Chinese government came in for criticism last week for failing to do more at COP26 to counter climate change (see WiC562). But the massive majority of the firms in the Navigator survey have taken note of China\' s commitments to low-carbon transition, with 86% of the businesses seeing Beijing\' s carbon reduction pledges as bringing new chances to profit. Companies polled clearly see China as a pacesetter in green technology as well, citing renewable energy (39% of respondents), electric vehicles (38%) and energy-efficient products (35%) as the biggest opportunities. \"

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong83","Biden\u8217 s foreign policy undercut by domestic weakness","November 6, 2021 Saturday 4:23 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","So far no American ally has felt a need to react to the election debacles President Joe Biden suffered this week, notably in the state of Virginia, which his party controlled but then lost, and also in lesser votes elsewhere across the country. Usually, there is no reason for, say, a German leader, to comment on a vote in a middle-sized American state. But in this case, cables sent out from foreign allies\' embassies in Washington will likely need to grapple with this question: Is Biden already so wounded that, in just over three years, he\' ll be replaced in 2024 elections and have his foreign policy initiatives overturned by a nationalistic populist in the image of Donald Trump or even by Trump himself? His ratings in political surveys are as bad as Trump\' s at their worst. Voters have begun to wonder if, with the spectacle of Biden\' s occasional incoherent babbling, he is up to the job of the presidency. If a president believes he can\' t get consent for a treaty from two-thirds of the US Senate, as constitutionally required, he forges ahead anyway and calls it something else. For example, the Paris climate accord signed with dozens of other countries in 2015, was not labeled a treaty but an  executive agreement, binding only President Barack Obama\' s administration, wrote Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former diplomat who runs New America, a Washington think tank. The same was true of Obama\' s complex deal with Iran to curb its nuclear weapons program, known as the JCPOA. He called it a  non-binding agreement that committed the US to lift sanctions on Iran if Tehran complied with a series on non-proliferation measures.  They can call it a banana, but it\' s a treaty, the late Senator John McCain complained at the time. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/G7-Summit-June-13-2021.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image The weakness of each maneuver was evident when Trump took power after Obama. Because neither the Paris agreement nor the Iran deal was ratified in the Senate, Trump simply overturned each with the stroke of a pen. This year, Biden has quickly reinstated Paris and wants to return to the Iran agreement. But what will happen after 2024? America\' s whiplash foreign policy presents uncertainty among US allies.  Pervasive gridlock, polarization and distrust that characterize our national politics will give foreign leaders some pause before entering into long-term, costly agreements with us, predicted William Howell, a University of Chicago political scientist.  I think there is a real sort of underlying concern that America\' s return may be temporary, Max Bergmann, a fellow at the leftist Center for American Progress and specialist in relations with Europe.  Europeans are a little bit wary of following the lead of the United States. Biden insisted his election last year represented a clear return to US leadership in world affairs. At G-7 and NATO summits last summer, he announced boasted, really\- that  America is back. Allies understood that he meant that the mercuric Trump and his  America First attitudes had been pushed offstage. They publicly welcomed Biden with satisfaction. But Western joy was tempered by an underlying fear that some version of Trump\' s nationalistic populism,\~ an ideology with a two-century history in the US, might in fact live on, analysts said.  After Biden, it may be Trump again, commented Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador to the United States.  We Europeans, we have to learn to be grown up, we have to learn to defend or to handle our interests by ourselves. Virginia\' s election did not turn on foreign affairs but nonetheless showed American populism is alive and well. The defeat of the state\' s governor, deputy governor and attorney general were largely built on dissatisfaction among parents with school bureaucrats\' disdain for complaints about frameworks for teaching racial history and on efforts to give transgender students access to traditionally girl or boy bathrooms. Nonetheless, by equating political control at home with an ability to lead the Free World, Biden set himself up for embarrassment. Since taking office, he insisted the US must show the world democracy can work. On the eve of his trip to Europe last week, for a G20 summit and COP26 climate conference, Biden cajoled his own Democratic Party legislators in Congress to approve US$550 billion worth of programs to fight climate change.  The rest of the world wonders whether we can function, he warned. HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/000_VD9NM.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image His chief Congressional ally, House leader Nancy Pelosi, said legislators must pass the spending measure so Biden wouldn\' t be embarrassed when he got off his plane in Europe. But the legislators failed to endorse the package and Biden left Washington empty-handed. US allies abroad had already been flummoxed by a series of Biden foreign policy missteps that made them wonder about his competence. NATO partners criticized Biden for the chaotic and incomplete evacuation of Americans, other foreigners and Afghan collaborators as Kabul fell to the Taliban. He enraged France, America\' s oldest ally, by quietly arranging a new anti-Chinese alliance with Britain and Australia, which denied Paris of a $100 billion submarine deal with Canberra. The secretive partnership also seemed a snub at continental Europe\' s importance as a strategic partner.  This brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision reminds me a lot of what Mr Trump used to do. I am angry and bitter. This isn\' t done between allies, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. Since January, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have crossed the US southern border unhindered. Biden appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to solve the problem. She traveled to Central America for talks about the flow, returned to declare the trip was a success  in terms of a pathway that is about progress and didn\' t take up the issue again. The migrants keep coming to the majority dismay of Americans. In the Washington Post, a conservative Biden critic traced the beginnings of the president\' s electoral problems in the US to the botched Afghan withdrawal.  After his Afghanistan debacle, the floor fell out from under the president, the critic opined. On the other side of the globe, it\' s unclear whether China worries about Biden\' s image problems at home. China is convinced the US is inexorably hostile, no matter who is president; US military leaders have labeled China a  pacing threat, Pentagon language meaning it is on the military rise. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/000_Was6225772.jpg?resize=780%2C501&ssl=1 Link to Image Bipartisan American criticism of China\' s human rights record, US naval cruises through the contested South China Sea, which China considers its own, and support for democratic Taiwan\' s separate status from China all convince Beijing the US won\' t change course whoever might be elected in 2024. A weakened US administration will likely embolden China to maintain, or even increase, pressure on Taiwan to negotiate about uniting with the mainland\- though it appears Beijing hardly needs much encouragement. To counter this, Biden hopes to renew dormant alliances in the Far East and add India to the mix. But potential partners will likely think twice about joining an anti-China coalition with a perpetually wavering and increasingly weak American administration. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong84","Wind in its sails","October 15, 2021 5:58 AM GMT","Week in China","Covid-19 has made international travel much more complicated. Crossing borders is still a struggle. There are a jumble of pandemic-based rules and restrictions \- many of which seem to change on a regular basis. But Zhang Lei, the founder of Envision Group, has carried on travelling through the summer. The 44 year-old was seen rubbing shoulders with French President Emmanuel Macron in Douai, an industrial town in northern France, at the end of June, for instance. Four days later, he was spotted alongside British leader Boris Johnson on a tour of an electric vehicle assembly plant in Sunderland in northern England. His accompanying of the two political heavyweights highlights Envision\' s growing influence in the electric vehicle sector. In Douai, Envision is building a low-carbon electric vehicle (EV) battery facility with annual production capacity of 9 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2024, before scaling that up to 24 GWh by the end of the decade. This \€ 2 billion ($2.4 billion) investment is also a key plank in French carmaker Renault\' s plan to establish Europe\' s largest EV production cluster, making 400,000 new energy vehicles a year. In Sunderland, once a world leader in shipbuilding, Envision will build Britain\' s first gigafactory next to the carmaking base where Nissan (a long-term partner of Renault) has been making vehicles since 1986. The plan is for the factory to be powered by a microgrid generating up to 132 MW of renewable energy from Nissan\' s wind and solar farms. It will also feature an on-site energy storage system with repurposed batteries. It will likewise have a first-phase capacity of 9 GWh (and ultimately 35 GWh). The Sunderland project is part of a \£31 billion ($1.4 billion) EV36Zero initiative that the British government will help to finance. At a time of heightened sensitivity about Chinese infrastructure investment in Europe, Envision\' s inking of two deals of national significance is an achievement. Its \' energy storage\' role in both is also notable \- given it is a lesser known player in the EV battery space, a field that has been dominated by its Chinese peers like CATL and BYD ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2021/04/hoarding-reserves/ see WiC537 ). In fact, it was not until 2018 that the Shanghai-based Envision focused on storage technology by acquiring Automotive Energy Supply Corporation (AESC), the lithium-ion battery unit of Nissan (which has retained a 25% stake in the entity). Envision stepped in when GSR Capital, led by high-profile investor Allen Zhu ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2018/02/market-share-matters/ see WiC396 ), failed to procure sufficient funds for a deal estimated at around $1 billion, reported Nikkei Asia. Founded in 2007, privately-held Envision started out manufacturing wind turbines. From small roots it grew into a major player. For instance, in the three years to 2019, revenues had more than tripled to Rmb23.2 billion ($3.6 billion), piggybacking on favourable policies in the sector including tax breaks for wind power programmes that led to domestic installations. Envision has leapfrogged a number of rivals in the industry. Since 2017 it has consistently ranked as China\' s second largest wind turbine maker by newly installed capacity, closing the gap on market leader Xinjiang Goldwind. Last year its local market share amounted to 17% with 10.1 GW of wind installations, while Goldwind grabbed 21% of the market, data from BloombergNEF showed. In projects overseen by state-owned enterprises, Envision took first place by clinching 24% of the available deals (totalling 5.6 GW in scale), while state-backed Goldwind trailed at 19%, according to 21CN Business Herald, a financial news outlet. A sizable portion of those projects were offshore, meaning that the turbines must be moored to the seabed, presenting a greater technical challenge than installing them on land. Envision prefers to compete at the higher-end of the market, emphasising its product quality and reliability. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Zhang noted that his firm\' s turbines are equipped with sensors to collect data for real-time status reports and subsequent analysis. The technology crucially enables their operators to identify tiny cracks on the blades of the offshore turbines (which are frequently struck by lightning) which helps to prevent future outages. Zhang\' s travels meanwhile reflect that Envision\' s commercial footprint extends far beyond China. Last year it secured the contract to build its second wind farm in France after winning an earlier tender for construction of a 40 MW project in Burgundy in 2019. Located in the Haute-Marne region, the new wind farm has been designed to supply renewable energy to 52,000 people a year. Envision\' s equipment has also been installed in Argentina, Chile, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro and Vietnam. The Global Wind Energy Council estimates that 12,500 of Envision\' s wind turbines are working across the globe, making it the world\' s fourth largest supplier of the technology. Somewhat unusually Envision positioned itself as a multinational company from day one. In the same year that the group was founded 14 years ago, Zhang put Envision\' s global innovation centre in Silkeborg, a Danish town close to the global headquarters of windpower giants Vestas and Siemens. Until two years ago it was led by windpower veteran Anders Rebsdorf, who pulled together a team of hires from firms including IBM and General Electric. For instance, the lab (aided by funding from the EU) devised the world\' s first wind turbine generator with high-temperature superconductors for its drivetrain \- a breakthrough that reduces the overall weight of the nacelle by 25% and reduces reliance on rare earth components that are expensive to source. Zhang lays claim to a fair degree of cultural diversity. After graduating from the London School of Economics he worked as a trading strategist at French oil giant Total, and later as an energy derivatives product manager at Barclays. In 2009 he was tempted back to China through the Thousand Talents Programme, a national scheme that encourages overseas Chinese to come home with generous research and start-up subsidies ( HYPERLINK https://www.weekinchina.com/2009/08/forget-uncle-sam/ see WiC27 ). Born in Jiangsu province to a family which owned manufacturing businesses, Zhang chose to strike out on his own in renewable energy. He decided to look not just at hardware but focus too on the software and networking technologies that help to achieve cost savings in electricity storage and distribution. This vision crystallised in EnOS, a new platform unveiled in 2016. Through real-time computing, machine learning and Big Data analytics, EnOS is designed to guide how renewable energy is produced, transmitted, stored and consumed. To scale up the platform, Envision went on an acquisition spree that saw it purchase Bazefield (the second largest renewable energy management company in Europe), ChargePoint (an operator of a network of independently-owned EV charging stations across North America and Europe), AutoGrid (a Silicon Valley-based Big Data company that predicts demand and supply on electric grid networks), and SonnenBatterie (Europe\' s largest distributed energy storage company, based in Germany). Operated by an Envision subsidiary in Singapore, EnOS currently plays a role in managing more than 200 GW of energy assets globally, counting Hong Kong\' s electricity provider CLP and America\' s Pattern Energy among its customers. Most recently it was contracted by Guohua Energy Investment, the renewable unit of state-owned China Energy, to build a technology system to manage the distribution of 12 GW of wind and photovoltaic energy. It will also form the backbone of the distributed solar energy systems operated by TEESS, a joint venture between Total and Envision in China. Market commentators are expecting deployments of EnOS to grow rapidly in China, given Beijing\' s commitments to carbon neutrality by 2060. Under the plan, renewable energy will have to make up 25% of the nation\' s primary energy supply by 2030, with wind and solar providing 1,200 GW of power. Perhaps somewhat deliberately, visitors to Envision\' s website would have trouble identifying it as a Chinese company. Its marketing agenda is clearly designed with an international twist too. One of the key things it plugs on its website site is its ownership of Formula E team Envision Virgin Racing, which it describes as  the greenest on the grid (the team was certified as carbon neutral last August by the UK\' s Carbon Trust). Envision\' s electric car racing team \- which currently ranks fifth in the Formula E standings with 165 points \- also proclaims on its web page that it is a partner of the UN\' s COP26 summit to be held in Glasgow next month. Envision\' s globalist PR message received a fillip this week when Fortune ranked it second on its Change the World List. Now in its seventh year, the US magazine says the list (whose 2021 edition contains 53 firms) honours  companies that use the tools of capitalism to address society\' s unmet needs . \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong85","Singapore must become the carbon neutralizer for Asia","April 28, 2022 Thursday 4:18 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","Sitting at the intersection where major shipping and aviation routes from East to West converge, Singapore has long held the position of a strategic trading hub. With an extensive network of trade agreements and the title of the world\' s second most globally connected economy, the city-state is a gateway to the Asian market. For surrounding Southeast Asian markets abundant in natural resources, Singapore serves as a key logistics hub for the trade of commodities with the West. Imports of goods from the ASEAN states to those in the European Union saw HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=ASEAN-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics#ASEAN_countries_trade_in_goods_with_main_partners a new all-time high However, trade relations between ASEAN and the EU are likely to be impacted by divergent approaches to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG).\~ When it comes to sustainability, the EU is taking a leading role in enforcing standards. By 2026, a major piece of trade policy is set to shape all future imports entering the bloc: the HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_3661 Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism On the face of it, the CBAM is an ambitious climate measure that has the power to raise the bar for national sustainability initiatives, but it has also HYPERLINK https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/asian-countries-see-eu-carbon-border-levy-as-protectionist-survey/ faced criticism for being  protectionist and discriminatory toward emerging countries. This means that Asian exporters will need to transform their approach to carbon management to stay competitive in the future. As Singapore continues to further its ambition to be a leader in the fields of carbon trading and green finance, how can it capitalize on its existing position as a key trading and logistics hub in the region to become the central provider for trusted, accredited, carbon-neutral trade entering the EU? New rules of engagement Described as having been designed in compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, the CBAM stipulates that EU importers need to pay a tariff in the form of carbon certificates that correspond to the carbon price that would have been paid had these goods been produced within the EU under its carbon pricing rules. Because of the adjustments required, the CBAM will be phased in gradually and will begin by targeting imports that have historically seen a high risk of carbon leakage, such as iron, steel, aluminum and electricity.\~ CBAM will also result in greater reporting requirements for both importers and exporters, which will now be held accountable for documenting their carbon emissions. As it stands, the state of carbon reporting is a very manual process that relies on traditional tools such as Excel, even when HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/09_resource_guide3.pdf reporting emissions to the United Nations . Without uniform standards on how these data are collected and what software is used, human errors and lack of trust in reporting processes could give ground for EU trade officials to claim that carbon emissions have not been  adequately offset in the market(s) where a particular good was produced.\~\~ Singapore as a carbon neutralizer Singapore is already home to HYPERLINK https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/carbon-services-and-climate-finance/ more than 70 organizations The current tax of S$5 (US$3.60) per metric ton of emissions is HYPERLINK https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2022-singapores-carbon-tax-could-increase-to-80-per-tonne-of-emissions-by-2030-in-accelerated-net-zero-emissions-bid set to increase to between S$50 and S$80 per ton according to Singapore\' s HYPERLINK https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/ 2030 Green Plan . This local expertise will place it in good stead as ASEAN producers look for leadership in this space in the run-up to 2026. Thanks to its status as a trading and logistics hub, Singapore is well positioned to help producers in countries across the region to navigate the complexities of trade with the EU as CBAM implementation approaches. However, there is currently little indication that the EU will acknowledge non-EU carbon pricing initiatives. How can Singapore enable Asian businesses and producers to overcome this hurdle? The solution is to spearhead the development of high-integrity carbon measurement and reporting. Singapore can lead the charge by providing services that enable producers to certify their carbon footprint according to standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), such as the global benchmark HYPERLINK https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:14097:ed-1:v1:en ISO 14097:2021 . This accreditation could then be certified by leading European certification firms such as the British Standards Institute (BSI), allowing businesses to establish the credibility of the carbon footprint of these producers. By reducing or negating the carbon emissions involved through emission-reduction efforts such as energy-efficiency products and renewable energy substitution, producers can minimize the tariffs imposed on them once their products enter the EU.\~ Furthermore, Singapore can provide neutralizing services for individual products, providing the seal of approval for import into the EU. Using  voluntary emission reduction credits (VERs), businesses can obtain high-integrity carbon-neutrality certificates, certified according to European standards by Singaporean or European certification firms such as Singapore Test Services and BSI, will help to achieve an international standard of carbon neutrality under HYPERLINK https://www.bsigroup.com/en-SG/PAS-2060-Carbon-Neutrality/ PAS 2060 (soon to be HYPERLINK https://www.iso.org/standard/43279.html ISO 14068 ). These carbon-neutrality certifications would account for the carbon emitted throughout the entire production supply chain, including transshipment through Singapore.\~ By offering and streamlining this process for businesses, Singapore can position itself as the linchpin of the global carbon-trading operations to complement its status as a major logistics and trading hub. This would not only greatly help Asian producers to prepare themselves best and most economically for the CBAM so that their products shipped to the EU can be reliably trusted as carbon neutral, but would also further enhance Singapore as a trade hub in the new era, where the flow of materials, money, and carbon will be more profoundly intertwined.\~ To secure this position, Singapore needs to tackle a significant issue plaguing the VER market: the challenges surrounding Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). As part of the Paris Agreement, all countries \- both developed and developing \- committed to specific emissions-reduction plans based on NDCs. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement established a cross-border system that puts a greater burden on developing nations to achieve their own NDCs while selling carbon credits to developed countries. The Singapore government\' s emphasis on sustainability and a booming tech entrepreneurial spirit have prepared the city-state to evolve into a green finance center for the region, one with services designed to ease the burden on developing nations. Frms such as MetaVerse Green Exchange (MVGX) are offering an innovative Carbon Neutrality Token (CNT ) \- a digital VER that certifies and tracks carbon credits to ensure that it has all the integrity to meet the highest carbon neutrality standards without encroaching on NDCs issues for developing countries. This allows ASEAN countries to keep to their commitments toward net-zero emissions, while exporting digital VERs to Singapore for Asian businesses to purchase so they can ensure that their products are verifiably carbon neutral before they head to the EU \- all with the assurances that there is no double-counting and that they are directly impacting green projects.\~ This private-sector solution verifiably enables carbon neutrality at scale, and when applied by Singapore to global trade flows, will enable fellow Asian governments to accelerate and further their commitments as they work toward net-zero emissions in 2030 under COP26 \' s Glasgow Climate Pact, while helping Asian producers mitigate the challenges posed by CBAM. Reading between the lines For this future to materialize, the EU must recognize the important work already being done in Singapore to create reputable and reliable authentication. The standards provided by firms across the country are on a par with those within the EU, creating a level playing field for producers in Asia and those in Europe. However, it could be argued that, beyond its sustainability aims, the CBAM is a protectionist measure that seeks to maintain the competitiveness of goods produced within the EU market (and under strict and costly EU climate policies), by applying a tariff on goods imported from foreign markets where less stringent climate policies are imposed on local producers. It has also been argued that CBAM HYPERLINK https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm runs afoul of the WTO\' s rules of non-discrimination and national treatment, which state that imported products should be given  no less favorable treatment than domestic products. Questions also persist as to whether the EU will accept regional carbon pricing initiatives within Asia as a means to avoid the tariff imposed under CBAM.\~ The opportunity for Singapore, which seeks to position itself as the leading carbon hub in the region, lies in maximizing its existing position at the intersection of East and West. By creating a local market for commercial solutions that apply internationally recognized standards in the pricing and offsetting of carbon emissions, it can provide the green stamp for products passing through its port. Such solutions would also go a long way to address the HYPERLINK https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osginf2021d2_en.pdf European Parliament \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong86","Vietnam displays new international clout at UNGA","September 29, 2021 Wednesday 5:20 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","The global offensive against Covid-19 took center stage at the recent 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The UN\' s urgent pandemic messaging was underscored by all nations, but especially by Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who recognizes that this global health storm has created obstacles for developments affecting the economic, political and social life of the world, especially in small and developing countries.\~  The pandemic sounds a warning bell of the shocking destruction that may be caused by non-traditional security challenges such as diseases or climate change if they are not addressed, Phuc said. At the UN podium, his voice was unwavering about the global perils associated with a failure to contain the virus and for the promotion of fair and equitable access to vaccines and medications. While this is an international issue and not just for a single country, Vietnam, once a recognized leader in the early curbing of the transmission of Covid-19, has been forced to adopt draconian lockdown measures to respond to the widening virus spread, especially in Ho Chi Minh City. While developed countries are taking measures to control the virus, the urgent task of the world currently is to prevent this health crisis in developing countries, because as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has made clear,  No one is safe until everyone is safe. Vietnam continues to be in short supply of available vaccines and has one of the lowest Covid-19 inoculation rates in Asia, with just under 2% of its 98 million people fully vaccinated.\~\~ It\' s no wonder that Phuc\' s speech reinforced the need for the expansion of vaccination coverage, the network and supply of vaccines administered to small countries, developing countries, and support for countries to aid in their recovery post-pandemic.\~ At a virtual Covid summit held during the UN session, President Joe Biden committed the United States to send an additional 500 million Covid-19 vaccines around the world, increasing the total doses to more than 1.1 billion. Global leaders know that to beat back this pandemic, all nations, rich and poor, must be engaged. This pledge has arrived at a critical moment, since Hanoi is struggling to rein in a surge of new cases attributed to the Delta variant.  For the pandemic to be repelled, it is essential that we stand in solidarity, uphold a high sense of responsibility, and step up cooperation, Phuc said. Despite a resurgence of Covid-19, Vietnam\' s self-image was boosted in its rotating role as a member of the UN Security Council and presidency in April, and ability and confidence to steer signature events and peace-building efforts. Its expressed leadership abilities mark the second time that the emerging nation has served as president as a non-permanent UNSC member for the 2020-21 tenure. The Security Council is the most powerful UN body, composed of 15 members, five that are permanent \- China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \- and 10 that are non-permanent, elected every two years. He also alluded to China, like Biden, but without naming Beijing as contributing to  disputes over territories and resources in many areas and in a disregard for international law. This veiled irresolute reference plainly ignored China\' s assaults on the United Nations mission. Vietnam was first elected as a non-permanent member for the 2008-09 term, and acted as the council\' s president in July 2008 and October 2009. In 2020, Vietnam for the second time in history became a non-permanent member after securing 192 out of 193 votes.\~ Vietnam\' s ascendancy in international security has been broadly witnessed in its role in hosting the 2017 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and the 2019 Hanoi Summit, a meeting bringing together North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then-US president Donald Trump. Although the summit failed to bridge any resolution on the disarmament of a global nuclear threat, Hanoi emerged as a recognized peace-builder.\~ Vietnam\' s remarkable repositioning as a middle power and evolving role as a peace-builder demonstrates the nation\' s growing confidence to play a key mediation role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on regional security issues. Over the past three decades, Vietnam has garnered recognition as a responsible member of the international community. The nation has successfully adopted market institutions that have led to more than two decades of impressive economic performance. The nation\' s successful march to the UN was accelerated by the remarkable steps taken from 1995 to 1999, including the normalizing of diplomatic and trade relations with the United States, and cooperation with multilateral donors like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Notably, Vietnam has leveraged greater integration with the international economic system, including through ascension to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Despite spending a half-century at war, Hanoi has lost no time in supporting UN initiatives that highlight the fundamental principles of international laws and the Charter in addressing international conflicts through peaceful means.\~ A central part of its openness and engagement with the world has been the country\' s willingness to acquire a more prominent voice and position in the United Nations. This has been most evident in its successful efforts to join UN peacekeeping operations. Vietnam recognizes the urgency in supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Paris Climate Agreement (COP21). The country\' s leadership faces the present dangers of climate change seen in the East Sea (aka South China Sea), \\landslides in the northern mountains, and rising sea levels in the Mekong Delta, the rice bowl for its citizens and home to more than 20 million Vietnamese. Vietnam is in complete accord with the UN in recognizing that poverty and environmental issues are interconnected. Human impact on the ocean and on coastal communities has been profound, ranging from the destruction of marine ecosystems and lost biodiversity.\~  Cooperation in mitigating and preventing the dire impacts of climate change has become more crucial than ever before, Phuc added in his speech.\~ Vietnam faces some of the greatest and most urgent threats of biodiversity degradation, extreme weather, and sea-level rise from climate change of any country in the world. However, a number of new initiatives are starting to address these challenges, ranging from a national transition to green energy to a UN-backed push for sustainable development. Hanoi\' s political leaders have pledged to restructure Vietnam\' s economy to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions. Phuc also referenced the lead-up to toward the Conference of the Parties ( COP-26 ), a global UN summit on climate change scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November.  We need to make every effort to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, in which developed countries should take the lead, urged the Vietnamese president. Along with Covid-19, climate change ranks among the highest concerns among all Southeast Asians. Also, the Philippines and Vietnam were the countries worst hit by extreme weather events in 2020, including super-typhoons Goni (Rolly) and Vamco. With the dual challenges of Covid-19 and climate change, the transition to a new normalcy will require the cooperation of the wealthy nations helping the poor and developing countries.\~ Vietnam is pledging to stake its own future on making proactive and responsible contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping charter, to uphold international law and to achieve sustainable development goals. According to President Phuc,  The prerequisite to fostering recovery and growth in the post-pandemic era is to sustain peace, security, and stability in each country, each region, and the world at large. \~ \"

It was initially planned to have supplied about 10% of the country\' s surging electricity demand by transmitting gas to four separate power stations in two of Vietnam\' s poorer central provinces. It is forecast to generate as much as US$20 billion in revenue for the Vietnamese government. ExxonMobil discovered the field a decade ago and holds 63.75% of the field in a joint venture with national entity PetroVietnam. In January 2019, it awarded Italian multinational oilfield services company\~Saipem engineering design contracts.\~  The proposed project consists of an offshore platform, a pipeline to transport the gas to shore, an onshore gas treatment plant and pipelines that feed gas to third-party power plants to generate electricity locally, ExxonMobil said at the beginning of 2019.\~ By mid-2019 there was talk ExxonMobil was trying to sell the project due to issues over gas agreements with the Vietnamese government. At the same time, China was a persistent threat in the background.\~  ExxonMobil continues to progress preparatory work [for] Ca Voi Xanh. We completed front-end engineering and design for the project in May 2020, and are working on the final development plan, an ExxonMobil spokesperson told S&P Global Platts.\~ Vietnam shelved its plans for a series of Russian- and Japanese-built nuclear plants in late 2016 when coal was cheap and offshore gas exploration was not overtly threatened by China. But bubbling tensions in the South China Sea between Vietnam and China saw Spanish energy giant Repsol pull out of two joint venture projects with the Vietnamese government in 12 months during 2018.\~ HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Vietnam-Blue-Whale-Gas-Field-ExxonMobil.jpg?resize=780%2C556&ssl=1 Link to Image At COP26 in Glasgow, Vietnam made a commitment to net-zero by 2050 \- it has even mulled moving away from its vast rice production given the thirsty crop\' s methane emissions profile and its new commitment to the Global Methane Pledge \- and committed to lowering initial LNG-to-power plans. Its most recent Power Development Plan (PDP) makes clear it won\' t build any new coal-fired power stations.\~ It may make changes to its Power Development Plan 8, which the nation has been waiting for since at least early 2020, to reduce the share of fossil fuels in its power mix. The government held a press conference on November 19 to explain its new net-zero efforts.\~ The PDP is the starting point for all new power projects; without inclusion in the document they cannot proceed, although it is not a guarantee if they are.\~Coal-fired power generation will be at just 40GW of the national power mix by 2030 under the new draft.\~ Under Rex Tillerson, who left ExxonMobil to become then-president Donald Trump\' s secretary of state, the energy giant was one of the few over the past decade to push back against China and refuse to leave its South China Sea position. Beijing was then using stick and carrot tactics, suggesting multinational energy companies could be locked out of what looked like a new shale frontier onshore in mainland China. Geology significantly trickier than what the US shale boom offered ultimately hindered that, and even now China struggles to unlock its onshore resources.\~ Vietnam has largely turned away from developing its offshore resources. However, outside China\' s nine-dash line claims in the South China Sea, in the south close to the Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam continues oil and gas production and some new exploration.\~ Singapore-headquartered Jadestone Energy, which holds projects across the Asia-Pacific and typically buys older producing assets, holds Vietnamese energy assets, while Italy\' s Eni made a large gas and condensate discovery in mid-2020 in two nearshore blocks in the Song Hong Basin, north of Danang and the old DMZ. The find was a follow-on from an original 2019 discovery.\~ There is also Block B, owned by PetroVietnam, Thailand\' s PTTEP and Japan\' s Mitsui, which aims to send gas to the large\~planned Mon II gas-fired power complex in the southwest. Chevron pulled out of the project in 2015 after failing to reach a gas price agreement with the Vietnamese government.\~ HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Vietnam-PetroVietnam-June-5-2004.jpg?resize=780%2C547&ssl=1 Link to Image Power from LNG imports will drop from a planned 41 gigawatts by 2030 to 22.4GW, a steep fall and a volte-face for a nation that had spent three solid years advancing plans for import terminals and associated power stations, in part as a way to fortify energy security while improving the nation\' s terms of trade with the US that had incensed Trump.\~ The Biden administration has made project financing for large new fossil fuel projects much harder, a significant turn considering some of Vietnam\' s planned LNG import projects had support from US foreign development banks.\~ Financing and building a long string of LNG import terminals and associated infrastructure up and down the nation\' s long coast is a daunting task, not helped by currently high spot LNG and oil prices.\~The large LNG import terminal in the northern port city of Hai Phong, which is far from sanction, involves Exxon.\~ Another, in nearby Quang Ninh province with Tokyo Gas and Marubeni, has seen a positive final investment decision (FID) and construction started in October. Another import terminal saw FID this October in Quang Tri.\~ More recently, Vietnam has announced offshore wind plans and initial investment in the sector has been rapid, driven first by Denmark, whose multinational power company Orsed has led the offshore wind charge in recent years.\~ But it will be years before the giant turbines are installed off the coast and sending gigawatts of power to the grid. In this light, the news ExxonMobil is back and working on the Blue Whale is significant.\~ Then, the US energy giant had five main areas of focus: US onshore, Mozambique LNG, Guyanese oil, pre-salt offshore Brazil and LNG in Papua New Guinea. Its African project is now stalled, as is the expansion of Papua New Guinea plant.\~ However, it was unlikely even in 2019 that ExxonMobil would find a buyer for the field given the hesitancy to move into an area where China had already chased away Spain\' s Repsol at two separate developments and even asked ally Russia to leave a South China Sea position.\~ In 2019, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi asked his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to abandon its offshore exploration with Vietnam. Lavrov reportedly declined. Rosneft Vietnam had reportedly been concerned since 2018 that its Lan Do  red orchid project in block 06.1 lies within China\' s sweeping nine-dash line claim to the sea and that drilling there could upset Beijing.\~ HYPERLINK https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Vietnam-Rosneft-Oil-Gas-South-China-Sea.png?resize=780%2C516&ssl=1 Link to Image By 2019, China was pressing for the termination of a Vietnamese offshore development with Rosneft Vietnam, a joint Russia-Vietnam venture that then canceled its contract for London-based Noble Corp\' s semi-submersible exploration rig. Noble announced the cancellation in a fleet notice without explicitly naming the company, while saying it would still be paid for the contract. The notice came only days before then-US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed China\' s wide-ranging claims in the disputed maritime region were  illegal. These problems have made an ExxonMobil sale difficult, but even without China the unusually high CO2 content of 30% of the gas would be even more of a hurdle than in 2019, before most international oil companies committed to climate targets and vowed to cut down on processes like venting and flaring.\~ Typically CO2 is vented at the wellhead but companies are now committing to new solutions.\~ The news from ExxonMobil came only a few days after the 60th anniversary of the Traditional Day of Vietnam Oil and Gas Industry on November 24, according to the state oil company\' s website. It also noted it had hit its domestic production target of 9.72 tonnes of oil 39 days ahead of schedule.\~  This is very meaningful good news for PetroVietnam, continuing to write a golden history page with the glorious mission of \' finding oil to enrich the country\' , it said.\~ But it still needs to find gas to meet growing power needs.\~Landing the Blue Whale onshore is still a long way off, but for both ExxonMobil and Vietnam, it might be a better option than letting it slowly sink and drown offshore.\~ \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong88","Ukraine: A conflict soaked in contradictions","March 3, 2022 Thursday 3:56 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","Surprise and horror have defined the reaction to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. That\' s likely because although the intervention has followed the contours of a modern land war, it has also marked a break with the past in a number of ways. The world has become used to military interventions by the United States. This is, however, not a US intervention. That in itself is a surprise \- one that has befuddled reporters and pundits alike. Even as we deplore the violence and the loss of life in Ukraine resulting from the Russian intervention \- and the neofascist violence in the Donbas \- it is valuable to step back and look at how the rest of the world may perceive this conflict, starting with the West\' s ethnocentric interest in an attack whose participants and victims they believe they share aspects of identity with \- whether related to culture, religion or skin color. White wars War in Ukraine joins a sequence of wars that have opened sores on a very fragile planet. Wars in Africa and Asia seem endless, and some of them are rarely commented upon with any feeling in media outlets across the world or in the cascade of posts found on social media platforms. For example, the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which\~ HYPERLINK https://peacekeeping.un.org/mission/past/monuc/background.shtml started \~in 1996 and which has resulted in millions of casualties, has not elicited the kind of sympathy from the world now seen during the reporting on Ukraine. In contrast, the startlingly frank comments from political leaders and journalists during the conflict in Ukraine have revealed the grip of racism on the imaginations of these shapers of public opinion. It was impossible recently to get major global media outlets interested in\~ HYPERLINK https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/09/rwandas-military-is-the-french-proxy-on-african-soil/ the conflict in Cabo Delgado At COP26 , I told a group of oil-company executives about this intervention, which I had covered for\~ HYPERLINK https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/09/09/rwandas-military-is-the-french-proxy-on-african-soil/ Globetrotter , and one of them responded with precise accuracy:  You\' re right about what you say, but no one cares. No one, which is to say the political forces in the North Atlantic states, cares about the suffering of children in Africa and Asia. They are, however, gripped by the war in Ukraine, which should grip them, which distresses all of us, but which should not be allowed to be seen as worse than other conflicts taking place across the globe that are much more brutal and are likely to slip out of everyone\' s memory because of the lack of interest and attention given by world leaders and media outlets to them. Charlie D\' Agata of CBS News\~ HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3eDZean39s said \~Kiev  isn\' t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European \- I have to choose those words carefully, too \- city, where you wouldn\' t expect that, or hope that  [a conflict] is going to happen. Clearly, these are the things one expects to see in Kabul (Afghanistan) or Baghdad (Iraq) or Goma (the Democratic Republic of Congo), but not in a  relatively civilized, relatively European city in Ukraine. If these are things that one expects in the former cities respectively, then there is very little need to be particularly outraged by the violence that is witnessed in these cities. You would not expect such violence in Ukraine,\~ HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQ392yepF0 said \~the country\' s deputy chief prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, to the British Broadcasting Corporation, because of the kind of people who were caught in the crossfire:  European people with blue eyes and blond hair being killed every day. Sakvarelidze considers the Ukrainians to be Europeans, although D\' Agata calls them  relatively European. But they are certainly not African or Asian, people whom \- if you think carefully about what is being said here \- certain world leaders and international media outlets expect to be killed by the violence unleashed against them by the global great powers and by the weapons sold to the local thugs in these regions by these great powers. Worst war? On February 23, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, in a heartfelt statement about the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, HYPERLINK said :  In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century. The next day, on February 24, with Russia\~ HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-orders-military-operations-ukraine-demands-kyiv-forces-surrender-2022-02-24/ launching \~ the biggest attack on a European state since World War II, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\~ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1496810890250928132 condemned \~this  barbaric attack and said  it is President Putin who is bringing war back to Europe.  Bringing war back to Europe : this is instructive language from Von der Leyen. It reminded me of Aim\'e9 C\'e9saire\' s\~ Discourse on Colonialism (1950), where the great poet and communist bemoaned Europe\' s ability to forget the terrible fascistic treatment of the peoples of Africa and Asia by the colonial powers when they spoke of fascism. Fascism, C\'e9saire wrote, is the colonial experiment brought back to Europe. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, neither the United Nations secretary-general nor the president of the European Commission came forward to make any immediate condemnation of that war. Both international institutions went along with the war, allowing the destruction of Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of\~ HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-deaths-survey/iraq-conflict-has-killed-a-million-iraqis-survey-idUSL3048857920080130 more than \~one million people. In 2004, a year into the US war on Iraq, after reports of grave violations of human rights (including by Amnesty International on\~torture\~in the prison of Abu Ghraib) came to light, the UN secretary-general, at the time, Kofi Annan,\~ HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2004/09/115352-lessons-iraq-war-underscore-importance-un-charter-annan called \~the war  illegal. In 2006, three years after the war had started, then Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who had been the president of the European Commission in 2003,\~ HYPERLINK called \~the war a  grave error. In the case of the Russian intervention, these institutions rushed to condemn the war, which is all very well; but does this mean they will be just as quick to condemn the United States when it starts its next bombing campaign? War stenography People often ask me what is the most reliable news outlet. This is a hard question to answer these days, as Western news outlets are increasingly becoming stenographers of their governments \- with the racist attitudes of the reporters on full display more and more often, making the apologies that come later hardly comforting. State-sponsored outlets in Russia and China now increasingly find themselves banned on social media sites. Anyone who counters Washington\' s narrative is dismissed as irrelevant, and these fringe voices find it hard to develop an audience. So-called cancel culture demonstrates its limits. D\' Agata has\~ HYPERLINK https://news.yahoo.com/cbs-journalist-apologizes-saying-ukraine-024714455.html apologized \~for his comment about Ukraine being  relatively civilized, relatively European compared with Iraq and Afghanistan and has already been rehabilitated because he is on the  right side of the conflict in Ukraine.

D\' Agata\' s reliability as a reporter will remain unquestioned. He  misspoke, they might say, but this is a Freudian slip. Calculations of war Wars are ugly, especially wars of aggression. The role of the reporter is to explain why a country goes to war, particularly an unprovoked war. If this were 1941, I might try to explain the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II or the Japanese assumption that the Nazis would soon defeat the Soviets and then take the war across the Atlantic Ocean. But the Soviets held out, saving the world from fascism. In the same way, the Russian attack on Ukraine requires explanation: The roots of it go deep to various political and foreign policy developments, such as the post-Soviet emergence of ethnic nationalism along the spine of Eastern Europe, the eastward advance of US power \- through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \- toward the Russian border, and the turbulent relationship between the major European states and their eastern neighbors, including Russia. To explain this conflict is not to justify it, for there is little to justify in the bombing of a sovereign people. Sane voices exist on all sides of ugly conflicts. In Russia, State Duma Deputy Mikhail Matveev of the Communist Party\~ HYPERLINK https://holod.media/2022/02/27/matveev/ said soon after the Russian entry into Ukraine that he voted for the recognition of the breakaway provinces of Ukraine, he  voted for peace, not for war, and he voted  for Russia to become a shield, so that Donbas is not bombed, and not for Kiev being bombed. Matveev\' s voice confounds the current narrative: It brings into motion the plight of the Donbas since the US-driven\~ HYPERLINK coup \~in Ukraine in 2014, and it sounds the alarm against the full scale of the Russian intervention.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong89","Hong Kong: New listing regime in progress","November 25, 2021 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Hong Kong Government News","Nov. 25 --Hong Kong SAR Governmentissued the following news release: Financial Secretary Paul Chan Our business, social and personal lives have been sorely affected by the pandemic. And yet, despite the daunting circumstances that have plagued us for nearly two years now, our financial system remains stable and remarkably resilient. Let me count the ways, starting with initial public offerings (IPOs). IPO funds raised in Hong Kong reached HK$400 billion last year, up a cheering 27% over 2019. As of September, total funds raised through IPOs exceeded HK$280 billion. Consider, too, the role of financial services in our gross domestic product. In 2019, the sector contributed more than 21%, surpassing trading and logistics, and making it the undisputed engine of the Hong Kong economy. The world is taking note. In September, Hong Kong reclaimed third place in the Global Financial Centres Index, only behind New York and London. And the World Investment Report, published in June by the United Nations Conference on Trade & Development, ranked Hong Kong the world's third largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) last year, trailing only the United States and the Mainland - and up from fifth place in 2019. The United Nations' report attributed Hong Kong's strong FDI to, and I quote, ""the resolution of conflicts arising from the implementation of the National Security Law,"" among others. That echoes the Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment, published by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in September. The report offers a considered analysis of the severe challenges we have faced, and overcome, in the past two years. No less important, it serves as a guide to where we are going as an economy and a community. The answer, by the way, is more than implied in the report's subtitle: ""A Place with Unique Advantages and Unlimited Opportunities."" Today's forum offers me a welcome opportunity to share some of my thoughts on how we can tap into those unlimited opportunities. The promising prospect of unlimited opportunities was given to Hong Kong in the National 14th Five-Year Plan. The plan supports our continuing growth as an international financial centre and our deepening integration in the Mainland's economic blueprint. The Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) has a critical role to play in realising that promise. Consider the mutual access schemes, Stock Connect and Bond Connect. Stock Connect's average daily turnover more than doubled last year, with northbound traffic arising about 120% and southbound soaring almost 130%. The numbers are equally encouraging for Bond Connect, with northbound turnover climbing 82% in 2020, and another year-on-year growth of 34% this year up to August. Southbound Bond Connect began operation in September, and marks another milestone in mutual access between the capital markets of Hong Kong and the Mainland. Hong Kong's role as a bridge, allowing international investors to access the Mainland market and Mainland funds to flow out to the international market, will be all the more significant. Looking ahead, our listing policies and regulatory procedures should keep track of market changes. That can boost the competitiveness of Hong Kong listings, reinforcing our status as a premier capital formation centre. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) has the Government's full support in enhancing our listing regime. I am sure some of you took part in the recent consultation by the HKEX on the establishment of a listing regime for special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. With consultation now concluded, our regulators are making concerted efforts to work out a SPAC listing regime that aims to strike that fine balance between market development and investor protection. HKEX has also concluded its review on our secondary listing regime. Starting from January 1 next year, Greater China issuers without a weighted voting rights structure can secondary list with a lower minimum market capitalisation at listing and without the need to demonstrate that they are innovative companies. Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business will find a concerted forum spotlight later this morning. The good news is that Hong Kong's fund management business grew 21%, year on year, to almost HK$35 trillion at the end of 2020. And I am determined to create more opportunities for the business and its players. As you know, the SFC created the open-ended fund company structure some three years ago. Last year, the limited partnership fund regime was introduced. Since then, more than 350 funds have set up here in Hong Kong. Tax concessions are part of the plan. The latest is exempting carried interest payable by private equity funds operating in Hong Kong from taxation. We are offering financial incentives, as well. Subsidies of up to HK$1 million are available to each qualifying, open-ended fund company, and as much as HK$8 million for each real estate investment trust. We are also encouraging foreign funds to establish a presence in Hong Kong. On November 1, we introduced a set of new fund redomiciliation mechanisms designed to attract foreign funds to relocate their registration and operation to this city. The family office business is also a priority, and Invest Hong Kong and regulators now offer one-stop support services to family offices looking to establish, or expand, in Hong Kong. Tax concessions for such offices are also under serious consideration. Then there is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect. It is nothing less than a milestone for our asset and wealth management sector. Certainly, our position as the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub will grow with the expansion of the two-way, cross-boundary fund flow. We count the largest pool of renminbi liquidity outside the Mainland, and about 70% of offshore renminbi payments are handled by the banks right here in Hong Kong. Rest assured, we will continue to expand channels for the two-way flow of renminbi funds. Among other initiatives, we are looking to allow stocks traded via Stock Connect southbound to be denominated in renminbi. We will also continue to enable the issuance of offshore renminbi bonds. In September, the Ministry of Finance announced its plan to issue in Hong Kong this year renminbi sovereign bonds totalling RMB20 billion. The Shenzhen Municipal People's Government also issued offshore renminbi municipal government bonds here in October. These issuances showcase Hong Kong as the premier gateway for international capital to access the Mainland. There is more on the bonds. I am leading a steering group intent on promoting the diversified development of Hong Kong's bond market. I am confident that we can boost Hong Kong's current position as Asia's third largest bond market, outside Japan, in total bond issuances. We value our connectivity with international markets. Beyond the Mainland, Hong Kong has formalised mutual recognition of funds' arrangements with Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Thailand. That, of course, enlarges our fund industry's distribution network. And the SFC is working to continue to expand that network. Green and sustainable finance shows great promise as well. Earlier this month, Ashley (SFC Chief Executive Officer Ashley Alder) spoke at the Green Horizon Summit @ COP26 in his role as Chair of the IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions) Board. Here in Hong Kong, the Green & Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, co-chaired by Ashley and the Monetary Authority, will bolster our reputation as a leader in this region in green and sustainable finance. It will also help move our financial sector in the direction of carbon neutrality before 2050. Back in January, the Hong Kong SAR Government completed our issuance of green bonds worth US$2.5 billion. The offering, in three tranches, featured tenors up to 30 years - the first such issuance among Asian governments. Demand from international investors was strong, with the 30-year tranche attracting orders more than seven times its issuance size. Just last Thursday, we completed the successful offering of another US$3 billion worth of green bonds denominated in US dollars and euro. That is the Hong Kong SAR Government's inaugural offering of euro-denominated bonds, with a 20-year tranche being the longest issued by an Asian government to date, allowing us to reach out to a new group of investors while setting an important new benchmark for potential issuers in Hong Kong and in the region. We will soon follow up with a retail tranche that the public can participate in as well. And we will continue with our Green & Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme to encourage more issuers to take advantage of this outstanding service platform of Hong Kong. Green bond issuance aside, we have been promoting green finance in three other directions. First, on the regulatory front, our regulators have introduced regulatory measures on climate risk management and disclosure. We are working towards adopting the Common Ground Taxonomy developed by the Mainland and the European Union, with the aim of providing a unified standard among the financial sector. Second, on green finance infrastructure, we have launched the Centre for Green & Sustainable Finance to support the industry in areas such as capacity building, data collection and analysis. Thirdly, on enriching public awareness on green finance, apart from creating more green business opportunities for the financial sector, we are leading by example by engaging our Exchange Fund in responsible investment and expanding its green portfolio. Apart from market development, it is equally important that we continue to uphold, and review, our regulatory mechanisms to ensure the smooth functioning of our financial system and the overall financial stability of Hong Kong. Certainly, it has always been a difficult balance to strike between promoting market development and preserving market integrity. And the SFC, in its ongoing review of the regulatory regime for virtual assets service providers, will, no doubt, give that the painstaking consideration it deserves.

Enormous compressors roar incessantly, distillation columns tower high above your head, large pipelines full of oil and gas criss-cross the site. Heat radiates from inspection hatches in the furnaces in which the hydrocarbons are heated to 850\'b0C to make the molecules HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_cracking crack . It\' s easy to get lost in alleys of ducts and pipes, which to an untrained eye, all look the same. Large tankers moor at the quay to unload cargoes of oil and gas and trucks leave at the other end, filled with plastic pellets. Tall chimneys release large plumes of flue gases from burning gas and unwanted by-products, using the energy to run the processes at the plant. At night a flare watches over the plant like a bright eye. This is where gases are combusted in case of an emergency or unexpected shutdown of parts of the plant. It\' s always burning with a small flame. Around the world, around the clock, the plastics we use every day are produced at facilities such as these on an almost incomprehensible scale. A scale so large that some suggest we now live in an era best labeled HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.2138/gselements.14.5.291 the plasticene . And as the climate crisis worsens, plastics production at plants like these is HYPERLINK https://www.statista.com/statistics/282732/global-production-of-plastics-since-1950/ ballooning . Modern lifestyles and practices are intimately entwined with the use of plastics. Our phones, computers, food packaging, clothes and even renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbine blades and the cables that connect them to the power grid, are all, to a large extent, made from plastics. This means plastic demand is likely to grow for decades to come \- not least in developing countries, which will account for the bulk of future demand growth. In 1950, the global production of plastic was estimated to be a mere 2 Mt (million tonnes). In 2015 this had grown to 380 Mt, and along a business-as-usual trajectory it will reach HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0459-z 1,606 Mt by 2050 . Unless mitigated, this growth will also incur a HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0459-z substantial increase HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-petrochemicals estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Why? Because the raw materials behind plastics and other petrochemicals are fossil fuels. As traditional demands for oil \- vehicle fuels \- are declining as the transport sector is increasingly electrified, the oil industry is seeing plastics as a key output that can make up for losses in other markets. Investing in plastics has therefore become a key strategy for fossil fuel firms. We have researched HYPERLINK https://steps-mistra.se/ sustainable plastics HYPERLINK plastic life cycles. This resulted in a HYPERLINK https://www.ivl.se/projektwebbar/petrochemicals.html research project in which we mapped and analyzed the fossil lock-ins of plastics and petrochemicals. More recently, we HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112418 investigated major plastics producers and the investments they are making which are likely to increase the production of fossil-based virgin plastics around the world. We discovered that the 12 largest petrochemical companies have cumulatively announced 88 new projects for production capacity increase and infrastructure expansion between 2012 and 2019. This is indicative of a global trend of increasing investments in the chemical industry, with HYPERLINK https://www.vci.de/services/publikationen/broschueren-faltblaetter/chemiewirtschaft-in-zahlen.jsp available data for key regions These new and expanded facilities will operate for decades once they are opened, adding to the current greenhouse gas emissions of the chemical industry \- which are already the HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-industry-2020 third largest of all industries.

The mountain peaks on the island have been flattened and the island itself has been expanded into the sea by so much that on satellite images available on HYPERLINK https://www.google.se/maps/@30.3316445,121.9432962,16437m/data=!3m1!1e3 Google maps you can no longer recognise its shape. All of this to make way for a gigantic industrial site: Zhejiang Petrochemical Company\' s somewhat perversely named HYPERLINK https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/zhoushan-green-petrochemical-base/ Green Petrochemical Base The brand new site, which is in the final stage of its second development phase, is a fully integrated petroleum refinery and petrochemical production facility. Previously, these processes have typically been located in separate facilities and sometimes on different continents. The new facility will have the capacity to process 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day (enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools) making it one of the largest refineries in the world. Most of its chemical products will be common plastics, such as polyethylene for flexible packaging and key petrochemical building block molecules for the production of polyester fibers for textiles. The Zhejiang project is indicative of a trend as oil and gas companies increasingly look to plastics and other petrochemicals as progressively important markets for their product.  The future of oil is in chemicals, not fuels, as a headline in a trade press journal HYPERLINK https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09708-feature2 describes it . Our investigations indicate that this future is fast approaching. Information about the industry and its growth is scarce in international statistical databases, such as those hosted by the UN Industrial Development Organization, and only extremely aggregated data is available from trade organizations. So we spent the last year collecting data about recent projects from trade press as well as information released by the firms themselves, cross-referencing to identify unique projects. Two key trends emerged in our analysis: the move towards primarily HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/oil-companies-are-going-all-in-on-petrochemicals-and-green-chemistry-needs-help-to-compete-153598 using oil for plastics and chemicals rather than petrol, and the explosive growth in demand for HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101479 US ethane , a byproduct from shale gas produced through fracking. The first trend is most manifest in China and the Asia-Pacific region, where industry experts HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-25/global-oil-refining-faces-shake-up-from-asia-petrochemicals-boom estimate that 70-80% of new refining capacity in the next five years will be plastics focused. The large oil firms are therefore strategically partnering with chemicals and plastics producers in the region \- in the Zhejiang case described above, for example, Saudi Aramco has HYPERLINK https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/saudi-aramco-zhejiang-petrochemical-project/ signed an agreement HYPERLINK https://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20190521/NEWS/190529988/basf-making-10b-investment-in-china US$10 billion in a new site in China \- the largest investment ever for the company. The second trend has mainly materialized along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from Corpus Christi and Houston (the petrochemical capital of the world) in Texas to Baton Rouge and New Orleans in Louisiana. The expansion of fracking in the US has created a plentiful supply of ethane, a by-product of fracking for oil and natural gas. While ethane cannot be used as natural gas in most applications, it is an excellent feedstock for the production of common plastics \- and is very cheap.

The first plastics To understand the modern plastics and petrochemical industries of today, we must look to the past. The modern chemical industry (including plastics) has a long tradition of close connections to the fossil fuel industry. It goes all the way back to the mid 19th century when the first synthetic dyestuffs and other early industrial chemicals were HYPERLINK produced from coal tars The industry emerged and developed in regions with coal resources and rapid industrialization, such as the UK. But it was in Germany, where chemistry was a strong academic tradition and collaboration with industrialists common, that key developments were made. This led to the foundation of successful companies such as Bayer (in 1863) and BASF (in 1865) \- companies that are still among the HYPERLINK top firms in the industry. Coal remained the main source of raw materials and energy for chemicals for a century, and also for the HYPERLINK https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakelite.html first synthetic plastics HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/426940/original/file-20211018-15-1vpywcz.jpg?w=780&ssl=1 Link to Image In the mid 20th century, it was clear that change was coming, but in the years following world war two the direction remained uncertain \- in 1949, the economist Egon Glesinger of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN published his book HYPERLINK https://books.google.se/books?id=V_U4AAAAMAAJ&q=the+coming+age+of+wood&dq=the+coming+age+of+wood&hl=sv&sa=X&redir_esc=y The Coming Age of Wood Reading this book today, it is difficult to understand that it is 70 years old: the topic is close to today\' s debate about how to mitigate climate change by using renewable resources. But in the 1950s, the industry sadly went a different way, as the breakthroughs US firms had made in petroleum processing during the war quickly spread around the globe with the help of re-industrialization aid schemes such as the Marshall plan. This led to the era of petrochemicals, with the industry recording double-digit growth during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, the industry has expanded into using natural gas, leading to the recent turn towards using gas condensates, such as ethane from fracking. For more than 150 years, the chemical and fossil fuel industries have fostered a particularly HYPERLINK https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/chemistrys-special-relationship/3004540.article special relationship Plastics and other chemicals are today almost exclusively produced from oil and gas and in China still coal to some degree. The largest companies producing plastics are often subsidiaries of international oil and gas companies, such as Shell (Netherlands/UK) and ExxonMobil (US), or of national oil companies, such as Sinopec (China) or SABIC (Saudi Arabia). Other firms in the industry have started by producing plastics and chemicals before acquiring oil and gas infrastructure, such as INEOS (UK) and Reliance (India). The firms in the industry rely on licensing technologies developed by global technology suppliers, such as Honeywell, who see chemicals production as a cornerstone for developing the  HYPERLINK https://www.hydrocarbonprocessing.com/magazine/2019/march-2019/columns/executive-viewpoint-introducing-the-refinery-of-the-future refinery of the future HYPERLINK 1% of the market, which is still completely dominated by fossil-based plastics.

At this point in time, all sectors of the global economy ought to be on track to reduce their use of fossil fuel resources, especially the most energy and emissions-intensive industries, which include cement, steel and chemicals.

These facilities will remain productive for decades, emitting CO far beyond 2050. There is a great need to move beyond words and small incremental changes, and take larger steps towards https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abg9853 low-carbon and sustainable plastics As for the virgin materials used, they should come from sustainably sourced biomass and other alternative feedstocks, and all energy used must be low-carbon.

At the top of their list should be collaborating with partners throughout the industry as well as researchers, decision-makers, consumers, and civil society to produce reliable roadmaps and strategies on how to transition towards a sustainable plastic system. A convention on plastic pollution is emerging, but global meetings on climate change, such as COP26 , need to focus more attention on the somewhat overseen issue of petrochemicals. Meanwhile, at Yushan island, tankers with crude oil from Saudi Arabia will dock regularly and pump their cargo into steam crackers that will run 24/7 for decades.

"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong91","China stocks bounce after regulatory shock and awe","November 4, 2021 Thursday 11:32 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","One year ago this week, President Xi Jinping set in motion what\' s come to be known as China\' s great  common prosperity rebalancing. Now, 12 months on, there\' s budding optimism that the worst may be over as Shanghai shares rebound. Adding to the rays of hope: Beijing is now widening the channels for investors to bet on Chinese stock and commodity derivatives. The move builds on market reforms that, since 2019, have been eliminating investment quotas for foreigners in stocks and bonds. And it coincides with the inclusion of Chinese government bonds to the FTSE World Government Bond Index. Is it a realistic assumption that the for China Inc? Only if the next 12 months of Xi policymaking are significantly more stable and transparent than the last 12. The bull case is clear enough. A year on from the Ant IPO drama, enough dust has settled from the initial shock of Xi\' s Big Tech crackdown. Many investors have had enough time to adjust to the new normal in Communist Party circles. And to refocus on the narrative that China, for all the political and regulatory risk, is home to a massive pool of consumers destined to become history\' s biggest middle-class cohort. HYPERLINK https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ant.jpg?resize=780%2C507&ssl=1 Link to Image  Sentiment is starting to recover on signs Beijing is attempting to strike a balance between stabilizing growth and pursuing structural adjustments, says Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.  We believe Chinese equities are close to the bottom now. HSBC\' s head of Asia-region equity strategy Herald van der Linde thinks investors are too down on mainland sectors like banks, healthcare, industrials and real estate.  We think the baby is being thrown out with the bathwater, van der Linde says.  Yes, China is struggling with growth and a stronger US dollar is not good news for China\' s stock markets. But that\' s now well known and is priced in. Here, the Alibaba Group example could tell a bigger story. In recent weeks, the e-commerce juggernaut Ma founded staged a noteworthy \- 19% in the last 30 days. Is Alibaba\' s rebound emblematic of what\' s in for other China-themed stocks? Are shares in Tencent Holdings, Baidu Inc, Didi Global and others about to bounce back next? Perhaps. But a lasting rebound that recoups the losses of the last 12 months requires smoother sailing on the regulatory front. And moves to shore up Asia\' s biggest economy must be orderly and sustainable. Now,\~Premier Li Keqiang warns that the economy faces new setbacks that require tax cuts and perhaps subsidies for\~small and medium-sized enterprises. Though Li was vague on timing or the sectors most at risk, his talk of fresh   and the need for\~ cross-cyclical adjustments seems starkly at odds with investors rediscovering Chinese asset markets. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ever-top-1.jpg?resize=780%2C519&ssl=1 Link to Image To be sure, not all of China\' s troubles are self-inflicted. Surely, traumatized export markets and rising are major headwinds. Also, says strategist Ken Cheung at Mizuho Bank, the  resurgence of virus spread and worsening supply constraints are dampening China\' s growth outlook. Economist Iris Pang at ING Bank notes that  internationally, the export season for China should come to an end in November, and demand could be soft due to another round of Covid outbreaks in various economies. Yet the chilling effect from Beijing\' s sudden and at times draconian crackdowns these last months, including in the pivotal property sector, must take some of the blame. Regulatory ups and downs  The company, he adds,  is systemically important to the Chinese financial system, that had seen its rules eased during the last financial crisis in 2008. Under such circumstances, Kicklighter adds,  moderate risks can turn into universal hazards. are not naive enough to believe that the company can pull itself out of its hole, rather there is full confidence in the Chinese government to stabilize the situation to avoid economic and societal breakdown. Even so, the speed, aggressiveness and poor timing of the crackdown exacerbated the economic pain and fallout. Nor is it clear Beijing is finished, says analyst\~Joel Liauw at CreditSights. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/000_8UJ4RA.jpg?resize=780%2C520&ssl=1 Link to Image Last Friday, the\~State Administration for Market Regulations signaled China will become stricter about how tech companies are classified and policed. It also said Beijing would be more assertive in demanding large tech platforms do their part to ensure China\' s economic success.  The draft rules represent the continued tough regulatory stance that the Chinese regulators are taking on the technology sector, \~Liauw says. CreditSights, he says, views this latest signaling as  credit negative for the Chinese tech companies. Here comes the money Such uncertainty comes as is again rushing China\' s way. And far more is strategizing over the best way to play mainland markets as the goalposts are being moved in real-time. The Ministry of Commerce reckons that total foreign investment in 2021 will exceed 1 trillion yuan, or $160 billion.  China\' s cross-border investment is expected to exceed the pre-pandemic level again in 2021, says Zong Changqing, who heads the commerce ministry\' s foreign investment department.  With economic development continuing to be stable, the attraction of China\' s super-large market will continue to grow. At present, Zong notes, China boasts more than 400 million middle-class consumers, representing vast potential. And between January and September, retail sales rose 16.4% year on year.  China\' s comprehensive advantages, such as complete industrial supporting facilities, sound infrastructure and abundant human resources have made China attractive to foreign investment, and foreign investors\' expectations and confidence in investing in China remain stable, Zong said. But is China ready to efficiently absorb for all of this incoming capital? The level of opacity surrounding the Evergrande debacle seems out of step for an economy that\' s now the globe\' s second-largest. When troubles at another developer, , emerged in late September, credit agencies were caught off guard. Opacity and unpredictability It wasn\' t until early October that global ratings companies downgraded Fantasia. It was during a phone call around then, says Fitch Ratings analyst Samuel Hui, that his team learned  for the first time about the existence of some $150 million of private bonds. This is a microcosm of where China\' s most important domestic growth engine finds itself as 2022 approaches. HYPERLINK Link to Image The same goes for municipalities around the nation. Since the 2008 global crisis, Beijing relied heavily on infrastructure spending by regional governments. An explosion of new highways, bridges, tunnels, stadiums, telecommunications systems and skyscraper-filled business districts around the nation helped Beijing generate 8% growth year after year. Much of that support was generated , or LGFVs. At the end of 2020, Goldman Sachs analyst Maggie Wei estimates there was more than $8 trillion worth of LGFVs outstanding \- roughly twice Germany\' s annual gross domestic product (GDP). The extreme opacity surrounding the\~LGFV\~boom creates control problems as Xi\' s government tries to deleverage the economy.  China\' s government is now targeting common prosperity, an objective that will be challenging to achieve while managing a potentially destabilizing transition, says analyst Alexander Perjessy at Moody\' s Investors Service. The global economy has much hinging on the success of this transition.\~ FXDaily\' s Kicklighter says the  control the CCP has over its own fate is not indomitable. As the second-largest economy in the world, it is deeply connected to the global system which creates limits to its ability to manufacture solutions out of thin air. For all the chatter about China\' s growing role in global affairs, Kicklighter finds it striking that Xi\' s government  has allowed its connections to key economic counterparts to wane somewhat over the past few years while simultaneously concentrating its domestic power. Xi\' s absence from the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow raised eyebrows around the globe. Optically, this looks like an error if Xi is, indeed, seeking to increase China\' s role on the world stage. And Xi is a source of global intrigue for another reason: he in 21 months. Of course, all these idiosyncrasies may be an acceptable risk for investors giving China another look at a moment when it\' s never been easier to access its markets. But with great potential comes great responsibility to get the policy mix right. For Xi\' s government, the really hard part has only just begun. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong92","Indonesia sees gas as bridge to carbon neutral","November 16, 2021 Tuesday 8:29 AM GMT","Asia Times-English","JAKARTA \- Indonesia\' s state-owned Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) is seeking investors for seven new initiatives in a clear sign the country will be falling back on its rich reserves of natural gas to ease the difficult transition from coal to renewable energy over the next three decades. Among them are more gas-fired power stations, particularly in central and eastern Indonesia, the development of regional liquified natural gas (LNG) hubs\~and new floating storage regasification (FSRU) plants, and the increased use of LNG for bunkering and sea transportation. PGN director of sales and operations Fariz Aziz says his enterprise also wants to build a gas-based methanol industry, along with bio-methanol processed from palm oil liquid waste, and to expand citywide pipeline networks for domestic households. The US and 20 other countries have pledged to stop funding foreign fossil fuel projects with  limited exceptions by the end of 2022. But while coal is clearly the main target, little has been said about natural gas as a so-called  gray alternative. Pointing to what could well be Indonesia\' s way of the future, natural gas already contributes to 40.5% of America\' s overall utility-scale electricity generation, followed by coal (19.3%), nuclear (19.7%) and renewables (19.8%). In Britain, gas is 42% of the energy mix. Indonesia trails on 18.5%, despite reserves of 20-30 trillion cubic feet (TFC) of gas readily accessible on the islands of Java and Sumatra. Total proven reserves are put at 96 TCF\~nationwide, but that includes the 45 TFC Natuna D Alpha field, which remains undeveloped 50 years after its discovery because of dangerously high levels of CO2.\~\~ Indonesia has estimated it will need to invest US$150 billion to $200 billion a year in low carbon programs over the next nine years to meet its stated goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 or earlier. COP26 HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Indonesia-Mulyani-October-7-2016-e1558411714691.jpg?resize=780%2C521&ssl=1 Link to Image  The world is asking us, so now the question is what the world can do to help Indonesia, she said, answering critics who question the viability of Indonesia\' s future energy plans.  Retiring coal early will cost us, then it will also cost the people and it will cost industry. The disappointing outcome of the Glasgow conference showed how difficult it is going to be to raise funding from wealthy nations, who used coal to reach developed status and now demand that developing world countries forego it. Indonesia has said it intends to retire 9,200-megawatts (MW) of coal-fired power by 2030, a decade earlier than the schedule laid out in the country\' s Long-Term Strategy for Low Carbon and Climate Resilience (LTS-LCCR). But while President Joko Widodo now wants to bring forward his stated target of phasing out coal altogether by 2040, experts say it will take a lot longer given the low cost and daunting opposition from Indonesia\' s powerful coal lobby. What may help is that electricity demand growth for the next decade is expected to average 4.9% a year, lower than the 6.4% projection under the previous 2019-2020 plan. Last year, the Covid-19 pandemic saw growth in demand fall to a negative -0.79%.\~ Coal comprises a whopping 67% of state power company Perusahaan Listrik Negara\' s (PLN) energy mix. Under current PLN planning, coal for power generation will be reduced to 55% by 2025 and 47% in 2038, by which time renewables are supposed to account for 28% of electricity generation. PLN\' s long-awaited 2021-2030 Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL), issued last month, envisages adding 40,600MW of new power by 2030, but that will include 13,8129MW in additional coal-fired capacity already under development. In fact, the utility predicts that coal consumption by both PLN and independent power producers will rise by 5.5% next year, from 102.5 million tonnes to 108.1 million tonnes, more than half of which will be made up of so-called\~ low rank deposits. Under the RUPTL\' s procurement plan, consumption will decline slightly to 114.3 million tonnes in 2024, but with additional new mine-mouth plants coming on stream, it will continue rising again until it peaks at about 141.5 million tonnes in 2030.\~ The RUPTL plan expects renewable plants to take up an ambitious 20,900MW, or 51%, of the new capacity, built mostly around hydro (10,391MW), geothermal (3,355MW) and solar (4,680MW). Reaching those targets, however, will rest on the\~supply-demand balance and what the plan calls  economic considerations. Analysts say the government needs to deliver on urgently-needed reforms and improvements in the regulatory framework through passage of the New and Renewable Energy Bill, currently before Parliament, and a long-delayed presidential regulation on tariffs and procurements for renewable energy projects. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Indonesia-Oil-Gas-Pertamina-2011-e1550635051474.jpg?resize=780%2C527&ssl=1 Link to Image PLN finance director Sinthya Rosesly says the utility is preparing to launch a sustainable financing framework in its efforts to raise as much as $500 billion from three different bond issues over the next four decades to develop green energy and decarbonization. But it will be no easy task. One experienced Jakarta-based consultant says apart from hydro, which includes the 7,200MW Kayan project in far-off North Kalimantan, other renewable ventures are currently burdened by significant cost, technology, regulatory or bureaucratic issues. Natural gas makes up 14% of planned new generation, or 5,833MW, with the RUPTL envisaging the fuel rising to 22% of the national energy mix in 2025 and 24% by 2050, filling an energy gap that experts feel can\' t be realistically filled by anything else. PGN is close to commissioning Java-1, the first project of its kind in which an offshore floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) will pipe gas directly to a newly-completed $1.4 billion, 1,760MW power plant at Karawang, on the eastern edge of Jakarta. A subsidiary of the Pertamina state oil company, PGN wants to install at least 12 FSRU\' s in strategic locations across the country where electricity demand\~currently exceeds supply and there is no pipeline, an expensive alternative in Java at least. But as its main customer, PLN has decided the economies of scale don\' t work for a once-heralded  milk run concept where small LNG carriers would provide the fuel to more than 50 small converted diesel stations in eastern Indonesia. Indonesia\' s total investment in the oil and gas industry last year amounted to $10.52 billion, according to upstream regulator SSK Migas. But low oil prices and the Covid-19 pandemic has further slowed spending on development wells to $1.6 billion and exploration to barely $500 million. The only promising new gas target is the three Andaman blocks 150\~kilometers off the northern Sumatra coast, where Repsol, Petronas, Harbour Energy and Mubadala are proving up a field that could hold by conservative estimates 4-5 TCF, potentially making it the largest find in Indonesia in decades. Most of the focus is on Repsol\' s much-anticipated drilling of the Rencong-IX wildcat well, which experts say could provide the first clue to unlocking the deeper areas of the North Sumatra basin stretching from onshore Aceh into the Andaman Sea. Although the exploration is technically in frontier waters, it is not far from the wells that fed Mobil Oil\' s old Aceh six-train plant which launched Indonesia into the global LNG export trade in the 1970s and was finally abandoned in 2014.\~ At depths of 1,500 meters, and with little known about the levels of CO2 and other impurities, a major find is likely to force the government to relent on its policy of capping the price of domestic gas at $6 per million British Thermal Unit (MMBTU), introduced as a cost-cutting measure for small manufacturers. The presence of Arun\' s Lhokseumawe\' s old port and other infrastructure\~could prove useful in piping the gas down through Sumatra to link up to an existing pipeline network in South Sumatra, which already supplies gas to power stations and industrial sites around Jakarta. Sluggish exploration aside, Indonesia still has abundant natural gas to call on, from East Kalimantan\' s Mahakam field to BP\' s Tangguh operation in Papua\' s Bird\' s Head region and two producing blocks in Central Sulawesi, which supply their feedstock to three dedicated LNG plants. HYPERLINK https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Indonesia-BP-Papua-Tangguh-Gas-Picture-BP.jpg?resize=780%2C514&ssl=1 Link to Image Elsewhere, Pertamina is now developing East Java\' s 2 TCF Cepu gas field, which will feed into a 370-kilometer pipeline that currently supplies gas from a series of small offshore fields to power stations in Pasarun and Gresik and a range of fertilizer and cement factories. Italian oil giant ENI still has to lay out a development plan for Kalimantan\' s $7 billion Indonesia Deepwater Development (IDD) project it is taking over from Chevron as the US oil company closes the door on its 90-year association with Indonesia. Covering four production sharing (PSC) blocks at depths of up to 2,000 meters, the Makassar Strait field contains proven reserves of 2.6 TCF, which like the Mahakham block further south would be supplied to the long-established Bontang LNG plant. That may depend, however, on the addition of more production trains to the two still in operation. Bontang opened in 1977 and at one point had eight trains processing 19.5 million tonnes of LNG per year, most of it for the North Asia market. Efforts to develop the Masela gas field in the Arafura Sea have come to a halt since Royal Dutch Shell withdrew from the 18.4 TCF venture following the government\' s decision to reject its plan to use floating LNG technology instead of a 180-kilometer pipeline. Japanese operator Inpex Corp still claims to be proceeding with plans for an onshore processing facility on the remote Tanimbar Island, 2,700 kilometers east of Jakarta. But industry experts say it will need a new partner to take on the $20 billion venture \- and favorable market conditions to make it commercially viable. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong93","Interview with editor of \u8216 Consensus or Conflict\u8217 ","October 11, 2021 Monday 8:21 PM GMT","Asia Times-English","He spoke with Asia Times editors via teleconference on October 8. Below is an edited transcript of the conversation. To read more on his book, click here. Asia Times: First of all, tell us about your organization. Give us a bit more of a personal sense of the CCG, what it is and what your role is. And then tell us also a little bit about how this book came together and what prompted you to put it together. Huiyao Wang: The Center for China Globalization, which I and Dr Miao together founded about 30 years ago, which is when China actually opened. We felt that globalization is really going to affect China, and maybe there should be a think tank to look at those issues regarding China and the relationship between China and the outside world. Asia Times: In the 30 years that CCG has been operating, you have had a chance to meet many American scholars, think tank people and so forth. Do you have an impression of the Biden administration and its senior staff? I\' m sure that you\' ve been in contact with many of these people. How does China view the Biden administration? Are you hopeful that a dialogue with the Biden administration might lead to a better consensus? Huiyao Wang: Well, absolutely, I do think so. I think the recent development is really fascinating. I was at Munich Security Conference last year, and I invited John Kerry to my roundtable. He was very straightforward and he\' s really focusing on collaboration, for example, on climate change. And he has been twice to China already, the only senior official of the US who landed in China. There was a\~ telephone conversation between President Xi and President Biden. And then in that conversation, it was said, \' let\' s instruct our working level to meet and talking again.\' We had, USTR officials, Treasury and Commerce. Everybody is coming out to talk about the China policy and we have the meeting of Jake Sullivan and China\' s top diplomat, who just met in Geneva just yesterday. So I think there are some positive things going on. I think that the problem is that the Trump administration has damaged China so much. There\' s already a bipartisan consensus on China because, as I said, China is a scapegoat for everything not doing well in the US. So,\~ because of the politicians feeding the local voters who really suffered from this globalization, they have the advantage. The problem is that you have the midterm election coming up next year and they have only a one-vote majority in the Senate, and they are sensitive to this issue. I think President Xi and President Biden know each other very well. They spent over 20 hours together, over eight or nine meals together, traveled on planes together and talked together through only one interpreter. If they meet again as scheduled at the end of the year, they\' re going to meet virtually. At least they\' re going to have a summit, a virtual meeting rather than a telephone call. You know that we have a new Japanese Prime Minister. The president just called him today. So we hope that the situation can be stabilized a little bit. With respect to China,\~Madame Meng has been released from Canada. We got rid of this sole point that was poisoning the relationship. So I\' m actually looking at a bit of stability under the Biden administration compared to the destabilized situation during the Trump administration. But I can\' t say, after President Biden, what\' s next? I really hope the people in America will see that China is no is not a threat. During a recent conference, I was talking to [Harvard Professor] Graham Allison, [Harvard Professor] Joseph Nye, [Financial Times columnist] Martin Wolf and [New York Times columnist] Thomas Friedman. I had one-on-one dialogue with them for two hours. They don\' t think that we should have a Cold War. They think we shouldn\' t decouple, and that view is already reflected into the Biden administration policy: No Cold War, no decoupling. So we hope that the things that they can do and study on the part of your media and journalists, is that we should really build up this consensus that we should really work together rather than divide it. So I think that we would probably see some stability, but the structural problems are still there. But how we can manage the risk, how we can really control that and not let it get out of hand is really the most important. I think we will gradually accept each other like Joseph Nye told me, by 2035 2050. We really need to manage our risk of conflict. And I think that\' s the way to go. We can\' t really totally converge. But we can peacefully coexist. We\' re two different cultures. I think that the world probably can have a different model to coexist. It\' s not the end of the world. So I hope for a kind of process that will take maybe one generation or two generations to get to understand then finally accept each other. Maybe that\' s the way in the future. I hope that really we can cope, and exist peacefully together. Asia Times: Many people have said that data is the fuel of the fourth industrial revolution. If artificial intelligence is the engine, then data is the fuel. China has enormous advantages in data in many fields, for example, medical. But not only is there a risk of data protectionism in the 21st century, just as we had oil protectionism in the 20th century. Huiyao Wang: Data is the petroleum of the 21st century, and you really need to make it flow before you can do well. It\' s just like capital, or talent \- the resources you have to flow. China is sitting on a gold mine of data. It has a billion smartphone users. It has the largest number and variety of applications that is probably superior to any other countries because it has a large population, has a larger geography and larger application practice. Parts of China can develop. Why can\' t that be applied elsewhere? We have to really use that data for the purposes of mankind. This thing is still debated, philosophically, ethically and technically in many ways. We have to reach a conclusion on that. That\' s the usefulness of a book like this. We have experts to talk about this, and we have to discuss in China as well. For example, China last year issued eight rules on data flow and data protection. Those are good examples of how we can push the consensus forward. Asia Times: Let\' s take the pandemic and what has been learned. You know what\~China has learned with its very successful policy. Not everybody agrees with this zero-tolerance policy. All of that is based on a wealth of data that have been collected. There must be some way of sharing that right because ultimately the pandemic is a global phenomenon and dealing with it is a global matter. Huiyao Wang: I think that\' s a good question. China had the peak of Covid-19 strike them last year and they developed this vast testing system, with quarantine, testing and tracing. They develop all kinds of technology, and they used data as a very good tool to do that. So that shows how effective they can be if they use the data to single out any Covid-19 cases. Then they can quickly stop the spread of that. This data approach, though, has been really widely used in China because China\' s philosophy and Chinese culture supports it. In China, people don\' t really regard individual freedom or individual human rights as the top of community interest. What is on top is the collective effort. For example, if I\' m locked down, cannot go out, even I lose my individual freedom, the whole society benefits from that. That\' s why I think this thing can only be applied in China. The data and technology are there but they may not work elsewhere. There are pros and cons to this approach, and there\' s a balance on that in each society. In China the government can do that because this society is very cooperative, and people really have a trust in the government. The same data approach might not work in a Western society. The West views governance as a necessary evil and never, never really trusts it. China has had a collective society for 5,000 years. China isn\' t what people think, It\' s a matter of the communist system. It\' s a different philosophy, a different culture and a different mentality, in which some technology works well. Asia Times: The United States seems to think that it can make up the rules and everyone has to abide by these rules. But China also has sometimes done that. It makes up a map and it says, OK, fine, this is our territory. But what international rules and regulations do we want? Where do we go with this? Huiyao Wang: When we talk about the rules-based order, what was referred to is the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the founding of the United Nations. The World Bank, IMF, GATT, all those institutions were born at that time. The world has gone on like that for 75 years, but the parameters have greatly changed since that. Then China was a tiny percentage of global trade or global GDP, and now it has become the second-largest economy. The old rules-based order doesn\' t reflect the new reality. So I think that is where we need to make some innovations, some updates of that. We\' re not saying we\' ve abandoned the order. We may say maybe we can upgrade or improve that. We have these new institutions like the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. These\~new institutions which have a new global role need new norms and new regulations. Another thing is the TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership]. We need now the next generation of 21st century standards for trade and service rules. Asia Times: The COP26 summit is coming up at the end of the month and the beginning of November in \~Glasgow. One of the challenges that we are facing is to deal with the climate issues, but at the same time, to do it in such a way that it does not destroy our political and economic structure. In China right now, you are sliding into an energy crisis because perhaps because there were some premature cutbacks on energy production actually instituted that might have caused the situation that we\' re dealing with right now. Huiyao Wang: China said that it will reach peak carbon before 2030 and then carbon neutrality before 2060. On the one hand, you know, China is a developing country. You may say that China can\' t do it. But China\~already realizes that it has enough smog. So they have cleaned up a lot of things.\~China is already now the largest, clean energy automobile producer, largest wind power producer and largest hydropower producer. Environmental needs are pushing China to be more innovative and to spend more resources on those new technologies. On the other hand, we have to follow the logic and the rhythm of development. China really has to cut down energy consumption per GDP unit. But of course, it\' s a gradual process. And recently, China has stopped building thermal power plants overseas, which is a huge commitment. But we will not jeopardize the economy. That\' s the beauty of the Chinese system. If things go a little wrong, that government could switch back. China never really has any big crisis because the government is really very efficient and very effective in controlling those crises. So I think that system is really working well from some insider\' s point of view. Asia Times: Professor Phelps has written for Asia Times extensively, and he\' s an economist whose ideas we follow closely. The emphasis in his contribution to your book is on indigenous innovation. He talks about the shift in focus from made-in-China to created-in-China. And he says this is essential to continuing growth and transformation. Of course, innovation is a very difficult thing to measure. I was wondering if CCG has done any studies on the state of indigenous innovation. Huiyao Wang: I think that China, and particularly after this trade war and the sanctions on Chinese companies, we\' re really fortunate to do a lot of indigenous innovation. In the past companies thought they didn\' t have to innovate because they could come by all the technology they needed from overseas. They thought that David Ricardo\' s competitive advantage is really great and everyone should do what he does best. Now this is a \~geopolitical decision for China to be more innovative. We have made enormous leaps. We went from having no phones to having smartphones. We have 4.7 million 4G stations, and almost one million 5G stations, and that\' s supported a lot of innovation. So we expect China to become more innovative, and to have more productive manufacturing as a result. It makes no sense to sanction China and no sense for China to retaliate with sanctions. I think we should really, really depend on each other and recognize everybody\' s advantage and overcome its disadvantage. Asia Times: Dr Wang, thank you very much for this conversation. \"
"COP26","Hong.Kong","COP26_Hong.Kong94","Power struggle over coal","October 15, 2021 5:58 AM GMT","Week in China","China\' s electricity sector is in a crisis, made worse as winter approaches. Power outages, of course, have occurred in the past. But the disruption over the last few weeks has been the worst for more than 20 years, affecting millions of households and companies.  Power cuts eight times a day, four days in a row I\' m speechless was one of the comments from a netizen from Liaoning, a northeastern province, while another was furious that malls in his city were closing early. One convenience store was even relying on candlelight, it was reported.  It\' s like living in North Korea, he fumed. How bad are the outages? Provinces in the northeast have been some of the hardest hit, with rolling blackouts that have forced factories to close, turned off the traffic lights on city streets and left hundreds of thousands of households without power. The crisis is also far from over, with Liaoning issuing its second-highest level alert on Monday, warning of a shortfall of as much as 20% of electricity demand. The interruptions to electricity supply have been just as damaging for industrial production. The manufacturing hub of Guangdong saw shortfalls reach 10% in late September, for instance, forcing the authorities to ration power distribution to priority customers. The authorities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang \- two more of the country\' s industrial hubs \- have also been forced into drastic action, ordering steel mills, aluminium refineries and textile producers to stop production. What\' s causing the outages? Given \' power shortage\' has become one of the most searched terms in social media, many web influencers have bought into various alternative explanations. A popular theory has been spreading that Beijing is worried about diverging producer prices and consumer prices, and therefore local governments have set out to curb industrial production. Some went as far as suggesting that China is trying to  export inflation to the US. The conspiracies have prompted a rebuttal by CCTV as the state broadcaster advised the public to blame economic fundamentals, i.e. much stronger demand for electricity as the Chinese economy recovers from the pandemic. Surges in power consumption driven by buoyant industrial output, for instance, saw demand rise by almost 14% during the first eight months of this year (high summer temperatures also contributed). Unlike the power crunches elsewhere in the world, China has more than enough generation capacity to cope with the spikes in demand. In fact, its coal-fired thermal power plants have been running well below capacity for much of the year. That points to another core issue that\' s also shaping the current energy shortfalls: China\' s commitment to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero status by 2060. As a result provincial governments have been ordered to cut down both energy consumption and energy intensity in their local economies. A so-called  dual control system has been implemented aggressively by the NDRC, the state economic planning agency, with  code red warnings issued to a number of provinces in August that they weren\' t on track to achieving the desired reductions. For many of the local authorities the most immediate solution was to produce less power, with at least 20 of the 31 provincial regions dropping output in recent weeks, primarily by rationing supplies to inefficient industrial users. As examples, Yunnan\' s local government instructed its cement industry to cut September production by more than 80% from August, Reuters has reported. Jiangsu made inspections of companies with higher coal consumption, as well as ordering manufacturers in Taizhou and Xinghua to halt production for three weeks to curb energy usage and carbon emissions, according to Metal Bulletin. Even the services sector felt the impact in some cities, Caixin adds, with local officials telling companies to reduce their hours or achieve greater savings on electricity usage by switching off office air-conditioners and elevators. And what about the coal price? Of course, the other major contributor to the power crunch is the surging price of coal, which has more than doubled on most commodity exchanges this year. This is another supply-and-demand issue: in the first eight months of the year, coal-fired generators in China were producing 14% more power than the same period last year, but coal production had risen only 6%. Making the situation much worse for the coal-fired plants is the policy directive that that utilities sell power around a regulated pricing band, meaning that the surge in coal costs cannot be passed through to consumers. Evan Li, head of Asia Utilities and Conglomerates Research at HSBC, estimates that this disconnect means that more than half of China\' s power plants have been running at a loss. Other analysts estimate the percentage could be as high as 90%. In a bid to minimise these losses, the power firms have run down their inventories of older coal, which were purchased at cheaper prices. As a result reserves at the major power plants began to dip below their long-term averages a year ago but were down to a quarter of typical levels by July, Bloomberg reckons. Typically the power firms bulk up their coal orders ahead of the winter months. However, Sinolink Securities has estimated that the September stockpiles at six of the leading power-generation groups were only enough to meet a fortnight\' s requirement. Effectively, the electricity producers have played a game of chicken with the central government by refusing to buy more coal at a time when they knew they would lose money on power generation. Instead they hoped that the authorities would reduce some of the restrictions on coal production from domestic miners or even release supplies from the state\' s strategic reserve into the market. Faced with a new round of red ink for each additional tonne of coal they burn, the plants have been looking for ways of throttling back production, including closing facilities for unscheduled maintenance and simply choosing not to meet the surging demand for power. Has the government backed down? Feeling the pressure from the power outages across the country, policymakers had already started to show signs of more flexibility by allowing some local governments to plan for higher electricity prices during peak hours. There was also a belated recognition of the crippling impact of higher coal prices, with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission encouraging the state banks earlier this month to prioritise loans to  qualified mines and power plants so they can increase thermal coal and electricity output. More significantly still, the State Council decreed last week that the wholesale tariff on electricity can now move within a wider band from the official benchmark, fluctuating by as much as 20%, compared with the previous cap of 10%. This Tuesday the NDRC then put out a statement saying it would liberalise pricing for electricity generated from coal and that industrial and commercial users will all have to buy their power at  market rates . No timeframe was given, but the commitment was that 100% of electricity generated from coal-fired power will be priced via market trading, with industrial and commercial users moving to the new arrangements  as soon as possible . Clearly the intention is to encourage major producers to generate more power and there were also efforts to bring down the price of coal in instructions to the three biggest coal-producing provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Shaanxi to raise output by as much as 30%, including new permissions to operate at full capacity even after exceeding their annual quotas.  Electricity and coal supply is crucial to people\' s lives and ensuring stable economic performance. It must be guaranteed, Premier Li Keqiang said during the State Council\' s executive meeting last week. Are the measures going to work? Coal prices did fall on the day of the State Council\' s call for more domestic production. There were fewer reports of electricity disruption last week too, although many factories reduced their operating hours over the National Day holiday period. Thermal coal futures then rose sharply to their upper limits after trading restarted after the Golden Week holiday on Monday and futures surged again to new records on Tuesday, despite a speech the previous evening from Premier Li in which he reiterated the plan to keep investing in the coal sector, at least for the immediate future. Unfortunately for Li, the call for more coal comes at a time when a wave of wet weather has swamped Shanxi, the most important source of the fossil fuel, forcing the shutdown of a tenth of its mines. Neighbouring Shaanxi, which ranks third for coal output, also reported heavy downpours that have hamstrung operations at local mines, according to Securities Times. Yet commentators are warning too that it will take time to get domestic output growing quickly again after a long period in which the policy line has been curtailing coal production, especially that of smaller, less efficient miners. In this kind of context it might be quicker to turn to increases in imports, although there is one fewer option here because of an unofficial ban on purchases from Australia, which has historically made up about a quarter of China\' s coal imports. A series of political rows between Beijing and Canberra have closed off this channel since December last year, although there were reports in Reuters last week of the release into the Chinese market of about a million tonnes of Australian coal that had been trapped by the ban in bonded warehouses. Analysts are speculating that a continuing coal crunch could see the Chinese relent on some of the restrictions on orders from Australia, although initially this would probably mean the drawdown of stockpiled coal previously unloaded at Chinese ports but that had not been allowed to clear customs. Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie believes that five million tonnes of coking coal and three million tonnes of thermal coal could be rapidly cleared by customs officials for use in China\' s domestic market. Yet these are relatively small amounts, which would do little to cool surging prices. Of course, dropping the ban completely would be a major irritation for Beijing. It would evidence yet again China\' s continued appetite for Australian resources imports, following its reluctance to block incoming shipments of iron ore even as diplomatic relations with Canberra plumbed new lows. With that context in mind there will be further efforts to source seaborne coal from alternative suppliers like Indonesia, as well as shipments from Russia and Mongolia, most of which are delivered by rail. The government has also been pressing the rail operators to get the coal to where it is most needed around the country: last week China State Railway Group promised to allocate more of its scheduling capacity to shipments of coal, prioritising delivery to the 363 power plants across China with direct rail access. What about the wider implications of the coal crunch? The crisis is already spilling over into other energy prices. China\' s hunt for natural gas has incentivised energy distributors to send liquefied natural gas shipments to Chinese ports, for instance, driving up prices for customers in other countries. It is also going to mean more disruption to the global supply chain at a time when bottlenecks in container shipping are already feeding through into higher prices for the world\' s consumers. Food prices are likely to go up too because China\' s soybean processors have been operating on reduced schedules, while energy restrictions for factories that make cardboard, paper and packaging materials have led to major reductions in output in September and October as well, which could have a wider impact for retailers in the lead-up to the Christmas shopping season. The call on coal miners to ramp up production also has implications for China\' s commitments to cleaner energy, coming only a few weeks before the UN\' s COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month. Certainly, the scramble to feed the country\' s coal-fired plants sends a contrasting message to that of Chinese leader Xi Jinping\' s much-publicised recent pledge that China will stop financing new coal plants abroad. Indeed, China\' s coal consumption \- at more than half of the international total \- sets the tone on the global effort to cut back on fossil fuels. This year the Chinese will still extract more coal than the 3.9 billion tonnes the country sourced in 2020, for instance. Green campaigners will worry about a wider reversal in climate policy commitments, with local governments getting more leeway to circumvent energy usage and intensity goals in order to deal with the ongoing electricity shortages. Officials are now being advised to implement the policies on a practical basis, avoiding a \' one-size fits\' all approach. Speaking at the National Energy Committee over the weekend, Premier Li reiterated this messaging. But the counter argument is that much of the disruption in power supply was down to the effectiveness of the pressure on local governments to do more to improve energy efficiency. The rise in coal prices was also, in part, a reflection of the government\' s success in closing smaller, dirtier mines. In this regard the Chinese have demonstrated they are serious about reducing their reliance on coal, even if one of the consequences of the current energy situation proves to be a short-lived resurgence in coal-fired power. There are other indicators that Beijing\' s commitment to renewable energy isn\' t disappearing too. In the revised guidelines issued this month, renewable power will be exempt from any energy consumption caps. Commentators think this will encourage the provinces to build new wind and solar parks, where previously they were more cautious for fear of breaking the energy consumption limits. HSBC\' s Evan Li agrees that the response to the outages is going to boost the contribution of coal to China\' s energy sector in the short term. But he thinks that a fuller revival of fossil fuels isn\' t going to happen because Beijing is determined in its focus on decarbonisation. The challenges in the electricity market are structural and could take years to fix. But in the longer run, there is a strong argument that the case for renewable energy is only going to strengthen. Higher tariffs for coal-fired power will make contracts with the renewable sector more attractive (green electricity currently trades on the grid at a costly 7% premium to coal-fired tariffs) and the disruption of the last few weeks should spur bold new investments in the ways that renewable energy is stored and redistributed. If anything, the underlying message is that China\' s energy mix desperately needs to be diversified, with an even faster rollout of renewable power (see this week's ""Energy"" section for more on the fast-growing renewables player Envision). \"

As the market rebounded in 2021 following the impact of Covid-19, we saw demand for STEM skills increase across all of our key markets. Whether it is engineers building green infrastructure, developers aiding digital transformation or the scientists helping to develop the next life-changing drug, we are proud to have placed more than 22,000 skilled people and, combined with our ESG efforts, we impacted over 33,000 lives this financial year.Within our contractor markets, we see particular client demand for our employed contractor model, a market segment where we lead in many countries, and now accounts for 32% of Group net fees.I am confident and excited about the future of SThree. Momentum is strong and demand for the talent we provide is expanding, driving anticipated double-digit growth in 2022. We are well positioned, we demonstrated our ability to navigate through unforeseen challenges, such as Covid-19, and we continue to evolve our delivery model. We will further invest in our infrastructure and our people in 2022, enhancing our Group-wide platform to drive accelerated margins in future years. We remain positive about our growth prospects as we continue to position ourselves as the leading STEM talent provider in the best global STEM markets.""\~\~Analyst conference callSThree is hosting a webinar for analysts today at 09:30 GMT. If you would like to register for the webinar, please contact HYPERLINK mailto:sthree@almapr.co.uk sthree@almapr.co.uk COP26 UN climate change conference marked a step forward in global efforts to address climate change, including a material increase in ambitions to reduce emissions across the world. Within environment, many of our clients are either in the renewable energy sector or navigating the low carbon transition. Social policy is essential to our operation as people are at the heart of our performance. We need our culture to be diverse, equitable and inclusive in order to attract and retain capable talent for our own business but also to source the candidates our clients need. As for governance, clients need assurances we have the legal resources and governance structures to deliver employee contracts that are fully compliant. In April 2021 we published our first Impact Report, setting out ESG progress, metrics and targets. We are an early adopter of the robust Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting standard, and you will find our first performance data in the Responsible business section of the Annual Report. Also in April 2021, we were delighted to be recognised as a climate leader by the Financial Times, joining the top 300 companies on their European Climate Leaders list. We were placed number 69 and are the only staffing sector company to achieve that distinction.Our DE&I policies are critical to attract and retain talent and help people perform at the top of their game. In November 2021, SThree was awarded Company of the Year at the 2021 European Diversity Awards joining the ranks of best practitioners such as Lego, HSBC and Vivendi. Again, we were the only staffing sector company to be recognised. We measured our current make-up and set challenging targets for gender, aspiring to increase gender representation at leadership levels to 50/50 by 2024. Our NED representation at the Board level is 50/50, in our Senior Leadership Team it is 40/60 and women currently occupy 31% of leadership roles more widely within the Group.\~\~ \~Platform and people developmentWe took great strides this year in improving our team members' development. We launched a new learning and development platform that is accessible to all from anywhere. New leadership training programmes were also put in place which achieved 92% participation.\~ We gave bias training to our recruiters so they could reduce its influence in staffing decisions. We have exceeded the target percentage of the Group adjusted operating profit spend on our people development set out in our Capital Markets Day plan, achieving 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%.It is critical for us to be hiring the right people in the right places as we increase our headcount. We therefore reviewed our talent acquisition and succession planning processes, refining them before training our recruiters in best practice. Having culture and values endorsed by our entire business, including every member of the senior management team, is also critically important. Extended parental leave, family leave, support for mental well-being and extended paid volunteering hours for everyone are just a few examples of this year's initiatives to develop an inclusive culture around our people. All these investments in our culture help us better fulfil our purpose: bringing skilled people together to build a better future.\~Markets and operating where STEM demand is strongestWe made a deliberate shift through the pandemic to adjust our portfolio and focus on the five core markets: US, UK, Netherlands, Germany and Japan. Together, these represent over 75% of the world STEM market and over 86% of our net fees. Our strategy is to aim for leadership in those markets by achieving scale and using that scale to add value to our offer. \~Segment recovery in core marketsThe standout segmental performance during the pandemic was in life sciences in the US, where demand was particularly strong. This was not just a result of Covid-19 programmes as other areas, such as medical devices, also contributed. There was strong adoption of technology, especially amongst some of the more traditional retailers who realised that, with consumers at home, they needed to improve their online business models. Infrastructure investment in Germany was strong and engineering project growth in the Netherlands supported strong demand for technology candidates. Technology really helped drive a renaissance in the UK business as well, with public sector investment and other industries such as education and healthcare, which had been tech laggards, now rapidly adopting technology. Companies needed new channels to engage with their customers and drive more resilience in their supply chain. They also needed artificial intelligence experts and data analytics to understand their business and customers better. Both trends drove demand for programmers. Engineers were needed to increase automation as did the energy and other sectors to support their decarbonisation journeys. After elective surgeries and treatment were artificially depressed during lockdowns, backlogs finally began to be addressed, which required health technology and engineering experts. Although certain niche skills that were out of favour, generally the story was one of strong recovery in demand.\~Our approach to the pandemicOur own response to the pandemic was to establish a framework approach, developing tactics for the three phases of the pandemic. First, there was the 'emergency response' phase, which we referred to in last year's annual report.\~ Our approach here was to revise the way we supported our clients and our candidates, whilst still maintaining capacity for when demand began to return. We shifted to having all our people working from home and provided them with the IT equipment, training and personal support they needed. The next phase, which we are thankfully emerging from in many of our markets, is the 'ongoing management of a rolling crisis' phase. Until it is fully resolved, we won't get the cross-sector recovery required to say with confidence that we have reached the final phase, £ new normal'. Throughout the year, we were still in the ongoing management phase and there was always going to be a level of volatility. As all the evidence suggested our strategy remained sound, the questions we focussed on throughout the year were, 'how do we operate in this period?' and, 'how do we implement the strategy given the uncertain background?'.Inevitably, some of the investment priorities we had a year ago changed. We formally changed to a global hybrid working policy for all staff that allows us to flex to uncertain times. It has been well received by our people. Remote working was putting heavier demands on our IT systems, so we further invested in our IT infrastructure. As cyber security is an ongoing issue, we invested in better-quality systems to protect our candidates' and clients' data. In the final quarter of the year, we hired Nick Folkes, a highly skilled technology and transformation leader as our Chief Technology and Information Officer.\~Management appointmentsIn July we welcomed Andrew Beach as our new Chief Financial Officer and said goodbye to Alex Smith, who had served as CFO for 12 years. I'd like to thank Alex again for his achievements in that time. At the close of the financial year, the Board announced that Mark Dorman would be stepping down from the Board and as CEO of the Group on 31 December 2021. Timo Lehne, who was serving as the Senior Managing Director of SThree's largest and most successful region, DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), was appointed Interim CEO and joined the Board as Executive Director from 1 January 2022. Mark will continue to assist the Group in facilitating a smooth handover and transition until 1 April 2022. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mark for his vision, drive and unique service to the Group over the past three years.\~A strong team effortI must sincerely thank all of SThree's employees for their exceptional productivity and adaptability throughout 2021, in what have been extremely difficult circumstances. My colleagues on the Board who navigated a situation that was without precedent, also deserve thanks. They provided excellent stewardship of the Company over the year. I would also like to thank our external stakeholders for their support. Candidates trusted us for advice and to guide their career development choices. Clients turned to us to meet their STEM talent requirements as they adapted to new challenges. Investors also showed confidence in us, having the full understanding of our strategy as well as our great operational and financial performance of the Group in 2021.\~OutlookOur year started with strong forward momentum. We will continue to build sustainable growth and will resume our plans for internal investment during the year, particularly in the infrastructure that will allow us to expertly harness data and efficiencies, for example in further enhanced CRM and ERP platforms. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net fees and profits in 2022, maintaining our operating conversion ratio at similar levels to 2021 to allow for the impact from investment of between 1% and 2% of net fees to further strengthen our operational and sales platforms. We anticipate payback on the investment, delivering an acceleration of margins from 2023.I believe we have good reason to be confident: we are in the right markets, we are focused on the right sectors, and we have a team that is flexible and resilient enough to seize the opportunities ahead of us. Group OPERATIONAL REVIEW\~OverviewThe Group delivered a very strong performance for the year, driven by the benefits of our business model and our strategy at the centre of two secular, long-term trends: an increasing demand for STEM skills and an accelerating trend towards flexible working. Overall, Group net fees were up 19% YoY, primarily attributable to our strategic focus on our Contract business, which now accounts for 75% of the Group net fees and delivered growth in net fees of 17% YoY. Our contractor order book increased by nearly 43% YoY reflecting the high demand for skilled contractors across our markets. Permanent net fees were up 24% YoY.Adjusted operating profit was \£360.8 million (2020: \£331.3 million), up 106% YoY.Total Group year-end headcount was up 6% YoY with average headcount down 11% YoY. Over the next year we are focussing our strategy for talent attraction and retention where we continue to drive market share gain. We increased productivity per head 31% YoY in the year, although we do expect this to normalise to some extent going into 2022. This has been a challenging period for our teams. The quality of our management and increasing expertise in our target markets are driving us forward on our journey to become the number one STEM talent provider in the best global STEM markets. We are committed to ensuring that SThree is well positioned over the long term and are confident we can continue to exploit the accelerating secular trends of STEM and flexible working across global markets and deliver our long-term ambitions.2024 ambitionsIn 2019, looking ahead to 2024 we set ourselves several ambitions to deliver growth and value for our Company and all stakeholders:to grow Group market share by 50%; to reach an operating profit conversion ratio in the range of 21-24%; and to drive a free cash conversion ratio of at least 75%. \~We also committed to several targets regarding our people and society that reflect the importance we put on being a people-centric and purpose-driven business. For example, we committed to achieve 50/50 gender representation at all leadership levels by 2023, to maintain our Learning & Development ('L&D') spend at 5% of operating profit, to grow productivity per head over the period by 1% to 2% per annum, to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions by 20% and to double the size of our renewable energy business by 2024.We have made good progress taking market share in the USA, Germany and the Netherlands in the year. While the free cash flow conversion declined to 40% (2020: 178%) due to increased demand for contractors, our operating profit conversion ratio rapidly accelerated to 17.1% (2020: 10.1%), driven by our productivity and improved hiring conditions. Within our People and Society goals we have slightly exceeded the target of the Group spend on people development, being 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%, to support our people in their efforts and strategic focus in the post-pandemic times. In 2021, we have also made a significant contribution towards climate action. We have grown our renewables business net fees by 22% YoY, delivering nearly 46% growth since 2019 (the baseline year). We have reduced our CO2 emissions by 44% YoY and have carried out a scenario analysis to provide our stakeholders with more transparency and better understanding of our business's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, and feed into the Group's first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report.\~ All growth variances expressed in constant currency.\~Group net fees by division, geography and sector \~2021 \~2020 Variance \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Continuing operations (1) Adjusted (2) Reported Adjusted (2) Reported Movement (3) Constantcurrencymovement (4) {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Revenue (\£3 million) 1,330.7 1,330.7 1,202.6 1,202.6 +11% +14% Net fees (\£3 million) 355.7 355.7 308.6 308.6 +15% +19% Operating profit (\£3 million) 60.8 61.0 31.3 31.8 +94% +106% Operating profit conversion ratio % 17.1% 17.1% 10.1% 10.3% +7% pts {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell +7% pts {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Profit before tax (\£3 million) 60.0 60.2 30.1 30.6 +99% +111% Basic earnings per share (p) 31.8 31.9 13.9 14.2 +129% +143% Proposed final dividend per share (p) 8.0 8.0 5.0 5.0 +60% +60% Total dividend (interim and final) per share (p) 11.0 11.0 5.0 5.0 +120% +120% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Net cash (\£3 million) (5) 57.5 57.5 49.9 49.9 +15% +15% \~(1) Excluding discontinued operations in Australia.

Although certain niche skills that were out of favour, generally the story was one of strong recovery in demand.\~Our approach to the pandemicOur own response to the pandemic was to establish a framework approach, developing tactics for the three phases of the pandemic. First, there was the 'emergency response' phase, which we referred to in last year's annual report.\~ Our approach here was to revise the way we supported our clients and our candidates, whilst still maintaining capacity for when demand began to return. We shifted to having all our people working from home and provided them with the IT equipment, training and personal support they needed. The next phase, which we are thankfully emerging from in many of our markets, is the 'ongoing management of a rolling crisis' phase. Until it is fully resolved, we won't get the cross-sector recovery required to say with confidence that we have reached the final phase, £ new normal'. Throughout the year, we were still in the ongoing management phase and there was always going to be a level of volatility. As all the evidence suggested our strategy remained sound, the questions we focussed on throughout the year were, 'how do we operate in this period?' and, 'how do we implement the strategy given the uncertain background?'.Inevitably, some of the investment priorities we had a year ago changed. We formally changed to a global hybrid working policy for all staff that allows us to flex to uncertain times. It has been well received by our people. Remote working was putting heavier demands on our IT systems, so we further invested in our IT infrastructure. As cyber security is an ongoing issue, we invested in better-quality systems to protect our candidates' and clients' data. In the final quarter of the year, we hired Nick Folkes, a highly skilled technology and transformation leader as our Chief Technology and Information Officer.\~Management appointmentsIn July we welcomed Andrew Beach as our new Chief Financial Officer and said goodbye to Alex Smith, who had served as CFO for 12 years. I'd like to thank Alex again for his achievements in that time. At the close of the financial year, the Board announced that Mark Dorman would be stepping down from the Board and as CEO of the Group on 31 December 2021. Timo Lehne, who was serving as the Senior Managing Director of SThree's largest and most successful region, DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), was appointed Interim CEO and joined the Board as Executive Director from 1 January 2022. Mark will continue to assist the Group in facilitating a smooth handover and transition until 1 April 2022. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mark for his vision, drive and unique service to the Group over the past three years.\~A strong team effortI must sincerely thank all of SThree's employees for their exceptional productivity and adaptability throughout 2021, in what have been extremely difficult circumstances. My colleagues on the Board who navigated a situation that was without precedent, also deserve thanks. They provided excellent stewardship of the Company over the year. I would also like to thank our external stakeholders for their support. Candidates trusted us for advice and to guide their career development choices. Clients turned to us to meet their STEM talent requirements as they adapted to new challenges. Investors also showed confidence in us, having the full understanding of our strategy as well as our great operational and financial performance of the Group in 2021.\~OutlookOur year started with strong forward momentum. We will continue to build sustainable growth and will resume our plans for internal investment during the year, particularly in the infrastructure that will allow us to expertly harness data and efficiencies, for example in further enhanced CRM and ERP platforms. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net fees and profits in 2022, maintaining our operating conversion ratio at similar levels to 2021 to allow for the impact from investment of between 1% and 2% of net fees to further strengthen our operational and sales platforms. We anticipate payback on the investment, delivering an acceleration of margins from 2023.I believe we have good reason to be confident: we are in the right markets, we are focused on the right sectors, and we have a team that is flexible and resilient enough to seize the opportunities ahead of us. Group OPERATIONAL REVIEW\~OverviewThe Group delivered a very strong performance for the year, driven by the benefits of our business model and our strategy at the centre of two secular, long-term trends: an increasing demand for STEM skills and an accelerating trend towards flexible working. Overall, Group net fees were up 19% YoY, primarily attributable to our strategic focus on our Contract business, which now accounts for 75% of the Group net fees and delivered growth in net fees of 17% YoY. Our contractor order book increased by nearly 43% YoY reflecting the high demand for skilled contractors across our markets. Permanent net fees were up 24% YoY.Adjusted operating profit was \£360.8 million (2020: \£331.3 million), up 106% YoY.Total Group year-end headcount was up 6% YoY with average headcount down 11% YoY. Over the next year we are focussing our strategy for talent attraction and retention where we continue to drive market share gain. We increased productivity per head 31% YoY in the year, although we do expect this to normalise to some extent going into 2022. This has been a challenging period for our teams. The quality of our management and increasing expertise in our target markets are driving us forward on our journey to become the number one STEM talent provider in the best global STEM markets. We are committed to ensuring that SThree is well positioned over the long term and are confident we can continue to exploit the accelerating secular trends of STEM and flexible working across global markets and deliver our long-term ambitions.2024 ambitionsIn 2019, looking ahead to 2024 we set ourselves several ambitions to deliver growth and value for our Company and all stakeholders:to grow Group market share by 50%; to reach an operating profit conversion ratio in the range of 21-24%; and to drive a free cash conversion ratio of at least 75%. \~We also committed to several targets regarding our people and society that reflect the importance we put on being a people-centric and purpose-driven business. For example, we committed to achieve 50/50 gender representation at all leadership levels by 2023, to maintain our Learning & Development ('L&D') spend at 5% of operating profit, to grow productivity per head over the period by 1% to 2% per annum, to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions by 20% and to double the size of our renewable energy business by 2024.We have made good progress taking market share in the USA, Germany and the Netherlands in the year. While the free cash flow conversion declined to 40% (2020: 178%) due to increased demand for contractors, our operating profit conversion ratio rapidly accelerated to 17.1% (2020: 10.1%), driven by our productivity and improved hiring conditions. Within our People and Society goals we have slightly exceeded the target of the Group spend on people development, being 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%, to support our people in their efforts and strategic focus in the post-pandemic times. In 2021, we have also made a significant contribution towards climate action. We have grown our renewables business net fees by 22% YoY, delivering nearly 46% growth since 2019 (the baseline year). We have reduced our CO2 emissions by 44% YoY and have carried out a scenario analysis to provide our stakeholders with more transparency and better understanding of our business's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, and feed into the Group's first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report.\~ All growth variances expressed in constant currency.\~Group net fees by division, geography and sector Growth year-on-year (In constant currency) \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ 2021 mix \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Contract Permanent Total Contract Permanent {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 17% 24% 19% 75% 25% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Breakdown of net fees 2021 2020 Geographical split EMEA excluding DACH 36% 38% DACH 36% 34% USA 25% 25% APAC 3% 3% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Sector split Technology 47% 45% Life Sciences 24% 23% Engineering 20% 22% Banking & Finance 7% 8% Other sectors 2% 2% Net fees by division {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Growth year-on-year (in constant currency) \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ 2021 mix \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Contract Permanent Total Contract Permanent {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 28% 17% 24% 68% 32% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Net fees by division {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Growth year-on-year (in constant currency) \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ 2021 mix \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Contract Permanent Total Contract Permanent {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 10% 6% 9% 87% 13% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Net fees by division {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Growth year-on-year (in constant currency) \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ 2021 mix \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Contract Permanent Total Contract Permanent {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 16% 53% 24% 75% 25% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Net fees by division {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Growth year-on-year (in constant currency) \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ 2021 mix \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Contract Permanent Total Contract Permanent {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 19% 37% 34% 17% 83% {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 2021 2020 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Before exceptional items Exceptional items Total Before exceptional items Exceptional items Total \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \~\~Note \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \£3'000 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Continuing operations {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Revenue 2 1,330,726 -

The Group financial statements and this preliminary announcement were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 January 2022.The auditors have reported on the Group's financial statements for the years ended 30 November 2021 and 30 November 2020 under s495 of the Companies Act 2006. The auditors' reports are unqualified and do not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 30 November 2020 were filed with the Registrar of Companies and those for the year ended 30 November 2021 will be filed following the Company's Annual General Meeting.In 2021, selected UK subsidiaries were exempt from the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 ('the Act') relating to the audit of individual accounts by virtue of s479A of the Act. The Company provides a guarantee concerning the outstanding liabilities of these subsidiaries under section 479C of the Act.\~ The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. Going concernIn determining the appropriate basis of preparation of this year's financial statements, the Directors are required to assess whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors have undertaken a review of the Group's forecasts and associated risks and sensitivities for at least 12 months from the date of approval of this year's financial statements.Although the global pandemic and its aftermath continue to create a moderate degree of uncertainty to economic conditions across all of our markets, the Group's business model has proven to be effective and resilient. In 2021 the Group delivered a very strong performance across key markets and sectors, with profit before tax surpassing the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, reflecting the continued strength of demand for the exceptional candidates we work with, their STEM skills and the growth trajectory of our business. In the assessment of the going concern basis of preparation, the Directors considered the future financial performance based on current trading and its growth trajectory, expected operating cash flows, as well as people and capital resources required to implement strategic initiatives in response to identified market opportunities and emerging risks. The Directors also assessed the Group's financial position, including accessible liquidity with committed borrowing facilities. At 30 November 2021, the Group had \£357.5 million of cash, with no debt except for IFRS 16 lease liabilities of \£335.1 million. As set out in note 10 to the financial statements, debt facilities relevant to the review period comprise a committed \£350.0 million RCF (facility expiring in May 2023 with all covenants met) and an uncommitted \£320.0 million accordion facility, both jointly provided by HSBC and Citibank. A further uncommitted \£35.0 million bank overdraft facility is also held with HSBC. The RCF is subject to covenants that are measured biannually in May and November, on a trailing 12-month basis, being (i) net debt to EBITDA of a maximum of 3.0x and (ii) interest cover of a minimum of 4.0x, based on measures as defined in the facilities agreements which are adjusted from the equivalent IFRS amounts. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at 30 November 2021 was nil, as no debt was drawn at the year end, and interest cover was 92.4 times.The Group developed a base case that demonstrates the Board's best estimate for the review period (to the end of Q1 2023), as well as a range of downside scenarios which may occur, either through further Covid-19 related impacts, general economic uncertainty or any of the Group's principal risks. This assessment considered the Group's potential responses to changing market conditions and business risks, resilience of its business model and overall level of Group funding and covenant requirements.The key assumptions of the downside scenarios linked to certain principal risks are shown below.\~Scenario 1 Downside scenario - economic downturnThe first scenario considers the downside impact of economic uncertainty triggered by the new Covid-19 variants over the review period, reflected in reduced sales activity for the remainder of 2022 and into Q1 2023.Under this plausible scenario, productivity is forecast to decline between 14% and 18% against the base case over 2022.\~ While variable costs are forecast to reduce in line with net fees, all other costs are assumed to remain in line with the base case.Link to risk: Risk 1: Macro-economic environment/cyclicality riskRisk 3: Commercial relationship/client risk\~Scenario 2 Severe but plausible scenario - demand/operational shockThe second scenario, considered severe but plausible, includes further potential Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions in all key markets throughout 2022 and into 2023, leading to demand at similar levels to that experienced in 2020 over that period. Under this severe but plausible scenario, the productivity is forecast to decline between 21% and 24% against the base case over 2022 and in Q1 2023. The impact of this severe but plausible downside is mitigated by the reduction in variable costs in line with net fees, together with further reductions in overheads resulting from the postponement of investment in additional headcount.Link to risk: Risk 1: Macro-economic environment/cyclicality riskRisk 3: Commercial relationship/client risk\~Under both scenarios, the Group's day-to-day working capital requirements are expected to be met through existing cash resources and cash equivalents and receipts from its continuing business activities, with sufficient cash headroom for the Group to continue trading throughout 2022 and into 2023. In each of these scenarios the Group is also forecast to be compliant with all covenants throughout the review period, with no requirement to utilise the existing credit facilities.\~Through this process, together with their knowledge and experience of the recruitment services industry, STEM markets and the principal risks, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months, and therefore the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 November 2021.\~Climate change considerationClimate change is a significant issue for the world and the transition to a low-carbon economy will create both risks and opportunities for the Group. The climate change scenario analyses conducted in line with TCFD recommendations undertaken this year did not identify any material financial impact. The Group also constantly monitors the latest government legislation in relation to climate-related matters. The following considerations were also made in respect of the financial statements:- The impact of climate-related risks as well as opportunities on the long-term viability of the Group. In line with the Group long-term commitment to the environment and society the Directors refreshed the ESG strategy. The Directors carried out a detailed assessment of how climate change may emerge across SThree's operations and impact its business model. Having identified risks and opportunities relating to the transitional impact of climate change and using three scenarios of global energy pathways for 2021-2040, SThree's strategic resilience was tested as well as its flexibility to adapt operations and drive continued growth. - The impact of the potential introduction of emission-reduction legislation in different jurisdictions may increase manufacturing costs among the Group's clients, which in turn could negatively affect their ability to pay debts, resulting in higher expected credit losses for trade and other receivables recognised by the Group. Management identified the need to enhance the Group's existing tools and techniques to monitor and mitigate any potential deterioration in clients' credit risk, in particular for a small proportion of the Group's clients within the Oil & Gas sector (circa 6% of Group net fees) whose operations are heavily exposed to climate-related risks. At present management continue to monitor this sector and provide guidelines to sales teams in line with climate change strategy.At present, the impact of climate-related matters is not material to the Group's financial statements.Accounting policies \~The accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those applied in the previous financial year, except for the adoption of new and amended standards effective as of 1 December 2020 as set out below.New and amended standards effective in 2021 and adopted by the GroupA number of amended standards became applicable as of 1 December 2020 and were adopted by the Group. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards.-\~ Amendments to references to conceptual framework in IFRS standards;-\~ Amendments to IFRS 3, Definition of a business;-\~ Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, definition of material;-\~ Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 (amendments to IFRS 4); and-\~ Amendments to IFRS 16, Covid-19 rent related concessions.New and amended standards that are applicable to the Group but not yet effectiveThe following other amendments and interpretations were issued by the IASB but are effective from 1 January 2022. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future periods.-\~ Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - phase 2.The replacement of Interbank Offered Rates ('IBORs') with Alternative Reference Rates ('ARRs') will begin from December 2021. Where floating interest-bearing receivables and payables exist (currently based on IBORs) the Group will apply suitable replacement benchmark rates and account for the instruments in accordance with the amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in 2019 (Phase 1) and 2020 (Phase 2). The adoption of these amendments and the transition to ARRs are expected to have an immaterial financial impact. The implications on the trading results of our segments of IBOR reform have also been assessed and the expected impact is immaterial. The Group is preparing to move to the new benchmark rates in accordance with timelines as per regulatory guidelines.The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Segmental analysis\~ \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~The Group's operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group's business is considered primarily from a geographical perspective.The Directors have determined the chief operating decision maker to be the Executive Committee made up of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief People Officer, with other senior management attending via invitation. The Group segments the business into the following reportable regions: DACH, EMEA excluding DACH, USA and APAC, as well as presents an analysis of net fees by its five key markets: Germany, the Netherlands, USA, the UK and Japan.DACH region comprises Germany, Switzerland and Austria. 'EMEA excluding DACH' region comprises primarily Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Ireland, and Dubai. All these sub-regions were aggregated into two separate reportable segments based on the possession of similar economic characteristics. Countries aggregated into DACH and separately into 'EMEA excluding DACH' generate a similar average net fee margin together with long-term growth rates, and are similar in each of the following areas:-\~ the nature of the services (recruitment/candidate placement);- the methods used in which they provide services to clients (independent contractors, employed contractors, and permanent candidates);-\~ the class of candidates (candidates, who we place with our clients, represent skillsets in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines).The Group's management reporting and controlling systems use accounting policies that are the same as those described in these financial statements and the accompanying notes.Revenue and net fees by reportable segment\~The Group measures the performance of its operating segments through a measure of segment profit or loss which is referred to as 'net fees' in the management reporting and controlling systems. Net fees is the measure of segment profit comprising revenue less cost of sales.\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

The Group was entitled to the grant until the end of 2021 and complied with all terms of the grant. The grant has now been fully utilised and no further income is due.Impact of Covid-19The Covid-19 health crisis had implications on certain items of income in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, affecting the profit before tax for the current and prior year. These items were not treated as exceptional.Government assistance incomeThe Group took advantage of job retention schemes launched by the national governments of France and Singapore, whereby it was reimbursed for a portion of salaries of furloughed personnel. A benefit of \£30.3 million (2020: \£31.2 million from local national governments of Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, Singapore and Spain) was recognised and presented as a deduction in reporting the related staff expense.Business optimisation expenseIn the prior year, in response to the significantly changed economic environment and increased risk and uncertainty caused by Covid-19, the Directors took relevant steps to right-size the structure and strategy of certain local businesses.

However, we manage the business against targets which are set to be comparable between years and within them, for otherwise foreign currency movements would undermine our ability to drive the business forward and control it. Within this announcement, we highlighted comparable results on a constant currency basis as well as the audited results ('on a reported basis') which reflect the actual foreign currency effects experienced. The Group evaluates its operating and financial performance on a constant currency basis (i.e. without giving effect to the impact of variation of foreign currency exchange rates from year to year). Constant currency APMs are calculated by applying the prior year foreign exchange rates to the current and prior financial year results to remove the impact of exchange rate.Measures on a constant currency basis enable users to focus on the performance of the business on a basis which is not affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the Group's operating activities from period to period. The calculations of the APMs on a constant currency basis and the reconciliation to the most directly related measures calculated in accordance with IFRS are as follows.\~\~\~ \ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 2021 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Revenue Net fees Operating profit Operating profit conversion ratio Profit before tax Basic EPS {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 pence {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Adjusted 1,330,726 355,713 60,809 17.1% 59,974 31.8 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Currency impact 35,686 11,325 3,648 0.5% 3,669 2.0 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Adjusted in constant currency 1,366,412 367,038 64,457 17.6% 63,643 33.8 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \~ {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell 2020 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Revenue Net fees Operating profit Operating profit conversion ratio Profit before tax Basic EPS {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 \£3'000 pence {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Adjusted 1,202,622 308,575 31,292 10.1% 30,127 13.9 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Currency impact 3,119 970 206 0.1% 203 0.1 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Adjusted in constant currency 1,205,741 309,545 31,498 10.2% 30,330 14.0 {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Operating profit conversion ratio represents operating profit over net fees.\~Other APMsNet cash excluding lease liabilitiesNet cash is an APM used by the Directors to evaluate the Group's capital structure and leverage.

Vice-Chairman of CHT Development Board Tarun Kumar Ghosh, Executive Director of Aranyak Foundation of Bangladesh Farid Uddin Ahmed, Executive Director of Tahzingdong Ching Shing Pru and journalists of electronic and print media were present there.Sources said that Tahzingdong supported by Aranyak Foundation of Bangladesh, has been implementing this project since 2009. The project covers 12,919.64 hectares of nine community-conserved areas, which are commonly called 'village common forests', and includes more than 1,000 indigenous forest-dependent families. Tahzingdong has built two community houses as part of institutional capacity building, and installed two water supply technologies that capture more than 387,000 litres of clean water in a month from the forests using a gravitational flow system. This system has reduced water scarcity within the community and 70 per cent of waterborne diseases.Moreover, the organisation has planted 28,545 seedlings in the community-managed forests, including bamboo, cane, and endangered species, sources also said.Many fruit seedlings have been planted in homesteads to increase forest and biodiversity conservation, as well as to prevent soil erosion of the water bodies. Three hundred sets of improved cooking stoves and 20 sets of solar panels have been provided to help maintain a clean and green environment. Fifty per cent of household-based biomass and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions have gone down in the villages and improved women's health condition. Alternative livelihood-generating support initiatives have been started, which have increased the income of vulnerable communities.It is mentionable that the Energy Globe Award was founded in 1999 by the Austrian energy pioneer Wolfgang Neumann and is one of the most prestigious environmental awards today.

A continually warming world will be a graveyard for entire ecosystems, entire peoples - and potentially even entire nations, the High Commissioner said.'That each of the last three years has been the hottest on record shows why it is imperative to focus on implementing the Paris deal and to ensure that the commitments states made to respect and promote human rights in climate action are acted upon and deepened,' Zeid stressed.The Conference of Parties (COP22), due to take place in Marrakech from November 7-18, is so important, Zeid said.'States need to take urgent action at COP22 to make sure that the measures detailed in the Paris Agreement are carried out. This will require adequate financing, sharing of technology and capacity-building.States also have an obligation to work individually and collectively to foster an environment for the enjoyment of all human rights by all. For this, they need to show more ambition and more willingness to cooperate internationally.'The Paris Agreement establishes a framework to measure, review and verify states' commitments, and calls for cooperation to enhance climate change education, training, public awareness and participation, as well as people's access to information.'This framework needs to be transparent and to integrate human rights considerations within its reporting guidel"
"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh22","Marrakesh: Political commitment not matched by funds commitment","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 22 -- Many environmentalists, including this writer, had been observing the proceedings since the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) started at Marrakesh, Morocco on November 07, 2016. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh also flew to Morocco to attend the high-level segment of COP 22. Fifty-nine heads of state and government reportedly joined the conference.Many issues related to climate change were discussed, debated and resolved in the conference. But two central themes dominated ultimately. These are: (i) curbing emissions collectively to hold global warming level at 2'C and (ii) financing adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Such agreements were also made in the climate change conference held in Copenhagen in December 2004. Attended by 194 countries and hundreds of environmental organisations and experts, the Copenhagen conference resolved to frame a legally-binding agreement to curb carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions in order to bring down global warming level below 2'C. It also recommended for providing US$100 billion every year by developed countries to meet the requirements of climate change-vulnerable developing countries. The COP 21 held in Paris in December 2015 echoed the same resolutions. The positive side was that till date, 109 countries including Bangladesh have ratified the Paris Agreement.About 15,000 negotiators, CEOs and activists were reported to be in Marrakesh for 12- day talks on climate change. The importance lay in growing impacts of climate change that have resulted in rising seas, deadly storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and pollution of water and etc.It was observed that two concerns were prevailing in the conference. The first one was the threat of US President-elect Donald Trump to withdraw from the climate change accord meaning no US contribution to the green climate fund. Secondly, only US$ 1.0 billion was committed by developed countries against US$100 billion for it. Related to this, no definite procedures and principles were yet adopted as to how this money would be disbursed.There were doubts whether the USA would ratify the Paris Declaration of COP 21. The US set this example regarding the Kyoto protocol of 1997. But President Barack Obama ratified the Paris agreement through an executive order just before the recently-held presidential election in the US. During the election campaign, Obama said in a TV talk that all progress on climate change including the Paris agreement was going to be on the ballot. During his present tour to Europe, he, however, said that there will not be major changes in the foreign policy of the USA whoever becomes the President. In Athens, Obama, among other issues, commented on Trump's position on climate change saying that climate deals would be difficult to unravel under the new President. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said in Marrakesh on November 15 that action on climate change has become 'unstoppable'. He predicted that Trump would drop plans to quit the global accord. European leaders are also of the same opinion. French President Francois Hollande said in Marrakesh that the 2015 accord to limit emissions 'is irreversible in law and in fact. In addition, it is irreversible in our minds"". Thus, the hope prevails that the USA, being the largest economic power of the world and the second largest greenhouse gas emitter, must respect the Paris agreement.COP22 ended at Marrakesh on November 18, 2016 with a declaration that called for the highest political commitment to address the climate change. It may be termed as a political declaration. The parties (countries) agreed to combat the impact of climate change combinedly and try to reduce emission of carbon. They also agreed to try utmost for funds to meet climate change projects and programmes. In reality, the Marrakesh climate change conference-Cop 22--appeared to have ended with no concrete framework to implement Paris accord. No substantive progress was made on any of the 11 issues discussed in the conference.The highest policy-making body, CMA, sat in a meeting one day and was prorogued after some time. The organisers said that this meeting would be held later. It is reported that it will take two years for the preparation of Rule Book (Framework) that will help implementation of the Paris agreement. It implies that COP 22 was trapped in the procedural problems which could not be sorted out.Visible progress was not also found about the management of the Green Climate Fund. The industrially developed countries agreed in Cancun and Durban conferences that finance for this fund would be unconditional. But the fund authority outl"

Soon after the start of the ""COP of action"" was overshadowed by the results of US presidential election of November 8 and by uncertainties over the potential U-turn the world's second largest emitter might take under the new administration.After a first week played on the defensive, government representatives and climate delegates on November 17 issued a joint statement, the Marrakech Action Proclamation, calling for ""the highest political commitment to combat climate change, as a matter of urgent priority"". The statement was interpreted as a signal of unity and determination in sticking to the path set at COP21 in Paris last year.After Paris, the focus has shifted to implementing action, and COP22 was the first important moment to start defining mechanisms and rules to achieve the Paris targets. No conclusive developments were expected at the Marrakech talks, but some starting advancements on key issues. These are reported in a set of 35 decisions adopted at the end of the Conference.Duty AssignmentThe governing body of the Paris Agreement - the CMA, including all countries who have ratified the deal met for the first time on November 15. As foreseen by hypothesis circulated in the previous months, the CMA1 asked the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (codename: APA) and the subsidiary bodies to continue their preparatory work and define rules and framework to make the Paris Agreement fully operational. The APA is responsible of defining the procedure related to the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), the transparency framework, the global stocktake and the compliance/implementation issues, whereas the cooperative mechanisms, the accounting framework for finance and technological support, the IPCC role in informing the global stocktake and the NDC registry are discussed within the two UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SBI and SBSTA).The countries agreed to complete the overall task by 2018 at COP24 to be held in Poland, where the CMA should adopt all rules and procedures. Next year, at COP23, the CMA will reconvene to review and assess the progress made.The APA is also asked to prepare arrangements and operating modalities for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement. The Adaptation Fund was established under the Kyoto Protocol and its role in the post-Kyoto climate regime monopolized the discussion in several sessions at COP22. The final document invites Parties to submit their views on the governance and institutional arrangements, safeguards and operating modalities for the Adaptation Fund to work under the Paris Agreement, by 31 March 2017.The Rules of the GameIn order to track actions and progress by all countries involved, the Paris agreement will need a robust transparency and accountability system covering NDCs, finance and technical transfers.

""The Delta Coalition is not a negotiation forum. It is the place where delta member-countries identify respective problems they are facing in terms of earning livelihoods and try to find the best practices of adaptation and mitigation,"" said an official.Though the Delta Coalition's focus is mainly on urban areas, Bangladesh is likely to bring rural areas in the next meeting as the delta problems affect both the regions but are of different nature. According to official website, Dhaka is focusing on action and momentum on water issues with a view to ensuring a resilient future enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 6.The meeting will deal with issues to attain the final goal of assuring future generation fullest access to fresh and clean water, it added.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in association with the Prime Minister's Office, will host the event. The High Level Water Panel is being organised by the Water Resources Ministry while the Regional Conference by the Local Government and Rural Development Ministry.During the first Delta Coalition conference held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands on May 9-10, the Delta Coalition and its operational plan 2016-2017 were officially launched.The Delta Coalition is the world's first international coalition of governments that have formed a partnership to deal with inclusive sustainable development in urbanising deltas, combining economic development with adaptation and preventive measures reducing climate change risks and strengthening resilience.Most importantly, it will allow delta countries to join forces to stimulate sharing best practices and innovation, and to increase opportunities for financing in order to facilitate the implementation of projects that will reduce vulnerability to climate change.Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Mozambique, Myanmar, the Netherlands, the Philippines and Vietnam have already joined the coalition.After the coalition was formed, Bangladesh and the Netherlands got a chance to present the Delta Coalition during COP22 in Marrakesh.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, a campaigner in the field, said despite having meritorious and skilled government officials in Bangladesh negotiation team, a clear lack of political guidance has weakened national position in the conference. He said climate change was not an issue of the Ministry of Environment and Forest alone, rather like the Philippines, an independent Climate Change Commission should be formed and given the responsibility to protect national interest.Mujibul Haque Munir, an executive of EquityBD, said there have been serious elements to be frustrated over the outcome of this year's climate conference since tendency of avoiding responsibilities from rich countries to the climate vulnerable countries were seemingly acute. He said rich countries did not even provide any clear roadmap for the 100 billion US dollar climate fund yearly from 2020.They did not agree on providing fund under the Loss and Damage issue. They made merely a commitment of 81 million US dollar for the adaptation only. This type of position by the rich countries will virtually lead to 'climate genocide' in LDCs and MVCs."" Pardip Kumar Roy, an executive of CSRL, said the LDCs and MVCs clearly expect a leadership role of Bangladesh in the climate change negotiations, for which Bangladesh should be well prepared, active and vocal in time.\l"

Our recent project is Novovoronezh Unit 6 that was put into operation this August. We are proud that this is the first and only Generation III+ nuclear power reactor in the world. VVER-based nuclear stations have prevented 15 gigatons of CO2 from being emitted globally. This amount is equal to emissions of 40 coal-fired thermal power stations with a capacity of one GWe for 60 years. Currently, nuclear accounts for 48 per cent of low-carbon generation in Russia. This is our contribution to the low-carbon future of our planet.""Komarov also noted that the nuclear industry bore a great responsibility, ""We must have safe nuclear stations and efficient spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management technologies.

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh28","Leading the fight on climate change","December 4, 2016 Sunday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Dec. 4 -- Until recently, the international climate negotiation process revolved strictly around high-level conversations between nation states. However, this is changing in a way that may lead us to rethink the structure of global climate talks.In particular, nonstate actors, such as businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), are becoming increasingly influential players, transforming the overall conversation - something we witnessed firsthand at the summit on climate change in Marrakech, Morocco this month.This shift has the potential to not only bring new voices into discussions over how the world addresses climate change, but also create more effective forums for taking action.COP22 wasn't the first time climate talks have been held in Marrakech. The city hosted the same forum in 2001 at a time when George W. Bush had recently been elected president. He promptly removed the U.S. from the global climate treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol. That decision cast a pall over those earlier talks, but that pales in comparison to the effect of Trump winning the U.S. election.With his administration preparing to take power, there is every expectation that the United States will disengage. President-elect Trump has explicitly indicated he will end the U.S. involvement in the Paris Agreement and the climate negotiation process more generally, although some expect the disengagement may not be quite as severe.How and whether the U.S. officially pulls out of the Paris Agreement or otherwise removes itself from the formal process is still unclear (there are at least three possible scenarios). But one thing is certain: The U.S. can no longer be expected to be as active a player as it was under the Obama administration.This means a different form of engagement is needed for continued progress in addressing climate change. Fortunately, changes in the negotiation environment are taking place.Stepped-up role of nonstate actors at MarrakechFor over two decades, international climate talks held under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) were focused on coming to a long-term, comprehensive global agreement on climate change.This was achieved in 2015 with the Paris Agreement, which puts forth a comprehensive architecture designed for the long term. It requires all parties to submit voluntary ""Nationally Determined Contributions"" (NDCs) to reduce their national greenhouse gas emissions. These pledges are designed to assess how far we have to go toward hitting global climate mitigation and adaptation targets, and how far individual states have gone toward doing their part. Over time, countries are supposed to set more ambitious targets.The key challenge in Marrakech was to take steps to operationalize the Paris Agreement, and here we saw greater involvement of nonstate actors.As Secretary John Kerry pointed out during his address in Marrakech, market pressures and low-carbon initiatives, more than states, will play an increasingly central role. Economic agents remain important, not merely for direct financial aid and engagement with the market, but also for insurance and other mechanisms of support.Substate actors can be cities, states and provinces as well as economic institutions, such as development banks. Other groups include research bodies, such as academic institutions, and NGOs.This stepped-up role for nonstate actors was particularly notable at COP22 in Marrakech. For example, representatives from California reaffirmed their commitment to reduce the state's emissions regardless of federal policies.California Governor Jerry Brown is seen as a global leader on climate change and an example of the influence entities other than countries can play. At COP22 in Marrakech, he said California 'will continue to confront' climate change.The interaction between states, and between states and nonstate actors, has the potential for being increasingly collaborative and decreasingly confrontational. For example, the development of a program engaging High Level Champions for Climate Action, begun in Paris, came to fruition in Marrakech. This program gathered an unprecedented network of nonstate actors and put them in dialogue. These dialogues, with the intent of increasing ambition from all parties, demonstrated a remarkable shift toward collaboration.We saw these dialogues taking place in Marrakech. One example is the financial sector's engagement in the discussion of how rich countries provide money to poor countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. In one striking example, the World Bank voiced its engagement with the distinctive perspectives of indigenous peoples for sustainable development.Moreover, as part of a concerted effort to bring both public and private sectors to bear on climate change, a platform was developed to showcase collaborative efforts, and motivate new partnerships and opportunities.Three outcomesThis evolving landscape has implications for how international collaborations to address climate change move forward, even with waning official U.S. engagement.First, the addition of nonstate actors brings interests not typically reflected into the policy arena. For example, subnational bodies such as the state of California can bring in new perspectives on climate action initiatives that might not otherwise be available. Or, in another example, the inclusion of indigenous voices can bring in a set of interests that have not been sufficiently represented.A broader array of resources, perspectives and expertise provides a more comprehensive approach to policy. Certainly, this diversity of perspectives brings new challenges in coordinating various groups and their interests, but it also opens new opportunities for cooperation.Second, by including interests that are at least one step removed from formal political agents, the ongoing landscape will be separated from the four- or five-year time span of typical state-level elections. As one of us (Boran) has argued previously, multilateral engagement that promotes a diversity of perspectives, expertise and know-how can become a strength of long-term climate policy. This, it may be hoped, provides a better chance of developing and implementing approaches to climate mitigation, adaptation, and financial support on longer time scales.Third, by bringing in nonstate actors there is greater potential for bilateral and multilateral engagement between drivers of climate action with overlapping interests. More agents in conversation open up new channels for collaboration, which is a better approach for the complex challenges presented by climate change.Hope beyond the stateClearly, the openness we saw in Marrakech to engage an increasingly wide range of actors in the global climate effort cannot be a substitute for the work nations have to do. But it may well prove at least as consequential in the long run as formal U.S. political engagement. And it may provide a new direction for the future of international collaboration and multilateralism. That should give us hope for progress on climate change.(Kenneth Shockley, Associate Professor and Holmes Rolston III Professor of Environmental Ethics and Philosophy, Colorado State University and Idil Boran, Associate Professor of Political Philosophy, York University, Canada)The ConversationPublished by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

The historic Paris agreement on climate change had been ratified well ahead of schedule.However, the US election results cast a cloud over the summit in Marrakesh last month. While it remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump will actually proceed with his vow to take the US out of the agreement, his recent move to appoint Scott Pruitt, a known fossil fuel defender, to head the Environmental Protection Agency is cause for concern.No country alone can solve all the problems related to climate change, but losing a key player could have seriously negative effects.Climate change poses an unparalleled, complex and urgent challenge to us all. Global businesses and their sustainable practices have a huge role to play in tackling this challenge. It is therefore encouraging that at the COP22, parties reaffirmed their commitment to implement the Paris Agreement.Even prior to COP22, several significant climate change deals were achieved.

Amalgamation of these two will hamper both the schemes,"" he said, urging the government to address the issues separately and efficiently.In accordance with the agreements signed in the global climate conferences, he said, the climate funds are totally separate and additional to other financial aid for the victim nations like Bangladesh. ""This issue was not clearly explained in the just concluded Marrakech conference,"" he noted.Mr Iftekhar expressed concern over some international agencies' efforts in convincing the government for accepting the climate fund as credit and expected that the government would not be entrapped into the schemes offered by international lending agencies.""We have legitimate right to ask for compensation from the polluter nations as per the agreements,"" he added.Senior program manager of TIB's Climate Finance Governance Unit M.

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh40","Climate change adaptation: Grants, not loans","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, Nov. 22 -- World Bank (WB) President Jim Yong Kim, during his Dhaka trip on October 16-17, 2016 announced a major investment to help Bangladesh adapt to climate change. Under the plan, the bank would invest US$ 2 billion in the next three years in climate change projects. The WB pledge by was made in the run-up to the COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco during November 7-18, 2016. Heads of state and government from 80 countries and senior ministers from 115 countries participated in the event. Sea level rise, salinity, and extreme weather events have pushed the issue of climate change to the top of the agenda of most countries. As the Paris climate agreement enters into force, now is the time for actual action on the ground, as stressed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at COP22. Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world where climate change will affect a large section of the population.According to the Climate Risk Index 2015, Bangladesh was among the top six countries most affected by climate change during 1994-2013. Climate change is estimated to reduce the agricultural GDP of Bangladesh by more than 3 per cent during 2005-2050. The country is seeing an influx of climate refugees in the already overstretched capital city Dhaka. For countries like Bangladesh, adaptation rather than mitigation is the core issue.As prescribed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), many countries have made national adaptation action plans and strategies to fight climate change. For its part, the Bangladesh government has taken climate change issue seriously. The country was among the first signatories in international protocols. Bangladesh made many rules, laws, plans, and policies to tackle climate change with support from international organisations like the UNFCCC and the World Bank. A National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) was developed in 2005 focusing on immediate and urgent adaptation issues. The NAPA was further updated in 2009 and it identified 45 adaptation measures with 18 immediate and medium-term adaptation measures. In 2008, the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) was developed and was updated in 2009. Many committees and units within the government and trust fund were created to take the issue seriously. Bangladesh mobilises its efforts to implement the BCCSAP through the twin funds: the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) and the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF). The former has a few hundred million US dollars from countries like the UK, Sweden, Australia, Denmark and others, while the latter has a few hundred million from own resources. Bangladesh is the first country to set up Climate Change Trust Fund of $400 million from its own resources. As of June 2016, 440 projects have been undertaken by the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund.A core problem with mainstream adaptation thinking and action is that adaptation is often seen as a 'technical fix' to be embedded onto on-going development plans. Inderberg et al (2015) shows in book 'Climate Change Adaptation and Development' that the lens of community participation is often condoned in climate adaptation projects rolled out within the existing framework of top-down development planning and implementation. As of now, Bangladesh is generally perceived as a pioneer in the emerging developing field of Community-Based Adaptation (CBA). The tenth International CBA gathering was held in Bangladesh in April 2016 which highlighted the increasingly important issue of urban community adaptation. Bangladesh showcases success in disaster management programme including early warning system, construction of cyclone shelters and river weeds cultivation etc. As World Bank President Kim said, ""Bangladesh has been a forerunner in adaptation and stronger disaster-coping mechanisms and these have reduced the impact of recent storms, cyclones, and floods."" It needs to be stressed here that a core factor behind this success is the fact that the technical and infrastructural components of disaster management were complemented by a focus on community-based disaster response system.Although the BCCSAP time and again highlights the success of Bangladesh in community-based approach, the document itself focuses more on the technical and infrastructural aspects than the social and political aspects of community-based adaptation. Research and knowledge management envisioned in the BCCSAP does not clarify whether and how the advanced knowledge and know-how of the experts will blend with the local-level knowledge and know-how of ordinary community members. Creating, fostering and disseminating knowledge on climate change adaptation needs to be based on a trans-disciplinary and participatory approach. A salutary aspect of the strategy is the inclusion of gender lens in framing the adaptation programmes. The BCCSAP programme for awareness raising and public education as well as the programme for strengthening human capital may be expanded to ensure local capacity-building, stronger participation and two-way knowledge exchange for fruitful cooperation across international, national, and local scales on adaptation. For food security programme, the local coping strategies of most fragile groups need to be integrated with the adaptation strategy proffered by experts and stakeholders.In the same vein, the NAPA's priority list of 38 measures focuses more on the immediate, pressing issues. The immediate interventions need to synthesize with longer-term issues, such as submergence of the coastal area by 2050. Introduction of drought or flood-resistant crops and salinity-proof crops is an important step forward, but such steps need to be aligned with local realities such as shrimp and crab-firming, the landholding patterns, and local power relations. Climate change adaptation needs as much hardware (infrastructure and technology), software (knowledge and know-how), as it needs orgware (organisational and institutional aspects, networks, and so on).A core issue with the climate change adaptation strategy in Bangladesh is policy harmonisation. Different thematic, multi-sectoral and sectoral policies, plans and strategies often lack synchrony and coordination. Sectoral policies rather than national climate change strategies drive the preparation process. The Power Sector Master Plan 2010 of Bangladesh was planned after NAPA and BCCSAP. But reflection of these policies in making this master plan was inadequate. According to this plan, fuel composition ratio in electricity generation as of 2030 would be 50 per cent to coal. Coal-based power plant is anticipated to increase the amount of CO2 emission. The BCCSAP merely mentions that there would be clean coal technologies. Developed countries are shelving off coal-based power plants and replacing them by renewable energy. The Bangladesh government should also follow their footsteps and make plans and policies in transiting towards a more climate-friendly growth path.The world is closely keeping tabs on how Bangladesh as an adaptation pioneer goes forward handling environmental change. The pledge of the World Bank is certainly an important step in strengthening international financial support to help the South Asian country adapt to the all-too-real hazards of climate change. However, a number of analysts point out that Bangladesh should seek grant rather than loan as its legitimate claim from polluters. The message is: Bangladesh needs to secure its due share of support that the international community is bound to extend. Within itself, Bangladesh needs to ensure across-the-board commitment towards continuity of policy and strategies for climate change adaptation so that the future of our progeny are not held hostage to political vicissitudes.

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh49","The blame-game over climate change","November 24, 2016 Thursday","Dhaka Courier","Dhaka, Nov. 24 -- The Industrial Revolution is largely blamed for climate change that is almost self-evident in today's world. However, it is revealed that pre-industrial deforestation caused about 9 percent of today's global warming. Humans started this change long before the Industrial Revolution, when machines changed our ancestors' way of life, in the beginning of the fossil fuel era. A study shows that these emissions are still present in the atmosphere.Deforestation started as the world's population grew. Today the world is coming to a consensus on a ""polluter pays"" model, that means the biggest emitters take on the biggest role to mitigate the effects of climate change. Some people want to put the burden on China for developments that date as far back as the ninth century. Some point fingers at some other Asian countries too.In Bangladesh we lost our best rain forests either for tea or for timber. Our northeastern part, greater Sylhet area, is well known as the humid tropics. The best part of these humid tropics has been cleared for tea plantation. Our southeastern part, greater Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts area, has 'rain' forests, which were cleared mainly for teak plantation. These two valuable commodities were mainly used by non-natives!Once I was told that a 12-year-old British boy, Durrel, wrote to Mahathir Muhammad, the then premier of Malaysia, requesting him not to clear the rainforests, so that he (Durrel) could enjoy greater biodiversity and wildlife once he grew up. I understand that Mahathir reacted sharply and wrote: ""The people, who asked you to write this letter - request them to pay more for our timber so that we don't cut more trees and grow more palms!""If we need to deal with responsibility, we have to keep per capita emissions in mind. The 'rich' have to pay for their oversized contributions to global warming. If we consider the data from 1900-2004: the US has contributed by far the lion's share, in the form of 314,772 m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. That is well over four times the top European contributor, Germany (73,625 mt). Some other countries that may be of interest to us include the UK on 55,163mt, India 25,054mt, Brazil 9,136mt, Indonesia 6,167mt and China 89,243mt. Bangladesh's historical contribution stands at an almost negligible 562mt. One has to bear in mind that emissions started before this data was calculated. UK, having spawned the Industrial Revolution, may be held chiefly responsible for the emissions in the 19th century.As 2015 drew to a close, the international family of nations gathered in Paris, and against the odds, managed to agree a deal finally to deal with greenhouse gases emissions, through a program of mitigation and adaptation. The finance will start to flow in 2020. The Paris deal, as it came to be known, is regarded as the world's first comprehensive climate agreement. The following are its principal aims:Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina attended the Conference of Parties (COP22) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Marrakech, Morocco this year. There she rightly mentioned that the Paris Agreement created a solid ground for meaningful cooperation in combating climate change impacts. She felt that this is the time to move forward and implement the decisions with action. She called upon all the countries of the world to throw in their lot, in order ""to share equitably the burden to fulfill our promises of making the world a safe and better place for our future generations.""Under the prime minister's able leadership, Bangladesh has already taken a few initiatives by spending our own resources through the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF). She communicated this to the world leaders during her stay at the summit, and it would have acted as a powerful message to world leaders that the country most affected by climate change can no longer wait around for their issues to play out.

COP 21 has brought a new dimension of accommodating different issues in which a significant role has to be played by the private sector where developing and small countries have also obliged themselves to undertake responsibilities.COP 21 is most remarkable as it brings to us the 31-page Paris agreement containing 140 decisions and 29 Articles. There are differences of opinion and political clouts throughout the whole negotiation period, but finally an agreement was reached, full implementation of which will take a year. So far about 200 countries signed the agreement and some of them have already ratified. A significant number of countries including Bangladesh is in the process of ratification.The 22nd session of the COP 22 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) is scheduled to take place on November 7-18, 2016. During , parties will, inter alia, begin preparations for entry into force of the Paris Agreement. Now the discussion is going on to have COP 22 as a follow-up of the Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 which is going to be held in Marrakesh, Morocco.It is of course true that achieving an agreement in Paris was no small feat; everyone seems to agree on this that it was difficult to come to an agreement, and what led to an agreement being reached has got a different dimension in which political agenda played a big role. The agreement is non-binding, but everyone is bound to save the planet. Undeveloped or poorer developing countries are also signatories because it promised them money and the main aim was saving the planet or universe. Financial commitment was almost absent but the countries felt there was nothing to be lost in signing it.The agreement, seen as a mark of positive wisdom and containing a long wish list, needs extensive follow-up and stock taking. The developing countries have obligated themselves by agreeing on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). For Bangladesh, it is 5 per cent unconditional by 2030 (Transport, Industry and Energy) and 15 per cent conditional. Bangladesh is one of the highly climate change vulnerable countries and has a natural dependency on agriculture, the main source of employment and it has little to contribute to the global GHG emission reduction.Analysts say although the per capita annual emission in Bangladesh is lower than that of developed countries, it has contributed for INDC and if financial and technological support is available from the international community, the reduction can be up to 15 per cent. Bangladesh has created an example in having these obligations but for showing scientific proof of emission and taking care of the issues of sustainability, it would definitely need support. The national strategy of Bangladesh in the context of INDC has highlighted the importance of adaptation and indicated certain key aspects of its adaptation are needed along with financial implications. Appropriate technology development and deployment are critical in this context. By and large, the state of technology regime remains well below the required levels.Political clout behind the Agreement was present. Big and powerful countries were always on the frontl"

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh59","A litmus test for the Paris Agreement","November 22, 2016 Tuesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 22 -- The Paris Climate Agreement was hailed around the world as a historic achievement last December. Whether or not it makes history, however, depends on its successful implementation. This is the focus of the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakesh, which began on Monday (7 November) and runs until 18 November. Being the first COP after the Paris summit in December 2015, the Marrakesh climate conference provides the first serious litmus test for the decisions reached in Paris.The record time in which the Paris Agreement was ratified is an encouraging sign that the international community is serious about climate policy. As such, the accord has come into effect in international law even before the Marrakesh conference. Yet, this does not make the implementation of its content a foregone conclusion. Its transformative ambitions entail a radical departure from business as usual - not least in key policies like energy, agriculture, transport and construction. If we are still to avert the gravest consequences of anthropogenic climate change, then incremental steps will be insufficient. Climate change and climate policy have far-reaching implications affecting virtually all areas of human development, from agriculture and energy supply to the protection of species and migration. Consequently, the Paris Agreement must be implemented in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And this applies not least with regard to the need to adapt to climate change impacts, which is essential if we are to achieve goals on water supply (SDG 6), infrastructure (SDG 9) and the protection of ecosystems (SDG 15), among others.In accordance with the common but differentiated responsibilities of states for global climate change mitigation and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) laid out at the Paris summit, each country must now determine its own combination of policies and technologies for effectively integrating the SDGs with its own national development objectives. This requires cool-headed calculation and technocratic planning, but most of all the moderation of political conflicts of interest, especially with regard to national implementation. The current debate on the German NDC is a case for that.In order to provide national and local actors with impetus for the way ahead in successfully implementing the Paris deal, the signatory countries should focus on achieving three things in Marrakesh. First, they should devise binding, long-term strategies for implementing the different issue areas of the Paris Agreement, not least with regard to financing, technology transfer and the promotion of a climate-sensitive global investment policy. Second, they should formulate the mechanisms through which they intend to regularly ratchet up their NDCs in order to achieve the overarching objective of stabilising average global warming at 1.5degC or a maximum of 2degC. Third, they should use the financing roadmap adopted a few weeks ago as a basis for further fleshing out how the pledge already made to provide developing countries with $100 billion annually from 2020 on can be honoured. In particular, they should spell out how sufficient finance will be mobilised for adaptation purposes and how global financial flows can be brought into l"

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh65","Why Muslims marching for climate","May 3, 2017 Wednesday","The News Today (Bangladesh.)","From the cropless farmer to the beleaguered first responder to the person forced to evacuate their flooded home, we all have our reasons for caring about climate change. As an Indonesian-born Muslim living in California, it is my faith that compels me to protect our earth. For many people like me who cherish tolerance and clean air, the first 100 days of the Trump presidency have not been easy. As a Muslim immigrant to America, it has been painfully frustrating to witness the Trump administration reinforce xenophobia against both immigrants and Muslims.As someone whose faith is bound up with combating climate change, it hurt to see Trump impose an executive order that effectively denies the impacts of climate change I have seen with my own eyes. Frustration must never lead to resignation, however: that is why, on Saturday, I and many other Muslims will be marching in Washington, D.C. in solidarity with thousands of others for our climate and the protection of the vulnerable. Prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) leaves Muslims like me in no doubt as to the duty we humans share: 'God has made the Earth green and beautiful, and He has appointed you as stewards over it,' he said.There is no greater threat to our 'green and beautiful' Earth than the more frequent and intense droughts, floods and storms brought by climate change. Muslim-majority countries around the world are some of the most severely affected by climate change impacts like heat waves, floods, droughts and extreme weather events like the recent famine in Somalia, which has led to more than 16 million people facing food shortages and death. Many Muslims live in parts of the world that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, such as Bangladesh and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Pakistan is another country that is extremely short of freshwater resources. With a continuously increasing of climate crisis, the water availability has decreased severely, which then placed the country as water scarce nation and in turn it will have an adverse influence on poverty.Maldives is another Muslim-majority country that could become the first in history to be completely erased by the sea level rise at the turn of the century. And with last year's COP 22 taking place in Morocco, the responsibility has shifted to the governments of Muslim majority countries and their religious leaders to step up and play their role in the growing grassroots movement accross Muslim communities around the globe, to reverse the effects of climate change. That means phasing out greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, shifting away from fossil fuels to clean sources of energy, including urging the Muslim petropowers and oil-producing nations to take the lead in the transition toward renewable energy based development. (Rich and oil states should phase out their emissions by the middle of the century and provide generous support to help the poor nations to combat climate change). The consequences of climate change are already having significant and costly affects on our communities, our health and our ecosystem.Globally, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were the three hottest years on record. From January to March 2017, the US experienced five billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, a national record that killed 37 people. Climate change likely worsened the impact of Colorado's deadly 2013 floods and has exacerbated droughts in California. Of course, it is always the poor and vulnerable who are impacted most. These facts and figures are no abstractions for me. In February 2007 I was in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, as the city was paralyzed by severe flooding - the worst in its history - that inundated about 70 percent of the city, killed a number of people, cut off the highway connecting to the country's major airport and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. In January 2014, a couple years after I moved to the US, California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a 'drought state of emergency' due to ongoing water shortfalls following the driest calendar year in state history. He asked Californians to cut their water usage by at least a fifth. As a California resident, I witnessed first hand firefighters battling a wildfire in San Diego County during the severe Santa Ana Wind and heat wave in 2016. I am not alone. Muslims - and indeed the majority of Americans outside the White House - are united on the urgency of the issue of climate change.In August 2015, I witnessed over 80 global Muslim leaders from over 20 countries release the Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change in Istanbul, urging world governments to phase out fossil fuels and make a transition to renewable energy to tackle climate change.In December of that year, by signing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, almost 200 governments set a path to do just that. The Global Muslim Climate Network, of which I am chair, is also doing its part to encourage more Muslims to focus on solutions and take concrete actions, such as running their local mosques on solar energy. By seeking to undermine the Paris Agreement, which the Trump administration could do if it decides to formally withdraw or which arguably it is already doing by seeking to eradicate climate regulations and funding for climate science research - Donald Trump and his administration are reneging on a promise to have the interests of the vulnerable and forgotten at heart. Together with his divisive rhetoric against Muslims and immigrants, Trump represents a potentially disastrous departure from the inclusive and multicultural American society that I love.\l"

And political leaders gathered last week at the United Nations to sign the new accord. But implementation is surely the tough part. Governments need a new approach to an issue that is highly complex, long term, and global in scale.At its core, the climate challenge is an energy challenge. About 80% of the world's primary energy comes from carbon-based sources: coal, oil, and gas. When burned, they emit the carbon dioxide that causes global warming. By 2070, we need a world economy that is nearly 100% carbon-free to prevent global warming from running dangerously out of control.The Paris agreement recognizes these basic facts. It calls on the world to cut greenhouse-gas emissions (especially CO2) to net-zero levels in the second half of the century. To this end, governments are to prepare plans not only to the year 2030 (the so-called Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs), but also to mid-century (the so-called Low-Emission Development Strategies, or LEDS).The world's governments have never before attempted to remake a core sector of the world economy on a global scale with such an aggressive timel"

Some 26 million people are also forced into poverty each year by the impact of natural disasters, with climate shocks reversing hard-won development gains.The year of green financeYet before you get too downhearted, we need to celebrate the fact that 2016 was also the best year ever for green finance. Simply put, green finance covers the financing of investments that generate environmental benefits as part of the broader strategy to achieve inclusive, resilient and sustainable development. In 2016, G20 heads of state for the first time recognised the need to 'scale up green finance' setting out a series of steps to make this happen. Key countries issued strategies for greening their financial systems, with China in the vanguard launching a 35-point programme. Leading insurance regulators also decided to work together on how to respond to sustainability challenges, such as climate change. In all, UN Environment estimates that the number of policy measures to green the financial system has more than doubled to over 200 measures across 60 countries.Importantly, these policy moves were closely connected with the rapid growth of green finance in the marketplace. The green bond market went from strength to strength, with over US$81 billion in issuance, almost double the 2015 tally. Financial centres from Casablanca to London, Hong Kong to Paris set out their plans to seize the green finance opportunity, notably by mobilising the capital required for the low-carbon transition. And the transformational potential of fintech for sustainable development began to be appreciated, from crowdfunding and mobile payments to artificial intelligence.With global carbon emissions stalling and clean tech costs plummeting, the task ahead for green finance in 2017 is to step up the pace. Financial institutions with assets worth tens of trillions of dollars are now committed to aligning their portfolios with the low-carbon transition and sustainable development more broadly. Yet the actual reallocation of capital still remains insufficient. Amongst the blizzard of opportunities that exist, three practical steps stand out to shift the trillions of private capital: first, rolling out sustainable finance roadmaps at the national level; second, targeting public effort where market forces cannot reach; and third, encouraging a real convergence at the international level in terms of the 'rules of the game' that shape financial markets, such as market standards and financial regulations.Roadmaps for green and sustainable financeOne of the key insights from the G20's work on green finance on 2016 was that governments need to be clearer about the policy signals they send to financiers about their plans for climate action and sustainable development. With the Paris Agreement now in force, the focus in 2017 will shift to how the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that set out each country's goals can be turned into clear investment pipel"
"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh68","COP21 goals : An alternative path to success","November 14, 2016 Monday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Nov. 14 -- With COP22 just around the corner, we continue to confront the challenge of implementing a reliable system for evaluating, overseeing and taxing carbon dioxide emissions and other GHGs.One of the major limitations lies in the difficulty of identifying and controlling all emissions on a global scale and determining the cost of ""emissions permits"". Without first knowing this cost, it is impossible to fix a price for these permits on a (single) carbon market.Unfortunately, the various efforts to implement such a system for regulating carbon emissions have proven to have serious limitations, even at national or regional level. In Europe, for example, carbon emission quotas were set in a relatively arbitrary manner and were not readily scaled up to a global level or applied to a wide range of carbon emitting activities (e.g., heating buildings).Emilie Alberola, director of the carbon and energy market research unit at CDC Climat (France), has stressed that, due to these weaknesses in the quota system, economic agents lack incentives to make the long-term investments (30 to 50 years) necessary to reduce CO2 and other GHG emissions. And such limitations are especially pronounced in times of economic crisis.Therefore, is it not critical that we pause to reevaluate our current strategies and recognise that the moment has come for a true paradigm shift? The current model for controlling carbon emissions relies on penalties, not incentives, and is unlikely to meet the ambitious goals - requiring swift action on a large scale - that we so urgently need to achieve.An alternative approach to managing carbon emissionsThe alternative approach proposed here seeks to replace taxes on carbon and other GHG emissions with an inherently dynamic, incentive-based strategy. This alternative proposal includes two interlocking components:1) the first component consists of an excise duty applied on the extraction of fossil fuels and primary production of products with global warming potential (GWP) both synthetic and non-synthetic, including fluorocarbons and methane;2) The second component involves a scalable refund that would make it possible to reclaim the excise duty levied upstream, in whole or in part. Refunds would be granted in exchange for a reduction in, or complete elimination of, emissions linked to the use of substances with a global- warming potential.Compared to the immediate sources of GHG emissions that are innumerable, there are indeed much fewer sources of extraction/production of GHG-emitting materials. Once adopted, the excise duty principle would be intrinsic in all participating countries and therefore more readily implemented. The great advantage of this combination is that it provides inherent incentives to promote compliance: could there be a more effective strategy?Examples of activities eligible for refunds would include demonstrated development of more energy-efficient processes or installations (agriculture, housing, and transport); cogeneration of energy, including renewable energy sources; production of long-lasting insulating materials and other non-emissive products as well as recycling, fixation, or long-term storage of GHGs.The excise duty would be levied on the basis of the quantity of material extracted. Suppose that the excise duty on petroleum is fixed at $10 ($25 per tonne) and with a barrel price ranging from $40 to $110, this would not constitute an insurmountable financial barrier for immediate ""professional"" uses and for consumers.As some 30 gigabarrels of oil are extracted each year, the excise duty on oil alone would generate at least $300 billion. And this does not take into account the revenues from excise duties on coal, traditional or other sources of natural gas (bituminous sands, shale gas) or, possibly, industrial non-recycled biomass (wood and pellet forms).This combination of duties and refunds has thus four critical advantages:1) there are innumerable sources of GHG emissions, but relatively fewer sources of GHG extraction/production; so, it will be simpler and more straightforward to tax/regulate the latter;2) the plan incorporates inherent incentives to promote compliance and meet emission reduction targets;3) it avoids the uncertainties of the carbon stock market, which is inevitably speculative in nature;4) it would not require direct funding from the producers or from states already struggling with limited resources or saddled with heavy debts.It is interesting to note that the proposal is supported by Christian de Perthuis in France and, somehow, Barack Obama also took over this idea although probably a little bit late in his second term.The process is also similar in some ways to the process described by the Nobel laureate Jean Tirole, who has urged that a carbon tax be levied in conjunction with a system of ""green funds."" though in this case, the duty would be levied not on GHG emissions, but on their extraction/production.How to manage a tax system based on carbon extractionsAfter signing a treaty pledging its participation, each country would be obliged to levy the duty regardless of whether the GHGs (or other products associated with climate externalities) were extracted within the country or were imported from elsewhere.States choosing not to participate would be penalised by excise duties imposed at the borders by the WTO, the ECB, or an institution specifically created to fill this role. To ensure compliance, a source-tracing system (similar to those adopted in some food industry sectors) would be instituted. This is particularly important to trace the imports.In order to provide full or partial refunds of the excise duty levied upstream, we propose the implementation of a tax system incorporating environmental externalities (here the climate impact) of any product or activity and aligned with the traditional tax schemes like the European VAT.There already exists an operational strategy for quantifying and implementing excise duty refunds, based on models for monetisation of environmental and social externalities which draw distinctions between products or services according to their overall carbon profile. With such a system, the tax burden would thus not rise for those producers or consumers who adopt strategies that selectively reduce their climate externalities.Examples include the issues discussed in the UN's list of Millennium Development Goals. The tax would be calculated using methods (e.g., Life Cycle Analysis [LCA]) already in place for monetising some externalities.The main challenge? Probably the resistance to paradigm shiftsDespite its potential benefits, such a proposal must first confront the ""resistance to change"" that characterises most stakeholders in our ""advanced"" societies: economists, the political world and even scientists.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The New Nation.

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh69","Climate dialogue: Bridging gaps in understanding","June 21, 2016 Tuesday","The Financial Express (Bangladesh)","Bangladesh, June 21 -- Dialogue is the only means to resolve complex issues peacefully. Climate dialogue has so far seen heated debates on contentious issues. World leaders have been spending a significant proportion of their time to have dialogues and discuss about global warming and responsibilities of the most pollutant countries. The Paris agreement was reached in December 2015 after a lengthy dialogue.The largest annual conference of parties (COP22) -the sustainable innovation forum 2016-- is scheduled to take place during the second week of November in Marrakech, Morocco. In this climate dialogue and conference, the private sector is getting more and more importance as a significant proportion of funding is expected from it. Bangladesh, as a least developed country, has also contributed a lot. The government is seriously concerned over climate change and is taking full care of its capabilities, commitment for Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) at 5.0 per cent without external support and 15 per cent if external support is available as business-as-usual case. This has been appreciated by the world community.The last conference was held in Bonn, Germany in May 2016 where the LDC issues were discussed with a special focus on a good quality national adaptation plan.In the COP21 discussion, the political agenda of the large countries to take recourse to safe position were visible while LDC issues are sometimes bypassed. A number of 'shall' has been substituted at the last stage by 'should'. In some very pertinent areas, say finance, loss and damage, no decision was taken and in this respect ratification of the Paris agreement by the big polluter countries would be very important. It is expected that Bangladesh would lead a large delegation to the upcoming COP but private sector representatives and representatives from all other related sectors of water, energy and agriculture would probably need to be engaged to get benefits of climate change dialogue.The areas important for making the dialogue successful are many among which confidence on dialogue partners is one of the most important issues. So far it is seen that a sort of inertia has worked in the private sector in case of climate change issues; efficiency of natural resources with adaptation of new technologies is being treated from the point of view of cost issues. Both existing and upcoming state and non-state actors should have a clear idea and need to know the potential areas to exploit to accrue benefits out of it. A slew of measures can be initiated by having effective dialogue among public and private sectors both at domestic and international levels. It is clear that there is a gap of understanding of climate change issues and cost minimisation among different actors.BUILD, as a public-private dialogue platform, has identified seven gaps so far which need to be bridged to get better results from dialogue. There is confidence gap among public and private sectors. In order to bridge the gap, there is a serious need to have more and more platforms for structured dialogues inviting all relevant actors.There is an understanding gap between buyers and sellers; some corporate bodies have taken voluntary steps to reduce costs by implementing energy-efficient technology and procedures and have been able to bring in efficiency but are facing buyers' pressure to further reduce prices because of reduced cost of production which is discouraging for the private sector. Importers of products from Bangladesh should also encourage entrepreneurs to use more and more resource -efficient technology so that others are also interested to participate in these processes and educate themselves to maintain the full eco-system.There is information gap. Nobody knows who is doing what. Information disclosure is important. The private sector is a bit confused and does not also like to disclose information. All related information and steps taken by the government are not appropriately or timely communicated to the private sector. Projects are being implemented by the government, NGOs, stakeholders and the private sector are not closely involved and coordinated and no database of projects is being prepared.Policy gaps, mainstream policies and benefits for the private sector and tax policies are not always aligned with climate change strategies. Policy mix-in favour of climate responsible production processes is important. Tax policies would also need to be aligned with climate strategies so that gradually private sector becomes ready to be climate-responsible entrepreneurs.Another important issue is the issue of land which is not discipl"

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh73","Avoiding dirty fuel","September 28, 2016 Wednesday","The New Nation (Bangladesh)","Dhaka, Sept. 28 -- Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas and are used as an energy source in the electricity and transportation sectors. They are also a leading source of the world's global warming resulting in pollution.Burning fossil fuels negatively affects the environment because they release carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, which contributes to global climate change. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the burning of fossil fuels during the last 150 years has increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by 25 percent. Levels of methane and nitrous oxide have also increased .In addition to contributing to global climate change, burning fossil fuels also pollutes the air, leading to negative health effects for animals. Exposure to the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels can cause headaches and increase the risk of heart disease. According to GreenEnergyChoice.com, more than 2.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide are produced just by power plants each year. Sulphur oxides produced burning fossil fuels form sulphuric acid when they combine with water vapor. As this acid accumulates in lakes and streams, it makes the habitats uninhabitable for plants and animals.Burning fossil fuels also results in thermal pollution. The process of burning any substance generates heat, and this heat is often released into lakes and streams when the water that they contain is used as a coolant. The increased temperatures in these lakes and streams upsets the ecosystem, causing some species' populations to increase and others to decrease.The wide scale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later, to fire steam engines enabled the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, gas lights using natural gas or coal gas were coming into wide use.Fossil fuels lobby is the umbrella term used to name the paid representatives of large fossil fuel (oil, gas, coal) and electric utilities corporations who attempt to influence governmental policy. This energy lobby is criticized for using its influence to block or dilute legislation regarding global climate change.Many of the most influential members of the energy lobby are among the top polluters in the United States. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization established in March 2002 by former attorneys at the Environmental Protection Agency, ""Companies like ExxonMobil and Sunoco keep reporting record profits while increasing emissions or more cancer causing chemicals from their refineries.In the 2006 US election cycle, oil and gas companies contributed over $19 million to political campaigns. 82% of that money went to Republican candidates, while the remaining 18% went to Democrats. In 2004, oil and gas companies contributed over $25 million to political campaigns, donating 80% of that money to Republicans. In the 2000 elections, over $34 million was contributed, with 78% of that money going to Republicans.The energy lobby has a history of conflict with international interests and democratic global governance. According to the International Sustainable Energy Organization for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency the second World Climate Conference was sabotaged by the USA and oil lobbieswhereupon UNISEO proceeded to set up a Global Energy Charter which protects life, health, climate and the biosphere from emissions. According to the organization, these same ""reactionary energy lobby groups tried to boycott this Charter with the help from oil- and coal-producing nations and succeeded to keep energy out of the Rio Conference on Environment & Development (Earth Summit) in 1992, to continue this game in all Climate Conferences in Berlin, Kyoto, The Hague and Marrakech, where the USA boycotted the Kyoto protocol and still ignores the Charter.The financial conflict of interest behind the Cop 21-Paris summit-with about 20 percent of the budget brought corporations-is basically an open secret. Corporate Accountability International (CAI) has mapped out the connections between energy corporations sponsoring the event, policymakers, and international bodies to show exactly how well choreographed the conference has become: back-channel diplomatic horse trading, showcases for ""business innovation,"" a perfunctory nod to ""civil society groups"" and a tightly controlled smattering of protesters.CAI analyzes four major COP21 sponsors that have seized Paris as a prime business opportunity. These companies have lately eschewed historical associations with polluting fuels and proclaimed their commitment to progressive investment in clean energy. But CAI argues sponsorship deals let ""corporations responsible for causing the climate crisis green-wash their brands while continuing to make no meaningful changes to their polluting operations.""Ahead of (COP 22If the ruling elite can't imagine climate talks without the influence of polluters' money, how can we imagine a world without dirty fuels?

"COP22","Bangladesh","COP22_Bangladesh76","Time for government to rethink about Rampal plant plan","December 8, 2016 Thursday","The News Today (Bangladesh.)","It is time perhaps that the government authorities made a pause in the drive to push through the most widely objected project in Bangladesh for a rethink. The government should at least try for clearing a thickening mist surrounding the project. Such an imperative is created by a United Nations (UN) agency United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO)'s call for a halt, and a broad union in a body or mass at home as its corroborator. The UNESCO pull came at an advanced stage of the spadework on the Rampal thermal power plant in the vicinity of the Sundarbans.The spadework on the Rampal so far has been done brushing aside consistent protests by environmental experts and concerned civic groups as well as politicians in opposition and even in the broad ruling coalition. The anti-Rampal mass demonstrations particularly by the left-leaning fronts of politicians and conscious and concerned environmentalists as well and national interest-preservation volunteers have often turned into police-protester clashes. But these turned into little avail in deterring the government from its resolve for executing the ruinous coal-fired power plant under joint venture with an Indian company.When the former ruling party Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) took a public stand in opposition to the thermal power plant near the world-heritage-site Sundarbans, the ruling prime minister (PM) herself appeared on the media in an address to the nation to defend the government stand. ""It'll go as planned"", the ruling PM had said, apparently as a rebutter to former PM and BNP chief and other opponents' contentions over the 1320-megawatt harmful power project. The government was all set to strike a deal with India on the financing of the plant at the stage of project processing. But the campaigners in protest fear that it would be detrimental to the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest Sundabans. The joint-venture Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company Ltd (BIFCL) has signed the loan agreement in July 2016 with the state-run Exim Bank of India, and the physical work on the power plant was started shortly afterwards.The red signal came from the UNESCO, setting off squalls of brainstorming talk over the possible boon and bane that may be packed in the project, wittingly or unwittingly. The government side logically has to go on the back-foot as the state minister for power said the government would give an analytical reply to a latest UNESCO letter carrying its concerns and call for a halt. Core contents of the UNESCO report titled, ""Report on the mission to the Sundarbans World Heritage Site, Bangladesh"", were recently published in newspapers.The three-member mission visiting Bangladesh from March 22-28, 2016 prepared the report based on consultations with different parties. Subsequently it was sent to the government in time.The UNESCO called for the government to relocate the plant to a ""more suitable location"" where it would not have a negative impact on the Sundarbans. It noted that the human-heritage forest along the Bay of Bengal was already facing serious shortage of freshwater flows as the sweet-water flows dropped alarmingly following construction of the Farakka barrage by India. It led to the rise in salinity and siltation in the Sundarbans - the precious gift of Almighty Allah. Salt-tolerant species are expanding replacing other natural varieties.The UN mission identified four core potential threats to the Sundarbans from the construction and operation of the Rampal thermal power plant in the vicinity of Sundarbans. They are (i) pollution from coal ash through air; (ii) pollution from wastewater and waste ash; (iii) increased shipping and dredging; and (iv) the cumulative impact of industrial and related development infrastructures. The report also said associated activities which are already going on around the Rampal power-plant site will also harm the world's largest mangrove forest. It also warned against unplanned development in coastal area. The World Heritage Site Sundarbans has Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) and the government should introduce a system that allows management of the forest in a more integrated manner. The UNESCO in 1997 declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.The UN mission also recommended the government to halt the site development for the Orion power plant in Khulna and any similar proposed development until independent, comprehensive and scientifically sound environmental impact assessment (EIA) is conducted.The state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, after inaugurating a workshop on research in power and energy sector at Bidyut Bhaban in Dhaka, told inquisitive reporters that the government would respond to the UNESCO letter, ""stating our position over its concern on the Rampal power plant"". He hoped that getting the government response, the UN body would understand that there is no actual reason for concern - thereby dropping an indication that the process could continue. Some other Awami League (AL) senior politicians - apart from the junior minister - and associated intellectuals as well as energy journalists went on narrating the merits of the project and playing down the demerits being focused by the protesters.They viewed such UN body sanctions are not binding. An AL lawmaker in a TV talk- show went to the extent of questioning: ""Does any UN agency feed the teeming millions in Bangladesh?"" The campaigners, he quipped, want people to go back to the times of lighting with lanterns. An opposition politician from the international affairs wing of the BNP put up a tooth-and-nail fight against the logic pressed by a government-side politician, who presides over the parliamentary standing committee on food ministry, in favour of going ahead with the Rampal power project. The state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, in support of the project under his ministry, mentioned that the government had planned the power plant as part of its effort to ensure electricity to every household within 2018.The protesters, on the other hand, made it clear that they do appreciate the government recipe for electricity augmentation, but not at the cost of the Sundarbans that cannot be replicated while the plant can be relocated to any other site. The National Committee on Protection of oil, gas, power and ports in a latest development virtually toned down their stance as they pleaded for building a plant, even if there, based on bio-fuels instead of coal that needs to be imported through the Sundarbans water channels. The UNESCO stand, however, looks yet tougher.It requested the government to conduct a revised EIA before going ahead with the Rampal power plant. Also, the government has been requested to submit a revised EIA report with the advice note of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Earlier in Bonn, Germany, in the 39th annual meeting held in 2015 the UNESCO had requested the government to undertake a comprehensive Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in order to assess the indirect and cumulative impact from power plants and other developments in the vicinity of the Sundarbans.The latest and third representation to the government, the UN body's stance is being propped up by a wider coalition of campaigners, including one of the largest political parties of the country. The UNESCO's last word puts Rampal thermal power plant project at a crossroads, leaving two options for the Bangladesh government: ditch it or lose the World Heritage Site status of the Sundarbans. The first is dispensable, not the second in common consent. So, the choice is crucial. In its latest opinionated report, the UNESCO virtually has served an ultimatum like this: roll back the coal-fired power project from the vicinity of the one-of-its-kind of mangrove forest or it (UNESCO) will take back Sundarbans' crown of universal glory.The 41st session of the World Heritage Committee in 2017 in Istanbul will take a decision as to whether the Sundarbans will be put on the list of ""World Heritage in Danger"". Meanwhile, the authorities in India also apparently face a test of their wisdom over the power project as the campaigners have submitted an ""open letter"" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through the country's mission in Dhaka for reconsidering the joint venture. Those who did it, interestingly, are not the ones from traditional India-bashing camps. Rather many of them, especially the leftwing political elements, might have party-to-party or people-to-people contacts in India.And their like-minded quarters and media across the border are also reported to have taken a stand on this issue that corroborates the views of the campaigners in Bangladesh. There have been many an environmentalist movements in India against projects, including coal-fired ones, which they deemed would harm the ecology.In some cases, the entrepreneurs had to take recourse to a retreat. On the home front, the anti-Rampal thermal power plant demonstrations have long been carried on particularly by a left-leaning front of politicians and national interest-preservation volunteers, sometimes erupting into police-protester clashes. A heavy extra weight has been added to the relentless campaign from the political front with a former ruling party, BNP, announcing its plan for leading a long march towards Rampal.The latest stance of the BNP, which had led a violent boycott movement against the last general election, on agitation against the Indo-Bangladesh joint-venture power plant, came as its demand in support of the greens fell flat. Thus what had started off as a protest by some left-leaning political groups has by now grew into a broader coalition cutting across varied political ideologies with a spontaneous alignment with the UN systems' cultural organ UNESCO. The opposition political front the BNP in a press conference fully supported the UNESCO position and demanded relocation of the plant. Activists of the leftwing allies of the AL also join in street protests and the Workers Party, a part of the ruling government, also called for relocation of the project.Many argue that the government would be ill advised to stand as an ivory tower alienated from all else with its prudent agenda of enhancing power generation to meet fast-growing needs. True, power is considered a vital development matrix in the modern times. It is evident that a country which consumes the highest amount of electricity is the most developed one of nations in economic terms. On this count, it is still the United States (US) that tops the development pyramid. But power development should not be at the cost of a World Heritage Site like the Sundarbans.Meanwhile, the government side, seemingly left with support from only the ruling party and a few energy journalists, has scaled up media campaign emphatically by involving young faces against what is being described as follies of old-school campaigners. They are calling for support to the government development strides through carrying on the power-generation mega-plan. In reply to repeated representation to the government for rethinking the setting up of thermal power plant because of its impact on the flora and fauna of the World Heritage Site, the government has also come up with clarification that the project has been undertaken following proper environmental impact assessment and ultra super-critical technology is being used to ensure that the plant does not have any adverse effect on the mangrove forest. Following governmental disagreement with the recommendation, UNESCO reaffirmed its stand. Experts, environmentalists and researchers have also listed hard facts and figures to highlight the damage the 1320-megawatt coal-fired power plant might do to the forest.They say the ultra-super-critical technology being talked about will not make the project pollution-free. The focus is on what technology can be used to prevent the air pollution, water pollution and solid waste pollution. But the government swept aside all reasoning as ""unfounded, untrue and anti-development"".This unique forest the Sundarbans, replete with its rare biodiversity, has been a matter of great pride to Bangladesh. But now UNESCO forewarns an action in reversal which analysts forecast would have other major collateral damage to national interest. What are those like?The nation loses the glory of possessing a unique UN recognition - World Heritage Site - along with a package of upkeep funds for its maintenance. It also risks being classed as a contributor to global warming and climate change and, hence, may lose the claim to climate-change compensation funds due as a worst victim of global climate change caused by rich country's by way of spewing excessive greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.It will prove a heavily losing tradeoff in the end, the critics say only about the monetary aspects. And with the Sundarbans, there cannot be any tradeoff whatsoever - you cannot create another Sundarbans. A journalist leader reminded that UNESCO is an important organization, a universal cultural body, so its ""views should be considered with due importance"".Despite all the considerations crediting the government's power agenda, a consensus is building up on the need for the government high-ups to get down to weighing the latest developments. The wise words of a senior journalist, who otherwise is associated with the pro-ruling camp of journalists amid divisions among the professionals, hold some substance.He told a televised talk on the raging controversies that ""I don't agree, I'm not obliged to comply - this type of intransigence cannot be judicious now"". But on the prime minister's return from the US after attending the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session she again came up with government stand for the last.

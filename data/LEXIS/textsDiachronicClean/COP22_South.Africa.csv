SACAU CEO Ishmael Sunga is one of the several high-profile African speakers who will be speaking on Africa Day Side Events at COP 22 on 16 November 2016. The day will open with a high-level panel discussion on Implementing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in Africa: Moving from Commitment to Action with speakers from the African Union Commission (AUC), UNECA, African Development Bank (AfDB), President of African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN), and the Pan-African Parliament. Sunga will be speaking during a panel discussion on the Implementation of regional climate smart agriculture approaches: the case of East and Southern Africa at a side event. The session will look at the barriers preventing smallholder farmers from improving their livelihood in the face of negative climate change impact, how systems in which they operate can be strengthened to facilitate transformative change, and how to address youth involvement and gender parity. Other panelists include Hon Oppah C.Z. Muchinguri (Minister, Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, Republic of Zimbabwe) and Golden Mahove (Deputy Team Leader and Agricultural Development Facility Lead, Vuna). Farmers in southern Africa are at the front-line of this catastrophe, and are arguably the worst affected, said Sunga before his departure for COP22 . Implementing the the Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement, which commits governments to a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change, came into force last week after the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was achieved when 94 of the 197 parties ratified the convention on 5 October. Part of the agenda for COP22 is to discuss new efforts and implementation plans of the Paris Agreement concluded at the COP21 conference in December 2015. Climate change and droughts affect agriculture in Southern Africa and there is a need to devise mechanisms to mitigate against their impact, said Sunga. If we are serious about feeding our continent, then we need to take a fresh look at developing and modernising agriculture to increase its productivity. A drought survey conducted by SACAU in early 2016, showed that the Southern Africa region had a food security crisis causing an increase in the size of the highly food insecure population. Lack of rainfall and dry weather conditions in the region also contributed to an estimated 630,000 livestock deaths across the region. SACAU hopes that the COP22 conference will provide strategic solutions that will develop African farmers and provide long-term goals for agricultural development. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa2","Africa Day at COP22: moving forward on climate change commitment","November 21, 2016 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","The Africa Day event had the dual themes of 'Moving from Commitment to Action with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)£nd 'The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative: Moving Forward'... President Alpha Cond\'e9 of the Republic of Guinea presided over the High Level gathering also attended by the Presidents of Botswana, Ian Khama; Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf; Togo, Faure Gnassingbe; Ministers from the continent; heads of Pan African Institutions; the African Union Commission; the African Development Bank; the Economic Commission for Africa; NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency and; development partners. The Africa Day event had the dual themes of Moving from Commitment to Action with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative: Moving Forward. As Climate Change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world, with Africa already experiencing some of the most severe impacts, the continent s leaders have proactively responded with the establishment of the Committee of Africa Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on Climate that have thus far, influenced global negotiations. Presence of heads of state at COP22 and the Africa Day event further demonstrated the importance placed on securing the continent s interests within the global climate governance mechanism and in defining the roadmap to reduce global temperature rise to well below 2oC goal, considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the threshold for averting dangerous changes to the climate system. COP21 in Paris in December 2015, delivered the landmark Paris Agreement in which the Intended NDCs emerged as the game changer and primary mechanism for reducing global temperature rise. To date 46 African countries have signed the Paris Agreement and 27 out of 103 countries have ratified the Agreement that entered into force on 4\~November, 2016. <strong> Action COP </strong> Africa has seized the opportunity of COP22 , dubbed the action COP , to demonstrate leadership in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, through the NDCs and in ensuring that the means of implementation, namely finance, capacity building, technology development and transfer - the cornerstones of implementation - are provided. Beyond COP22 , a critical issue is the alignment of NDCs with existing national development priorities and initiatives. Implementation will be enhanced and supported by pan- African initiatives and programmes operating through a range of partnerships, two of which are: The African Adaptation Initiative (AAI) and; the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI). The latter, supported by the governments of France and Germany, seeks to achieve at least 300 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2020. Emphasising the importance of energy access, President Cond\'e9 noted that out of 1 billion Africans 700 million have no access to energy. Since 2002, we have fought to ensure that production is accelerated and increased , and expressed satisfaction at the funding for AREI as an indicator that Europe is taking steps to deliver on commitments for implementation. Cond\'e9 said that Africa needs to develop on the basis of an energy mix, but we also need to develop fast, and the faster Africa has access to energy, the faster Africa will develop, he said. <strong>Energy pledges</strong> All these initiatives fit very well into our African Union Agenda 2063 where we want to have a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and commits Africa to pursue a sustainable development path where climate resilient programs play a major role while we protect our environment through renewable energy , said chairperson of the Africa Union Commission (AUC), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, in a statement read on her behalf by Dr Elham Mahmoud Ahmed, Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy, AU Commission. Abdalla Hamdok, ECA executive secretary a.i, emphasised the importance of aligning Africa s climate change initiatives with sustainable development, noting that, The impacts of climate change in Africa are increasing in complexity resulting in new and emerging threats to lives and livelihoods, catalysing new migration dynamics, disasters and conflict and lost economic opportunities. Egypt s Minister of Environment and President of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN), Mohammed Fahmy, also welcomed the initiatives and encouraged good governance and transparency as the foundation of implementation. COP21 and 22 Presidents, Segol\'e8ne Royal of France and Salaheddine Mezouar of Morocco, also participated in the event. This is an African COP, the biggest economies must fulfil their commitments to Africa , said Royal. Mezouar, COP22 President, said Africa must and will electrify at the lowest cost , and that the COP 22 roadmap should respond to the issues of financing, access to electricity and capacity building to increase the success of projects . , Further emphasising that it was time to put an end to clich\'e9s about African countries ability to carry out projects. \"

A collaborative partnership between the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the African Union Commission (AUC), the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the New Partnership for Africa s Development (NEPAD), established the Africa Pavilion in the blue zone of the COP22 village, dedicated to engagement, networking and dialogue. The Pavilion also aimed to provide a platform for the voices of the continent to be heard. The Pavilion embodied the united front of an Africa speaking with one voice in articulating its interests given the high stakes of climate change negotiations Over the two weeks of COP22 , the Africa Pavilion will feature a dynamic program of round-tables, conferences and bilateral meetings, where key issues of adaptation and mitigation; green industrialisation; agriculture; transport; health; water and sanitation; biodiversity and innovation will be discussed. Both COP21 President and French Minister of the Environment, Energy and the Sea, in charge of international climate negotiations, Segol\'e8ne Royal, and COP22 President and Moroccan Minister of Foreign, Salaheddine Mezouar, visited the Africa pavilion in the early days of COP22 . The pavilion is drawing crowds with its unique architecture and interesting features such as living green walls. Several African heads of State and high level officials are also expected to visit the pavilion during the High level week of COP22 , and especially on Africa Day, Wednesday 16 November 2016. COP22 is the fourth COP to take place on African soil - the second time in Morocco presenting an important opportunity to place special emphasis on the continent s needs and proposals. Africa is among the world s regions most vulnerable to climate change and its key priorities include ensuring that global ambitions and historic responsibilities regarding means of implementation, particularly predictable financing, to facilitate low carbon climate resilient development are in line with the continent s development goals. COP22 is dubbed the COP of action, providing a clear roadmap for the implementation of commitments made in the Paris Agreement which came into force on 4 November 2016. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa4","COP22 host Morocco's mosques are going green","September 7, 2016 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","Two months before it hosts the COP22 climate conference, Morocco is preparing to launch an ambitious project to turn its mosques green as a commitment to clean energy... The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs announced a tender in mid-August to modify 64 mosques initially in six of the kingdom's cities to reduce the energy they consume. Its goal is a 40% reduction in energy costs at 15,000 mosques around the country that consume an average of 90KW a day, said the SIE state energy investment company. Studies have shown that energy consumption can be cut by 60%, with estimates showing savings of as much as 68% at Rabat's majestic As-Sunna mosque. This can be achieved through energy-saving lighting, photovoltaic electricity generation and solar water heating, and without harming the appearance of the mosques. The upgrades will also benefit the faithful, with access to hot water for washing and air conditioning available in prayer rooms, said SIE. Another upshot would be the ""strong social impact"" through the creation of 5,000 jobs and a new growth market, it said. ""The return of the investment made will be based on the energy savings achieved."" German development organisation GIZ, which supports the project, describes it as a ""win-win"" situation that will also raise awareness of renewable and efficient energy in Morocco. ""It is based on the idea that Moroccan companies... involved in these mosques will be repaid through savings made by the building manager,"" says GIZ's Jan-Christoph Kuntze. All of the technology needed is ""already available on the local market"", he said, adding that this gave the project the potential to create jobs. ""The mosques can play a multiplier role"" of raising awareness about the need to save energy and adapt to cleaner sources. King Mohammed VI has pushed a proactive policy of environmental awareness in the northwest African country of nearly 34-million people, 99% of whom are Muslim. Marrakesh will host the next world climate conference, COP22 , from November 7 to 18. One of the main challenges for Morocco, which hosted COP7 in 2001, is to ratify the Paris Agreement signed last year by 195 countries to fight global warming. COP22 will ""highlight the country's commitment to work for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and to continue to support developing countries... affected by the impact of climate change"", Mohammed said in a speech in June. The king was behind an ambitious plan launched in 2009 to develop renewables and enable the country bereft of hydrocarbons to support nearly half of its energy needs this way. The ultimate aim is to raise the share of renewable energy to 52% of all consumption. Central to this was the opening of Noor I - the first stage of what will be the largest solar power plant in the world - near Ouarzazate on the edge of the Sahara desert. As Morocco counts down to COP22 , its people are being exposed more and more to events and initiatives showcasing the country's involvement in protecting the planet. Its ""green mosques"" project is expected to take centre stage in the drive for change being highlighted at the conference. Source: AFP \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa5","COP 22 - Developing Nations Seek Acceleration of Climate Action","November 29, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, Manasvi Srisodapol, Special Representative of the chair of the Group of 77, told the joint closing plenary of the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties ( COP-22 ) in Marrakech that the needs of the developing countries should be given the highest priority for two reasons: they bear the brunt of the increasing adverse effects of climate change, and they are also the least equipped to cope with this problem on their own. ""It is of utmost importance for us to send a clear message to the global community that we must all be part of the global climate solution,"" he said at the conclusion of the meeting on November 18. ""We are pleased that the Marrakech Conference was able to achieve some clarity, and good progress has been made."" This include the adoption of the Terms of Reference and initial work plan for the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB); the established linkage between technology mechanism and the financial mechanism; the indicative framework for the five-year rolling work plan of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM); and the conclusion of the Third Comprehensive Review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building under the Convention and under the Kyoto Protocol. Nonetheless, he warned, there remain outstanding issues which require further discussion after Marrakech. The Group has placed a priority on scaling up of finance, in particular adaptation finance. ""There can be no enhanced action without enhanced support. Support enables action and action needs support. Enhanced action needs enhanced support in the provision of scaled-up financial resources, technology and capacity-building. Action must cover both adaptation and mitigation,"" the Special Representative declared. He reiterated that adaptation is a matter of urgency for developing countries whose capacities to carry out actions to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change are limited. ""We therefore urge that progress in implementing the Paris Agreement must reflect balance between adaptation and mitigation."" He said: ""We came to Marrakech with a challenging task, the challenge of turning agreements into action. COP22 can indeed be considered a ""COP for action"". The speedy and unprecedented entry into force of the Paris Agreement signals the level of urgency and importance with which our leaders and the international community attach to combating climate change. ""We are here to accelerate climate actions, and this has been underscored by the Marrakesh Action Proclamation which we endorsed yesterday and the tireless efforts of the High Level Champions over the past year."" After nearly four years, only 73 parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance to the Doha Amendment. The Group reiterates that the unfinished business of the pre-2020 actions and ambition, which are long overdue, must be urgently addressed. The Group sees the Kyoto Protocol as a fundamental building block in its post-2020 efforts. ""We urge all Parties that have not done so to ratify the Doha Amendment expeditiously."" Meanwhile, speaking earlier on behalf of Group of 77 and China, Surasak Karnjanarat, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Kingdom of Thailand, declared that countries of the Group of 77 and China have been the most affected by the adverse impacts of climate change. ""Yet we are taking ambitious measures in line with our capacities. Developed countries must support our endeavors,"" he said. Reiterating the G77 stand, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on developed countries to deliver on their pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 in support of climate action by developing countries. The Climate Change Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November 2016, was years ahead of expectations, Ban said, with 111 countries, accounting for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions having ratified the agreement. The Secretary-General applauded the bold leadership shown by many of the world's most vulnerable countries, many of whom are in Africa, to strengthen their ambition and to move as quickly as possible toward a one-hundred-percent clean energy, climate-resilient future. Karnjanarat said the Group of 77 would like to highlight the implementation phase of the Paris Agreement, as applicable to Parties that ratify the Agreement: First, the delicate balance achieved in Paris must be preserved. It is crucial to ensure transparency, inclusiveness, Party-driven process, and balance of all issues and across all work plans of subsidiary bodies. ""We must reaffirm the provisions and principles of the Convention, in particular, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as reflected in the Paris Agreement."" Second, there is an urgent need to enhance the pre-2020 ambition, including the expeditious ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to provide a strong basis for post-2020 efforts under the Paris Agreement. Third, capacity-building support for climate action is critical for developing countries and should be based on and responsive to national needs, foster country ownership, participatory, and cross-cutting. Fourth, developing countries require additional, adequate, predictable and sustainable climate financing to transform our economies to climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions. The Group noted the efforts by developed countries for the formulation of a roadmap to achieve the floor of $100 billion per year by 2020. ""We reiterate our call for developed country Parties to enhance ambition on the provision and mobilization of support, and to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation finance, including by setting a target to quadruple resources allocated to adaptation from public and grant-based sources by 2020."" Fifth, technology development and transfer is also vital. Technology mechanism needs to be enhanced to support the rapid transfer of technologies from developed countries to developing countries, helping them to innovate and develop their own technologies. Concrete enhanced actions on technology development and transfer and strengthening of the linkages between the technology mechanism and the financial mechanism is required. He also pointed out that direct access of all developing country parties of the convention and Paris Agreement to means of implementation, including finance, technology transfer and capacity building provided by multilateral supporting mechanism, should be simplified and granted. ""For us, adaptation remains a priority. Developing countries are the least contributors to climate change, however, we are the most affected. In order to increase adaptive capacity and resilience, we require the implementation of guarantees of the Paris Agreement in terms of the means of implementation"". He said the Group remains ever committed to addressing climate change and looks forward to a clear and strong outcome of COP22 . At the conclusion at COP-22 , the Secretary-General said decisions adopted in Marrakech ""powerfully reaffirms continued strong global support for the Paris Agreement on climate change and demonstrates the determination of all governments to implement the agreement as quickly as possible."" He noted that all countries understand that climate action is essential for their security, economic prosperity and the health and well-being of their citizens. Global cooperation rooted in strong national action is essential, the Secretary-General said, pointing out that no country, irrespective of its size or strength, is immune from the impacts of climate change, and no country can afford to tackle the climate challenge alone. \"

To make good on their promise, the two companies have launched a plan to deploy nearly 1,000 solar kits in Senegal, C\'f4te d'Ivoire and Cameroon. Several villages in rural areas have been identified to participate in the first phase of this pilot programme, prior to deployment on a larger scale. The kits include a solar panel connected to a battery that can be used to provide domestic appliances with electricity. They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralised source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones. This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, Engie will supply the solar kits and take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via Orange Money. The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by installment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"

Deputy director-general of climate change and air quality Judy Beaumont conveyed this message at the stakeholder consultation forum for the event known as COP22 at the Voortrekker Monument. COP22 starts on Monday. ""You are all aware that 2015 was a special year on the international calendar. The world agreed to both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,"" Beaumont told delegates. ""This was largely due to an increasing realisation globally of the seriousness of the challenge posed by climate change... The simple truth is that climate change is already here today, and we are bearing the brunt of it. ""It is particularly devastating for us in the developing world, and specifically in Africa, and particularly for the vulnerable sectors of our population."" Beaumont said at present South Africa and Nigeria were the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Africa. For South Africa, emissions per capita were higher than in most other major emerging economies, including Brazil, China, and India. ""This has triggered a number of policy initiatives across government, driven by various departments, and highly successful renewable energy programmes..."" Beaumont said the National Climate Change Response White Paper provided the framework for climate change policy in South Africa. The policy recognised South Africa as a significant contributor to global climate change and that it was extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to the country's socio-economic and environmental context. ""Fortunately, as well as the abundance of coal, South Africa is also blessed with some of the best renewable energy resources in the world."" Beaumont said South Africa continued to contribute immensely to finding a global solution to the climate change problem. ""It is very important that the South African team goes to Marrakesh with a thoroughly discussed and carefully considered position,"" she said. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa8","\'e2\u8364 \u8249 COP22 raises the question how SA will achieve its goals","November 3, 2016","Mail & Guardian","COMMENT Nearly 200 countries will convene in Marrakech, Morocco, on Monday to advance progress made on the Paris Agreement on climate change.The agreement will enter into force on Friday, signalling a true global effort to tackle the climate challenge. The 22nd Conference of the Parties meeting ( COP22 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change represents a crucial opportunity for member countries to demonstrate their commitments on climate change.From November 7-18, COP22 must develop rules and processes for implementing the agreement to clarify and define operational elements for key issues covered in it. This is crucial to ensure that the global temperature rise is limited to well below 2\'c2\'b0C, the minimum that climate scientists believe is required to prevent serious climate-related consequences. By the end of October, 86 countries, including China, India and the United States, had ratified the agreement. Together, these countries represent 61% of global greenhouse gas emissions. When a country ratifies the agreement, it commits itself to the decisive actions and policies outlined in its own national climate strategy. This nationally determined contribution (NDC) lays the foundation for actions and investment pathways towards clean energy, green infrastructure and climate resilience.Countries that have joined are legally bound by the agreement. Its provisions include the requirement for all countries to report their climate actions transparently, collectively take stock of progress (starting in 2018) and enhance their climate actions every five years, while also scaling up finance for it.Countries that have ratified the agreement become part of its governing body, called the CMA, with authority over all procedural and operational matters. The first meeting of this body (CMA1) will be held in conjunction with COP22 , marking the start of decision-making on how to \'c2\£dimplement the agreement and adopt its rules. CMA1 must ensure that the parties have adequate time to embed their NDCs in national legislation and policy, especially many developing countries that have complicated internal processes for ratification, such as South Africa, Nigeria, Angola and Sudan. One option is to extend CMA1 beyond the meeting in Marrakech, and to set a clear deadline to conclude it. The likely points of contention at COP22 include how exactly national commitments will be monitored and verified, and the global requirements for reporting on climate action. Clarity is also needed on the plan to raise $100-billion in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. Current pledges from developed countries are insufficient. Questions also remain about the future of the Adaptation Fund, set to end in 2020. Last year South Africa submitted its national plan, which included an emissions reduction target of between 398 and 614 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent over the period 2025-2030, largely conditional on significant amounts of external assistance. South Africa is yet to ratify the agreement.Despite praise for South Africa's renewable energy independent power producer programme, questions remain over how South Africa will achieve its climate targets given its continued reliance on coal. Marrakech presents an opportunity for South Africa to reiterate its intention to ratify the agreement and do its part to curb climate change. But the domestic approval of the agreement still requires a process to ensure public participation and transparency, and a demonstrated commitment to poverty alleviation and green growth. Even though South Africa has a responsibility to act, based on its historical emissions, it is currently experiencing low economic growth and budgetary restraints. South Africans are also awaiting the treasury's decision on the draft carbon tax Bill.Despite the momentum built up over the Paris Agreement, international efforts must be coupled with continued progress by countries at home to deliver on their national climate plans. The Moroccan COP president, Salaheddine Mezouar, must accommodate parties that are genuinely committed to the process but are still awaiting the necessary domestic approval. There is much work still ahead to turn the transformational promise of the agreement into reality. Romy Chevallier and Elizabeth Aardenburg are senior researcher and visiting research assistant respectively at the South African Institute of International Affairs. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa9","New Fund Aims to Help Build Resilience to Climate Change","November 18, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The world has been too slow in responding to climate events such as El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a, and those who are the ""least responsible are the ones suffering most"", Mary Robinson, the special envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, told IPS at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ). ""I've seen a window into a 'new normal' and it is very serious."" -- Mary Robinson During the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Robinson strongly advocated for engaging community-led solutions and for incorporating gender equality and women's participation in the climate talks. ""Global warming is accelerating too much and it is being aggravated by El Ni\'f1o and La Ni\'f1a. They do not have to become a humanitarian disaster, but people have now been left to cope for themselves... I think we were too slow in many instances and this has become a humanitarian disaster for the 60 million people who are food insecure and suffering from droughts,"" she said. El Ni\'f1o has been directly associated with droughts and floods in many parts of the world that have severely impacted millions of livelihoods. A warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific waters, the phenomenon occurs on average every three to seven years and sea surface temperatures across the Pacific can warm more than 1 degree C. El Ni\'f1o is a natural occurrence, but scientists believe it is becoming more intense as a result of global warming. How El Ni\'f1o interacts with climate change is not 100 percent clear, but many of the countries that are now experiencing El Ni\'f1o are also vulnerable to climate variations. According to Robinson, El Ni\'f1o and its climate-linked emergencies are a threat to human security and, therefore, a threat to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced in September 2015 as the 2030 Agenda replacing the Millennium Development Goals. ""I have gone to Central America to the dry corridor in Honduras and have seen women crying because there is no water and they feel very neglected. They feel they are left behind and that nobody seems to know about them. I saw in Ethiopia severely malnourished children, it could affect them for life in terms of being stunted. The same thing in southern Africa. I feel I've seen a window into a 'new normal' and it is very serious. We need to understand the urgency of taking the necessary steps,"" Robinson said. Drought and flooding associated with El Ni\'f1o created enormous problems across East Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Pacific. Ethiopia, where Robinson has visited earlier this year, is experiencing its worst drought in half a century. One million children in Eastern and Southern Africa alone are acutely malnourished. It is very likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015, according to an assessment released at the COP22 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary data shows that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El Ni\'f1o event. These long-term changes in the climate have exacerbated social, humanitarian and environmental pressures. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees pointed that in 2015, more than 19 million new displacements were associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence. ""We need a much more concerted response and fund preparedness. If we have a very strategic early warning system, we can deal with the problem much more effectively. Building resilience in communities is the absolute key. We need to invest in support for building resilience now rather than having a huge humanitarian disaster,"" stressed Robinson. On Nov. 17, during the COP22 in Marrakech, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) - a coalition led by France, Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada launched at the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015 - announced a new goal to mobilise more than 30 million dollars by July 2017 and 100 million by 2020. The international partnership aims to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific. The idea is to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events. There will be a special focus on women, who are particularly vulnerable to climate menaces but are the protagonists in building resilience. ""Now we've moved from the Paris negotiations to implementation on the ground. Building resilience is key and it must be done in a way that is gender sensitive with full account of gender equality and also human rights. We must recognize the role of women as agents for change in their communities,"" Robinson emphasised. The number of climate-related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years, said Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction. ""This initiative will help reduce the impact of these events on low and middle-income countries which suffer the most,"" he said. Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS, ""We can see already in Africa the impact of climate change that is undermining our efforts to bring food security for all. Take the example of El Ni\'f1o that has affected all of Africa in the last two years. Countries that had made fantastic progress like Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar are now suffering hunger again. Countries that have eradicated hunger are back to face it again. We need to adapt."" Climate change has different impacts on men and women, girls and boys, told IPS Edith Ofwona, the senior program specialist at International Development Research Centre (IDRC). ""Gender is critical. We must recognise it is not about women alone,"" she said. ""[But] women are important because they provide the largest labour force, mainly in the agricultural sector. It is important to appreciate the differences in the impacts, the needs in terms of response. There is need for balance, affirmative action and ensuring all social groups are taken into consideration."" \"

Adopted by 196 parties to the UNFCCC last December, the Paris Agreement, named after the French capital where it was approved by the previous conference, known as COP 21, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2\'c2\'baC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\'c2\'baC. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55\'e2\€  percent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific \'e2\€ \£8thresholds. The agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , which has been under way since November 7. Before the meeting wraps up on Saturday, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. Ban said that the UN would help countries implement the agreement and he called on developed countries ""to honour their commitment to mobilise climate finance - $100bn (R140bn) by 2020 - to help developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate vulnerability"". The UN chief also said that after a decade of making sure climate change was at the top of the international agenda, he would leave delegations with some key lessons: 1.\'e2\€  Multilateral solutions work; acting together, countries achieve more than they ever could alone. 2.\'e2\€  Heads of states and government must take the lead. 3.\'e2\€  Whole societies must get engaged. 4.\'e2\€  The UN must continue to champion science. 5.\'e2\€  Solutions must be funded and expanded. 6.\'e2\€  The UN must continue advancing the moral cause for action. The president of the UN General Assembly, Peter Thomson, encouraged all parties to the Paris Agreement to implement and enhance ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) ""without delay"". \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa11","The rubber will hit the road for developing countries at COP22 in Marrakech","November 4, 2016 Friday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The main objective of the Paris Climate Agreement is to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2\'b0C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5... Temperatures across Africa, however, are rising. This year marks the moment when carbon dioxide officially passed the symbolic 400 parts per million (ppm) mark. And, according to scientists, it will not return to below this in our lifetimes. The safe level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 350ppm. Passing the symbolic 400ppm mark permanently is a clear sign that mean annual temperature rise in Africa is likely to exceed 2\'b0C by the end of this century. The deal struck last December under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris marked a seminal moment in the development of the international climate change regime. The deal is also an important tool in mobilising finance, technological support and capacity building for developing countries to help them cope with and tackle climate change. But the details still need to be worked out. As Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the convention said: <blockquote>while the Paris Agreement gave clear pathways and a final destination in respect to decisive action on climate change, many of the details regarding how to move forward as one global community in that common direction still need to be resolved.</blockquote> The 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) taking place in Morocco holds considerable potential to accelerate and amplify the decisions made a year ago in Paris. African concerns In Cairo earlier this year African ministers of environment and representatives of more than 45 African countries welcomed the adoption of the Paris Agreement. They emphasised that the agreement accommodated many African concerns and interests. The meeting also stressed the need for African countries to continue engaging actively in climate change negotiations to provide further guidance on the implementation of the Agreement. One of the most contentious issues on the table will be the progress towards mobilising the $100bn a year promised by developed countries to developing economies by 2020. South Africa has played a leading role in helping to secure climate financing for developing countries. Ensuring meaningful progress on reaching this $100bn target will be a key element of South Africa s proposed position in Marrakech. But there is considerable concern about the promised $100bn and where it will come from. Oxfam France recently complained that a recent meeting of European Finance Ministers gave no concrete indication about how they are going to increase the total amount of aid to meet the $100 billion objective. This omission is significant as the EU represents one of the main providers of development funding. A paper published by the Indian Ministry of Economic Affairs questioned the findings of an earlier Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report that said developed countries had mobilised $57bn of climate aid in 2013-14. Indian officials suggested that the true amount figure mobilised by rich countries may only be $2.2bn. The discrepancy is important because the OECD s report is accepted by developed countries as the basis of negotiations and evidence that there has been significant progress made towards the $100bn commitment. In Marrakech South Africa s will press for a clear pathway to realising the $100bn of climate finance per year by 2020. Mitigation and adaptation Another key element of South Africa s proposed position for the conference is adaptation. The adaptation component of Nationally Determined Commitments is central to the call by a number of developing countries, particularly in Africa, for a balanced treatment of mitigation and adaptation. South Africa believes the agreement should address vulnerability, priorities, plans and actions, implementation and support needs, as well as adaptation efforts for recognition in the case of developing countries. On mitigation, South Africa wants to see progress on the features and information contained in the Nationally Determined Contributions at COP22 . This includes the consideration of common time frames for contributions to allow for effective global stocktaking and ratcheting up of country commitments in future. This is essential if the target of 2\'b0C is to be met. South Africa has ratified the agreement along with 17 other African countries. These are Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Swaziland and Uganda. Signing the agreement requires countries to adopt it within their own legal systems through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. They are among 92 countries to have ratified the terms of the agreement. This breaks all UN records when it comes to how fast an agreement enters into force. But signatures alone won t do the trick. Hard decisions must be made, and commitments must be backed up by concrete action. Developing countries like South Africa will be pushing for this to happen in Marrakech. \"

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa13","At the Nexus of Water and Climate Change","September 03, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it's clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal. Here at World Water Week, which concluded on Friday, Susanne Skyllerstedt, programme officer for Water, Climate Change and Development at the Global Water Partnership (GWP), says her organisation is working with Sub-Saharan African governments to incorporate adaptation strategies into the partnership's climate change programme. ""For us, resolutions of COP21 are part and parcel of what we are implementing and those of COP22 (in Marrakech) will be embedded in our long-term agenda of ensuring water security in Africa and rest of the developing world in a bid to attain water-related sustainable development goals,"" she told IPS. GWP is a Stockholm-based organisation that has been involved in fostering integrated water resource management around the world for the last 20 years. GPS has four regional offices in Africa covering Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa. As an inter-governmental entity, GWP works with organisations involved in water resources management. These range from national government's institutions, United Nations agencies to funding bodies. Other stakeholders include professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector. GWP has a water and climate change programme to support governments on water security and climate change resilience. Already, said Skyllerstedt, GWP has a programme that was started in Africa through the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) together with the African Union Commission and other development partners. The programme has been a key platform for supporting African governments. These include support on national climate change adaptation programmes more so in the sphere of policy formulation. For Sub-Saharan Africa countries noted for vulnerability to impacts of global climate change, the programme is key in supporting climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Through monitoring and evaluation programmes conducted in the recent past, GWP has learned vital lessons and is cognisant of areas that need more resources to achieve the desired goals. Already, she said, GWP is running a three-year programme on climate change aimed at achieving sustainable development goals linked to water, energy and food through climate resilience. She said they are implementing initiatives aimed at enabling countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to acquire highly relevant technologies on sustainable water management. ""We have demo programmes on new technologies being implemented by our partners in Africa but they need to be scaled up to have a major impact,"" she said. GWP is also addressing the challenge of water pollution, to ensure availability of cleaner water for human consumption and other uses. It is collaborating with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to promote water security and hygiene. ""The aim is to incorporate water, sanitation and hygiene component in climate resilience,"" Skyllerstedt explained. GWP is also developing tools for better planning on water, sanitation and hygiene to help communities during calamities such as floods. ""We have an urban planning project focusing on urban water systems and infrastructure we work with national government and other partners on issues planning putting into consideration matters of access to water and sanitation facilities as well as water related calamities. At the same time GWP collaborates with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on drought and flood monitoring. ""We work with experts and stakeholders to ensure national plans take into account climate change-related hazards,"" Skyllerstedt said. ""Many African countries face challenges in fighting impacts of extreme weather such as floods and droughts, and here is where the adaption programme is relevant."" For the next three years GWP intends to widen its support to encompass not only national climate change adaptation programmes but also Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that countries published prior to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. ""National Adaptation Programmes (NAPs) and NDCs should be merged to avoid duplications,"" she observed. The biggest challenge to implementation of GWP programmes by its partners in Africa and elsewhere remains access to financial resources. ""During the COP21 in Paris last year, there were lots of pledges on financing initiatives for enhancing water security and its access by the poor. Unfortunately, our partners are not able to access the money due technical bottlenecks,"" she said. The situation has compelled GWP to embark on enhancing the capacity of their partners in Africa in the spheres of project design as well as making of investment plans and strategies. Skyllerstedt spoke to IPS during the World Water Week held in Stockholm, Sweden from 28 Aug. 28 to Sep. 2 and organised by the Stockholm International Water Institute. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa14","Very strange venue for COP22; Morocco has the presidency for climate change talks - yet illegally occupies the territory \'e2\u8364 \'a8of unconsulted people who are among ....","November 15, 2016 Tuesday","The Mercury (South Africa)","When we talk about climate justice, the first thing that comes to mind is the plight of small island states, which contri-\'e2\€ \£8bute little to global warming but suffer its worst impacts. Or perhaps we think of climate-vulnerable countries like \'e2\€ \£8Pakistan, where millions are at risk of displacement owing to severe floods. But with the latest instalment of the UN climate talks under way in Marrakesh, don't forget about the people of Western Sahara right next door. Morocco has become a key player in international climate politics after assuming the presidency of this year's UN climate conference, known as COP22 . It is troubling and ironic that such an important responsibility has been entrusted to a country that has repeatedly demonstrated its profound contempt for \'e2\€ \£8international law and the UN, and that remains a brutal occupying power. Lest anyone involved in international climate politics - journalists, diplomats, or civil society actors - forget, despite an opinion from the International Court of Justice in 1975, that Morocco has no valid claim to the territory of Western Sahara, it has been illegally occupying the territory, located south of its southern border, for 40 years. And in case anyone missed the news: when last year the UN secretary-general had the temerity to refer to Morocco's occupation as ""an occupation"", Morocco responded first with massive street protests denouncing the secretary-general (the protests were attended by Moroccan government officials), and subsequently by expelling all civilian personnel from Minurso, the UN's peacekeeping mission in the \'e2\€ \£8territory. As the secretary-general made clear, Morocco's behaviour carries a serious risk of reigniting war in the region. The history of the Western Sahara occupation is complex, but a good place to start is with Minurso itself. The name stands for (in English) ""the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara."" The referendum in question was promised to the indigenous Saharawi people of Western Sahara in 1991, as part of a UN-brokered ceasefire that ended the war that they had fought with Morocco since its invasion in 1975 (after Spain, the prior colonial power, withdrew). In line with clear international norms for post-colonial transitions, the referendum will give the Saharawi the option to become an independent nation. They remain the only former colony in Africa that has not been granted this fundamental right, and the AU has repeatedly called on the UN to set a date for the referendum to occur. The Saharawi Republic is a full and founding member of the AU, while Morocco is the only country on the continent which is not a member. Since 1991, Saharawi refugees in Saharan Algeria have been waiting, in some of the most inhospitable conditions imaginable, for the referendum to be held. They have foresworn armed struggle and placed their trust in the UN, and in international law, to resolve the issue. In response, \'e2\€ \£8Morocco has repeatedly prevented the referendum from being held, flooded the Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers, and engaged in widely documented human rights abuses against indigenous Saharawi in the occupied territory. The people of Western Sahara are some of the most vulnerable in the world to climate change. Increasingly common extreme weather events amplify the hardship posed by already inhospitable conditions. Last year severe floods devastated the adobe structures of the refugee camps, destroying homes and displacing some 25 000 people. Meanwhile, Morocco is fast positioning itself as a global green energy pioneer. This is an important and admirable goal, but the fact that Morocco is actively granting new oil exploration contracts for foreign corporations to illegally drill on and off-shore in Western \'e2\€ \£8Sahara throws its true intentions into question. Already some of Morocco's renewable energy development is taking place in Western Sahara. Energy generated in Western \'e2\€ \£8Sahara - without the consent of its people - is exported back to \'e2\€ \£8Morocco. The royal palace regulates Morocco's energy market and receives significant energy contracts in the occupied territory. This contravenes the UN's legal opinion of 2002, which asserted that exploration and exploitation activities of the natural resources of Western Sahara could only be carried out in accordance with the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara. Morocco has not consulted the people of Western Sahara on its green energy projects in their territory, nor will the people of Western Sahara be the ones profiting from them. Quite simply, Morocco's actions violate international law. Left unchecked, this will further entrench the occupation and damage the peace process. The Saharawi have no interest in disrupting the essential and urgent international co-operation that is needed to deal with the climate crisis. But it is imperative that everyone involved in international climate politics understands that no country is less deserving of the honour and responsi-\'e2\€ \£8bility of guiding these crucial talks than Morocco: a country that has unilaterally expelled UN peacekeeping staff and repeatedly refused to abide by UN Security Council resolutions. At COP22 Responsible countries, journalists and members of civil society can use this opportunity to send the message that they do not condone Morocco's behaviour. Only in the face of strong international pressure will Morocco begin acting as a responsible international partner with the UN. For a start, by agreeing to return to direct negotiations with the Frente Polisario, the internationally recognised representative of the Saharawi people, towards holding a referendum as soon as possible. As a climate activist, I've dedicated much of my life to the pursuit of a safe climate future for the world. The fight against climate change is the most important challenge of our time, but it must not be used as a smokescreen to mask injustices perpetrated against some of the world's most marginalised people. l Constantinides is an international climate activist and humanitarian \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa15","Adaptation Funding a Must for Africa [analysis]","November 13, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The Paris Agreement hammered out at the summit on climate change in the French capital last year committed all parties to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. The big question at the follow-up meeting here in Marrakech is how that deal will be implemented, especially for the developing nations of Africa. ""We have three major objectives at this COP: [the first is] to set a foundation for a strong technical and legal framework of the Paris Agreement,"" said Seni Nafo, chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN). ""The second key issue is to push for accelerating action after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and lastly but not the least, ensuring finance for Africa's adaptation."" Dubbed the 'COP of Implementation,' the summit dubbed COP 22 is seen by the African group as an opportunity to refine some of Paris's unfinished business. Despite adoption last year, a number of key decisions in the PA such as modalities for achieving the 2 degree C. threshold, mechanisms to enforce compliance and achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation, among others, were deferred to COP 22 . With the deal based on Nationally Determined Contributions, it is feared the challenge of access to climate finance for Africa might get further complicated as it has been discovered that most countries' NDCs are vague, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). ""ACPC is ready to support African countries in the revision of their Nationally Determined Contributions, most of which have been found to be defective,"" James Murombedzi, Officer in Charge at ACPC told IPS, adding that his organisation wants to see an inclusive implementation of the PA. Murombedzi said this would, however, not be possible if COP 22 does not lay a strong foundation. The talk over the years has been capacity building to achieve the required levels of preparing bankable proposals in most African countries. Nevertheless, experts have urged caution even as the continent pushes for this need. According to Balgis Osman Elasha, Principal Climate Change officer at the African Development Bank, Africa should avoid the 'Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) trap' by perpetually pushing capacity building and miss out on serious climate funding opportunities. Elasha says ""Africa could not benefit from the CDM because it was caught up in the capacity building mode while others were taking action."" CDM of the Kyoto Protocol provided for emissions reduction projects aimed at assisting parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments. As highlighted, a balance between adaptation and mitigation features prominently in the negotiations. And for African economies, adaptation is not a question of the future but now. Available data shows that most countries are already facing economic challenges which are likely to be worsened by climate change effects. For example, cereal production is expected to decrease by up to 49 percent in Africa by 2050 due to the impacts of climate change, exacerbating food insecurity. And Zambia's Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Lloyd Mulenga Kaziya underscored the need for urgent action especially the improvement of hydromet services. ""Zambia is deeply affected. In the past five years, our rivers have been drying up while the frequency of droughts has increased affecting our smallholder farmers in terms of production, and to make matters worse, information flow to the affected communities is not readily available,"" said Kaziya, adding that the southern African country requires urgent support to upgrade hydromet systems and integrate them in all key sectors such as Mining, Energy and Agriculture With these critical needs identified, the AGN is determined to ensure that Africa's voice is heard at the negotiating table -- especially now as the rules and modalities for implementation are being discussed. But on its part, the continent is not seating idle. At COP 21, the Africa Renewable Initiative (AREI) was launched to pave the way for Africa's transition to inclusive green growth. AREI already has resulted in significant financial commitment of over 10 billion dollars for renewable energy projects in Africa, according to the African Development Bank, one of the partners of the initiative. The tone for Africa's demands at this year's COP was clear on day one of the event as Salahedinne Mezouar, the COP 22 President, said: ""Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change,"" underscored Mezouar, implicitly referring to Africa--the most exposed region whose contribution to global carbon emissions is just about 5 percent. As negotiations enter the second week, the African group remains optimistic that most outstanding issues, especially means of implementation, would be resolved for smooth implementation of the Paris Agreement. \"

The BASIC group of countries Brazil, India, China and South Africa meet regularly on the margins of sessions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). BASIC meetings have become an important forum for the group to coordinate positions in the international climate change negotiations and broadly support the G77 plus China group. This is the second meeting of BASIC Ministers since the adoption of the Paris Agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015. Also in attendance were HE Mr Xie Zhenhua, Special Representative for Climate Change of China, HE Mr Anil Madhav Dave, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India, and HE Ambassador Antonio Marcondes, Under Secretary-General for the Environment, Energy, Science and Technology, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Brazil.

The Ministers emphasised the importance of the upcoming COP22 as an important step in the process of implementation of the Paris Agreement and as another milestone to accelerate pre-2020 implementation. They also reaffirmed that work on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and acceleration of pre-2020 implementation should be in full accordance with the principles of equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities. The Ministers reiterated the importance of an open, transparent, inclusive and Party-driven process. Other issues highlighted and reinforced by the BASIC Ministers in their joint statement released at the conclusion of the meeting included: olRenewing their commitment to work with all Parties for COP22 to result in greater understanding and convergence on key issues related to the implementation of the Agreement, and expressed confidence that further concrete progress will be made on pre-2020 action and the global action agenda Furthermore, BASIC Ministers reiterated their commitment to strengthen the unity and advancing the common interests of the Group of 77 and China Stressing the importance of accelerating the implementation of commitments and actions in the pre-2020 period, and in particular ratifying the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and addressing the gaps on Mitigation, Adaptation and provision of Means of Implementation. In this regard, the Ministers urged developed country Parties to revisit and increase their quantified emission reduction targets and enhance provision of means of implementation to allow developing countries to scale up mitigation and adaptation efforts, in order to lay a solid foundation for post-2020 enhanced ambition and implementation. Suggesting that the Facilitative Dialogue in Marrakesh on accelerating pre-2020 implementation should be comprehensive and productive, with a view to developing further concrete recommendations on pre-2020 implementation and ambition, including by strengthening the performance of the existing institutional arrangements under the Convention. Welcoming the imminent entry into force of the Paris Agreement on 4 November 2016. They acknowledged, in particular, the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreement by many Parties, including members of BASIC. COP22 . In that sense, Ministers called for the continuation of the mandates conferred to the Ad hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement, Subsidiary Body for Implementation, Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and other constituted bodies until 2018, under the supervision of the COP, in order to prepare draft decisions to be recommended to the CMA Noting that the CMA should not conclude its first session in conjunction with COP22 , in order to give remaining Parties to the Convention time to ratify the Agreement and to make further progress on the work programme mandated by Decision 1/CP.21. Ministers called on the CMA to make the necessary arrangements during COP22 to initiate consideration of relevant matters as mandated in the Paris Agreement in an inclusive manner olThe BASIC Ministers emphasized the need at COP22 to make further progress towards the operationalization of the provisions related to adaptation in the Paris Agreement. They further reiterated that developed countries should provide financial resources, technology development and transfer and capacity-building support to developing countries for their effective implementation and ambitious actions under the Paris Agreement. Ministers emphasised the importance of making progress in Marrakesh on identifying concrete and clear pathways to reaching the goal of USD100 billion per annum in climate finance by 2020. With USD100 billion per annum as a starting point, developed countries should progressively and substantially scale up their financial support in the post-2020 period. In addition, Ministers emphasised the need for the COP to initiate the mandated consideration of information to be provided by developed countries on public financial resources as part of their Biennial Communications of Indicative Support on the provision of climate finance to developing countries. Ministers called for increased clarity and robust methodologies, to be developed under the Convention, to account for and track climate finance provided by developed countries. The need for support to developing countries for effective implementation of their mitigation and adaptation actions was emphasized: this must be done through accelerating the work on the new Technology Framework and the Technology Mechanism - including its assessment for meaningful and tangible dissemination, transfer and deployment of technology from developed to developing countries. They also emphasized the role of innovation and international cooperation on climate related technology in enhancing global actions. The importance of capacity building in the implementation of the Paris Agreement was emphasized. The Ministers expressed the hope that the terms of reference for the Paris Committee on Capacity-Building, agreed by all Parties at the May 2016 session of the UNFCCC in Bonn, will be adopted at COP22 . Such a comprehensive stock-take should build on past experience and lessons learned from existing relevant work under the Convention, including among others the 2013 - 2015 Review and the NDC synthesis paper issued by the Secretariat, with a view to allowing Parties to update and enhance actions and support, in a nationally determined manner and in accordance with relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement. Ministers noted the adoption of the HFCs amendment to the Montreal Protocol and the outcomes of the 39th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. In this context, measures related to these outcomes should be consistent with the principle of CBDRandRC. Ministers highlighted the efforts of BASIC countries and other developing countries in tackling climate change, both pre- and post-2020, and emphasized that these represent far more ambitious efforts compared to their respective responsibilities and capabilities. Ministers also commended the climate action initiatives by BASIC members, namely the International Solar Alliance led by India, the Biofuture Platform led by Brazil, which will be launched at COP22 , and the China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund. Ministers agreed to further strengthen the cooperation and solidarity among the BASIC countries. In conclusion, the BASIC Ministers welcomed the offer of China to host the 24th BASIC Ministerial meeting. Enquiries:Albi ModiseCell: 083 490 2871 \"

It will focus on how to translate the Paris Agreement declarations into reality and follows the signing of the Agreement in early October where 94 of the 197 parties inked their support of the fight against global warming. COP 22 s agenda includes the adaptation, mitigation, transparency, and technology transfer to combat increasing greenhouse gas emissions. There s also a plan to discuss new efforts and implementation of the Paris Agreement with the latest data from the UN Environmental Programme showing that temperatures could rise by over 3 degrees this century unless there s urgent action. Female farmers at the frontline of dealing with climate change These efforts are regarded as critical to women farmers across the world who are on the front line of dealing with the impact of climate change. This includes South Africa where a sustainable use of natural resources project focusing on building resilience and adaptation in agriculture, in the face of climate change. The project is funded by the European Union (EU) and Oxfam to provide grassroots women from Gauteng, Western Cape, and Limpopo with skills to adapt and use natural resources to be resilient to the effects of climate change. Food insecurity, climate change and water shortages (through rainwater harvesting) are some of the critical issues addressed by this sustainable agriculture project. The project has also provided the use of clean energy by installing solar panels and biogas digesters in different schools. As primary beneficiaries, the women have been trained to use and maintain biogas digesters and solar panels. Extreme weather takes its toll A report commissioned by Oxfam titled Adapting to Climate Change states that women make up a significant proportion of smallholder producers. It is estimated that 60 percent of economically active women in Africa depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Low rainfall and high temperatures during the El Ni\'f1o, causing extreme weather conditions, triggered a lot of challenges at the project sites such as water scarcity and crops dying because of the heat. The effects of drought limited our ability to plant and grow crops in our food garden, said Violet Masinga Community Working Group member at Risenga Primary School, Siyandhani, Giyani. Water scarcity was a major challenge in our project site, our vegetables died and we had to replant, she added. Agents of change Women are not only vulnerable to climate change but they are also effective actors or agents of change in relation to both mitigation and adaptation. Another beneficiary has urged global leaders attending COP22 to find solutions for smallholder farmers especially women farmers. Women farmers suffer the most, world leaders should implement the climate agreement from the ground, said Zodwa Ranyadi CWG at Nandi Primary School, Diepkloof, Soweto and Women Energy Climate Change Forum member (WECCF). Funding should be another aspect that they provide to women farmers as this will give us access to own and control land as economic empowerment, said Ranyadi. They should come up with practical solutions that will help women and men farmers to adapt to climate change. Despite these challenges, the women are determined to take the lead in fighting and adapting to climate change through this project.

GenderCC Southern Africa and the Land Access Movement of South Africa (LAMOSA) are kick-starting a number of provincial capacity-building workshops and information seminars around the country starting from 10 February 2017 in the Free Sate and North West province. The information seminars will also be conducted in Mpumalanga, and Gauteng, where women smallholder farmers will be highlighting the impact of climate change on them as farmers and the support they need. Gender equality and women empowerment in agriculture According to Dorah Marema, executive director of GenderCC SA, although progress has been made to recognise the role of women in agriculture, much more needs to be done to support women as primary providers of household food security. Women still do not receive the same level of support from societal institutions, then their male counterparts. We want to build understanding and partnerships for women which can influence policy and the status quo. In the end, it must be noted that this is not about women, but about society at large, Marema emphasized. In 2015, GenderCC SA mobilised more than 3,000 women in South Africa to register their concerns and demands to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, France. Last year, GenderCC SA highlighted issues of gender equality and women empowerment in agricultural adaptation programmes and the need for access to finance at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Studies indicate that the success of increased agricultural production and food security on the continent rests largely in the hands of women farmers. Lack of access to resources and land LAMOSA, in partnership with GenderCC SA, women for Climate Justice, supported by Oxfam South Africa (OZA), organised small-scale farmers in Mpumalanga in January this year for a multi-stakeholder dialogue and information session on climate change. The event coincided with the former President Kgalema Motlanthe High-Level Panel on Assessment of Post-Apartheid Legislation and its impact on the lives of the poor. The small-scale farmers, including Khomotso Moseri of GenderCC SA made their submission to the panel on 16 and 17 January 2017. Last year, LAMOSA led a successful Constitutional Court challenge against the South African government on behalf of landless communities to voice their disapproval of the timing of new land restitution claims, which they said disadvantaged thousands of previous claimants whose cases were lodged during the initial process but have still not been settled. The government reopened its land claims process in 2014, allowing people who missed an earlier deadline for lodging claims for compensation to do so within the next five years. President Jacob Zuma signed into law the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, which reopens the restitution claims process that closed at the end of 1998 and gives claimants five years - until 30 June 2019 - to lodge further claims. \"

They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralised source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones. This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants. Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment. ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via ""Orange Money"". The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid Access to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimise the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa. ENGIE has been present in Africa for over 50 years, where it operates in the fields of electricity, natural gas and services. ENGIE has a cumulated energy capacity of approximately 3,000MW across power plants in operation or under construction. ENGIE is also working on decentralised electricity production for isolated companies and rural villages in order to achieve the global goal of providing 20 million people with electricity by 2020. To this end, the group is also researching opportunities for the deployment of home solar systems and mini-grids, as well as its policy to promote the use of solar energy to power telecoms towers in areas not connected to the electricity grid. Orange is present in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East where, at the end of September 2016, it had 113 million customers.

South Africa has emphasised the need to bring governments and nonstate actors together to discuss how to provide additional contributions to help to build up resilience to climate change and to transition to low-carbon societies.Despite facing the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment and inequality, and facing many resource and capacity constraints, South Africa is doing its fair share in contributing to the global effort to fight climate change.Our national response policy prioritises climate change actions that have both significant mitigation and adaptation benefits, and that contribute to economic growth, job creation and poverty eradication. To do this, we require billions of dollars in additional investment that we simply cannot mobilise on our own. We would like to scale up current efforts in green economy, renewable energy, green transport and the like, but this requires significant investment that we can only achieve with support. There is furthermore a need to scale up funding at a global level, and parties need to help each other with skills development and in building up capacity.Then there is the central question of how to secure funding for adaptation. Like many other countries on the continent, South Africa is semi-arid with less than 5% of annual rainfall available to recharge our groundwater aquifers. In a changing climate, our existing water-related problems are exacerbated. If one considers the drought we are currently experiencing, that has led to many of our major rivers running dry and our dams half-full, it is easy to imagine how this has extremely dire consequences for every aspect of our economy and society, especially in relation to food security.Therefore, significant investment is required to change the way that we use and manage scarce and fragile water resources. This is very important because adaptation is always in danger of being pushed off the international climate change agenda. We need to look seriously at ways of doubling adaptation financing in the pre-2020 period. The means of implementation are critical if we are to meet the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement. In this regard, non-party stakeholders, especially business, need to do more to support and advance global climate action.It is immensely encouraging that, less than a year after its adoption at the closing of COP21, the ratification of the Paris Agreement has taken place with such speed. South Africa is in the final stages of ratification, following our domestic procedures. The task before the parties is to build on and strengthen this momentum.South Africa is confident that the upcoming COP22 will do this and foster collaborative efforts to catalyse pre-2020 action.Edna Molewa is the minister of environmental affairs. \"

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said yesterday that preliminary data through October shows global average temperatures this year are 1.2\'c2\'baC above pre-industrial levels. That's getting close to the limit set by the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year. It calls for limiting the temperature rise since the industrial revolution to 2\'c2\'baC or even 1.5\'c2\'baC. This year's temperatures were boosted by the El Ni\'c3\'b1o weather event. The previous hottest year was 2015. WMO said 16 of the 17 hottest years have occurred this century, with the only exception being 1998, which was also an El Ni\'c3\'b1o year. But there is some good news, Global carbon emissions have remained largely steady for the past three years, even while economies have grown, scientists said in a study published yesterday. The findings, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, point to a possible shift toward a cleaner global economic system, largely due to the US and China decreasing their emissions. But scientists cautioned that it's too early to proclaim a turning point in emissions that contribute to climate change. ""It is great news that global carbon dioxide emissions have been flat in the last three years, but it is far too early to proclaim we have reached a peak,"" said study co-author Glen Peters, a researcher at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. Researchers said that while the emissions grew by 0.7% in 2014 and that there was a projected 0.2% increase for 2016, the emissions trend has shown a shift from high growth in earlier in the decade. In the past three years, emissions growth has remained below 1%, despite gross domestic product (GDP) growing by 3%. Much of the slowdown in the growth of annual carbon emissions, which have remained at around 36.4 billion tons in the past three years, is due to China's ratcheting down emissions, which dropped 0.7% in 2015. The US reducing coal production has also made an impact, researchers said. But they also warned that the cause of China's emissions reductions are still unclear, and there have been data inconsistencies in the past. China is responsible for 30% of global carbon emissions. In the US, emissions have decreased since 2007. Recent decreases are largely due to declines in coal consumption. The announcements come as the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ) is under way in Morocco, until Thursday. Africa is presenting a united front at the conference. The continent is among the world's regions most vulnerable to climate change. Africa's key priorities include ensuring that global ambitions and historic responsibilities regarding means of implementation, particularly predictable financing, to facilitate low carbon climate resilient development are in line with the continent's development goals, said the statement. A collaborative partnership between the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the AU Commission, ECA, and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) established the Africa Pavilion in the blue zone of the COP22 village, dedicated to engagement, networking and dialogue, said the statement. The Pavilion also aims to provide a platform for the voices of the continent to be heard. The Pavilion embodies the united front of an Africa ""speaking with one voice"" in articulating its interests given the high stakes of climate change negotiations. The Africa Pavilion features a programme of round-table conferences and bilateral meetings, where key issues of adaptation and mitigation; green industrialisation; agriculture; transport; health; water and sanitation; biodiversity and innovation are discussed. \"

The session brought together the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, and CEOs who are part of the group and those interested in joining their group, key government officials and international organisations to discuss the priorities and opportunities for delivering the Paris Agreement.Minister Molewa said the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015 concluded a four-year negotiating process that was mandated by the COP17 hosted by South Africa in Durban in December 2011.By ratifying the Paris Agreement, countries had not only committed to the implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions to ensure that greenhouse gasses are reduced, but had agreed that investment should takes place in climate resilient communities. The discussion at the World Economic Forum, covered priority areas for Africa to realise the opportunities for accelerating low carbon action and to manage the risks associated with the impact of climate change, with specific emphasis on the risks associated with water management and sustainable agriculture.Minister Molewa said at the COP22 Marrakesh Climate Conference in Morocco in November 2016, the political message was clear that the ""momentum behind the Paris Agreement is irreversible and that it is in every Party's interest to deliver on the contribution it has communicated under the Agreement"". The message from the 2017 WEFA was therefore to remind and urge all Parties, including the US, not to backtrack on these issues of importance to humanity.Delivering on the Paris Agreement requires unprecedented public and private partnerships to create the best pathways to enable an inclusive economic growth that supports low-carbon and climate resilient economies, delegates heard. ""Securing access to new, additional and predictable sources of funding without unrealistic pre-conditions is of central importance to African and other developing countries.""As highlighted in Marrakesh, there needs to be predictability of public climate finance flows from 2016 to 2020,"" the Minister said. As countries moved towards the development of a green economy, there would be a need for ""effective understanding of climate-related financial risks that prevent clear planning, decision-making and investment"" in the public and private sectors.These risks must be mitigated and or better- less risky models be found. Adapt to climate change""Also required is a greater understanding of the urgency to adapt to climate change, and an understanding of the scale of low-carbon investment needed to prevent dangerous climate change,"" Minister Molewa said.The Paris Agreement secured commitments by a global alliance to mobilise up to US$1 trillion in solar investments. On behalf of the African continent, Minister Molewa called on the developed countries to honour their commitments to the developing world, particularly African countries, and support Adaptation and Mitigation programmes to enable the Continent to transition to a low-carbon economy.Furthermore, the importance of Climate Smart Agriculture in Africa was also discussed. The absence of specific agriculture related matters in the Paris Agreement short-changes organized and coordinated actions in the development of the agricultural sector and its responses to climate change.The Minister said South Africa is among the pioneers in adopting the green economy strategies. The hallmark was the signing of the Green Economy Accord in 2011 and the adoption in 2012 of the National Development Plan 2030, which committed the country to an ""environmentally sustainable and equitable transition to a low carbon inclusive economy.""She said South Africa has put in place many programmes and policy frameworks in the recent past, to translate the NDP Vision 2030 into action. The country is currently implementing programmes to promote energy efficiency, green transport, sustainable housing and climate resilient agriculture.""We are glad that there is great visible progress on these sectors as we all see new multimodal transport in cities like Johannesburg, Tshwane and Cape Town.

The negotiations, COP22 , are intended to flesh out the historic accord signed by nearly all nations in Paris last year to reduce the human contribution to climate change. But the delegates will no doubt have a worried eye fixed on events across the \'e2\€ \£8Atlantic, where Americans will be choosing their next president tomorrow. Wild Republican contender Donald Trump has bluntly declared that he would tear up the accord if he made it to the White House. Not for him the fact that Earth's weather patterns are changing and that the weight of scientific opinion is that humankind is playing a part in this. Not for him the fact that the Paris accord and its subsequent ratification by the majority of its 197 signatory governments are the culmination of intense and often tortuous negotiations to thrash out ways of mitigating this almost unthinkable danger bearing down on us. Over the nearly three decades that it has taken to reach that agreement, it has been the stand-off between the US and China that persistently presented the single biggest obstacle to progress. Together they contribute nearly 40\'e2\€  percent of greenhouse gases, so it was only when they joined in putting their pens to paper that there could at last be real hope of us earthlings facing up to the challenge. And now this man, mockingly referred to by many of his compatriots as The Donald, is threatening to undo all of this. One of the observations analysts have made about this extraordinary, if not downright weird, US presidential election is that it shows how little understanding there is among Americans of how much the world has changed. The climate issue alone is why most of the international community has reason to wait with bated breath for Americans to make their choice. \"

The meeting is being held in Hanoi, Vietnam, which is regarded by many observers as one of the major trafficking hubs for a multitude of illegally-traded wild species - including thousands of horns hacked from South African rhinos over the last eight years. Dignitaries attending the event include the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, who has spoken out strongly against the unsustainable pillage of wildlife across the globe and John Scanlon, head of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). While the Vietnamese hosts were planning to welcome more than 50 heads of state or senior ministers to the three-day meeting, a provisional list posted on the conference website suggests there may be several empty seats and that most nations will be represented by deputy ministers, ambassadors, diplomats or officials. With Environment Minister Edna Molewa attending the UN COP22 climate change conference in Morocco, South Africa will be represented in Hanoi by Molewa's deputy, Barbara Thomson. The Hanoi Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade hopes to produce an action plan that will call for ""reasoned, tangible, and unified action"" against illicit wildlife trading. Signatories will be required to work towards four main commitments: l Eradicating the market for illegal wildlife products. l Ensuring effective legal frameworks and deterrents. l Strengthening law enforcement. l Sustainable livelihoods and economic development. In a message before the conference, Prince William said: ""Now is the chance to send an unambiguous message to the world that it is no longer acceptable to buy and sell ivory, rhino horn or other illegal wildlife products. I would challenge anyone who knows the truth of how these wildlife products are obtained, to justify desiring them."" Appealing to the people of Asia in particular to stop buying wildlife parts, especially ivory and rhino horn, he said the number of wild African elephants had fallen by nearly two thirds since his birth in 1982. ""I am not prepared to explain to our children why we lost this battle when we had the tools to win it,"" he said. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa30","Objections to construction of two coal-fired power stations dismissed","November 16, 2016","Mail & Guardian","Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa has dismissed objections to the country building two new coal-fired power stations. This will mean 16-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent will be added to the atmosphere. The power stations will also use up water in areas that are already water stressed, at a time when the country is toying with its third year of drought.The minister's decision came on the second day of COP22 , where South Africa is negotiating on the nuts and bolts of how the Paris Agreement will play out. This put countries on the same path to ensuring that global warming is kept below 2\'c2\'b0C on pre-industrial levels. As part of the Africa group, South Africa has consistently argued that the goal should be 1.5\'c2\'b0C because anything more is catastrophic for the continent. Projections by the World Bank show that average global warming is doubled in Africa's interior, while the continent has little capacity to adapt to that change. But South Africa has been roundly criticised for its actions not matching up to its rhetoric. It ratified the Paris Agreement in early November and has a wide range of local initiatives to lower emissions and help people adapt to climate change. Its Nationally Determined Agreement - the pledge it submitted to Paris - has, however, been called out as not being ambitious enough. Climate Action Tracker rated the contribution as ""inadequate"", saying: ""It is not consistent with limiting warming below 2\'c2\'b0C"". The contribution is vague and allows South Africa to increase its emissions by anywhere between 20% and 82% on 1990 levels. That translates to either 198-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 614-million tonnes. This goal stems from South Africa's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord in 2009 to reduce emissions on business-as-usual levels by 42% by 2025. Climate Action Tracker said: ""If most other countries follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3-4\'c2\'b0C."" Whether it's the upper target or the lower target that is reached is down to the choices made in South Africa's power sector. This is responsible for half of the country's carbon emissions of just under 450-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, according to the local Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Those decisions are made at the department of energy. It has been pushing for a new nuclear build, to replace the ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations that are run by the state-owned utility Eskom. But, at the same time, it has called for bids from private companies to build coal-fired power stations. This borrows from the platform for bids that was created for South Africa's 6 000MW independent renewable energy build. Once that department invites bids, it is up to companies to sketch out their environment impacts and get authorisation from the department of environmental affairs. It is the granting of these authorisations that civil society group groundWork objected to. A previous objection to the granting of an environmental authorisation for Thabametsi, an independent coal-fired power station, resulted in the environmental affairs minister telling the mine to do a climate change impact assessment. This was a first for South Africa. But this time, groundWork's objections were dismissed. If construction does go ahead, the two power plants will join two other power stations under construction in adding 90-million tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions to the atmosphere. The other two, Eskom-owned Medupi and Kusile, will be the world's largest dry-cooled, coal-fired, power stations in the world. Each will have a capacity of 4 800MW. Government says emissions from the new plants will be reduced because of their newer technology. Their overall impact will also be reduced as Eskom's older fleet of coal-fired plants starts to retire in the 2020s and 2030s. But the environment impact assessments of the plants does not include their wider footprint, specifically in terms of the coal mines that will be built to supply them. Critically, serious concerns have been raised about the impact these stations will have on water availability in the already water scarce areas where they are being built. Eskom uses 2% of South Africa's water and is the only entity guaranteed supply, regardless of circumstances. Medupi and Kusile have meant the construction of water transfer schemes to bring them water. This water comes from the Vaal river system, which means it falls hundreds of kilometres away Lesotho and the KwaZulu-Natal province. In the case of Medupi, the Mokolo-Crocodile Water Augmentation Project will take water from Gauteng, at an initial cost of R11-billion for construction. But water is scarce in Gauteng. Official climate projections - contained in South Africa's national climate change response strategy - show that drought will become more prevalent and more severe. Projections from the 2030 Water Resources Group show that demand for the whole country will exceed supply by 17%, a situation that will be ever-more acute in Gauteng. Medupi's demands will also dramatically increase when it installs flue gas desulphurisation technology. This technology decreases sulphur emissions, but triples the plant's water use. Farming rights in the area have been bought up to access the water rights that come with the farms, in order to supply Medupi's demand. Concerns over this impact on water resources were so great that the World Bank investigated it when granting a loan to help Medupi's construction. This noted that ""potential project-induced harm"" included ""significant water consumption raising issues of both scarcity and pollution in the local area"". The bank went on to note that ""due consideration should have been given to probable future projects in the area, e.g. additional mines and coal-fired power stations"". That reality has come to pass, thanks to environmental authorisation for more coal-fired power stations being granted. Now the country has to find the water to supply them, and a way to deal with the climate change that will be driven by more carbon emissions. \"

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa32","Climate Finance for Farmers Key to Avert One Billion Hungry","November 21, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","With climate change posing growing threats to smallholder farmers, experts working around the issues of agriculture and food security say it is more critical than ever to implement locally appropriate solutions to help them adapt to changing rainfall patterns. Most countries consider agriculture a priority when it comes to their plans to limit the rise of global temperatures to less than 2 degrees C. In line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement, 95 percent of all countries included agriculture in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). ""We need to find solutions that allow people to live better, increase their income, promote decent jobs and be resilient."" -- Martial Bernoux of FAO ""The climate is changing. We don't have rains that we used to have in the past. In the last decade, we had two consecutive years of intense drought and we lost all the production. The animals all died because they had no water,"" Ahmed Khiat, 68, a small farmer in the Moroccan community of Souaka, told IPS. Khiat comes from a long line of farmers. Born and raised in the arid region of Settat located some 200 km northeast of Marrakech, he has cultivated the land his whole life, growing maize, lentils and other vegetables, as well as raising sheep. But the family tradition was not passed to his nine sons and daughters, who all migrated to the cities in search for jobs. In the past, he said, farmers were able to get 90 percent of their income from agriculture -- now it's half that. ""They don't work anymore in the field,"" Khiat about his sons. ""The work here is very seasonal. I prefer they have a permanent job in the city."" Agriculture is an important part of the Moroccan economy, contributing 15 percent to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 23 percent to its exports. Around 45 percent of Morocco's population lives in rural areas and depends mainly on agriculture for their income, Mohamed Boughlala, an economist at the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INRA) in Morocco, told IPS. Seventy percent of the people in the countryside live in poverty. Unemployment is common among youth and around 80 percent of farmers are illiterate. Khiat, for example, says he does not know how to spell his own name. ""The studies we did here we found that we lost 100mm of rainfall in average per year. In 2015, this region had only 400 mm of rain and, in 2016, we only had 330 mm. If we show them there is a technology so you can improve the yield, reduce the risk and the cost of production, we can improve small farmers' livelihoods,"" stressed Boughlala. In 2015, families who used conventional ploughing methods had zero yield. But the farmers who applied so-called ""direct seeding"" had an increase of 30 percent. Direct seeding is a technology for growing cereals without disturbing the soil through tillage, i.e. without ploughing. With this technique, the scarce rainfall infiltrates the soil and is retained near the roots of the crop, which results in higher yields compared to traditional seeding. Soil erosion is reduced and labour costs go down. Direct seeding had been tested in Morocco by INRA as a way to increase resilience to climate change. Morocco piloted this technology with financial support of a 4.3-million-dollar grant from the Special Climate Change Fund of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) - designed to strengthen the capacity of institutions and farmers to integrate climate change adaptation measures in projects which are implemented under the Plan Maroc Vert, or the green plan addressing Moroccan's agricultural needs. Khiat was one of the 2,500 small farmers benefitted by the direct seeding for cereals in 2011. Facilities like GEF and the Green Climate Fund will be key for African farmers to access financial resources to cope with global warming. However, the African continent -- home to 25 percent of the developing world's population -- receives only 5 percent of public and private climate funds. Although it contributes very little to greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is likely the most vulnerable to the climate impacts. The need to protect African agriculture in the face of climate change was addressed at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech ( COP22 ) with the Global Climate Action Agenda on Nov. 17. The one-day event at the Climate Summit aimed to boost concerted efforts to cut emissions, help vulnerable nations adapt and build a sustainable future. ""We need to find new sources of funding for farmers. Climate change brings back the uncertainty of food insecurity in the world. We project that we may be soon see one billion hungry people in the world if we don't act strongly to tackle climate change. In the COP22 , we saw agriculture regaining the necessary importance,"" Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, the director-general of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS. Solutions should be designed and implemented locally, stressed the natural resources officer with the Climate Change Mitigation Unit at FAO, Martial Bernoux. ""Our number one objective is to achieve food security and fight poverty,"" he told IPS. ""What is more perturbing to small farmers is the scarcity of water and the unstable cycle that changes the rainfall regime. The frequency of climatic events increased and farmers have no time to be resilient and no ability to adapt. It is necessary to work with microcredit mechanisms to help them,"" said Bernoux. When climate change is added to the food security equation, local solutions become more complex, he said. ""We need to hear the communities' demands, their deficiencies and potentialities to improve, like establishing an early warning system to inform farmers some days in advance when the rain is coming so they can prepare the land. If they lose this opportunity, it could be fatal for the yield."" Agriculture is an overarching issue that affects nearly all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including food security, zero poverty, resilience and adaptation, argued Bernoux. ""We need to find solutions that allow people to live better, increase their income, promote decent jobs and be resilient,"" he said. ""By working with agriculture you connect with all the other SDGs."" \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa33","Africa united in efforts to protect agriculture","November 21, 2016 Monday","Cape Times (South Africa)","A UNANIMOUS decision on how to take action on climate change is incredibly rare. Yet, African nations have overwhelmingly included climate resilient agriculture in their indicative pledges to the UN. And agriculture is seen as a major focus through a common position of the AU on climate adaptation. Agriculture employs more than 60\'e2\€  percent of Africa's working population. But low productivity and high levels of food insecurity persist. So the inclusion of agriculture in strategies should come as no surprise. The question is: how are African nations going to move from pledges to progress? The Moroccan government, host of this year's COP22 climate talks, is seeking the answer with the launch of the ambitious Adaptation of African Agriculture initiative. The initiative is high on the agenda. The aim is to mobilise $30\'e2\€  billion (R420bn) to make agriculture more resilient to the changing climate. Improved water management is one of the three key pillars of the initiative - and for good reason. Globally, agriculture uses around 70\'e2\€  percent of freshwater supply. But water sources are increasingly under threat. Droughts will be more frequent, more intense and last longer. Increasing the amount of water for agriculture through water storage at all levels from field to reservoir will be a part of the solution. But existing water sources also can be managed better. In fact, certain regions in Africa have untapped water. Where water supplies are already under pressure, improving the productivity of water use in agriculture would make more water available for other uses. The urban, energy and industrial sectors can also encourage productivity gains and more sustainable and climate resilient practices through benefit- sharing mechanisms like the Tana Water Fund. Another pillar is investment in water storage. Farmers will increasingly need to rely on water storage as part of the adaptation agenda. Improved soil management practices have potential to both improve the utilisation of water and increase production. They are increasingly seen as a natural way to store carbon, turning soils into a carbon sink. This can open up new funding prospects that will have multiple benefits. Adopting water management practices to a local context is crucial. Also key to the initiative is more efficient use of water. New efficient irrigation technologies, like drip and sprinkler irrigation, are already showing much promise. In Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, a new SMS system is being piloted, which is delivering field-specific information and advice. The Morocco climate talks are a golden opportunity for making strides on the adaptation of African agriculture. African countries now need to be empowered with the tools and strategies for taking action. Improved water management approaches may be just one piece of the puzzle, but will provide benefits for generations to come. l\'e2\€  Bird is director-general at the International Water Management Institute.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa34","Africa needs to manage food, water and energy in a way that connects all three","January 23, 2017 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","There is an increasing global demand for food, water and energy. All three are inter-linked, a fact that has increasingly become the focus of attention for policy makers and governments... One initiative has been the Water-Energy-Food security nexus developed in Bonn by Holger Hoff under the auspices of the international climate change conferences of the parties (COP). The aim was to improve management of the complex links between water, energy and food systems. It is increasingly being used by international organisations to evaluate whether approaches to meeting development targets set out under the Sustainable Development Goals are coherent. Understanding the connections between basic food demands and accessibility to water and energy is also important when it comes to climate change and its impact on agriculture and livelihoods. This issue featured prominently at COP22 in Marrakech in 2016. The approach can play a massive role in reducing resource loss and maximising benefits. For example, countries like South Africa and Tanzania have started using the approach to develop policies around water, energy and food production. In South Africa the Water Research Commission has begun to use the model in national discussions on managing the effects of climate change. Tanzania applied integrated water resource management in its water sector and African Union strategy on climate change. But very little progress has trickled down to actual policy development. Regions like southern Africa need to move beyond simply having a framework for understanding the connection between the three. This is only the first step. Now more case studies are needed to see how the three components interact and also how policies can be successfully implemented. Why and where is the nexus important? Countries with severe water constraints, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, have started to develop policy that looks at all three factors. These regions have become testing grounds for the practical application of the nexus approach. Solutions, such as the development of multi-functional productive systems to improve natural resources use, have been implemented. In Jordan, these have been developed to include water, energy and food. A pilot system has been implemented around the Sahara Forest Project. This includes solar energy farming in water scarce regions. <figure class=""fig-caption"" class=""align-center zoomable""><figcaption><span class=""caption"">Over-using water for food production will have a detrimental impact on energy production. For example, Zambia relies on Lake Kariba for energy.</span><span class=""attribution"">Flickr/Joe McKenna</span></figcaption></figure> There are others signs of progress. Awareness about the challenges posed by climate change has led to the better allocation of resources through careful planning, savings and recycling. Some countries have developed national policies around these issues. And governance patterns and language in policy development have started to reflect the linkages between water, energy and food. But attempts to integrate water, energy and food management still have a long way to go. Most institutions like the various water, energy and agriculture departments or organisations operate under a complex system of unclear mandates and obscure funding and don t consult with others. This doesn t mean that efforts to shape resources management are doomed. But there is a clear need to improve how it s done. Bringing the nexus to fruition In southern Africa the nexus approach has been discussed by the Southern African Development Community in the water sector. One of the biggest challenges for the region is that water is distributed very unevenly. But it is short of electricity and some countries are highly dependent on hydro-power. What this means for food production is a challenge given that the over-allocation of water resources for food production would have a detrimental impact on energy production. To integrate water with food and energy, the regional body has taken steps to raise awareness of the issues. But each member state faces very different challenges. For example, South Africa is a middle-income country and has a fairly developed industrial sector that produces food. This requires concentrated investment in energy and water infrastructure, which the country has maintained partly due to its economy s size and maturity. Malawi, on the other hand, lacks the basic infrastructures to supply its population with water and access to energy. It is also much more vulnerable to the impact of drought and flood. Tanzania s economy relies heavily on agricultural production. It is therefore particularly vulnerable to changes in weather patterns. In addition, it doesn t have the capacity to adapt to these changes which limits agricultural productivity. What s needed For a policy to be effective it must take into account what infrastructure is available in a country and a region. It must also be backed up by proper data collection and institutions must be strengthened to overcome bottlenecks. What s also important is that interventions must be designed with the involvement of all stakeholders, including consumers. A common mistake is that governments are solely responsible for managing resources. Cooperation is key. Governments, institutes, and consumers must build relationships. Discussing their needs is crucial to success. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. One common factor is that investment in innovation and technical support is vital so that a range of solutions can be developed. The nexus approach has the potential to help African countries meet sustainable development goals. This can only happen if the approach is turned into actions, like policy development and implementation. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"

Climate change is a serious problem, and the science now & unequivocally& finds that humans are causing it. Negotiations in the past 20 years have made slow progress, until the Paris agreement was signed in December 2015 - widely considered a major step forward. The agreement is a treaty in all but name, and treaties are negotiated multilaterally, but need to be ratified by countries to enter into force. In SA, that means the Cabinet sends the treaty to Parliament. For the Paris agreement, a & double trigger& is required under article 21 - 55 parties must ratify, accounting for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The number of parties is already at 61, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change website. The 55% of emissions requires some more large emitting countries - with percentages recorded in a politically agreed table. India has ratified. Add a few EU member states such as Germany, France and the UK (pre-Brexit), and that will push the total well over 55%. If Japan ratifies, that would add more than the 3.12% still required. This gathering momentum will lead to official ratification earlier than expected. The agreement will enter into force 30 days after the double trigger is met, hence the significance of October 7. That is more than 30 days before COP22 , due to start on November 7 in Marrakech, Morocco. Early ratification serves to & Trump-proof& the Paris agreement. The Republican candidate has threatened to pull out of Paris. But it's not that easy. Under article 28, a party may withdraw three years after the agreement enters into force, and then that withdrawal takes effect only a year later. So, even in a horror scenario, The Donald has to live with the agreement, since the Obama administration submitted the US instrument of ratification. Trump would have to expend significant political capital domestically, and alienate many other countries. For all his bluster, that might not be a price worth actually paying. SA is the only one of the newly industrialised Basic (Brazil, SA, India and China) countries that has not ratified. While processes are under way, the deadline has shifted from initial plans for July, with speculation that it may happen in late November. SA was central in negotiations in Paris, President Jacob Zuma signed on in April and the formal ratification must follow.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa38","Failed Syria ceasefire in UN focus","September 28, 2016 Wednesday","The Mercury (South Africa)","THE failed attempt by the US and Russia to revive a ceasefire in Syria stole the spotlight at the annual UN gathering of world leaders but every other global hotspot had \'e2\€ \£8its moment - and there were some chuckles as well, including a message to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to be ready to receive his gift of a ""white bull"" from South Sudan. With the final speeches of the six-day gabfest delivered on Monday, there were also a few high points. Last December's Paris climate agreement got 31 more ratifications at a high-level event hosted by Ban, topping the 55 countries required and just over 7% short of the 55% of global emissions needed for the deal to enter into force. It is expected to reach that magic number before the next UN conference on climate change in November in Morocco. UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson called the agreement a ""historic achievement"" that would never have happened if the world's nations hadn't shifted course to preserve life on Earth. ""There might be a Plan B in life but there certainly is no Planet B,"" Eliasson said on Monday in wrapping up the General Assembly's annual General Debate which was attended by more than 135 heads of state and government and more than 50 \'e2\€ \£8ministers. The high-level meetings began with the first-ever UN summit on refugees and migrants called to tackle one of the most contentious issues facing the world: millions of people fleeing conflict and poverty - and not many countries willing to accept them. World leaders approved the New York Declaration aimed at providing a more co-ordinated and humane response to the largest refugee crisis since World War II, and President Barack Obama secured thousands of new \'e2\€ \£8resettlement places and billions of dollars in pledges to help the refugees at a summit the following day. Eliasson said both events gave ""new structure to the work on refugees and migration which will be very useful"". ""But above all I hope we shall make sure that this organisation sends the signal of everybody's equal value, and that we need to work in such a way that we prevent the xenophobic tendencies to prevail which are still strong in today's world,"" he said. Crossy Prime Minister Allen Chastanet of the Caribbean island nation of St Lucia, population 183 000, told the 193-member General Assembly that ""as a small island state within this body, our voice is meant to be equal, but long experience and realpolitik prove the contrary"". Chastanet also questioned the format of the so-called General Debate where leaders deliver speeches from 9am often until after 8pm. ""While many speak, few stay around to listen; far less respond,"" he said. ""Then we wonder how and why this entity is so negatively perceived..."" One of the UN's great failures has been its inability to end the five-and-a-half-year Syrian conflict, which has claimed more than \'e2\€ \£8300 000 lives. During the ministerial meeting, not only did lengthy US-Russian negotiations fail to restore a ceasefire, but the Syrian government announced a new offensive to retake Aleppo, unleashing some of the heaviest bombing of the war. Other conflicts had opposing sides attacking each other. India and Pakistan squabbled over Kashmir. Israeli Prime \'e2\€ \£8Minister Benjamin Netanyahu predicted that Israel would have a bright \'e2\€ \£8future at the UN and invited Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to address Israel's parliament - an offer Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour dismissed as ""a new gimmick."" And the United Arab Emirates accused Iran of sponsoring \'e2\€ \£8""terrorism"", a claim Tehran denies. In almost every speech, \'e2\€ \£8leaders called for global action against radical extremist groups which have spread from Syria and Iran to North Africa, Europe and the US. There were no speeches about the search for a successor to Ban, whose second term as secretary-general ends on December 31. But there was plenty of behind-the-scenes chatter about the nine candidates vying to replace him and whether the winner would be front-runner Antonio Guterres, the former Portuguese prime minister or someone from Eastern Europe which has never held the post that by tradition rotates by region, or the first woman. One of the lighter moments came in the speech of Taban Deng Gai, first vice-president of war-ravaged South Sudan, who paid tribute to Ban and recalled that President Salva Kiir gave the UN chief a ""white bull"" as a sign of peace.""It has grown and is ready to be delivered to his excellency."" - AP \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa39","South-South co-operation valued in war on climate change","November 16, 2016 Wednesday","Cape Times (South Africa)","JOHANNESBURG: South-South co-operation is growing as developing countries help each other address climate change, sustainable development and implementation of the Paris Agreement, say senior UN officials and government ministers at the UN Climate Conference in Marrakech ( COP 22 ). Nabarro made his comments at the High-Level Forum on South-South Co-operation on Climate Change, one of the events kicking off the second week of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Nabarro said the Climate Partnerships for the Global South, also known as the Southern Climate Partnership Incubator (SCPI), initiated by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon on the margins of the signing ceremony for the Paris Agreement at the UN headquarters in New York in April, ""is about making connections"". ""The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4. The UN has launched the SCPI to initiate, facilitate and support partnerships that will help developing countries address climate change. ""SCPI is leveraging the UN system to match the needs of developing countries with counterparts willing and able to meet them. Through the SCPI we can help each one to learn from the other,"" said Nabarro. He added that the SCPI has reviewed 300 good cases of bilateral, trilateral and plurilateral partnerships facilitated by the UN, non-governmental organisations and multilateral development banks. The president of COP 22 , Salaheddine Mezouar, minister of foreign affairs and co-operation of Morocco, underscored that the South-South co-operation is ""not in opposition to North-South or South-North co-operation"". ""We want to assure that countries of the South are taking charge, that they have much to share and much to bring to each other,"" he told the forum participants. ""As we are in a changing world, the balances of this new world also depend on the strengthening of South-South partnerships and South-South co-operation. ""Momentum in both these areas will help move much faster and will also help developing countries find other levers to meet the challenges they face."" The executive secretary of UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa, reminded the forum's participants that ""while it is clear that developed countries need to provide support to developing countries to reach their goals of the Paris accord, it also encourages complimentary support such as South-South co-operation"". South-South co-operation is rapidly becoming an integral component of international co-operation to address climate change. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa40","Responsible green finance: can investors make a real social impact?","February 7, 2017 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","At the beginning of 2017, France announced the launch of its green bonds scheme... The amount, not yet officially revealed, could be counted in billions of euros, thus constituting the first green sovereign borrowing scheme on this scale in the world. Poland launched its own green bonds scheme in late 2016, worth approximately 750m This is still considered to be a niche market, but its development potential is enormous and has soared over the last three years, especially since the signing of Paris Agreement on climate change. How do green bonds work? Green bonds work in the same way as conventional bond issues. Those financial tools are a form of loan made by private or public corporations, governments and institutions. Under various conditions and interest rates, they provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term and diverse investments. Green bonds concern sovereign (state), private and international business markets. They represent approximately $170bn, or slightly less than 1% of the total international bond market. Unlike regular bonds, green bonds are managed directly by the company s general management rather than by the accounts management office, because of the potential impact they have on the company s reputation and image. With green bonds, it is possible to direct the amounts raised towards specific activities, assess a project s environmental risk, track funding from the central treasury department (a report audited by a third party must allow cash flows to be monitored in the issuer s statement), and ensure frequent reports on the use of the funds. Green bonds provide a vehicle for measuring the environmental performance of an investment project: the financing of a wind farm, setting up of renewable energy sites, green infrastructure, and so on. There are many advantages for investors. They will know the precise project in which their savings are invested ( I know what I m funding ) and will therefore be in a position to judge the quality of the issuer through the various assessments of the green bond s environmental risk and the issuer in general. <figure class=""fig-caption"" class=""align-center ""><figcaption><span class=""caption"">Can green bonds change and really impact social and environmental issues?</span><span class=""attribution"">bykst/piaxabay</span></figcaption></figure> The advantage for investors lies primarily in the communication and legitimacy process, given the fact that the context puts some pressure on companies to meet investors impact request. They can thus prove the sustainability of their process up to the stage of funding, by linking their words and their actions. This also ensures that a more direct dialogue between investors and issuers can be initiated than through equity funding, which does not allow investment projects to be identified consistently. What is the real impact on the environment? But the question of measuring environmental impact remains. How can the environmental benefits of an investment project be assessed? Does the solution lie in the standard application of a measuring tool or in the ad hoc measuring of each project, given that each project is funded differently? Each green bond is different and the environmental impact will therefore most probably be measured by expectations for the project, its execution and results. The effort required to set up a green bond often results in the issuer requesting additional remuneration from the investor in order to compensate for the cost of this effort. Pricing is complex, therefore, given that investors are not always prepared to pay more for a project that could have been funded by a conventional bond. This can create an imbalance between supply and demand, but as is the case with responsible equity investment, green investors in the bond market are often prepared to pay more: price is not their priority. A niche market that could grow The climate talks in Marrakesh last year allowed African countries to take a closer interest in the issue of green bonds. Morocco, for example launched green bonds in November 2016 through several banks and public companies for a total amount in the region of nearly 150 million. The Capital Markets Authority has said that the launch of the first Kenyan green bond will be realised in 2017. Other African countries such as Nigeria, the biggest economy in West Africa, are also preparing their own green bond launch. Nigeria expects a bond issue of 63 million for the funding of green projects for the first quarter of 2017 and a second issue for the end of the year. Although European countries are always considered to be leaders in the private business market of green bonds issues, the interest and appetite for the development of renewable energy and sustainable economies is growing fast on the African continent, as it is in many Asian countries including India, Japan, South Korea and especially China. Taking bonds to the next level At present, as is the case with responsible investment, the green bonds market is concentrated in the hands of institutional investors and asset management companies. The majority of green bonds are issued by the Chinese market, which accounts for almost half of the outstanding amounts issued in 2016. As the Chinese market is reserved for local investors, this does not allow a real expansion of the market. According to Novethic, some green bonds are also too small to allow certain large funds to subscribe to them. Taxation can also pose problems for investors. American green bonds will not be attractive for European investors from a tax point of view, as their taxation is advantageous only for investors based in the United States. Does the green bond market allow investors to make a greater impact through their investments? The requirements promoted by the green bond principles for transparency, reporting, cash flow traceability and measuring the environmental impact clearly make this possible. But the market should cover broader themes than low carbon strategies and move towards the funding of water management, deforestation and the conservation of land and ecosystems. The bubble created by the Paris Agreement should not suck the life out of the green bonds debate, even if it has the virtue of having initiated the debate, as these practices have now developed beyond the 2016 COP22 . The green bond model should also be extended beyond the environment, to social issues (social inclusion through housing and employment, health issues, community and humanitarian projects). Will the social impact bonds market allow social issues to be funded with traceability, reporting and impact measurement? To achieve this, it will have to distance itself from the controversy over the state s withdrawal from the social sphere in favour of private companies, and also from the debate over the financialisation of social issues. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa41","Africa-funded project to help small-island nations adapt to climate change","November 21, 2016 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","FAO will support six African island nations in their efforts to make agriculture more resilient to climate shocks and boost economic development. The $1.5 million project will focus on a variety of... Farmers in Cabo Verde, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Sao Tome and Principe, and Seychelles will benefit from training and knowledge exchanges on climate-smart food production, as well as ways to create viable market opportunities for nutritious food. Among these climate-smart agriculture practices are the use of a range of easy-to-grow crops of high nutritional value that will make production more resilient to adverse conditions. Other initiatives focus on innovative ways to increase food production. These include the introduction of fish aggregation devices - also known as fish magnets - to attract more fish to catch areas and increase the availability of nutritious seafood in local markets. On the marketing side, the project includes activities to help smallholders identify opportunities to enter high-value niche markets through Fair Trade or Organic labeling, to ensure the project is sustainable. To promote regional agricultural trade initiatives, the project will focus on strengthening regulations and agreements between importers and exporters. The project will also work with local government to identify policy opportunities, including ways to stimulate healthy nutrition trough food-based dietary guidelines and nutrition education programming. In all, the project aims to increase the countries' capacities, from the farm-level to the policy level, to reduce the double burden of malnutrition: tackling persistent hunger, on one hand, and rising obesity, on the other. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of COP22 in Marrakesh, the UN's global climate conference set to adopt action items that will bring to life last year's much-anticipated Paris Climate agreement. Among them are actions to counter the devastating impacts of climate change on agriculture and water. Ending hunger and poverty It's widely accepted that these impacts also pose a major threat to international efforts to end hunger and poverty. SIDS countries overall struggle with high levels of unemployment and poverty, and rely heavily on imports for their food. Because people's livelihoods in these island nations depend heavily on fisheries, tourism and crop production, climate change has the potential to aggravate these vulnerabilities and derail the development progress made over recent years. For this reason, FAO's continued support for small-island nations in Africa focuses on interventions that address social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities, while boosting local production of nutritious food. Africa Solidarity Trust Fund The Africa Solidarity Trust Fund was launched in 2013 as a unique Africa-led initiative to improve agriculture and food security across the continent. It's doing so by assisting countries and regional organisations to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, eliminate rural poverty and sustainably manage natural resources. The fund draws on contributions from Equatorial Guinea ($30 million), Angola ($10 million) and a symbolic contribution by civil society organisations in the Republic of the Congo. Since its inception, the Fund has already provided financing for 16 projects in 38 countries including building resilience for conflict affected rural communities, reducing rural poverty through youth employment opportunities and building best practices to increase crop and livestock production. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa42","Small farmers hit in climate crisis","May 17, 2016 Tuesday","The Mercury (South Africa)","The international climate deal agreed to in Paris has ""failed to include meaningful mechanisms"" to guarantee financial support for poorer countries adapting to global warming, according to a report by Oxfam. In the study, Unfinished Business, the aid charity claims the high cost of climate adaptation measures, such as creating flood defences and drought-resistant crops, means smaller-scale farmers across the world are ""being left on their own"". The 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), held last December, was at the time heralded by some as an ""historic"" agreement. But Oxfam has criticised the West for failing to commit to any concrete investment targets. Oxfam estimates that just 16% of the $100bn a year pledged by rich nations in 2009 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and cut carbon emissions has been paid. It has called on countries to target 35% by 2020, and 50% by 2025, via grants and other forms of financing in order to avoid the burden of ""heavy repayments"". The cost for developing countries to adapt to climate change could go as high as $500bn a year by 2050 - four to five times larger than previous estimates, according to a report released last week by the UN. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's policy adviser on climate change, blasted the lack of commitment to developing countries, warning the issue ""cannot be kicked down the road"" for any longer. She also emphasised the impact of El Ni\'c3\'b1o, a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean which can influence the weather. Carty said: ""We have known about the growing gap in adaptation funding for years now, and we were dismayed when the Paris deal failed to fix it. We need to see specific commitments in Bonn to increase adaptation finance and for that money to be spent supporting small farmers who are on the front lines of the climate crisis. We are already seeing the price of failure: tens of millions of people around the world face hunger and poverty from the droughts and crop failures caused by El Ni\'c3\'b1o."" In an interview with The Independent, Lord Stern, the world's most authoritative climate economist, called on rich countries to do everything they could to help poorer nations weather the storm of global warming - warning that a failure would escalate poverty and conflict. He said: ""Equality is a big issue. The rich got rich on high-carbon growth and it's the poor people of the world - whether they be poor people in rich countries or poor people in poor countries - who suffer earliest and most. ""The defining challenges of this century are overcoming poverty and managing climate change: if we fail on one we fail on the other. Clearly if we fail to manage climate change we create an environment so hostile that development will be undermined, leading to hundreds of millions having to move because their environment has been devastated.""

""Healthy and productive oceans are critical for combatting rural poverty, ensuring food security, improving nutrition and achieving Zero Hunger,"" he said. ""Stakeholders from fishing, shipping, energy generation and tourism, to list a few, require responsive and innovative solutions to turn climate change impacts into opportunities,"" according to Graziano da Silva. Climate change is an oceans issue, too African nations are increasingly realising the critical need to diversify beyond land-based activities and build their country's often rich relationships with the sea, the FAO leader said. But that relationship is becoming less and less predictable due to environmental changes. ""Coastal communities are already being affected by a combination of ocean warming, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, salt-water intrusions, ocean acidification and subsequent changes to the resources they depend on for food and livelihoods,"" Graziano da Silva noted. And yet, attention to climate change impacts on the ocean has lagged behind concerns for impacts on land and atmosphere. This will have to change in order to unlock the full potential of blue growth in broader marine and maritime economies, and prevent others from losing their existing livelihoods, Graziano da Silva said. He underscored the disproportionate impacts on Small Island Developing States, saying that ""For SIDS countries, this has become a fight for survival."" In these countries, coastal communities are not only more dependent on natural resources but also less able to adapt to change - particularly those in Africa."" Port state measures essential to unlocking blue potential Climate change is not the only challenge to coastal nations seeking to unleash their true blue potential. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing puts additional stress on oceans and marine resources, siphoning off billions worldwide in government revenue in the process. For this reason, FAO has been urging governments to sign on to the international Port State Measures Agreement that recently entered into force and will play a key role in combatting illegal fishing and improving fisheries management. Currently, however, only 13 out of 34 SIDS countries are party to the agreement, of which only nine countries are in Africa, Graziano da Silva stressed as he urged governments to consider taking immediate action to implement the treaty. At the next Our Oceans Conference, September 15-16 in Washington DC, I would like to present publicly the list of countries that have ratified the PSMA, he said. The blue economy Global fish production has grown steadily in the last five decades, even outpacing world population growth. Between the 1960s and 2012, the average per capita fish consumption almost doubled, rising from just under 10 kg to more than 19 kg. But the blue economy runs on more than just fish. In all, global ocean economic activity is estimated at $3-5 trillion. Ninety percent of global trade moves by marine transport and over 30 percent of global oil and gas is extracted offshore. What's more, expanding knowledge of marine biodiversity has provided breakthroughs in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, food production, and aquaculture. Graziano da Silva highlighted the role of ocean health in the UN's new Sustainable Development Goals, along with the success of last year's COP21 Climate Conference in Paris, where marine health featured prominently for the first time. Looking ahead at the upcoming COP22 in Morocco, the FAO leader said the organization will highlight how oceans can help grow economies and manage climate change at the same time. ""The goal of the international community should be not only building a sustainable green economy but also a blue one,"" he concluded. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa44","How Trump turned the lights out in Marrakesh; His victory likely to spur withdrawal of funding for climate change efforts","November 11, 2016 Friday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","IF AN iceberg had fallen from the sky, it wouldn't have chilled the climate-change conference in Morocco this week like news of the US election. More than 10\'e2\€  000 delegates, activists, science buffs and their support staff were there for COP22 , yet another round of the Paris Accord on climate change that became law on November 4, signed by 195 heads of state, including President Jacob Zuma. Barrack Obama is on board, but at a rally last month, Donald Trump made clear his position: ""We're going to put America first. That includes cancelling billions in climate change spending for the UN, a number Hillary wants to increase, and instead we will use that money to provide for American infrastructure including clean water, clean air and safety."" Not all bad. Trump wants clean air and water, but the global NGOs, state agencies, academic think-tanks and the multi-billion-dollar industry that has become the green lobby need money. Careers depend on it. So do worthwhile programmes like Kenya's wind farm on Lake Turkana or more airports with solar roofs like George in the Eastern Cape. To protect the climate from rising carbon dioxide emissions, everyone agrees on cleaner energy. But there's dissent on how to get there, with pragmatists saying it will need an evolution to new tech that allows fossil fuels like oil, gas and oil to burn with less smoke. The hardliners want to tear down those generators and replace them with wave, solar, wind (some say nuclear, to others it's a swearword). In Africa, this will be funded by the rich, and the Paris deal came with a kitty of $100\'e2\€  billion (R1.34\'e2\€  trillion). Now, the world's biggest donor who, in the past half century has spent trillions on aid, loans and soft investment among poorer nations, looks set to keep its money at home. And delegates like those in Marrakesh may have to do the same if no one pays the hotels and conference fees, fact-finding tours (tropics in the northern winter) and air fares. The meetings are known as a Conference of Parties (unkind types say ""continuous party"") and this one is COP22 . The treaty agrees to limit emissions and keep a rise in temperature below 2\'c2\'baC. Of course, we've been there before. Fewer than 20 countries have failed to ratify the UN Convention Against Torture. So why does the annual report from Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International run to hundreds of pages, mostly about people being tortured? There are global deals on stolen funds and money laundering, yet Western banks struggle to find the ill-gotten cash. Signing and doing are not the same thing. The wisdom of COP is simple: solar panels and wind farms are good, and we need to stop using coal to make electricity, especially in Africa where it's prevalent. Eskom gets more than 85% of its power from coal, ditto Botswana. Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria talk about using more, not less. The Obama government has opposed carbon fuel even though the US is the world's second-worst for greenhouse gas after China. The EU is number three. And as the election looked good for Hillary Clinton, then people left her Victory HQ in New York and the fireworks were cancelled, delegates in Marrakesh punched their iPads and followed the news online, forgetting perhaps that data centres for Google and YouTube use more power in a year than Zambia, Kenya or Morocco. One reason for this low consumption is that 95% of the world's people living off the grid are in Asia and Africa. In Europe, with their heating, air-conditioners, TV in the lounge and each of the kids' rooms, washers, dryers and hot water on tap, a small town can use more power than a country in the developing world. South Africa is the exception. When the new coal-fired plant at Medupi is finished in 2018, it will pump out more electricity than the whole of Nigeria. Walk through just about any city north of the Limpopo and you'll hear the chug of small generators. Better than nothing except the cost of that current is 10 times more than from a central source, no matter how it's made. In energy and in so much else, South Africa is the continent's superpower, but most of it comes from coal, the planet's most abundant fossil fuel. And often the cheapest, used to produce nearly a third of all the world's kilowatts and a massive 44%\'e2\€  in the US. Yes, drive past any town in Britain and you'll see wind turbines. And solar hot water has changed life for millions in Brazil, Australia and - thanks to the ANC - in townships around Joburg, Durban and our major cities Not everyone agreed with former Aussie premier Tony Abbott in 2014 when he said: ""Coal is good for humanity."" But it was hard to contest his view that it's ""an essential part of our economic future"". German Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has revised previous goals for letting go of the black stuff. Coal generators, he told an energy conference in Berlin, ""will on no account be switched off in the next decade, in my opinion not even in the one after that"". Merkel has promised to cut carbon dioxde by 95% over the next 30 years. Now, even in Europe's biggest economy, this seems unlikely. Too many other commitments, and if Washington pulls away from climate change, it's bound to set a precedent at a time when the EU is facing a financial hole with Britain's withdrawal. And parties currently top of the polls in France and Holland have pledged to give their people a similar vote. The World Bank has been condemned for funding Medupi to the tune of R40bn. But supporters say coal can burn around the clock. Solar only works when the sun is shining. And dollar for dollar, the same investment in panels would produce less power. What's more, South Africa has some of the world's largest coal reserves. The good news is an Anglo-Indian firm in Madras has pioneered a system when 97%\'e2\€  of emissions from a coal-fired generator can be captured and there's talk of the inventors being but up for a Nobel prize. Solar is part of the future. The sun will burn for at least another 5\'e2\€  billion years and the Sahara or Kalahari is surely the place to use it. The question after this week's election is: ""who pays?"" If you see yourself as a greenie but struggle with physics (I tick both), think on this. A 100 watt lightbulb burns that much power in an hour. But millions in Africa use less than 100 watts in a whole year. This leads to trees being cut for firewood and desertification put down to climate change when it's really just a growing population keeping warm and cooking their food. And while the continent may be a low consumer, in some ways it's more dependent. Vaccines, HIV drugs, even snakebite serum must stay cool. Hospitals can't work without electricity and, where boreholes are deep, it's still the best way to pump water. Everyone agrees on this, on the need to get more people connected to the grid, even power as a human right. It's not the destination that's in doubt at Marrakesh, but how to get there. But the past year, for many COP activists, the echo chamber of their cause has boomed a single message: Trump can't win. Well he has. Does that matter for millions of students doing homework by a paraffin lamp? Unlikely. But whether they get power any time soon will be more up to their governments than anyone else. What's for sure is the solutions need to be real. Cleaner ways of using what we've got, better distribution, fairer access, fewer people left out of the light. On aid, Trump says: ""Charity starts at home"". For Africa, policies on power may need to do just that. Hill is a writer and conservationist who works across east and southern Africa. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa45","Drought-hit Zimbabwe farmers look to science to save crops","November 10, 2016 Thursday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","Science is providing a glimmer of hope for smallholder maize farmers in Zimbabwe... Severe lack of rain across southern Africa has hit the country hard, with government officials saying a quarter of the population faces starvation. Many villagers are forced to survive on wild fruit. Maize, the country's traditional staple crop, has suffered a series of poor harvests. Late rains this year again wrecked the planting season, and the little that is growing has often been destroyed by heat. It may not help the immediate crisis, but science is providing a glimmer of hope for smallholder maize farmers in Zimbabwe. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - known by its Spanish acronym CIMMYT -- is conducting trials in Zaka on hybrid maize seeds adapted to tackle drought and high temperatures. The seeds are developed to survive dry conditions with 60% less water than normal and in temperatures of up to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), according to CIMMYT researchers. ""If we get these new maize seed varieties that will help us a lot,"" said Ceaser Chavizha, a small smallholder in Zaka, located in Masvingo province, south of the capital Harare. Like many farmers in the region who rely on maize produce, Chavizha has been forced to survive on food handouts as his crops have been reduced to dried husks. ""We cannot continue with handouts as we have fields that we can work on to produce food for our own, so we hope the new maize seeds will help us improve our yields,"" he told AFP. Maize meal crops are ground and turned into mealie meal, used to make porridge and other food, but the El Nino-induced drought has wrecked arable fields, grazing pastures and water sources. The drought scourge is high on the agenda at UN COP22 climate talks in Morocco, where world leaders and experts are discussing how to implement the landmark Paris Agreement that was signed last year. The pact aims to cap global warming at below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F), compared with pre-industrial levels. Once referred to as the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe used to be an exporter of maize, but now aid organisations say the country requires about two million metric tonnes a year to feed itself. Cosmos Magorokosho, a senior scientist and maize breeder at CIMMYT, said the ultimate goal of hybrids was to help farmers develop long-term sustainable agriculture. ""Basically it means transferring genes from one plant to another type so that you create a new type that has the characteristics that you want,"" he said. He said CIMMYT had received $500,000 funding from USAID to develop the new maize variety for drought-prone areas in east, central and southern Africa. Magorokosho stressed that more funds were needed to extend the project, and criticised the Zimbabwe government's delay in adopting new maize hybrids. ""There is a layer of testing that is required by the authorities which is a little bit long... we would wish it is shortened so that the varieties can get quickly to the farmers,"" Magorokosho said. CIMMYT, a non-profit research project headquartered in Mexico, is also working on a vitamin A-rich maize variety which is already in production in other parts of Africa and Latin America. This year, Zimbabwe's cash-strapped government declared a ""state of disaster"" in most rural areas, with at least 2.4 million people in urgent need of food aid. Sekai Makonese, another small-scale farmer in Zaka, welcomed the potential impact of scientific intervention, saying she was counting on hybrids becoming widespread as soon as possible. ""Long ago, we used to farm maize with no problems but now we have a problem with climate change and now our crops fail before we harvest,"" she said. The Zimbabwe government is yet to approve the mass distribution of the seeds, but the product is already available at some agricultural outlets. <em>Source: </em>emAFP/em<em>.</em> \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa46","Reducing emissions in power sector - SA's top priority","October 26, 2016 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The Department of Environmental Affairs says emission reduction options in the power sector remain a priority to meet the country's overall greenhouse gas reduction targets over the coming few years... Judie Beaumont, the deputy director-general responsible for Climate Change and Air Quality, said this when the department, as well as Eskom, briefed the Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs on renewable energy and SA s greenhouse emission reduction system at the National Assembly, on Tuesday, 25 October. Emission reduction options in the power sector are absolutely critical for South Africa s overall ability to reduce our carbon emissions and to transition to a lower carbon economy overtime. If we are not able to reduce emissions in the power sector, the rest of the economy has to take deeper action. So I think just to emphasise the importance of the power sector which really is the sector that generates because of the reliance at the moment on coal-based generation is the sector that produces the most greenhouse emissions, she said. Climate change mitigation system framework In 2005, Cabinet approved South Africa s climate change mitigation system framework. The framework included a number of key elements from a carbon budget for each company and desired emissions reduction outcomes for key economic sectors to pollution prevention plans by companies with carbon budgets and a reporting system to gather information on the actual emissions of users. Other measures, including the introduction of a carbon tax, are amongst those that have been identified to support or complement the carbon budget system. The system was introduced in phases. The first phase, which runs from 2016 until 2020, will be voluntary as there are no legal basis to set emissions limits for sector companies. Phase 2, which will run post 2020, will become mandatory once the climate change response legislation is in place. Beaumont said as the country is implementing the emissions reduction system, renewable energy is a critical component in that strategy. Deborah Ramalope, chief director responsible for emission reduction in the department, said the first phase was approved in 2015, together with the litigation potential analysis which will look at what is possible per sector in terms of emission reduction targets. She said the department has so far completed carbon budget with 18 companies, including Eskom, and that soon there will be draft carbon reduction plans that will help companies achieve their carbon budgets. The key sectors that are being considered for the implementation of mitigation factors include energy, transport, waste, carbon sinks, among others. From then on, companies will be required to report to the department on an annual basis to explain how they are doing in terms of meeting their carbon budgets and we will assess compliance. Eskom commits to climate change We take the issue of climate change very seriously as well as the issue of adhering to commitments made at the Paris conference, which should be probably ratified at the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ). We hope that the country will sign the COP 22 agreement of November 2016 so that we remain a player in the bigger parties and groupings relating to the discussions on climate change, he said. Eskom s chief financial officer Anoj Singh said Eskom is currently compliant with respect to meeting the requirements of carbon emissions. He said Eskom currently contributes about 44.5% to the national greenhouse gas emissions, which is the budgeted amount, and this makes the power utility compliant. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa47","We must work together to halt climate change","November 11, 2016 Friday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","LAST week the National Assembly formally ratified the Paris Agreement; representing a major milestone in South Africa's national effort to address and combat climate change. This paved the way for us to join 103 nations of the world who have ratified the agreement in the run-up to the 22nd Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under way in Morocco. This is a major step towards a low-carbon future and is evidence of our commitment to deal with climate change. It will furthermore build on what we have already done to reduce emissions while growing our economy. The Paris Agreement is universally regarded as a seminal point in the fight against climate change and was adopted last year in December at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the UNFCCC in Paris. South Africa signed the Paris Agreement at the UN in New York in April this year. It guides international efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to meet all challenges associated with and posed by climate change. It signals the change in pace towards low carbon development from 2020 onwards through commitments of countries in ambitious national plans called Nationally Determined Contributions.\'c2\~\'c2\~ The main objective of the agreement is to limit the global temperature increase to below 2\'c2\'b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Of critical importance to developing countries, particularly in Africa, is the enhanced importance accorded to adaptation to climate change, through the establishment of a global goal on adaptation, and to addressing loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change. The agreement on provision of financial support by developed countries to developing countries, and the intention to scale this up from 2025 is an important signal of continued support for climate action. Global climate change is real, and addressing it can no longer be postponed. It cannot be left to governments alone; it requires all of us to take action and be part of the solution. As government we have taken the lead and put in place progressive, innovative and proactive policies to deal with an ever-changing climate. Our policies are guided by the overarching principle of sustainable development, which is the cornerstone of Vision 2030 contained in the National Development Plan (NDP). These include the National Strategy for Sustainable Development, a National Climate Change Response Policy, Green Economy Strategy, and Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) which outlines our country's energy mix. Our approach as government is to strike a balance between policies that lower emissions, but at the same time promote economic growth. We committed ourselves in the first National Green Economy summit in 2010 to work together to pursue and explore opportunities ""towards a resource-efficient, low-carbon and pro-employment growth path"". This is in addition to our Industrial Policy and Action Plan that recognises that energy efficiency and less-carbon intensive production are central tenets of a green economy. The Paris Agreement applies to post-2020 climate actions but we need to start acting now. Government calls on all sectors to implement measures to fight climate change so that we can build a buffer against the harmful effects of a changing environment. We can all start at home by becoming more energy efficient by switching off lights that are not in use, changing to fluorescents or\'c2\~LEDs light bulbs and better insulating our homes. Switching to clean energy sources such as solar heating, using energy-efficient showerheads and high-efficiency home appliances will also help reduce individual and collective carbon footprints. Small changes to our daily routines such as walking, cycling or using public transport rather than taking the car can also have a positive impact. Another practical way you can join the fight against climate change is to plant more trees in your garden, thereby reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Our actions today can save our country and the world for future generations. Molewa is Minister of Environmental Affairs. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa48","FAO to tackle water scarcity, one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture","November 18, 2016 Friday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","It is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution... With over 90 percent of countries referring to the important role of agriculture in their national plans to adapt to and mitigate climate change, Graziano da Silva stressed that ""it is time to invest in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture as a fundamental part of the climate solution."" Last year's conference in Paris led to the world's first legally binding global climate deal. The current summit in Marrakech, Morocco is geared to implementation of the pledges all signatory countries made. Echoing the prevalent spirit at the COP, the Paris Agreement is irreversible and inaction would be a disaster for the world. Transforming agriculture - maximising benefits Although agriculture contributes to nearly 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, it is a fundamental part of the solution to boost resilience and combat climate change impacts - especially in developing countries where agriculture is often the backbone of the economy. Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people. Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services, and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. ""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" FAO's director-general said. ""Countries are recognising this potential with unprecedented commitments."" Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added. A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, a special event co-organised by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Hait\'e9 (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals. In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change. Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative."" At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far. The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particular, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he said. Cost of inaction far outweighs action The world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change. ""For millions of people, our actions can make a difference between poverty and prosperity, and between hunger and food security,"" FAO's director-general said. \"

""Africa is paying a heavy price over the climate issue and is without doubt the continent worst affected,"" Morocco's King Mohammed VI told the summit attended by 20 African leaders. ""These disruptions... greatly hamper Africa's development and gravely threaten the basic rights of tens of millions of Africans,"" he said. He said the continent needed to ""speak in a single voice, demand climate justice"". France's President Francois Hollande and UN chief Ban Ki-moon also attended the summit which took place alongside the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakesh. Ban said Africa was at the forefront of the fight against climate change, and that 36 of the 50 countries most affected by global warming were African. Senegal's President Macky Sall said African countries would wait until 2020 for promised aid from developed countries to fight global warming. An agreement after last year's climate talks in Paris provides for a green fund of $100bn ( 90bn) per year from 2020 to help poorer nations make the shift to clean energy. Hollande said Wednesday's summit would ""lay the foundations"" for the plan to help Africa from 2020. ""France has made its commitments and will keep them, I will see to it,"" he said. African leaders have called for more funding from developed nations to cut fossil fuel emissions and take contingency measures. ""Developed countries must shoulder their historical responsibility for emissions,"" Djibouti's President Ismail Omar Guelleh said on Tuesday. The UN, too, has called for more money, especially for ""adaptation"" - shoring up defences against the effects of global warming. This could mean building dykes or elevating homes as protection against rising seas, improving weather warning systems and growing climate change-resistant crops. President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide during the 13-year-old conflict in Darfur, also attended. He has always denied the charges. Burundi, South Africa and the Gambia have all pulled out of the court's founding treaty, the Rome statute, in recent weeks. Kenya, Namibia and Uganda have indicated they may follow suit. On Wednesday, Russia dealt the ICC a new blow by saying it would formally withdraw its signature from the Rome statute. Hosting the summit is a diplomatic coup for Morocco as it seeks to reassert its influence in Africa. In July, the kingdom announced it wanted to rejoin the African Union after a three-decade hiatus, and in September it lodged a formal application. The king has since toured east Africa in a bid to woo support. After the Marrakesh talks he is due to visit Addis Ababa, where the AU is based. Morocco pulled out of what was then called the Organisation of African Unity in 1984 in protest at the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic declared by the pro-independence Polisario Front in the Western Sahara. The move came at the height of the armed conflict between the Polisario and Morocco over the former Spanish colony. A UN-supervised ceasefire has been in effect since 1991 but a quarter of a century of efforts for a lasting peace have yielded few results. Morocco controls all the territory's main towns, with the Polisario confined to a narrow strip in the desert interior. Tens of thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in camps in neighbouring Algeria. Algeria has long backed the Polisario and Morocco's bid for AU membership has set off what is likely to be dogged diplomatic battle for influence between the North African rivals. Source: AFP \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa50","Protecting and developing African agriculture in the face of climate change","November 28, 2016 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The weak output in Africa, reinforced by a spike in temperatures and exacerbated by extreme climate events, could create a vicious loop of food insecurity, impoverishment, mass migration and... During the COP21 last year in Paris, the world s developed nations reaffirmed their commitment to provide at least $100 billion per year, beginning in 2020, to help developing nations combat climate change. In the past, most funds have been used on mitigation projects - those intended to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. But there is a growing consensus that work focused on adapting to climate change is of equal importance and more funding needs to be devoted to it. This is a step in the right direction. With 28 African countries expected to more than double in population by 2050, and 10 African countries - Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia - expected to grow by at least a factor of five by 2100, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Africa will be hard pressed to feed itself as temperature increases drive farm production down. Higher temperatures leads to weak output in Africa <blockquote>The scientific consensus is that a temperature increase of 2\'b0Celsius would result in an average reduction of 15% to 20% in agricultural yields on the continent.</blockquote> While increases in temperature and carbon dioxide can increase some crop yields in some places, experts at the US Environmental Protection Agency have noted Africa isn t among them. In fact, the opposite is true: The scientific consensus is that a temperature increase of 2\'b0Celsius would result in an average reduction of 15% to 20% in agricultural yields on the continent. The Center for Global Development s 2011 report, Quantifying Vulnerability to Climate Change Implications for Adaptation Assistance, forecasts median agricultural productivity losses due to climate change ranging from 18% in North Africa to 19.8% in Central Africa through 2050. The weak output in Africa, reinforced by a spike in temperatures and exacerbated by extreme climate events, could create a vicious loop of food insecurity, impoverishment, mass migration and, finally, armed conflict. Climate-related migration and conflict already are a reality on the continent, and more often than not they are related to agriculture and food. The feedback loop In addition to the moral imperative of feeding people, there is also an essentially practical argument to be made in favour of significantly increasing support for agricultural adaptation in Africa - the so-called feedback loop. By helping Africa boost agricultural production through improved soil management and irrigation techniques, as well as increased research on other farming techniques that respect the integrity of land, the global community also would be helping reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. That s because the improved agricultural practices, in a virtuous circle, would increase yields on poor farmland, reduce deforestation and improve the carbon sequestration capacity of cultivated soil. Adapting African Agriculture Currently, agriculture and Africa are the poor relations of climate finance. Adaptation, agriculture and Africa have been understudied and underfunded and their importance underestimated. In the area of agriculture, all geographic regions combined account for only 4% of public funds linked to climate change. The African continent, home to nearly 25% of the developing world s population, receives just 5% of public and private climate funds. This is difficult to swallow when you consider that Africa is among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, while only marginally contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. By maintaining African agriculture and reinforcing its capacity for adapting to climate change, the international community can show its responsiveness to the life-and-death issue of African food security, while addressing the global imperative to reduce temperature increases. Marrakech COP22 is a unique opportunity to finally position the adaptation of African agriculture as one of the highest priority subjects. Delegates to the Marrakech climate conference can help solve this problem by reallocating available climate change resources from mitigation efforts to adaptation projects in general, and to the African agriculture in particular. For Africa and the world, it is time to consider these realities. \"

The transformation of the agricultural sectors to address climate change for adaptation and mitigation is essential to tackling hunger and poverty and offers considerable benefits and opportunities for preserving natural resources. At the COP21 summit in Paris, countries made unprecedented commitments to adapt to and mitigate climate change. The agreement recognises ""the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change."" This is echoed in country commitments where the agricultural sectors stand out as a priority. Now, at COP22 in Morocco, we have the opportunity to make significant progress, by making agriculture a major part of the solution. A focus on smallholders Transformation to sustainable agriculture will require tailor-made solutions and an enabling environment, resources and time. The world's primary food producers include around 500 million smallholders and family farmers engaged in a variety of farming practices and environmental conditions. As a result, there is no single formula for sustainability. For that very reason, rapid deployment of support for that transformation is critical. In 2016, July and August were the hottest ever in recorded history, underscoring the urgent need to dramatically scale up our efforts on climate action. The good news is that a radical shift to climate-smart sustainable agriculture is possible, and rural smallholders - the most vulnerable of all - can not only adapt but actively contribute to global climate stabilisation. To do so effectively, they will need support as they do not have any reserves to invest in new farming practices. The sooner we start to focus actions on people in rural areas of developing countries, the better. There is not much time as the adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural livelihoods will hit harder and faster in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Small Island Developing States. Taking action Plenty of viable and affordable ideas for climate actions exist, ranging from efficient practices used in agroecology and those outlined in FAO's Climate-Smart Agriculture and Save and Grow approaches to techniques such as the broader use of nitrogen-fixing cover crops and methods to cut methane emissions involved in growing rice or raising livestock. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations actively supports countries in these multiple efforts, from improving soil fertility, efficient and sustainable water use, management of crop and livestock varieties to protecting biodiversity and helping member states build technical and policy capacity. The Paris climate agreement, the world's first legally binding global climate deal, explicitly recognises the importance of harnessing climate action to drive sustainable development - something the agricultural sectors are uniquely positioned to do. It is essential that we keep the momentum going. As rural communities in developing countries are the least responsible for climate change and the most exposed to its adverse impacts, enabling them to respond is both a duty and a collective interest. Private and public investment will be required urgently. The benefits of immediate action will vastly outstrip the short-term cost. Funding New funding facilities, such as the Green Climate Fund, are now available. International and public funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture need to catalyse even larger flows of national and private investments. And, given the great potential to eradicate hunger and poverty while also contributing to climate change mitigation, more climate finance should be channeled towards sustainable agriculture. Political will What we really need now is political will, commitment to execution and policy coherence. If we don't act now, we will not be able to eradicate hunger and poverty by 2030, as foreseen in the global Sustainable Development Goals. Worse, even more people - as many as 122 million - could be at risk of undernourishment by 2030 than would be the case in the absence of climate change. Marrakesh can and should become the place where we assign agriculture its central role in solving the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change.

The green agricultural revolution here is well overdue. With more than 874 million hectares of arable land - nearly six times as much as in the United States - Africa has the opportunity to ensure food security for all without repeating the environmental mistakes made by advanced economies.Africa s green industrial revolutionStatistics in the 2016 United Nations Economic Report on Africa (ERA) show a path to environmentally sound industrialisation. Investing in infrastructure so that people can power their homes with greener energy without chopping down trees will be key. With the increased wealth that an agricultural revolution might bring, we need to be conscious of not squandering our natural resources. Therefore, green power and improved livelihoods must go hand in hand. If we adopt a green agenda to improve urbanization, energy developments, and population growth, the report says, GDP per capita would more than triple to $14,000 and the number of Africans living on less than $2 a day would nearly halve to 350 million.Africa s green industrial revolution has to use the continent s abundant renewable energies. Africa consumes less than 3 percent of the total energy produced globally and accounts for less than 4 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, yet it needs more energy to industrialise. Currently, Africa uses only 2 percent of its renewable water resources and has the potential to increase hydropower generation.Greening is not just about honoring United Nations environment agreements made at the COP21 Paris climate change talks last year, or the decisions made at COP22 which will take place in Marrakesh in November. It is about combining industrialisation and technological advances that protect our natural resources in the production process. If we get this transition right, women, in particular, stand to benefit. Rural women constitute the majority of the 80 percent of agricultural production coming from small farmers, yet they have limited access and control over the means of production. With proper training, these women could boost productivity and boost their earnings, thus lifting the economy. Jobs as the multiplier effect I was entrusted with the responsibility to implement a strategy focused on health, education and financial inclusion for Ecobank Foundation, a branch of one of Africa s largest banking conglomerates dedicated to funding social projects. While it will be possible for us to make progress with our partners, we will not reach our full contribution to society until our collective investment is matched with jobs along the value chains of Africa s agricultural resources. Jobs are the multiplier effect of social investments. Unless more Africans are joining - and being retained in - the labour market, transformation will remain an elusive concept for many Africans. I am confident that my generation can deliver on the jobs promise, the same way our forefathers did on the promise of independence. We have managed to solve everyday problems by innovation out of necessity in places where energy is lacking. We can do the same for our agricultural revolution that holds the key to unlocking jobs in new sectors. With Africa s population projected to reach 2.4 billion people by 2050, current and new jobs will have to come from agriculture to quell persistent high levels of informal employment accounting for as many as 80 percent of jobs. Financing the green revolution Technology can help, as we have seen with M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer. With adequate regulation, M-Pesa could give rise to a mechanism to finance the green revolution. For example, InVenture delivered 200,000 loans in Kenya with repayment rates above 90 percent by using mobile data to create a financial identity for borrowers. We have already seen how this can translate into agricultural development. In Zimbabwe, an e-voucher programme helps cash-strapped small-scale farmers buy agricultural inputs. In Nigeria, an e-wallet program allows farmers to receive vouchers for subsidized seeds and fertilizer. In Senegal, the Mlouma online platform connects farmers to food purchasers by displaying real-time market prices for their location. In Ghana, cocoalink connects cocoa farmers with information about good farming practices. In DRC, Mobile Agribiz uses web and mobile technologies to improve access to agriculture information and market accessibility for small farmers. In Africa, we have adopted alternative technology to address our limitations. Greening Africa s industrialisation will allow us to reach our full potential without relying solely on unpredictable commodity cycles. In doing so, we can create jobs and move up the value chain, both on the continent and in the global marketplace. We have access to technology as we learn to distance ourselves from raw materials extraction. Though the conditions have changed, we have a window that we cannot miss if we are to reap the benefits of our investments in Africa s transformation.

""The unprecedented mobilisation of the international community and its political will, expressed at the highest levels, have been crowned by the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement,"" said Mezouar in a Monday UN press release. In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific thresholds. The Agreement entered into force in time for COP 22 , where the first Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement will open on November 15. Before the meeting wraps up on November 18, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action. In his remarks, Mezouar urged participants ""to be more ambitious,"" and stressed that ""the eyes of the world are on us"". Meanwhile, Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, told the opening of the Conference that the rapid entry into force of the Paris accord ""is a clear cause for celebration, but it is also a timely reminder of the high expectations that are now placed upon us all"". Espinosa said: ""Achieving the aims and ambitions of the Paris Agreement is not a given"". She added: ""Marrakech is our moment to take forward climate action at the international and national levels as a central pillar of the successful realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"". Espinosa underlined key areas in which work needs to be taken forward. She stressed that finance was flowing, but it was not enough. The President of COP 21, which agreed the Paris accord last year, Segolene Royal, French Minister of Environment, Energy and the Sea, welcomed the ratification of the Paris Agreement by 100 countries as of this past Sunday.

In fact, it is estimated that 65 percent of Africa's population is affected by climate change... This story of failed harvest, hunger and hopelessness as temperatures rise are common across the continent. In fact, it is estimated that 65 percent of Africa's population is affected by climate change. The need for agriculture, which feeds the chronically food insecure region and forms the backbone of its economy, to adapt to these extreme weather events is becoming urgent. Yet disappointingly, here at COP22 in Marrakech, dubbed both ""The African COP"" and ""The COP of Action,"" talks to include agriculture in the climate change negotiations have once again collapsed. Disputes on how to integrate adaptation and mitigation efforts have led to any further discussions being postponed until June 2017 at the next meeting of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) in Bonn. Lack of progress at a global level makes regional action all the more critical. That is why the Moroccan government is championing the adaptation of African agriculture (AAA), through the launch of the ambitious AAA initiative. At an event held in Marrakech, scientists and policymakers from all over Africa came together to determine an action plan for implementing this initiative, based on a rich body of evidence generated by the global research network CGIAR and its many partners. Taken together with the clear desire for action by African countries that prioritised agriculture in their national climate plans, there is significant potential to transform food and farming under climate change. A number of actions were identified at the event as being the most crucial for accelerating action on the adaptation of African agriculture. Mobilising investment Recent analysis has proven that investing in climate-sensitive practices makes both environmental and economic sense. According to a report launched by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and CGIAR last week, for each dollar invested through IFAD's Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme, farmers could earn a return of up to $2.60 over a 20 year period by applying climate change adaptation practices. <blockquote>Africa's annual need for investment in adaptation has been estimated to be between $7-15 billion per year by 2020, across all sectors.</blockquote> Despite this compelling evidence, investments are limited by availability and access to finance. Africa's annual need for investment in adaptation has been estimated to be between $7-15 billion per year by 2020, across all sectors. But only around $1-2 billion per year is available now from public sources, and Africa receives just five percent of international public climate funding. Assisting African countries to prepare economic and financial analyses of costs and returns to farmers of various adaptation actions, for example, will help countries access sorely needed finance from climate funds. Knowledge exchange As greater amounts of investments are mobilised into the sector, we need to ensure it is used effectively. By fostering partnerships that share knowledge, at a regional and transnational level, Africa farmers can be equipped with cost-effective and impactful approaches for adaptation. A recent knowledge exchange between Senegal and Colombia is a fine example of this. Work has been underway in Senegal to involve farmers in a new initiative for farmer-oriented climate information and weather forecasting services. This has involved marrying traditional knowledge with advanced scientific approaches, which are then disseminated in local languages via community radio. Colombian farmers have visited Kaffrine in Senegal to learn from this experience, and taking back lessons for implementing a similar project in their region benefiting 1,500 farmers. Monitoring and measuring Measuring progress is going to be a great challenge as the Paris Agreement moves forward, and should not be underestimated. Countries will be required to report on their emissions using an enhanced transparency and accountability framework put together as part of the Paris Agreement. There is an important role here for the science community to facilitate and support this process. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) has developed a Climate-Smart Agriculture programming and indicator tool, which brings together and builds upon approaches used by major development agencies in monitoring projects. The tool helps measure outcomes related to increased productivity, food security, adaptation, resilience, and mitigation, and could be key to helping countries measure progress towards established targets. Farmers like Amon have no time to lose - they are relying on leaders and experts to take action now. Using the momentum created by the Moroccan government, Africa must move forward on adaptation for agriculture, even while global progress stalls.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa57","Let us keep up the impetus on climate action","October 23, 2016 Sunday","Sunday Times (South Africa)","Let us keep up the impetus on climate action South Africa requires funding from international sources as well as a greater role by the private sector if it wants to attain its climate change objectives, writes LESS than a year after its adoption at the closing of the climate change conference COP21, the Paris agreement to combat climate change will come into effect next month, and become binding on all countries that have ratified the treaty. This is after the threshold was reached of at least 55 countries that were parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change finalising their instruments of ratification. It is a victory for climate action that the process of ratification has taken place with such speed. South Africa is in the final stages of going through the parliamentary ratification. The task before countries is to build on and strengthen the momentum that ensured the early enforcement of the agreement. For this to happen, the issue of climate finance is critical. The reality is that developing countries such as South Africa can only scale up their climate action efforts with significant investment. Ahead of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 This implementation refers to the provision of financial resources to enable developing countries to meet the costs of adaptation to, and mitigation of, the effects of climate change. The Paris agreement commits developed countries to provide $100-billion (about R1.4-trillion) a year by 2020 and scale that up in 2025. South Africa has consistently emphasised the importance of governments and non-state actors meeting to discuss how to find additional resources to aid our country's transition to a low-carbon, inclusive, climate-resilient economy and society. Despite facing the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality, and resulting resource and capacity constraints, we are doing our fair share towards the global effort to fight climate change. We have invested heavily in mitigation and adaptation initiatives in the green economy, renewable energy, green transport and other sectors, to name but a few. To scale up efforts requires billions of dollars in additional investment that we simply cannot find on our own. Funding for implementation includes provision for the transfer of environmentally sound, technically proven technologies, as well as for skills development and capacity building. South Africa further emphasised in Morocco this week that we need to seriously look at so-called adaptation financing before 2020: for instance, the provision of climate-change adaptation financing to help manage issues like water scarcity. Like many other countries on the continent, South Africa is semi-arid, with less than 5% of annual rainfall available to recharge our groundwater aquifers (large underground lakes). In an ever-changing climate, our existing water challenges are exacerbated. Extreme weather includes drought, which leads to diminished agricultural production and loss of food security, especially for people in rural areas. Irregular rainfall can lead to an increase in human and animal disease, including cholera, malaria and diarrhoea, thereby putting immense strain on the public health system. Flash flooding damages crucial infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications, resulting in social and economic losses. Flooding of low-lying coastal areas as a result of sea-level rise results in the loss of life and human settlements, as well as destruction of mangroves and river deltas. Groundwater can become contaminated, rendering areas uninhabitable for communities reliant on borehole water for drinking and crop irrigation. Climate change affects nearly every cog in the many wheels that keep this country running: from healthcare to agriculture and forestry, to biodiversity and ecosystems, to infrastructure and human settlements, to defence, to water and sanitation. Adapting to climate change requires a response that builds and sustains South Africa's social, economic and environmental resilience as well as our emergency response capacity - and to meet our obligations we require financial support. Although we are all ultimately impacted by the effects of a changing climate, such effects are not being felt evenly around the world. South Africa, and the African continent as a whole, are at greater risk because of low levels of development and because our climate change adaptation efforts aren't on the scale of developed countries. Scaling up the provision of climate financing is critical if we are to meet the long-term objectives of the Paris agreement. In this regard, non-party stakeholders, especially business, need to do more to support and advance the Global Climate Action agenda.  Molewa is minister of environmental affairs \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa58","Unity call as race for AU hots up","December 02, 2016 Friday","Pretoria News (South Africa)","With the race hotting up to replace Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as AU chairwoman next month, one of the five hopeful candidates - Professor Abdoulaye Bathily of Senegal - has criss-crossed the continent passing through Morocco, Madagascar and Mozambique before landing in South Africa. His message is simple: ""Africa must unite to overcome perennial problems of joblessness and poverty."" The professor obviously knows what he's talking about - he has taught African history at universities for four decades and has been a UN diplomat, foreign minister, MP and leader of a leftist political party in his country. Speaking to the African News Agency in Joburg, Bathily, who comes across as unassuming, boldly stated: ""I am African first before being a Senegalese."" He had just arrived in South Africa from Mozambique, where he met President Filipe Nyusi. He is lobbying for support across the imaginary divide between Anglophone and Francophone countries on the continent. He dismissed the divide as an outdated concept created in the '0s during the invasion, occupation and colonisation of the continent. He is confident Africa can and will unite to take its rightful place in the world, where there is full citizen participation. Bathily attended the recent UN climate change conference - COP22 - in Morocco, where he was impressed with developments. He, however, would like Africa to have greener energy and participate more in the blue economy. At the ripe age of 69, somehow Bathily's punishing travel and engagements schedule does not seem to affect him. In Maputo he made it a point to visit an old friend. ""I also met former president Joaquim Chissano,"" said the former UN diplomat, whose experience, knowledge of the continent and academic qualifications place him head and shoulders above the rest of the candidates. Not fazed by mingling with politicians and leaders he casually mentions that he ""met President Jacob Zuma"" and had a chat with him. He was not wearing a tie, but his grey suit more than marks him out as a distinguished individual. The professor is travelling with a delegation that includes his country's foreign minister, Mankeur Ndiaye, helping him to lobby for support for the AU Commission chairperson position, which is voted for by member states. Bathily said he spoke to Zuma about his candidature for the coveted position that will be contested for in January in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. ""I also met former president Thabo Mbeki,"" said Bathily. ""I know Chissano and Mbeki from the Struggle days."" Asked about his vision for Africa, the professor said public and private economic actors needed to ""pull together"" to build an ""African social base"" for development to take place. ""Africa is lacking a vigorous private sector. ""There must be free movement of people and goods in Africa."" His vision is in line with the shared AU vision 2063 which seeks to steer the continent towards higher social, political, economic and cultural levels. Bathily says Africa needs transcoporations to ""put the capital together"" to fund infrastructure projects on the continent. He said about 70\'e2\€  percent of the AU bills were paid for from donor funds from abroad. ""This time Africa cannot continue to depend on foreign donors."" He said as many as 63\'e2\€  percent of Africa's young educated people could not get jobs because there was slow development and limited industrialisation. ""We also need to develop our human capacity to be able to use money properly and for the purpose it has been budgeted for."" Noting that noble ideas have been hamstrung in the past by limited funding and poor handling of funds, Bathily says there is hope. He is aware Rwanda President Paul Kagame is leading an AU finance reform team, which has come up with a plan to finance the august body. As much as $1.2\'e2\€  billion can be raised through a 0.2\'e2\€  percent tax on imports from outside the continent, if Kagame's reform plan is put into practice. If he wins the coveted position of AU Commission leader, Bathily says he will ""see that this programme is implemented"". He also has a passion for women's issues which he says are important. ""Dlamini Zuma has done a lot... I would want to keep the momentum"". The professor, who in October quit his post as Special Representative of the UN secretary-general for Central Africa to contest the AU position, has fond memories of meetings with Nelson Mandela. Apart from Bathily, the coveted post has attracted four other candidates - Botswana's Dr Pelonomi Moitoi, Kenyan Foreign Affairs cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed, former Ugandan vice-president Specioza Wandira Kazibwe and Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Agapito Mba Mokuy. Dlamini Zuma was supposed to hand over the baton in July, but those who had lined up to take over never made the grade in elections held in Kigali, Rwanda on July 17 and 18. Kazibwe, Moitoi and Mba Mokuy failed to garner the required two-thirds majority vote and Dlamini Zuma, who declined a second term, was asked to continue in the role until January . All three have again put their names in the hat. If the criteria for the most powerful position in the AU is voted for on experience, track records of excellence and academic qualification, Bathily leads the way. - ANA \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa59","\'e2\u8364 \u8249 SA lags behind as countries put forward their climate change plans","November 22, 2016","Mail & Guardian","NEWS ANALYSIS There won't be a COP meeting next year. After two decades of negotiations, the world got its climate agreement at COP21 in Paris last year  the Paris Agreement. This year's meeting in Marrakech fleshed that out and ensured its nearly 200 signatories were on the same path.That will see the world moving away from fossil fuels and aiming for zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will also, hopefully, ensure that global warming does not exceed 2\'c2\'b0C this century. Instead of a massive COP meeting, negotiators will meet twice in Germany next year in smaller gatherings to keep on tweaking things. At the heart of this process will be each country's nationally determined contribution. This is the pledge each country put forward to say how it will lower emissions, and adapt to the changing climate. South Africa's contribution covers a whole range of things, such as creating jobs in sustainable development initiatives and shutting down coal-fired power stations. But its core aim is vague  carbon emissions by 2030 could be anywhere between 198-million tonnes and 614-million tonnes. Climate Action Tracker  a nongovernmental group that crunches the numbers on each country's contribution  called South Africa's contribution ""inadequate"" because it did not match the ambition of keeping global warming below 2\'c2\'b0C. ""If most other countries follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3\'c2\'b0C to 4\'c2\'b0C."" Put together, all the contributions that have been submitted will see the world warm by 2.7\'c2\'b0C this century. These commitments are, however, just a starting point. Most countries have played it safe with their nationally determined contributions. These also only cover the period up until 2030. They are more about getting countries on the same page than ensuring that the world is saved from 2\'c2\'b0C warming. At COP22 in Marrakech, four countries took big steps towards the real goal of keeping warming below that dangerous level. The United States, Germany, Canada and Mexico published their plans for how their economies would have moved largely away from fossil fuels by 2050. Germany promised a 95% cut and the United States an 80% cut. The Climate Vulnerable Group of 47 states that face the worst impacts of the changing climate, went one further and promised to run off 100% renewables by the middle of this century.African countries took the practical path towards a similar goal, giving more details on their Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. This will see 300-gigawatts of renewable capacity built across the continent by 2030. Critically, this will be with funds from private investors, instead of from developed countries giving aid. That path has stuttered over the years and created a great deal of cynicism among African countries, which stand to lose out from the changing climate. Even the Paris Agreement's goal of reducing warming to 2\'c2\'b0C will result in warming of double that on the continent, which is why the Africa Group at negotiations argued for, and failed to get that goal to be 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Funds to build renewable energy  and adapt to the changing climate  should have come through the Green Climate Fund. In theory, this would have $10-billion a year to disburse to countries that applied for finance. It neatly solved an impasse at previous negotiations, where developing countries refused to sign up to an agreement that prevented them from exploiting fossil fuels and did not see developed countries pay for the climate damage caused by their previous use of fossil fuels. But the money isn't there. The US promised to kick things off with a $3-billion commitment. It has handed over $500-million with little more expected to come from that source  president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to cut all funds to United Nations programmes. By taking control over their own energy future, African countries have an opportunity to do another great technological leapfrog. With the exception of South Africa, most of the continent's countries have little in the way of power. Renewable energy will allow countries to get that power, while not emitting carbon. All of this means delegates left Marrakech with a clear view of the path ahead: countries doing their best and working together to lower emissions. The only spanner in that works is Trump, who could reverse all work to reduce emissions in the world's second largest emitter of carbon dioxide. With global levels at 400 parts per million  up from the stable 250 parts per million at the start of the Industrial Revolution  the world is into its sixth successive year of record-breaking heat. This year is set to be the hottest on record  the World Meteorological Organisation says it will be 1.1\'c2\'b0C hotter than it would otherwise be if humans weren't warming the planet. That's halfway to the 2\'c2\'b0C cap set by the Paris Agreement. But even Trump might be unable to stop the progress coming out of Paris and Marrakech. The nations of the world have largely agreed to do the same thing. That's historic. \"

Droughts and floods are more frequent and intense, as are climate-related outbreaks of diseases and pests, he added, citing the terrible impact of El Ni\'f1o in parts of Africa, Asia and Central American and more recently, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti. ""As usual the poorest and the hungry suffer the most and the vast majority of them are small family farmers that live in rural areas of developing countries,"" the FAO director-general said, noting how adaptation and mitigation to climate change is fundamental, and that this requires ""much better access to appropriate technologies, knowledge, markets, information and investments."" Recent international commitments for action, including the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognise the fundamental role of sustainable agriculture in addressing climate change, hunger, and poverty. The World Food Day 2016 slogan: 'Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too', underscores the fact that to feed a global population expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050, humanity needs to produce more food, but in ways that use up less natural resources and that drastically reduce loss and waste. The fight for food security is a question of Politics In his address, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stressed that the fight against hunger is essentially a political issue. ""Italy maintains that the fight for food security is, at this point in history, a question of politics with a capital P',"" he added. Renzi said that the international community needs to urgently address the problems of inequality and injustice. Italy would strive to ensure that these themes are at the top of the international agenda, including at two important events in March next year: the G7 summit, which Italy will host and preside and a meeting of European Union leaders. Renzi noted that Europe should reject a ""culture of waste"". Italy recently passed a new law aimed at curbing food waste, one that was based, ""more on collaboration and less on punishment."" Another keynote speaker at today's ceremony, Princess Lalla Hasnaa of Morocco, whose country is hosting next month's COP22 climate talks, said these would be ""action-oriented"" and geared towards implementing the Paris Agreement. ""The Moroccan Presidency will seek to nurture and promote the spirit of mobilisation which prevailed in Paris in terms of increasing climate funding, developing expertise and ensuring the transfer of technology. It will lay special emphasis on adaptation, primarily for the countries of the South and for Small Island States."" Princess Hasnaa said. Pope urges solidarity with ""climate refugees"" In a special message read out at the ceremony, Pope Francis linked the impact of climate change on the planet's fields, fisheries, and forests to the migration of people from rural areas of developing countries. ""The most recent data tell us that the numbers of climate refugees' are growing, swelling the ranks of the excluded and forgotten, who are being marginalised from the great human family,"" the pontiff said. ""From the wisdom of rural communities we can learn a style of life that can help defend us from the logic of consumerism and production at any cost, a logic that, cloaked in good justification, such as increasing population, is in reality aimed solely at the increase in profit,"" he said. Pope Francis expressed concern that a growing number of actors in agriculture ""believe they are omnipotent or are able to ignore the cycles of the seasons and to improperly modify the various animal and plant species, leading to the loss of variety that, if it exists in nature, has and must have its role"". What may ""give excellent results in the laboratory may be advantageous to some, but it can have ruinous effects for others."" He stressed that in dealing with such issues, the world should rely more on the wisdom that farmers, fishers, and pastoralists ""conserve in memory handed down through generations."" We must change the way we approach food and agriculture UN Special Envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, Macharia Kamau, for his part, urged for the need ""to build stronger solidarity, stronger actions, better partnerships and innovation, including insurance schemes that protect families and take risk out of humanitarian response"" programmes. ""The 2030 agenda, at its core, is an agenda for fighting poverty, making sure there is no hunger, and food is there for everybody. And nothing threatens that more than climate change,"" he said. ""We must change the way we approach food and agriculture. Part of that change is ensuring rural smallholder producers are more resilient than ever before to the impacts of a changing climate,"" said Kanayo F. Nwanze, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). ""If we are ever to break the cycle of poverty and hunger, our attention must be focused on these smallholder producers who are the source of food for their families and communities, but are vulnerable to the effects of climate change."" Ertharin Cousin, executive director, World Food Programme (WFP) for her part said: Climate change is already stretching the international humanitarian system financially and operationally, so moving beyond disaster relief to managing risk is an urgent task for all of us. More than 80 percent of the world's hungry live in areas prone to natural disasters and environmental degradation. Climate change is not waiting, neither can we."" Mayors Summit On World Food Day, FAO is also hosting the second Mayors' Annual Summit where mayors and senior officials from more than 45 cities will discuss progress made in meeting the goals of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. The pact calls on cities to develop more sustainable and equitable food systems, end urban hunger, promote healthy diets, reduce waste and conserve biodiversity while adapting to climate change and mitigating its effects. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa62","Starting Line Draws Nearer for Global Climate Agreement","September 22, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The Paris Climate Agreement is on the verge of coming into force after 31 nations officially deposited their instruments of ratification here Wednesday, more than doubling the number of countries which have joined so far to reach 60. However the treaty will not yet enter into force, since these 60 countries represent only 48 percent of global carbon emissions. The Paris Agreement requires at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in order for the deal to take effect. Convened by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the High Level Event on Entry into Force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change brought world leaders together to act upon commitments made to reduce global greenhouse emissions last year. ""What once seemed impossible now seems inevitable. When this year ends, I hope we can all look back with pride knowing that we seized the opportunity to protect our common home,"" said Ban to delegates. Director of Strategy and Policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) Alden Meyer pointed out the significance of the event to IPS, stating: ""Political leaders see this as an important issue for their public."" Similarly, Greenpeace International's Climate and Energy Policy Advisor Kaisa Kosonen said how ""inspiring"" it was to see so many countries ratifying the agreement so soon. ""It truly tells you that times have changed. If one compares the process we had at Copenhagen and you think about where we are today when the agreement is looking likely to enter into force... it is giving the agreement a very good start,"" she told IPS During the UN Climate Change Conference in 2009 (COP15) in Denmark, global leaders failed to commit to concrete actions to reduce emissions. The Paris Agreement now obligates governments to keep temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Many believe that the treaty will be ratified by the end of the year, less than a year since the agreement was signed, which would make it the speediest agreement to enter into force. ""It's unprecedented,"" said Spokesperson for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Nick Nuttall to IPS after noting the breakneck speed in which the treaty would come into force. ""Getting an agreement on climate change was one of the most difficult tasks the world has ever faced... that's a strong political signal that all governments are on board to actually make good on their pledges in Paris."" Of the countries that have joined are some of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions including China and the United States, which together account for over one third of global emissions. However many of the countries which joined the agreement early, were small island states many of which see climate change as an existential threat. Although these states face increased natural disasters and rising sea levels, their own carbon emissions barely make a dent on a global scale. China, which represents just over 20 percent of global emissions, has ambitiously committed to reduce carbon dioxide levels by 60 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The East Asian nation also aims to expand energy consumption coming from non-fossil energy to 20 percent by then. The U.S. meanwhile plans to cut up to 28 percent of the country's emissions below 2005 levels by 2025. Meyer commented on the importance of the move by the U.S., stating: ""The United States is very wealthy but is obviously not immune as we've seen from Superstorm Sandy, the recent flooding in Louisiana, the droughts and heat waves in the West... no country, no community is immune."" More countries are expected to ratify the agreement by the end of this year including Australia, Canada and the 28 members of the European Union (EU). If these promises are fulfilled, the agreement will pass the second threshold and go into effect within 30 days. But this is just the beginning, Nuttall stated. ""The Paris Agreement is a framework agreement to combat climate change but it needs some nuts and bolts put in."" Meyer echoed similar sentiments, telling IPS: ""Having the agreement in place is only meaningful if countries implement [the agreement]. It is really actions on the ground that make a difference and the jury is still out on that."" Nuttall highlighted the need for a ""rule book"" for member states to put the climate treaty into action, which many hope will be achieved during the upcoming Climate Conference ( COP22 ) in Morocco. Meyer particularly pointed to the challenge of achieving the two degree Celsius goal, telling IPS that the pledges by themselves do not add up to meet the temperature target. But even if the international community achieves this goal, the impacts of climate change will drastically increase which will require further action. ""The other side of this discussion has to be how we increase resilience to climate impacts and how we help countries and communities that are facing impacts cope with those impacts,"" Meyer told IPS. ""This is a moment which we should celebrate, hoist a glass of champagne but get back to work in the morning because there's still a lot of work to do,"" he continued. Already obstacles are arising as trade policies continue to clash with climate action. ""It's clear that all policies that still favor fossil fuels or prevent countries from prioritizing renewable clean energy are harmful and should not be supported,"" Kosonen said, referring to a new controversial global trade deal Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa). According to leaked documents, the trade deal under negotiation between the EU and 22 countries may threaten the expansion of clean, renewable energy which could undermine the achievement of the Paris Agreement. However, the world is waiting for the final ratification of the Paris Agreement as it is still uncertain where, how far and how fast it will go. ""The direction is clear, the commitment is clear but... can a family of nations working with the private sector and being supported by cities and regions rev up the action sufficiently quickly that we have a good chance of peaking these emissions very soon? That we will have to wait and see,"" Nuttall stated. Kosonen noted there is no room for complacency. Follow @ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/tharanga_yaku https://twitter.com/tharanga_yaku \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa63","How to reverse the dangerous decline in low-carbon innovation","October 25, 2016 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to less than 2\'b0C at the end of the 21st century demands that we sharply reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, reaching near zero in less than 100 years... We can measure the pace and progress of low-carbon innovation by looking at global patenting activity in related technologies. Growth here could reflect general growth of patenting in all technologies, and so the chart below indicates low-carbon inventions as a share of inventions in all technology areas. We can see rapid growth in the number of green patents filed over the last 30 years and particularly since 2005. Between 2000 and 2013, the number of new climate-mitigation inventions patented globally grew at an annual rate of almost 10%, more than double the rate of innovation in all technologies. However, low-carbon innovation efforts have started to slow since 2013. <figure class=""fig-caption"" class=""align-center zoomable""><figcaption><span class=""caption""></span><span class=""attribution""><span class=""source"">Author's calculations from the European Patent Office's Global Patent Statistical Database.</span>, <span class=""license"">Author provided</span></span></figcaption></figure> Priced out? One of the main drivers of low-carbon innovation is the price of energy. It is clear from our chart above that innovation efforts in low-carbon technologies go hand-in-hand with the price of oil, which is strongly correlated with the price of coal and gas, the two other major fossil fuels. Correlation, of course, is not necessarily causation, but there is ample evidence that inventors react to higher energy prices by developing energy-saving (and hence carbon-saving) technologies. We suspect, therefore, that the recent decline in low-carbon innovation is a direct consequence of the collapse in oil prices from US$110 a barrel in August 2013 to US$51 this month, which makes the value of future energy savings smaller. Low-carbon innovation also responds to the price that carbon emitters pay on their carbon emissions. When carbon can be emitted without cost despite the damage created through increased climate change companies and consumers lack incentives to invest in emissions reducing technologies. Without appropriate policy interventions, the market for technologies that reduce emissions will then be limited. Ebb and flow By making carbon emissions costly, climate policies such as carbon taxes or emissions allowances encourage the development of new low-carbon technologies. Research and development is motivated by profit, after all. A recent paper demonstrates this very clearly. The European Union carbon market) (EU ETS) obliges 12,000 industrial facilities to purchase allowances to cover carbon emissions. The chart below shows how this has increased innovation activity in low-carbon technologies among regulated companies. The chart plots the low-carbon patenting activity of firms regulated under the EU ETS against that of a carefully selected control group of unregulated but similar firms. Both groups showed similar innovation activity before the introduction of the EU ETS, but companies facing a price on their carbon emissions from 2005 reacted by filing 30% more patents in low-carbon technologies, particularly in renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency and carbon sequestration. Interestingly, the effect on innovation occurred when the price of carbon on the market was about 30/tonne CO2 and when firms expected prices to remain at a high level in the foreseeable future. Since expectations over future prices are what determine innovation, long-term regulatory consistency is crucial. Recent evidence suggests that up to 90% of the recent fall in EU ETS carbon prices to about 6 a tonne could be explained by the uncertainty about the level of ambition around long-term climate targets. <figure class=""fig-caption"" class=""align-center zoomable""><figcaption><span class=""caption""></span><span class=""attribution""><span class=""source"">Calel & Dechezlepr\'eatre 2016</span>, <span class=""license"">Author provided</span></span></figcaption></figure> So a sufficiently high and stable carbon price encourages the development of low-carbon technologies. However, recent analysis by the OECD shows that the price of carbon emissions globally is still extremely low. Among the 41 OECD and G20 countries surveyed (accounting for 80% of all energy use and carbon emissions worldwide), some 70% of emissions are not priced at all and only 4% are subject to a carbon price above 30, a conservative estimate of the damage that results from emitting one tonne of carbon dioxide. A consequence of our analysis is that higher and more stable carbon prices than observed today are a necessary condition to restart the low-carbon innovation machine. This is particularly important given that the other major driver of low-carbon technology development the price of fossil fuels is both at a historical low and volatile. Agreeing on a single internationally binding minimum carbon price, or establishing a price band for CO2 emission rights in existing carbon markets would offer the kind of stability that innovators are currently lacking. Funding As with all innovation, it is usually impossible for inventors of low-carbon products to capture all the benefits of their innovations. Smartphone makers were all able to copy Apple s iPhone idea even if they couldn t copy the device itself. This low appropriation of the returns from innovation leads to under-investment in R&D. This is particularly the case in clean technologies. Overcoming this requires innovation policies such as public funding for basic research, subsidies for private R&D, better access to finance, funding for demonstration projects, technology accelerators and incubators, and support for commercial deployment of early-stage technologies, for example feed-in tariffs that subsidise electricity produced from renewables. During the Paris talks, 20 countries from across the developed and developing world promised to double their clean energy R&D investment over five years. This is welcome, and now needs to materialise. However, technology support policies on their own are irrelevant. If no carbon pricing is in place to create a market demand for things like carbon capture and storage (CCS), then no R&D will be conducted even with large subsidies in place. In 2009 the European Commission implemented a programme which dedicated 1 billion to co-finance projects in CCS, but all publicly supported projects have since been abandoned because of the low carbon price on the market. Meeting the commitment made in the Paris Agreement will require all countries to adopt low-carbon alternative technologies in all their sectors. Greater public funding for low-carbon R&D and higher and stable carbon pricing mechanisms are essential to achieve this. With all eyes now on COP22 , it is to be hoped that events in Marrakesh can offer a greater commitment to low-carbon innovation as a central part of the way forward.

The Republic of South Africa would like to extend her gratitude to the Government of Rwanda for the warm hospitality accorded to us and for the excellent hosting of this meeting in the beautiful city of Kigali. We would also like to commend the level of professionalism and excellence exhibited by the Secretariat in organizing this meeting and serving the Parties. Distinguished delegates, once again, I would like to reiterate the unparalleled success of the Montreal Protocol, in particular through the significant phase-out of ozone-depleting substances that has been achieved hitherto. The Protocol should serve as an inspiration and a model for other Multilateral Environmental Agreements. The Dubai Pathways on HFCs We would like to applaud the Parties for finally coming to an agreement on the long outstanding matter relating to the proposed amendment of the Protocol to include non-ODS substances with a high global warming potential. After many years of intense negotiations, significant progress has been made with regard to the proposed amendment to include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The Dubai Pathway on HFCs is a key milestone in the history of the Montreal Protocol. In this regard South Africa would further like to emphasize the importance of cooperative, coordinated and synergistic international environmental Governance, particularly within the realm of chemicals. This effort requires close cooperation and coordination between the Montreal Protocol and the UNFCCC as well as other chemicals and waste Multilateral Environmental Agreements which will improve the effectiveness of our sustainable development efforts. And this will enhance efficiency, cooperation, cut costs, and avoid duplication. South Africa is in support of the baseline of 2020-2022, with the freeze date of 2024 and a 65% HCFC baseline component. As parties we need to work together to be able to agree on the most ambitious reduction steps and agree on all other aspects of the amendment. We are positive that this can be done in the next day and half. Alternatives to HFCs Significant progress has been made to amend the Montreal Protocol to include HFCs. We however know that there are some challenges that still needs to be resolved. These include questions relating to alternatives to HFCs and their costs. Issues relating to the availability of appropriate, cost-effective, technically proven, and environmentally sound alternatives still have to be answered comprehensively. Historically, the difficulties of not finding all alternatives for all applications never prevented this body in taking action to restore the ozone layer. We have been successful in many aspects. We urge the assessment panels to work further to find alternatives over time. HCFC phase out In South Africa, a process to inform phase-out strategies and action plans for HCFCs has been completed. The regulations on the management and phasing out of ozone depleting substances have been enacted and are being implemented. These regulations are an additional tool to ensure that South Africa remains in compliance with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol. We have been able to meet the target of reducing our HCFC consumption by 10% in 2015, and we are committed in making sure that we will meet all our targets. Methyl bromide phase out Methyl bromide phase-out program in the country is progressing effectively. In South Africa. We regularly monitor the consumption of Methyl Bromide through the quota allocation system, product stewardship, compliance inspections and licensing system. These measures have helped us to phase out Methyl Bromide in all applications that have alternatives. The control on consumption of both these substances is achieved through an active collaborative effort with the Ministry of Agriculture, South African Revenue Services and International Trade Administration Commission and Industry. Training programs for customs officials have also been undertaken to make sure that there are no illegal shipments that come to our country. I need to underscore that although South Africa has applied for Critical Use Exemption for Methyl Bromide for 2017, earnest efforts have been undertaken to find alternatives. In this regard there have been applications received from the industry to register alternatives, and the Ministry of Agriculture is on the process of evaluating these applications. Even though we did not receive the full complement of our application, we are committed to implementing the Methyl Bromide Option Committee recommendations of relooking our dosage rates and frequency of fumigation. This we will do to show our commitment to the Protocol. Climate benefits We have the National Climate Change White Response Policy which is now followed by the Climate Change Bill, representing the South African Government's vision for an effective climate change response and the long-term, just transition to a climate-resilient and lower-carbon economy and society. We have submitted our ambitious INDCs, and are finalising the ratification of the Paris Agreement ahead of COP22 . The move to support the amendment of the Montreal Protocol is in line with our effort to support the Paris Agreement on climate change. In our efforts to address climate change, so far the total investment in adaptation increased from US$ 1.64 bn in 2010 to US$ 2.31 bn in 2015. South Africa established a South African Green Fund with an allocated US$ 110 million in the 2011 to 2013 budgets to support catalytic and demonstration green economy initiatives. Financing and the MLF We would like to appreciate the role that the Multilateral Fund has been playing in assisting Article 5 countries to meet their obligations under the Protocol. We urge the non-A5 Parties and other donors to contribute more resources that would be commensurate with the current responsibilities and the increased mandate of the Protocol to address HFCs, which have a high global warming potential and was originally falling under the scope of the UNFCCC. Adequate and predictable financing is indispensable in transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy and society. It will enable and support the deployment of low carbon and adaptation technology as well as building the capacity to govern, regulate, install and operate these technologies. As a responsible global citizen, South Africa is committed and are working within the Africa Group to contributing to a solution to the global threats posed by ozone depleting substances and greenhouse gases emissions into the environment. We all owe a duty to the present and future generations to ensure sustainable development including through a strong and comprehensive phase down of HCFCs and GHGs, under the guiding principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. Ladies and gentlemen I thank you for your kind attention. For media inquiries contact: Albi Modise Cell: 083 490 2871 \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa65","Crowding the private sector into Africa's climate action","December 22, 2016 Thursday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","It is in the enlightened self-interest of African private sector to begin to mobilise investment capital for Africa's climate action, says Chinedu Moghalu... Hopefully, his views on climate change will change and align with reality when he settles into the Oval Office. Policymakers also believe that global climate agreements cannot be reversed easily. In the meantime, stakeholders are pressing on with formulating strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\~The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the United Nations' agency on climate change held on November 7 18, 2017, in Marrakech, Morocco. At the climate talks, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, Pakistan and seven other countries ratified the December 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A total of 111 countries, including the United States, China and Member Countries of the European Union ratified the agreement by the time COP 22 concluded. Since the Paris accord entered into force on\~November 4, quite earlier than anticipated, global action against climate change has effectively shifted to strategic programming. Therefore, in Marrakech - Canada, Germany, Mexico and the United States, published their plans to significantly decarbonise their economies by 2050. A group of 47 developing nations also committed to running entirely on renewable energy sources as rapidly as possible . Some of the plans are already gaining traction. Investments in renewable energy totalled $286 billion in 2015. This surpassed by 3% the previous high of renewable energy investment achieved in 2011. Data gleaned from Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2016, a joint publication by United Nations Environment Programme and Bloomberg, further revealed that last year, coal and gas-fired electricity generation drew less than half the record investment made in solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. The trend in renewable energy investment is a mixed bag, even in developing countries. China alone accounted for 55% of total investment last year; Africa's share was less than 5%. As climate change mitigation is being driven by investment in green energy, Africa is already taking the familiar position at the back seat on the 'green energy train'. This was not unanticipated by climate policymakers. Although China is the clear leader in investment in renewables, other developing countries, in particular the low-income countries, are not expected to be able to keep pace without international assistance. But the advanced countries appear to be reneging on their pledges to help finance both mitigation and adaptation frameworks in the developing world, including Africa. This generated some rumblings in Marrakech, with regard to the commitment by the developed countries to raise $100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate actions in developing countries.\~Disappointing as this is, the prospects of improvement in international assistance at the required scale are not assuring. <strong>International assistance waning</strong> One, virtually all the advanced countries have been bedevilled by over half a decade of weak economic growth. This has put investment in infrastructure below ideal levels, suggesting near-term pressure on the fiscal regimes to close the infrastructure gap, create domestic jobs, and boost economic growth. Two, the economic malaise is also driving populist nationalistic sentiments in Europe and the United States. The backlashes for the emerging isolationist regimes are expected to include decline in international trade, further political uncertainties, shrinking and closed borders, and volatility in financial markets acting together to further put downward pressure on economic growth and constrict foreign aid. Three, the developing world has ceased to be monolithic. A handful of the countries have recently made significant economic and financial advances. These countries, including the BRICS economies, and the countries of the Gulf States that have amassed huge reserve savings, are expected to underline their climate strategies by investment. The less fortunate countries will continue to rely on overseas development assistance, although the gap between pledges and delivery will continue to widen. Without a united front, commitment to pledges for climate change mitigation and adaptation will continue to slack, with consequences for vulnerable populations. The Africa that is left behind in the transition to the green economy will be worse off than it is today. <strong>Africa s climate change investment</strong> As the drive towards decarbonisation gathers pace, Africa's oil economies will face more intense fiscal challenges. Given the strong link between government balance sheets and private sector balance sheets, this will result in serious constraint for business growth and profit. Therefore, it is in the enlightened self-interest of the African private sector to begin to mobilise investment capital for Africa's climate action. For starters, the private sector is best suited to take the lead role in innovating climate solutions and green development. In Africa, the frontiers for the innovations are in power and agriculture. These are sectors that have been far less developed, compared to services sectors. Happily, countries including Nigeria have recently enacted reforms in both their power and agriculture sectors. These reforms are geared towards mobilising private sector resources, having relaxed statist control and incentivised investment. Accordingly, the private sector can leverage reforms that have relaxed the centralisation of the power grid to innovate and finance off-grid electricity solutions. Opportunities for Public Private Partnerships are also opening up as subnational governments are seeking to accelerate improvement in the power sector. These are happening in the region that is well endowed with solar energy and wind resources. Similarly, various reforms in the agriculture sector have factored the need for climate resilience in national food security policies. But there is a significant knowledge gap in Africa's agriculture which cannot be left to the smallholder farmers and governments to fill. Private investments across the agriculture value-chain are needed to help close the knowledge gap and support adaptation mechanisms in rural farming communities. Token actions towards building the green economy cannot remain an option for Africa's private sector. The risks are dangerously stacked. Without adequate climate action, African farmers could lose between 40% and 80% of their croplands for growing grains. Also, the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are dire for even urban populations. But the question remains: how will private sector resources be mobilised? No doubt, significant capacity lies with the African financial institutions, including the development finance banks and to a lesser extent the export credit agencies. But there has been risk aversion and shortage of risk-sharing market instruments. In the Nigerian banking industry, for example, aversion towards risk in agribusiness has hampered funding by financial institutions. And funding pooled at the instance of Central Bank of Nigeria for on-lending to agro-SMEs has historically under-performed. A further drag is the macroeconomic conditions, which are driving interest rates more and more beyond the affordability of agro-entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers. To unlock private sector funding, therefore, the blockades at both demand and supply sides of the credit market have to be addressed by smarter policies and more faithfulness with implementation. But this will not be enough. There has to be a framework for sharing expertise on the continent. The good news is that such frameworks that pool resources, help to mitigate risk, and share knowledge in mobilising climate actions already exist. At the supra-national level, the African Risk Capacity (ARC) was founded in 2012 as an agency of the African Union with the mandate to finance climate resilience and crisis response. In line with its mandate, the ARC is planning to roll out an Extreme Climate Facility, which will issue multi-peril, climate change catastrophe bonds. The securitisation instruments will bring scale and knowhow to Africa's climate risk management and climate change adaptation efforts, with tremendous benefits to the agriculture sector. XCF's catastrophe bonds are expected to attract not only investment from indigenous African banks but also from international financial institutions. One hopes that the XCF will soon be deployed, and the rigorous risk modelling it plans to have in place will serve other market initiatives. Necessary as it is for Africa to take responsibility for its resilience to climate change and to develop its adaptation mechanisms, the continent should not be denied 'climate justice'. The heavily-industrialised countries account for overwhelming proportions of the emissions that are heating the planet and are intensifying climate risks for vulnerable populations in less-industrialised developing countries. This makes the delivery of aid towards adaptation in developing countries quite mandatory. Foreign aid is also required to catalyse market frameworks in developing countries, and secure part of the moral planks on which the much-celebrated Paris accord rest. \"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa66","Africa's economic prospects in 2017 - 10 countries to watch","January 18, 2017 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","These are the top 10 African economies to watch in 2017 when evaluating Africa's economic prospects... Compounding these trends, varying dynamics within the continent's biggest economies meant that Nigeria slipped into recession, while South Africa barely lurched forward with anemic 0.2% growth in the third quarter. Looking ahead, those countries which have diversified their economies, focused on energy infrastructure, and promoted industrialisation, will be best poised to overcome the current challenges and succeed in 2017. As Aubrey Hruby and I documented in a report last year, those countries that rely heavily on the export of one or two resources to drive their economic growth have suffered as a result of the emerging market downturn and its knock-on effects, both in terms of demand for their commodities and in availability of financing for their major infrastructure and other development projects. <strong>Nigeria</strong> Nigeria,\~Africa's most populous country and one which only emerged as the continent's biggest economy three years ago, is bedeviled not only by low petroleum prices, but decreased production due to attacks by the militants in the oil-producing Niger Delta region - at one point last year, the amount of crude being pumped nearly reached the lowest point in three decades. The rest of the economy in the West African giant essentially stagnated, hammered both by the government's maladroit management of the currency float and by the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari's administration to make much headway in improving the country's overall business climate, as witnessed by Nigeria's abysmal 169th place ranking among 190 countries analysed in the World Bank's Doing Business 2017 report. <strong>Angola</strong> Angola\~nudged ahead of Nigeria early last year to become Africa's biggest oil producer, thanks in part to the latter country's problems with its militants, but the distinction means less in a world of depressed hydrocarbon prices. With inflation projected to have been around 45% in 2016, while the country's currency, the kwanza, lost nearly 20% of its value during the same period, the country's grim prospects heading into the new year add to the uncertainty with the announced plans of longtime President Jos\'e9 Eduardo dos Santos to retire later this year (elections are scheduled for August). <strong>Algeria</strong> Similarly,\~Algeria's\~heavy dependence on energy exports caused the growth to slow down to an estimated 3.6% in 2016 with the World Bank estimating it will plunge further in the coming year. Low oil prices will continue to weigh on government finances as inflation and unemployment both increase; the dinar has nominally depreciated 20% over the last two years. The 2017 budget signed by the country's octogenarian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in late December raises taxes to compensate for declining revenues from hydrocarbons, signaling that the heavy public spending that enabled the regime to weather the so-called Arab Spring is no longer an option. <strong>South Africa</strong> While\~South Africa\~was spared an end-of-the-year downgrade by Standard & Poor's of its sovereign credit - it remains at BBB-, one notch above ""junk"" status - Moody's opened 2017 by placing the country on a downgrade review, a step which serves notice to investors, some of whom have fiduciary obligations barring them from doing business in places branded with ""junk"" status. Moreover, the numerous corruption scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma have divided the ruling African National Congress, already reeling from unprecedented rebuff in the August 2016 local government and municipal elections, adding to the political volatility that undermines investor confidence just as the country regained its title as Africa's largest economy. <strong>DRC</strong> Despite its wealth of natural resources, both in terms of extractives and in potential for renewable energy, to say nothing of the extraordinary human capital in its people, the\~Democratic Republic of the Congo<strong>\~</strong>will struggle economically in the coming year. Notwithstanding a rickety last-minute political deal pushed by the country's influential Roman Catholic bishops that is supposed to lead to presidential elections before the end of 2017, President Joseph Kabila's decision to violate the constitution and hold on to power despite the December 19, 2016, expiration of his final term, casts a long shadow over the fourth most-populous country on the African continent and the largest country by area in Sub-Saharan Africa. As Sasha Lezhnev of the Enough Project pointed out recently, the political crisis is not without its connection to economic woes, past and present: ""Corruption has increased and prices for the key commodities that Congo produces have plummeted in recent years, e.g. with the price of copper going down by nearly half over the past five years. Average Congolese people are bearing the brunt of this. The price of some foodstuffs is up as high as 80%; the Congolese Franc has lost 27% of its value in 2016; inflation has increased to nearly 6%; Central Bank foreign exchange reserves have decreased by nearly half (45%) over the past two years. The Congolese government is also slashing state services, with budget cuts of 22% and a further 14%, including a 90% cut in spending on healthcare equipment."" If some of the bigger and resource-dependent economies in Africa are in the doldrums, some of the continent's medium-sized and more diversified economies will make interesting watching in the new year. <strong>C\'f4te d'Ivoire</strong>\~ The IMF's most recent regional economic outlook projects C\'f4te d'Ivoire's real gross domestic product (GDP) to continue growing at roughly 8% annually over the next few years, while the median for Sub-Saharan Africa will be just shy of 4.5v. According to data from the Ivorian government's Center for the Promotion of Investments in C\'f4te d'Ivoire (CEPICI), through in the first nine months of 2016, some 5,720 new enterprises were started in the country, many drawn by the business-friendly regulatory environment. <strong>Morocco</strong> Fresh off hosting the 22nd Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change two months ago in Marrakech,<strong>\~</strong>Morocco\~continues to forge a role as an African - and, indeed, a global - leader on renewable energy. The kingdom, which is on track to meet more than 40% of its needs through renewable energy, primarily solar and wind, by 2020 - an extraordinary turnaround given that just a few years ago the country was, according to the World Bank, the Middle East's largest energy importer, depending on fossil fuels for over 97% of its energy. Moreover, in pursuit of the goal of making Morocco the commercial gateway to Africa as well as Africa's bridge to Europe, King Mohammed VI has been busy implementing his strategy of making Africa the ""top priority"" of his foreign policy, with a string of official visits across Africa, including recent forays to Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, that have resulted in agreements for multibillion-dollar cross-investments in the agriculture, energy, and financial sectors; as well as the historic announcement last month of a Moroccan-Nigerian joint venture to build a gas pipeline to connect the two countries that will eventually link up to Europe. <strong>Senegal </strong> Senegal\~has long been a bastion of political stability in West Africa, a reputation consolidated in 2016 when voters in a constitutional referendum not only reaffirmed the two-term limit on the presidency, but cut the term of office itself down to five years from the current seven years, as well as enacted a raft of other measures to further good governance. President Macky Sall's Plan for an Emerging Senegal, crafted with help from McKinsey consultants, includes 27 flagship projects and 17 major reforms, encompassing diverse sectors ranging from agriculture to energy to education to health to financial services to tourism. The objective of all this is to increase the West African country's productivity in order to grow its GDP, create jobs, and facilitate industrialisation. According to the year-end update to Ernst & Young's Africa Attractiveness Index, Senegal - along with C\'f4te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania - is expected to continue growing in the high single digits in 2017. One possible bump in Senegal's road to the future is that the country was counting on a second Millennium Challenge Compact from the United States to help address regional obstacles to economic growth. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) board selected the country a year ago, but the Senegalese government's December 2016 decision to only vote for, but to actively co-sponsor, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 on Israeli settlements not only in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), but also in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, may cause Congress to closely scrutinise of a major appropriation for Senegal like an MCC compact, given the broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives - by a margin of 342 to 80 votes - for a measure condemning the UN resolution and the Obama administration's abstention on it. <strong>Kenya</strong> A largely diversified economic base,<strong>\~</strong>Kenya\~has largely been resilient through the emerging markets downturn of the last year. While final numbers for 2016 are still being crunched, it looks like East Africa's largest economy grew by at least the 5.9% forecasted by the World Bank and that may even approach the 6.8% growth the revised IMF prediction estimated in October. One of Kenya's advantages has been its membership in the East African Community, which has evolved from a customs union to a common market and has long-term aspirations of a monetary union and a political federation. On the other hand, the country faces not-insignificant political, security, and economic uncertainty in 2017 with presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections scheduled for August; the ongoing threat posed by al-Shabaab terrorists operating out of neighboring Somalia (recall that 2016 began with more than 100 Kenyan soldiers killed when the al-Qaeda-linked militants overran a peacekeeping base in El Adde, Somalia); and yet-to-be-determined impact on private-sector credit following the signing last year by President Uhuru Kenyatta of legislation capping interest rates at 4% above the benchmark central bank rate. <strong>Ethiopia</strong> If it can weather the political crises that have led to mass demonstrations and the declaration of a state of emergency in late 2016,\~Ethiopia\~will, according to IMF estimates, be positioned to overtake Kenya as East Africa's largest economy sometime in the coming year, having posted 10.8% average annual growth over the last decade, before drought hit the core agricultural sector this year (and anti-government protests erupted). Nevertheless, investors continue to flock to there - some $500 million in new foreign direct investment entered in the last three months of 2016 and an additional $3.5 billion was being processed, according to one analysis - and its large internal market (Ethiopia is the 13th most populous country in the world) and low labour costs make it an attractive location to manufacture fast-moving consumer goods. In addition, Ethiopia's investment in hydropower - last month authorities inaugurated Africa's tallest dam, the Gibe III dam on the Omo River, doubling the country's electrical output - will not only give it a reliable source of energy, but provide electricity to the region, including Kenya, which has signed up to buy some of the power produced. <blockquote> <strong><em>African countries face many challenges in 2017, but, alongside these, there are the fundamentally positive dynamics of many of their economies</em></strong> </blockquote> African countries face many challenges in 2017, but, alongside these, there are the fundamentally positive dynamics of many of their economies, including a growing labour force, increased urbanisation, and advances in technology, as I argued recently in a new Atlantic Council Strategy Paper, A Measured US Strategy for the New Africa . The 2016 Republican Party Platform affirmed: ""We recognise Africa's extraordinary potential. Both the United States and our many African allies will become stronger through investment, trade, and promotion of the democratic and free market principles that have brought prosperity around the world. We pledge to be the best partner of all African nations in their pursuit of economic freedom and human rights.""

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa67","Transforming agriculture critical to address food security, climate change challenges","September 27, 2016 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","According to FAO director-general Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, agriculture must transform itself to achieve food and nutrition security for all, as well as help address global challenges such as... In a speech to ministers, government, private sector and civil society representatives attending the biannual meeting of FAO's Committee on Agriculture (COAG, 26-30 September), the director-general noted how ""agriculture is at the very heart"" of a recent series of ground-breaking international agreements, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Change Agreement. ""Sustainable agriculture is paramount to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, to sustain natural resources, to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, to achieve healthier food systems and to build resilience against crises and natural disasters,"" Graziano da Silva said. But he noted that while past developments in agriculture have led to major improvements in productivity, ""progress has been uneven"" and that ""greater emphasis must be placed on the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability"". Sierra Leone's Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security, Monty Patrick Jones, also addressed the meeting, stressing that in Africa, boosting agricultural productivity in a sustainable way is not only essential for food and nutrition security, but is also critical to eradicating poverty. In particular, small-holder farmers ""should produce food not just for the table, but also for the market,"" he said, urging governments to play their part by supporting the process and increasing investments. ""We've seen an increase in investments, but only a few invest 10 percent"" of their budget on agriculture Jones said, referring to a pledge made by African leaders in the 2003 Maputo Declaration. Scientific innovation in agriculture go hand-in-hand with policy reform Another keynote speaker at COAG's opening, Joachim von Braun, director of University of Bonn's Center for Development Research, underscored the need for scientific innovation in agriculture to go hand-in-hand with policy reform. ""Agriculture and food systems are transforming, and that must be supported by a sound cooperation between science and policy,"" von Braun said. He told participants that for this purpose, an International Panel on Food, Nutrition and Agriculture should be established to assist the international community in the same way as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ""helps guide global climate policy"". FAO action on antimicrobial resistance and climate change Graziano da Silva, noting that the ""role of agriculture goes beyond generating food and income,"" referred to FAO's recent commitment at the United Nations General Assembly to work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to curb antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ""We at FAO believe that antibiotics and other antimicrobials should be used in agriculture to cure diseases and to alleviate suffering. Only under strict circumstances could they be used to prevent an imminent threat of infection,"" the director-general said. Graziano da Silva also pointed to growing international recognition that agriculture can play a transformative role in addressing the impacts of climate change. Countries are set to gather for the COP 22 summit in Morocco in November to put into motion their pledges on climate change and FAO ""stands ready to assist governments, especially of developing countries to have access to international resources that are available to finance these actions,"" he said. FAO support for 245 initiatives in 89 countries Graziano da Silva told participants at COAG's opening session that in 2014-15, FAO supported 245 initiatives in 89 countries to promote sustainable agricultural production practices based on participatory approaches. ""Results have well exceeded our targets. More than 80 of these initiatives were implemented in Africa alone,"" the FAO director-general said. He noted that within the Save Food Initiative, FAO supported 45 countries in reducing food waste and loss through a partnership network that includes civil society, the private sector, UN institutions, and academia. FAO also provided support to 70 countries across five regions to advance the mainstreaming of food security and nutrition in public policies and programmes. COAG meets every two years to assess the current state of affairs in world agriculture and provide guidance to FAO on its program of work. \"

The film is produced by stars Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio, with Academy Award-winning director Fisher Stevens; producers Trevor Davidoski, Jennifer Davisson, Brett Ratner and James Packer; and executive producer Martin Scorsese. It presents a riveting account of the dramatic changes now occurring around the world due to climate change, as well as the actions we as individuals and as a society need to take to prevent catastrophic disruption of life on our planet. The news comes a year after the Paris Climate Accord was reached at COP 21, and one day after the film was screened at COP 22 in Marrakech, Morocco. In written remarks to introduce the film at the screening in Marrakech, director Fisher Stevens said, Those of you in this room already know the urgency of this issue. You are here because you understand the problems and challenges we face as the human race moves into the future. By 2050, there may be almost 10 billion of us living on this planet. How can we sustain it at the rate we are going? How can we feed, clothe and have fresh water for that many people. We know something has got to give and we need a shift in the way we power the world. Need to screen for Trump Last week s election in the US underscores the urgency of the issue and this film. Our new administration could dismantle all the good and forward momentum that has occurred over the past few years if campaign promises are actually kept. However, let us do everything in our power to make president-elect Trump understand that man-made climate change is not only real, but is happening at an alarming rate. We are currently trying to get him to watch the film and to get Leo and other leaders in the climate movement an audience with the president-elect, continues Stevens. Critics called the film a rousing call to action and the climate change documentary Americans need to see . National Geographic took this call to heart, and the film received a rollout never before seen for a documentary film, first with a limited theatrical release in New York, Los Angeles and London, then making its global television debut on Sunday 30 October, on National Geographic Channel in 171 countries and 45 languages. Record-breaking views It was also available free for 10 days through 8 November on a record number of digital and streaming platforms across the globe, including NatGeoTV.com and Nat Geo Apps, VOD, iTunes, Hulu, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and more. The film marks National Geographic s continued push into premium programming, cementing the network s position as a leader in science, adventure and exploration. For 128 years, National Geographic has been committed to preserving our planet, said Courteney Monroe, CEO, National Geographic Global Networks. We are thrilled that we were able to reach so many people with the film and will continue to use every resource in our arsenal to educate the world on the global climate threats we face, and arm people with the resources and knowledge to take action. The record-setting numbers included more than 60 million unique viewers globally across linear, digital and social platforms, including 30 million viewers on National Geographic Channel in the US, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America (US: 8.5 M; Asia and Australia: 6.9 M; Europe and Africa: 10.6 M; Latin America: 3.0 M) as well as 13.4 million views on YouTube. On average, across linear TV viewing and YouTube, viewers watched at least 22 minutes of the film. In total, across all platforms, more than one billion minutes of the documentary have been viewed. In addition, the film was also made available free to more than 50,000 college students with campus screenings across the US, and more than 1,500 requests have been fulfilled from universities, religious institutions and other organisations for private screening events around the world. The film trended on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook during its entire release. In Before the Flood, DiCaprio interviews individuals from every facet of society in both developing and developed nations who provide unique, impassioned and pragmatic views on what must be done today and in the future to transition our economic and political systems into environmentally friendly institutions. The feature documentary was an official selection at the Toronto Film Festival, London Film Festival and Hamptons International Film Festival.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa71","Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa's Green Energy Potential","November 16, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Lowering investment risks in African countries is key to achieving a climate-resilient development pathway on the continent, say experts here at the U.N.-sponsored Climate Conference. Mustapha Bakkaoury, president of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), says his country's renewable energy revolution would not have been possible if multilateral partners such as the African Development Bank had not come on board to act as guarantors for a massive solar energy project, tipped to be one of a kind in Africa. Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone. The multi-billion-dollar solar power complex, located in the Souss-Massa-Dr\'e2a area in Ouarzazate, is expected to produce 580 MW at peak when finished, and is hailed as a model for other African countries to follow. ""Africa has legitimate energy needs, and development of Africa will happen through mobilisation of energy resources,"" Bakkaoury told IPS at COP 22 after a roundtable discussion on de-risking investment in realising groundbreaking renewable energy projects. Bakkauory believes it is possible for Africa to develop its energy sector while respecting the environment. ""What we say is that there is no fatality between having energy resources and respect towards the environment, and Africa has abundant resources to do this through its key partner - the African Development Bank,"" he said, noting the instrumental role of Africa's premier multilateral financier to renewable energy in Africa. And in affirming its continued commitment to universal access to energy for Africa, Alex Rugamba, AfDB Director for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, told IPS that ""the Bank's commitment has shifted gear as it has now a fully-fledged vice presidency dedicated to Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth."" Rugamba added that the Bank has learnt valuable lessons from various initiatives it is already supporting, and knows what is required to move forward with the initiatives without many challenges. Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone. Private sector involvement is required to drive this agenda, a point underscored by World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development, Laura Tuck. ""Private sector cannot be ignored because the money they have is more than what is available under public financing,"" she says. But the risk is believed to be too high for private investors to off-load their money into Africa's renewables, a relatively new investment portfolio with a lot of uncertainties. German Parliament State Secretary Thomas Silberhorn says the highest risk in Africa is politically related. ""It's not about economic risks alone, but also political risks,"" said Silberhorn. ""You don't need to convince German investors about solar energy because they already know that it works, what they need is reliability on the political environment and sustainability of their investments."" Silberhorn, who gave an example of a multi-million-dollar project in Kenya currently on hold due to political interference, added that ways to reduce political risks should be devised for Africa to benefit from private sector investments in renewables. But even as risk factors abound, World Bank's Tuck believes there is hope for Africa, citing Zambia, where record cheap solar energy has been recorded. ""Through a competitive bidding process, we have in Zambia under the Bank's 'Scaling Solar' program, recorded the cheapest price at 6.02 cents per KWh,"" she said, heralding it as a model to follow in de-risking climate investments for Africa's growth. And in keeping with the objective of universal energy for all, experts note the need to ensure that the end users are not exploited at the expense of investors. ""While the state should not interfere in this business model to work, modalities have to be put in place to ensure that the people for which energy is needed, afford it, otherwise, the project becomes useless,"" said MASEN's Bakkaoury. Following up on this key aspect and responding to the political risk question, Simon Ngure of KenGen Kenya proposes a key principle to minimise political interference - involvement of the local communities. ""If you involve the local communities from the onset, regardless of whether governments change, the projects succeed because the people will have seen the benefits already,"" said Ngure, who also noted policy restructuring as another key component to de-risk climate investments. Agreed that de-risking investment is a crucial component, small grants are another issue that the African Union Commission's implementing Agency, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), believes could unlock the continent's challenge of access to climate financing. NEPAD Director of Programmes Estherine Fotabong told IPS that it was for this reason that the agency established the NEPAD Climate Change Fund to strengthen the resilience of African countries by building national, sub-regional and continental capacity. ""One of the objectives of the fund is to support concrete action for communities on the ground, but most importantly, to help with capacity building of member states to be able to leverage financing from complicated climate financial regimes,"" said Fotabong, citing ECOWAS which she said used the funding to leverage financing from the Green Climate Fund, one of the financing regimes under the UNFCCC. \"

Jacob Zuma, President of Republic of South Africa","July 11, 2016 Monday","South African Official News","Introduction 1. On 11 July 2016, His Excellency, President Francois Hollande of the French Republic, hosted his counterpart, His Excellency President Jacob Zuma of the Republic of South Africa, on a State Visit to France. 2. On the occasion of this State Visit, the two Presidents reaffirmed the importance they attach to the relationship between their two countries, structured by a strategic partnership encompassing political, economic, social and defence matters. France and South Africa have common interests and share values, including the promotion of peace and security, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and sustainable development. Bilateral relations are rich and cover a wide variety of fields, especially in education and training, environment, health, transport, energy, research and science, arts and culture. 3. President Zuma's visit precedes the centenary commemoration of the South African engagement in the First World War on French territory and the transformation of the Delville Wood Memorial to honour all South Africans, irrespective of race, who perished in the war. Tribute will be paid to their sacrifice and courage at the South African War Memorial of Delville Wood, in France, on 12th July 2016. Economy and Development, Transport and Energy 5. France and South Africa recall the importance of their cooperation in the rail sector, materialised by the signing of a bilateral agreement on transport in June 2015, as well as the implementation of the Alstom Gibela-Prasa contract for the supply of rolling stock, which will create more than 30 000 industrial jobs and stimulate localisation in the field of rail transport. 6. France and South Africa place great importance on cooperation in the energy field within their strategic partnership, as exemplified by the agreement on cooperation in the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy signed in October 2014. 7. Following the COP17/CMP7 and the COP21/CMP11, they give special attention to the development of a sustainable energy mix encompassing renewable and nuclear energies to reduce carbon emissions. In this respect, the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) have partnered to finance a new ""green credit line"" with Nedbank, in order to promote the development of renewable energy in South Africa. Both countries commend the significant participation of French companies to the energy mix in South Africa. 8. France has been supporting South African reconstruction and development programmes since 1994, including the implementation of the South African National Development Plan - Vision 2030. Both countries welcome the signature of a new Partnership Framework Document for the 2016-2019 period, focusing on crucial development sectors. Science and Culture, Education and Training 9. Building on the legacy of the highly successful South Africa-France Seasons, France and South Africa place great importance in their cooperation in the fields of Arts and Culture and signed a new programme of cultural cooperation. 10. The Presidents welcome the ongoing collaboration between the South African National Archives and Institut National de l'Audiovisuel (INA), including the digitisation of the Rivonia Trial dictabelts, thereby preserving these historical records for generations to come. The same technology will be used to preserve the remaining audio recordings of other apartheid era trials. 11. France and South Africa affirm that innovation and investment in science and technology, and the development of human capital, are key areas to sustained economic growth and competitiveness. Priority areas for future scientific and academic cooperation include environment and agriculture, water and marine research, engineering sciences, global health, human and social sciences, astronomy, space science, nuclear and physics research and training. France and South Africa also aim at encouraging innovation through incubators and entrepreneurship programmes, as well as implementing trilateral scientific cooperation with African countries. 12. France and South Africa, as two major destinations for students from the African continent, believe in the importance of internationalisation of higher education. Both parties signed a Declaration of Intent to strengthen the cooperation in the field of higher education, training and skills development and accelerate student mobility between the two countries. Health 13. The Presidents noted the significant progress made by South Africa over the last few years to control the HIV and TB epidemics. France, as the second contributor to the Global Fund, has contributed to this project. France is furthermore ready to share its expertise and support South Africa's National Health Insurance, which aims to deliver quality health services to the South African population through the development of a new health financing system. In this regard, a Declaration of Intent regarding cooperation on health is to be signed shortly. 14. The Presidents recall their joint participation to the first meeting of UN High Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth in Lyon in March 2016. Both countries are thereby committed to address the health sector as a driver of growth. As proposed by South Africa, France supports the adoption of ""Health employment, decent jobs and inclusive economic growth"" as the main topic of the next Foreign Policy and Global Health network resolution. Agriculture 15. In the field of agriculture, both Heads of State welcome the recent signature of the protocol regarding the establishment of the French South African Agricultural Institute (FSAGRI), aiming at increasing high level skills in agriculture and agro-processing, and the start of its implementation at Fort Hare University. Cooperation in the Indian Ocean 16. France and South Africa are to explore channels of regional cooperation in the Indian Ocean. A bilateral agreement on maritime cooperation in areas adjacent to the French Southern and Antarctic Territories, Marion Island and Prince Edward Island was signed in this regard. France and South Africa also welcome and encourage partnerships at local and regional levels. Regional and Global Issues 17. The two Presidents agreed on the importance to support the implementation and objectives of Agenda 2063. South Africa and France remain committed to peace and security on the African continent, under the leadership of the African Union. 18. They agree to enhance communication and coordination to address pressing regional challenges, such as terrorism, international crime and migration, to promote common values and to support free and fair electoral processes in Africa and Europe. 19. France and South Africa also share a common concern about the political, security and humanitarian situation in the Middle East. President Hollande and President Zuma reaffirm that moving towards resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is as urgent as ever, and believe that the two-State solution is the only viable option and must be preserved. France recall its initiative on the Peace process and commends South African support and involvement. 20. The two Presidents have common views on the need to reform the UN and its organs, including the UN Security Council, in order to better respond to the current challenges facing the international community. France and South Africa will coordinate efforts and initiatives in the UN system. 21. South Africa and France have committed to promote the principles of inclusive and balanced development in the global economic and financial system. The Presidents acknowledge the need to coordinate their efforts, within multilateral instances such as G20, to curb illicit financial flows. Both countries are deeply concerned with the issue of tax and custom revenue evasion, which has a major negative impact on development, especially in African countries. 22. South Africa commends France for its outstanding presidency of the Paris Climate Change Conference (COP21/CMP11) in December 2015, which led to the adoption of the historic Paris Agreement and implementing COP decision covering climate action in both the pre-and-post 2020 periods. The Presidents resolve to continue the excellent multilateral and bilateral cooperation between South Africa and France on climate change and commend the significant pledges made by all Parties to address climate change during COP21. They both commit to a successful outcome of COP22 /CMP12 to be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November 2016, and to fully implement their INDCs/NDCs. South Africa welcomed France's continued leadership in developing actionable and fully funded global initiatives and platforms on renewable energy and climate change, such as the International Solar Alliance launched at the Paris Conference. 23. On the eve of the seventeenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to be held in Johannesburg in September 2016, the two Presidents express their intention to actively cooperate at all levels for the protection of the environment and the sustainable management of its resources. They welcome the declaration of intent for the creation and management of common marine protected areas in the Prince Edward-Crozet zone. 24. France and South Africa profess their support to the Open Government Partnership (OGP), a multilateral initiative promoting better governance through transparency, accountability, and the empowerment of citizens. Both parties look forward to the next global summit that will be hosted by France from 7 to 9 December 2016.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa73","No Climate Justice Without Gender Justice - the Marrakech Pact","November 15, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change last year is a breakthrough commitment to respect, promote and consider gender equality and women's empowerment obligations while taking climate change action. It also committed to gender-responsive adaptation and capacity building. A year later, with the Agreement entered into force on 4 November, vigorous efforts are being made at COP 22 in Marrakech to make sure that gender equality is systematically integrated into all aspects of the implementation of the Agreement. Both gender equality and climate change champions around the globe are meeting here in Marrakesh to transform the climate change agenda into one that recognizes the rights, priorities and capacities of women and girls and harnesses their talent and leadership for effective climate proofing and response. Yesterday, on 14 November 2016, Parties adopted a decision on gender and climate change which extends the 2014 Lima Work Programme on Gender. The decision is far-reaching in that, for the first time, climate decision-makers supported the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in all areas of work of the Convention -- mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, loss and damage. Now, it is incumbent upon Parties to register in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) commitments to promote gender equality and women's empowerment. A breakthrough in operationalizing gender-responsive climate policy and action was achieved, as the decision mandates the development of a gender action plan that will propose priority areas and concrete activities for gender-responsive climate action across the various work areas of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The decision also strengthens efforts to promote the participation of women in the UNFCCC process, including in bodies established under the Convention. It enhances accountability by requesting regular reporting from constituted bodies and financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on how they are working to promote gender equality in their work. The global agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and arrest global warming is about more than just tackling climate change. Of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SDG-13 ""Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"" is closely linked to SDG-5 ""Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"", recognizing gender equality both as a means and an end to effective climate action is a must. Moreover, the co-benefits of climate action and gender equality also positively and simultaneously address other SDGs - on poverty eradication, health, education, economic growth, sustainable energy, water and sanitation, full and productive employment and decent work, sustainable cities, just and peaceful societies, among others. For example, UN Women launched its Global Flagship Programme on Women's Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Energy in partnership with the Government of India, the Department for International Development DFID of the UK and UNEP, which has a benefit multiplier effect. When linking efforts to achieve gender equality to climate action, we can effectively respond to the tragedy of climate change by helping to mitigate impacts and build resilient, inclusive societies. The impacts of climate change range from health threats, resources constraints, loss of livelihoods, displacement, forced migration and conflicts, energy, income and time poverty and food insecurity to reduced access to infrastructure and essential services. They all have disproportionate impacts on women and girls. Climate change impacts also exacerbate the existing inequalities, discrimination, heavy burden of care and domestic work and violence that women face in their daily lives. Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, for example, the inadequate sanitary facilities and lighting in the overcrowded camps contributed to the high instances of night attacks on women. The hardship and suffering for women and girls walking millions of miles for endless of hours to fetch water, fuel and food in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia is unconscionable and has a high opportunity cost to them and to society and the economy. Even without much support and validation, women have been on the front lines of adaptation and mitigation. They have been formidable climate change activists, working in families, communities and economies to fend off the effects of extreme weather events and build resilience. Women have pioneered inclusive and sustainable initiatives. The Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF) in Benin has been key in the fight against energy poverty while economically empowering women in their local communities. It is an example of women led resilience building. Similarly, the leadership of CEO Ms. Wandee Khunchornyakong has allowed the Solar Power Company Group, Thailand's largest solar power generation company, to successfully unlock private financing for photovoltaic capacity, provide clean energy jobs for women, and lead the country on a low-carbon growth path. Women are also demonstrating leadership in science, technology, and innovation, as well as developing and applying protective, resilient and adaptive technologies to deal with flooding, heat, water management and promoting local indigenous practices and traditional knowledge. Yet, the consistent unequal participation of women and men in decision-making processes has meant rights and contributions of women are not adequately considered in disaster preparations and response plans, leading to further marginalization and greater risks. A 2015 study covering 881 environmental sector ministries from 193 countries found only 12 per cent of the ministers were women. Women account for only 20 to 25 per cent of the workforce in renewable energy. The low representation of women in positions of power and influence has been one of the factors for the slow progress in the formulation and implementation of gender-responsive climate policies and strategies. Gender-based discrimination in all its forms must be eliminated with the utmost urgency. The successful implementation of the actions under the extended work programme will require significantly increased targeted resources. Although the GCF has promoted a gender-sensitive approach from the outset, the existing resources to finance climate actions rarely ensure access to climate finance for programmes that are led by or have women as beneficiaries. This must change and both GEF and GCF must provide transformative and significantly scaled up financing for specific programs that aim at gender and climate justice together. UN Women has been working with Parties and other stakeholders to strengthen understanding and the systematic integration of a gender perspective in climate policies and actions. In doing so, it is crucial for Parties to set concrete goals and targets in order to ensure the full, equal and effective participation of women in climate policy making and programme implementation at national, regional and global levels. A paradigm shift is happening. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the co-benefits between gender equality and climate action, putting gender equality considerations and the voice and agency of women and girls at the centre of all climate management efforts and investments. We will thereby leave no one behind and do justice to people, planet and the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \"

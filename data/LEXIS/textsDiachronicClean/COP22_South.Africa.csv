"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa2","Africa Day at COP22: moving forward on climate change commitment","November 21, 2016 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (Africa: Marketing and Media)","The Africa Day event had the dual themes of 'Moving from Commitment to Action with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)£nd 'The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative: Moving Forward'...President Alpha Cond\'e9 of the Republic of Guinea presided over the High Level gathering also attended by the Presidents of Botswana, Ian Khama; Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf; Togo, Faure Gnassingbe; Ministers from the continent; heads of Pan African Institutions; the African Union Commission; the African Development Bank; the Economic Commission for Africa; NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency and; development partners. The Africa Day event had the dual themes of Moving from Commitment to Action with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative: Moving Forward. As Climate Change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world, with Africa already experiencing some of the most severe impacts, the continent s leaders have proactively responded with the establishment of the Committee of Africa Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on Climate that have thus far, influenced global negotiations. Presence of heads of state at COP22 and the Africa Day event further demonstrated the importance placed on securing the continent s interests within the global climate governance mechanism and in defining the roadmap to reduce global temperature rise to well below 2oC goal, considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the threshold for averting dangerous changes to the climate system. COP21 in Paris in December 2015, delivered the landmark Paris Agreement in which the Intended NDCs emerged as the game changer and primary mechanism for reducing global temperature rise. To date 46 African countries have signed the Paris Agreement and 27 out of 103 countries have ratified the Agreement that entered into force on 4\~November, 2016. <strong> Action COP </strong>Africa has seized the opportunity of COP22, dubbed the action COP , to demonstrate leadership in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, through the NDCs and in ensuring that the means of implementation, namely finance, capacity building, technology development and transfer - the cornerstones of implementation - are provided. Beyond COP22, a critical issue is the alignment of NDCs with existing national development priorities and initiatives. Implementation will be enhanced and supported by pan- African initiatives and programmes operating through a range of partnerships, two of which are: The African Adaptation Initiative (AAI) and; the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI). The latter, supported by the governments of France and Germany, seeks to achieve at least 300 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2020. Emphasising the importance of energy access, President Cond\'e9 noted that out of 1 billion Africans 700 million have no access to energy. Since 2002, we have fought to ensure that production is accelerated and increased , and expressed satisfaction at the funding for AREI as an indicator that Europe is taking steps to deliver on commitments for implementation. Cond\'e9 said that Africa needs to develop on the basis of an energy mix, but we also need to develop fast, and the faster Africa has access to energy, the faster Africa will develop, he said.<strong>Energy pledges</strong> All these initiatives fit very well into our African Union Agenda 2063 where we want to have a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and commits Africa to pursue a sustainable development path where climate resilient programs play a major role while we protect our environment through renewable energy , said chairperson of the Africa Union Commission (AUC), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, in a statement read on her behalf by Dr Elham Mahmoud Ahmed, Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy, AU Commission.Abdalla Hamdok, ECA executive secretary a.i, emphasised the importance of aligning Africa s climate change initiatives with sustainable development, noting that, The impacts of climate change in Africa are increasing in complexity resulting in new and emerging threats to lives and livelihoods, catalysing new migration dynamics, disasters and conflict and lost economic opportunities. Egypt s Minister of Environment and President of the African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN), Mohammed Fahmy, also welcomed the initiatives and encouraged good governance and transparency as the foundation of implementation. COP21 and 22 Presidents, Segol\'e8ne Royal of France and Salaheddine Mezouar of Morocco, also participated in the event. This is an African COP, the biggest economies must fulfil their commitments to Africa , said Royal. Mezouar, COP22 President, said Africa must and will electrify at the lowest cost , and that the COP 22 roadmap should respond to the issues of financing, access to electricity and capacity building to increase the success of projects . , Further emphasising that it was time to put an end to clich\'e9s about African countries ability to carry out projects.\l"

This can be achieved through energy-saving lighting, photovoltaic electricity generation and solar water heating, and without harming the appearance of the mosques.The upgrades will also benefit the faithful, with access to hot water for washing and air conditioning available in prayer rooms, said SIE.Another upshot would be the ""strong social impact"" through the creation of 5,000 jobs and a new growth market, it said.""The return of the investment made will be based on the energy savings achieved.""German development organisation GIZ, which supports the project, describes it as a ""win-win"" situation that will also raise awareness of renewable and efficient energy in Morocco.""It is based on the idea that Moroccan companies... involved in these mosques will be repaid through savings made by the building manager,"" says GIZ's Jan-Christoph Kuntze.All of the technology needed is ""already available on the local market"", he said, adding that this gave the project the potential to create jobs.""The mosques can play a multiplier role"" of raising awareness about the need to save energy and adapt to cleaner sources.King Mohammed VI has pushed a proactive policy of environmental awareness in the northwest African country of nearly 34-million people, 99% of whom are Muslim. Marrakesh will host the next world climate conference, COP22, from November 7 to 18.One of the main challenges for Morocco, which hosted COP7 in 2001, is to ratify the Paris Agreement signed last year by 195 countries to fight global warming. COP22 will ""highlight the country's commitment to work for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and to continue to support developing countries... affected by the impact of climate change"", Mohammed said in a speech in June.The king was behind an ambitious plan launched in 2009 to develop renewables and enable the country bereft of hydrocarbons to support nearly half of its energy needs this way. The ultimate aim is to raise the share of renewable energy to 52% of all consumption.Central to this was the opening of Noor I - the first stage of what will be the largest solar power plant in the world - near Ouarzazate on the edge of the Sahara desert. As Morocco counts down to COP22, its people are being exposed more and more to events and initiatives showcasing the country's involvement in protecting the planet.Its ""green mosques"" project is expected to take centre stage in the drive for change being highlighted at the conference.Source: AFP\l"

""We are pleased that the Marrakech Conference was able to achieve some clarity, and good progress has been made.""This include the adoption of the Terms of Reference and initial work plan for the Paris Committee on Capacity Building (PCCB); the established linkage between technology mechanism and the financial mechanism; the indicative framework for the five-year rolling work plan of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM); and the conclusion of the Third Comprehensive Review of the implementation of the framework for capacity building under the Convention and under the Kyoto Protocol.Nonetheless, he warned, there remain outstanding issues which require further discussion after Marrakech.The Group has placed a priority on scaling up of finance, in particular adaptation finance.""There can be no enhanced action without enhanced support. Support enables action and action needs support. Enhanced action needs enhanced support in the provision of scaled-up financial resources, technology and capacity-building. Action must cover both adaptation and mitigation,"" the Special Representative declared.He reiterated that adaptation is a matter of urgency for developing countries whose capacities to carry out actions to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change are limited.""We therefore urge that progress in implementing the Paris Agreement must reflect balance between adaptation and mitigation.""He said: ""We came to Marrakech with a challenging task, the challenge of turning agreements into action. COP22 can indeed be considered a ""COP for action"".The speedy and unprecedented entry into force of the Paris Agreement signals the level of urgency and importance with which our leaders and the international community attach to combating climate change.""We are here to accelerate climate actions, and this has been underscored by the Marrakesh Action Proclamation which we endorsed yesterday and the tireless efforts of the High Level Champions over the past year.""After nearly four years, only 73 parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance to the Doha Amendment.

Several villages in rural areas have been identified to participate in the first phase of this pilot programme, prior to deployment on a larger scale.The kits include a solar panel connected to a battery that can be used to provide domestic appliances with electricity. They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralised source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones.This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants.Within the framework of this partnership, Engie will supply the solar kits and take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via Orange Money. The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by installment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash.{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

COP22 starts on Monday.""You are all aware that 2015 was a special year on the international calendar. The world agreed to both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,"" Beaumont told delegates.""This was largely due to an increasing realisation globally of the seriousness of the challenge posed by climate change... The simple truth is that climate change is already here today, and we are bearing the brunt of it.""It is particularly devastating for us in the developing world, and specifically in Africa, and particularly for the vulnerable sectors of our population.""Beaumont said at present South Africa and Nigeria were the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Africa.For South Africa, emissions per capita were higher than in most other major emerging economies, including Brazil, China, and India.""This has triggered a number of policy initiatives across government, driven by various departments, and highly successful renewable energy programmes...""Beaumont said the National Climate Change Response White Paper provided the framework for climate change policy in South Africa.The policy recognised South Africa as a significant contributor to global climate change and that it was extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to the country's socio-economic and environmental context.""Fortunately, as well as the abundance of coal, South Africa is also blessed with some of the best renewable energy resources in the world.""Beaumont said South Africa continued to contribute immensely to finding a global solution to the climate change problem.""It is very important that the South African team goes to Marrakesh with a thoroughly discussed and carefully considered position,"" she said.\l"

They do not have to become a humanitarian disaster, but people have now been left to cope for themselves... I think we were too slow in many instances and this has become a humanitarian disaster for the 60 million people who are food insecure and suffering from droughts,"" she said.El Ni\'f1o has been directly associated with droughts and floods in many parts of the world that have severely impacted millions of livelihoods. A warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific waters, the phenomenon occurs on average every three to seven years and sea surface temperatures across the Pacific can warm more than 1 degree C.El Ni\'f1o is a natural occurrence, but scientists believe it is becoming more intense as a result of global warming.How El Ni\'f1o interacts with climate change is not 100 percent clear, but many of the countries that are now experiencing El Ni\'f1o are also vulnerable to climate variations. According to Robinson, El Ni\'f1o and its climate-linked emergencies are a threat to human security and, therefore, a threat to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) announced in September 2015 as the 2030 Agenda replacing the Millennium Development Goals.""I have gone to Central America to the dry corridor in Honduras and have seen women crying because there is no water and they feel very neglected. They feel they are left behind and that nobody seems to know about them. I saw in Ethiopia severely malnourished children, it could affect them for life in terms of being stunted. The same thing in southern Africa. I feel I've seen a window into a 'new normal' and it is very serious. We need to understand the urgency of taking the necessary steps,"" Robinson said.Drought and flooding associated with El Ni\'f1o created enormous problems across East Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Pacific. Ethiopia, where Robinson has visited earlier this year, is experiencing its worst drought in half a century. One million children in Eastern and Southern Africa alone are acutely malnourished.It is very likely that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, with global temperatures even higher than the record-breaking temperatures in 2015, according to an assessment released at the COP22 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary data shows that 2016's global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures spiked in the early months of the year because of the powerful El Ni\'f1o event.These long-term changes in the climate have exacerbated social, humanitarian and environmental pressures. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees pointed that in 2015, more than 19 million new displacements were associated with weather, water, climate and geophysical hazards in 113 countries, more than twice as many as for conflict and violence.""We need a much more concerted response and fund preparedness. If we have a very strategic early warning system, we can deal with the problem much more effectively. Building resilience in communities is the absolute key. We need to invest in support for building resilience now rather than having a huge humanitarian disaster,"" stressed Robinson.On Nov. 17, during the COP22 in Marrakech, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) - a coalition led by France, Australia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Japan and Canada launched at the Paris climate change negotiations in 2015 - announced a new goal to mobilise more than 30 million dollars by July 2017 and 100 million by 2020.The international partnership aims to strengthen risk information and early warning systems in vulnerable countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and small island developing states in the Pacific. The idea is to leverage financing to protect populations exposed to extreme climate events.There will be a special focus on women, who are particularly vulnerable to climate menaces but are the protagonists in building resilience. ""Now we've moved from the Paris negotiations to implementation on the ground. Building resilience is key and it must be done in a way that is gender sensitive with full account of gender equality and also human rights. We must recognize the role of women as agents for change in their communities,"" Robinson emphasised.The number of climate-related disasters has more than doubled over the past 40 years, said Robert Glasser, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.""This initiative will help reduce the impact of these events on low and middle-income countries which suffer the most,"" he said.Jos\'e9 Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told IPS, ""We can see already in Africa the impact of climate change that is undermining our efforts to bring food security for all. Take the example of El Ni\'f1o that has affected all of Africa in the last two years. Countries that had made fantastic progress like Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania and Madagascar are now suffering hunger again. Countries that have eradicated hunger are back to face it again. We need to adapt.""Climate change has different impacts on men and women, girls and boys, told IPS Edith Ofwona, the senior program specialist at International Development Research Centre (IDRC).""Gender is critical. We must recognise it is not about women alone,"" she said. ""[But] women are important because they provide the largest labour force, mainly in the agricultural sector. It is important to appreciate the differences in the impacts, the needs in terms of response. There is need for balance, affirmative action and ensuring all social groups are taken into consideration.""\l"

Now we have to translate words into effective policies and actions,"" UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said as he opened the high-level segment of the 22nd Conference of Parties (COP 22) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Tuesday.""This is critical to protect our planet, safeguard the most vulnerable and drive shared prosperity. Low-emission development and climate resilience will advance all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).""Adopted by 196 parties to the UNFCCC last December, the Paris Agreement, named after the French capital where it was approved by the previous conference, known as COP 21, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2\'c2\'baC above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5\'c2\'baC.In early October, the accord cleared the final threshold of 55 countries representing 55\'e2\€  percent of global emissions required for it to come into effect within one month. Its entry into force was extremely swift, particularly for an agreement that required a large number of ratifications and the two specific \'e2\€ \£8thresholds.The agreement entered into force in time for COP 22, which has been under way since November 7.Before the meeting wraps up on Saturday, parties hope to define the rules of implementation of the Paris Agreement and establish a viable plan to provide financial support to developing countries to support climate action.Ban said that the UN would help countries implement the agreement and he called on developed countries ""to honour their commitment to mobilise climate finance - $100bn (R140bn) by 2020 - to help developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate vulnerability"".The UN chief also said that after a decade of making sure climate change was at the top of the international agenda, he would leave delegations with some key lessons:1.\'e2\€  Multilateral solutions work; acting together, countries achieve more than they ever could alone.2.\'e2\€  Heads of states and government must take the lead.3.\'e2\€  Whole societies must get engaged.4.\'e2\€  The UN must continue to champion science.5.\'e2\€  Solutions must be funded and expanded.6.\'e2\€  The UN must continue advancing the moral cause for action.The president of the UN General Assembly, Peter Thomson, encouraged all parties to the Paris Agreement to implement and enhance ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) ""without delay"".\l"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa11","The rubber will hit the road for developing countries at COP22 in Marrakech","November 4, 2016 Friday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The main objective of the Paris Climate Agreement is to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2\'b0C while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5...Temperatures across Africa, however, are rising. This year marks the moment when carbon dioxide officially passed the symbolic 400 parts per million (ppm) mark. And, according to scientists, it will not return to below this in our lifetimes. The safe level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 350ppm. Passing the symbolic 400ppm mark permanently is a clear sign that mean annual temperature rise in Africa is likely to exceed 2\'b0C by the end of this century.The deal struck last December under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris marked a seminal moment in the development of the international climate change regime. The deal is also an important tool in mobilising finance, technological support and capacity building for developing countries to help them cope with and tackle climate change.But the details still need to be worked out. As Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the convention said: <blockquote>while the Paris Agreement gave clear pathways and a final destination in respect to decisive action on climate change, many of the details regarding how to move forward as one global community in that common direction still need to be resolved.</blockquote>The 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP22) taking place in Morocco holds considerable potential to accelerate and amplify the decisions made a year ago in Paris. African concernsIn Cairo earlier this year African ministers of environment and representatives of more than 45 African countries welcomed the adoption of the Paris Agreement. They emphasised that the agreement accommodated many African concerns and interests. The meeting also stressed the need for African countries to continue engaging actively in climate change negotiations to provide further guidance on the implementation of the Agreement.One of the most contentious issues on the table will be the progress towards mobilising the $100bn a year promised by developed countries to developing economies by 2020.South Africa has played a leading role in helping to secure climate financing for developing countries. Ensuring meaningful progress on reaching this $100bn target will be a key element of South Africa s proposed position in Marrakech. But there is considerable concern about the promised $100bn and where it will come from. Oxfam France recently complained that a recent meeting of European Finance Ministers gave no concrete indication about how they are going to increase the total amount of aid to meet the $100 billion objective. This omission is significant as the EU represents one of the main providers of development funding.A paper published by the Indian Ministry of Economic Affairs questioned the findings of an earlier Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report that said developed countries had mobilised $57bn of climate aid in 2013-14. Indian officials suggested that the true amount figure mobilised by rich countries may only be $2.2bn. The discrepancy is important because the OECD s report is accepted by developed countries as the basis of negotiations and evidence that there has been significant progress made towards the $100bn commitment.In Marrakech South Africa s will press for a clear pathway to realising the $100bn of climate finance per year by 2020. Mitigation and adaptationAnother key element of South Africa s proposed position for the conference is adaptation. The adaptation component of Nationally Determined Commitments is central to the call by a number of developing countries, particularly in Africa, for a balanced treatment of mitigation and adaptation. South Africa believes the agreement should address vulnerability, priorities, plans and actions, implementation and support needs, as well as adaptation efforts for recognition in the case of developing countries.On mitigation, South Africa wants to see progress on the features and information contained in the Nationally Determined Contributions at COP22. This includes the consideration of common time frames for contributions to allow for effective global stocktaking and ratcheting up of country commitments in future. This is essential if the target of 2\'b0C is to be met.South Africa has ratified the agreement along with 17 other African countries. These are Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Swaziland and Uganda. Signing the agreement requires countries to adopt it within their own legal systems through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. They are among 92 countries to have ratified the terms of the agreement. This breaks all UN records when it comes to how fast an agreement enters into force.But signatures alone won t do the trick.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa13","At the Nexus of Water and Climate Change","September 03, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","With the clock counting down towards the November climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where parties to the climate treaty agreed in Paris will negotiate implementation, it's clear that managing water resources will be a key aspect of any effective deal.Here at World Water Week, which concluded on Friday, Susanne Skyllerstedt, programme officer for Water, Climate Change and Development at the Global Water Partnership (GWP), says her organisation is working with Sub-Saharan African governments to incorporate adaptation strategies into the partnership's climate change programme.""For us, resolutions of COP21 are part and parcel of what we are implementing and those of COP22 (in Marrakech) will be embedded in our long-term agenda of ensuring water security in Africa and rest of the developing world in a bid to attain water-related sustainable development goals,"" she told IPS.GWP is a Stockholm-based organisation that has been involved in fostering integrated water resource management around the world for the last 20 years. GPS has four regional offices in Africa covering Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa.As an inter-governmental entity, GWP works with organisations involved in water resources management. These range from national government's institutions, United Nations agencies to funding bodies. Other stakeholders include professional associations, research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector. GWP has a water and climate change programme to support governments on water security and climate change resilience.Already, said Skyllerstedt, GWP has a programme that was started in Africa through the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) together with the African Union Commission and other development partners. The programme has been a key platform for supporting African governments.These include support on national climate change adaptation programmes more so in the sphere of policy formulation. For Sub-Saharan Africa countries noted for vulnerability to impacts of global climate change, the programme is key in supporting climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.Through monitoring and evaluation programmes conducted in the recent past, GWP has learned vital lessons and is cognisant of areas that need more resources to achieve the desired goals. Already, she said, GWP is running a three-year programme on climate change aimed at achieving sustainable development goals linked to water, energy and food through climate resilience.She said they are implementing initiatives aimed at enabling countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to acquire highly relevant technologies on sustainable water management. ""We have demo programmes on new technologies being implemented by our partners in Africa but they need to be scaled up to have a major impact,"" she said.GWP is also addressing the challenge of water pollution, to ensure availability of cleaner water for human consumption and other uses. It is collaborating with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to promote water security and hygiene. ""The aim is to incorporate water, sanitation and hygiene component in climate resilience,"" Skyllerstedt explained.GWP is also developing tools for better planning on water, sanitation and hygiene to help communities during calamities such as floods.""We have an urban planning project focusing on urban water systems and infrastructure we work with national government and other partners on issues planning putting into consideration matters of access to water and sanitation facilities as well as water related calamities.At the same time GWP collaborates with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on drought and flood monitoring.""We work with experts and stakeholders to ensure national plans take into account climate change-related hazards,"" Skyllerstedt said. ""Many African countries face challenges in fighting impacts of extreme weather such as floods and droughts, and here is where the adaption programme is relevant.""For the next three years GWP intends to widen its support to encompass not only national climate change adaptation programmes but also Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that countries published prior to the 2015 United Nations in Paris.""National Adaptation Programmes (NAPs) and NDCs should be merged to avoid duplications,"" she observed.The biggest challenge to implementation of GWP programmes by its partners in Africa and elsewhere remains access to financial resources.""During the COP21 in Paris last year, there were lots of pledges on financing initiatives for enhancing water security and its access by the poor. Unfortunately, our partners are not able to access the money due technical bottlenecks,"" she said.The situation has compelled GWP to embark on enhancing the capacity of their partners in Africa in the spheres of project design as well as making of investment plans and strategies.Skyllerstedt spoke to IPS during the World Water Week held in Stockholm, Sweden from 28 Aug. 28 to Sep. 2 and organised by the Stockholm International Water Institute.\l"

But with the latest instalment of the UN climate talks under way in Marrakesh, don't forget about the people of Western Sahara right next door.Morocco has become a key player in international climate politics after assuming the presidency of this year's UN climate conference, known as COP22.It is troubling and ironic that such an important responsibility has been entrusted to a country that has repeatedly demonstrated its profound contempt for \'e2\€ \£8international law and the UN, and that remains a brutal occupying power.Lest anyone involved in international climate politics - journalists, diplomats, or civil society actors - forget, despite an opinion from the International Court of Justice in 1975, that Morocco has no valid claim to the territory of Western Sahara, it has been illegally occupying the territory, located south of its southern border, for 40 years.And in case anyone missed the news: when last year the UN secretary-general had the temerity to refer to Morocco's occupation as ""an occupation"", Morocco responded first with massive street protests denouncing the secretary-general (the protests were attended by Moroccan government officials), and subsequently by expelling all civilian personnel from Minurso, the UN's peacekeeping mission in the \'e2\€ \£8territory.As the secretary-general made clear, Morocco's behaviour carries a serious risk of reigniting war in the region.The history of the Western Sahara occupation is complex, but a good place to start is with Minurso itself.The name stands for (in English) ""the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.""The referendum in question was promised to the indigenous Saharawi people of Western Sahara in 1991, as part of a UN-brokered ceasefire that ended the war that they had fought with Morocco since its invasion in 1975 (after Spain, the prior colonial power, withdrew).In l"

The big question at the follow-up meeting here in Marrakech is how that deal will be implemented, especially for the developing nations of Africa.""We have three major objectives at this COP: [the first is] to set a foundation for a strong technical and legal framework of the Paris Agreement,"" said Seni Nafo, chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN).""The second key issue is to push for accelerating action after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and lastly but not the least, ensuring finance for Africa's adaptation.""Dubbed the 'COP of Implementation,' the summit dubbed COP 22 is seen by the African group as an opportunity to refine some of Paris's unfinished business.Despite adoption last year, a number of key decisions in the PA such as modalities for achieving the 2 degree C. threshold, mechanisms to enforce compliance and achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation, among others, were deferred to COP 22.With the deal based on Nationally Determined Contributions, it is feared the challenge of access to climate finance for Africa might get further complicated as it has been discovered that most countries' NDCs are vague, according to the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).""ACPC is ready to support African countries in the revision of their Nationally Determined Contributions, most of which have been found to be defective,"" James Murombedzi, Officer in Charge at ACPC told IPS, adding that his organisation wants to see an inclusive implementation of the PA.Murombedzi said this would, however, not be possible if COP 22 does not lay a strong foundation.The talk over the years has been capacity building to achieve the required levels of preparing bankable proposals in most African countries. Nevertheless, experts have urged caution even as the continent pushes for this need.According to Balgis Osman Elasha, Principal Climate Change officer at the African Development Bank, Africa should avoid the 'Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) trap' by perpetually pushing capacity building and miss out on serious climate funding opportunities.Elasha says ""Africa could not benefit from the CDM because it was caught up in the capacity building mode while others were taking action.""CDM of the Kyoto Protocol provided for emissions reduction projects aimed at assisting parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments.As highlighted, a balance between adaptation and mitigation features prominently in the negotiations. And for African economies, adaptation is not a question of the future but now.Available data shows that most countries are already facing economic challenges which are likely to be worsened by climate change effects. For example, cereal production is expected to decrease by up to 49 percent in Africa by 2050 due to the impacts of climate change, exacerbating food insecurity.And Zambia's Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection, Lloyd Mulenga Kaziya underscored the need for urgent action especially the improvement of hydromet services. ""Zambia is deeply affected. In the past five years, our rivers have been drying up while the frequency of droughts has increased affecting our smallholder farmers in terms of production, and to make matters worse, information flow to the affected communities is not readily available,"" said Kaziya, adding that the southern African country requires urgent support to upgrade hydromet systems and integrate them in all key sectors such as Mining, Energy and AgricultureWith these critical needs identified, the AGN is determined to ensure that Africa's voice is heard at the negotiating table -- especially now as the rules and modalities for implementation are being discussed.But on its part, the continent is not seating idle. At COP 21, the Africa Renewable Initiative (AREI) was launched to pave the way for Africa's transition to inclusive green growth. AREI already has resulted in significant financial commitment of over 10 billion dollars for renewable energy projects in Africa, according to the African Development Bank, one of the partners of the initiative.The tone for Africa's demands at this year's COP was clear on day one of the event as Salahedinne Mezouar, the COP 22 President, said: ""Paris gave us a global commitment to climate change and COP22 in Marrakech will give us more ambitious climate action. We must all rise to the challenge in support of the most vulnerable countries in the fight against climate change,"" underscored Mezouar, implicitly referring to Africa--the most exposed region whose contribution to global carbon emissions is just about 5 percent.As negotiations enter the second week, the African group remains optimistic that most outstanding issues, especially means of implementation, would be resolved for smooth implementation of the Paris Agreement.\l"

The information seminars will also be conducted in Mpumalanga, and Gauteng, where women smallholder farmers will be highlighting the impact of climate change on them as farmers and the support they need. Gender equality and women empowerment in agricultureAccording to Dorah Marema, executive director of GenderCC SA, although progress has been made to recognise the role of women in agriculture, much more needs to be done to support women as primary providers of household food security. Women still do not receive the same level of support from societal institutions, then their male counterparts. We want to build understanding and partnerships for women which can influence policy and the status quo. In the end, it must be noted that this is not about women, but about society at large, Marema emphasized. In 2015, GenderCC SA mobilised more than 3,000 women in South Africa to register their concerns and demands to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, France. Last year, GenderCC SA highlighted issues of gender equality and women empowerment in agricultural adaptation programmes and the need for access to finance at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Studies indicate that the success of increased agricultural production and food security on the continent rests largely in the hands of women farmers.

They also contain a remote control solution and a mobile payment system, providing a decentralised source of renewable electricity to homes that are not connected to the grid. The solar kits can be used as a lighting solution with LED lamps, to operate small electrical appliances (radio, television, etc.) or to recharge mobile phones.This equipment offers an alternative solution, at low cost, that can replace petroleum lamps, disposable batteries or diesel-powered devices, which are all potentially dangerous pollutants.Within the framework of this partnership, ENGIE will supply the solar kits through BBOXX and Fenix International, both of which are companies that have worked with ENGIE for several years and that have become references in the supply of solar-powered equipment.ENGIE will also take responsibility for the installation and maintenance of the equipment. Orange will ensure the commercial deployment and management of billing via ""Orange Money"". The service will allow customers to pay rent for the use of the equipment, allowing them to pay by instalment rather than through an upfront investment. In addition, this mobile payment system offers customers a simple and secure way to pay remotely, thus avoiding the need to travel long distances with cash.Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity gridAccess to energy is a major challenge for the African continent. Around 90% of the population of sub-Saharan rural Africa does not have access to the electricity grid. In this context, Orange and ENGIE signed an agreement in 2015 to collaborate on ways to develop the electrification of rural areas and to optimise the supply of electricity to telecoms infrastructure in Africa.ENGIE has been present in Africa for over 50 years, where it operates in the fields of electricity, natural gas and services. ENGIE has a cumulated energy capacity of approximately 3,000MW across power plants in operation or under construction. ENGIE is also working on decentralised electricity production for isolated companies and rural villages in order to achieve the global goal of providing 20 million people with electricity by 2020.To this end, the group is also researching opportunities for the deployment of home solar systems and mini-grids, as well as its policy to promote the use of solar energy to power telecoms towers in areas not connected to the electricity grid.Orange is present in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East where, at the end of September 2016, it had 113 million customers.

South Africa has emphasised the need to bring governments and nonstate actors together to discuss how to provide additional contributions to help to build up resilience to climate change and to transition to low-carbon societies.Despite facing the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment and inequality, and facing many resource and capacity constraints, South Africa is doing its fair share in contributing to the global effort to fight climate change.Our national response policy prioritises climate change actions that have both significant mitigation and adaptation benefits, and that contribute to economic growth, job creation and poverty eradication. To do this, we require billions of dollars in additional investment that we simply cannot mobilise on our own. We would like to scale up current efforts in green economy, renewable energy, green transport and the like, but this requires significant investment that we can only achieve with support. There is furthermore a need to scale up funding at a global level, and parties need to help each other with skills development and in building up capacity.Then there is the central question of how to secure funding for adaptation. Like many other countries on the continent, South Africa is semi-arid with less than 5% of annual rainfall available to recharge our groundwater aquifers. In a changing climate, our existing water-related problems are exacerbated. If one considers the drought we are currently experiencing, that has led to many of our major rivers running dry and our dams half-full, it is easy to imagine how this has extremely dire consequences for every aspect of our economy and society, especially in relation to food security.Therefore, significant investment is required to change the way that we use and manage scarce and fragile water resources. This is very important because adaptation is always in danger of being pushed off the international climate change agenda. We need to look seriously at ways of doubling adaptation financing in the pre-2020 period. The means of implementation are critical if we are to meet the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement. In this regard, non-party stakeholders, especially business, need to do more to support and advance global climate action.It is immensely encouraging that, less than a year after its adoption at the closing of COP21, the ratification of the Paris Agreement has taken place with such speed. South Africa is in the final stages of ratification, following our domestic procedures.

It calls for limiting the temperature rise since the industrial revolution to 2\'c2\'baC or even 1.5\'c2\'baC.This year's temperatures were boosted by the El Ni\'c3\'b1o weather event. The previous hottest year was 2015. WMO said 16 of the 17 hottest years have occurred this century, with the only exception being 1998, which was also an El Ni\'c3\'b1o year.But there is some good news, Global carbon emissions have remained largely steady for the past three years, even while economies have grown, scientists said in a study published yesterday.The findings, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, point to a possible shift toward a cleaner global economic system, largely due to the US and China decreasing their emissions.But scientists cautioned that it's too early to proclaim a turning point in emissions that contribute to climate change.""It is great news that global carbon dioxide emissions have been flat in the last three years, but it is far too early to proclaim we have reached a peak,"" said study co-author Glen Peters, a researcher at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo.Researchers said that while the emissions grew by 0.7% in 2014 and that there was a projected 0.2% increase for 2016, the emissions trend has shown a shift from high growth in earlier in the decade. In the past three years, emissions growth has remained below 1%, despite gross domestic product (GDP) growing by 3%.Much of the slowdown in the growth of annual carbon emissions, which have remained at around 36.4 billion tons in the past three years, is due to China's ratcheting down emissions, which dropped 0.7% in 2015. The US reducing coal production has also made an impact, researchers said.But they also warned that the cause of China's emissions reductions are still unclear, and there have been data inconsistencies in the past. China is responsible for 30% of global carbon emissions. In the US, emissions have decreased since 2007. Recent decreases are largely due to decl"

The hallmark was the signing of the Green Economy Accord in 2011 and the adoption in 2012 of the National Development Plan 2030, which committed the country to an ""environmentally sustainable and equitable transition to a low carbon inclusive economy.""She said South Africa has put in place many programmes and policy frameworks in the recent past, to translate the NDP Vision 2030 into action. The country is currently implementing programmes to promote energy efficiency, green transport, sustainable housing and climate resilient agriculture.""We are glad that there is great visible progress on these sectors as we all see new multimodal transport in cities like Johannesburg, Tshwane and Cape Town.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa30","Objections to construction of two coal-fired power stations dismissed","November 16, 2016","Mail & Guardian","Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa has dismissed objections to the country building two new coal-fired power stations. This will mean 16-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent will be added to the atmosphere. The power stations will also use up water in areas that are already water stressed, at a time when the country is toying with its third year of drought.The minister's decision came on the second day of COP22, where South Africa is negotiating on the nuts and bolts of how the Paris Agreement will play out. This put countries on the same path to ensuring that global warming is kept below 2\'c2\'b0C on pre-industrial levels. As part of the Africa group, South Africa has consistently argued that the goal should be 1.5\'c2\'b0C because anything more is catastrophic for the continent. Projections by the World Bank show that average global warming is doubled in Africa's interior, while the continent has little capacity to adapt to that change. But South Africa has been roundly criticised for its actions not matching up to its rhetoric. It ratified the Paris Agreement in early November and has a wide range of local initiatives to lower emissions and help people adapt to climate change. Its Nationally Determined Agreement - the pledge it submitted to Paris - has, however, been called out as not being ambitious enough. Climate Action Tracker rated the contribution as ""inadequate"", saying: ""It is not consistent with limiting warming below 2\'c2\'b0C"". The contribution is vague and allows South Africa to increase its emissions by anywhere between 20% and 82% on 1990 levels. That translates to either 198-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 614-million tonnes. This goal stems from South Africa's pledge under the Copenhagen Accord in 2009 to reduce emissions on business-as-usual levels by 42% by 2025. Climate Action Tracker said: ""If most other countries follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3-4\'c2\'b0C."" Whether it's the upper target or the lower target that is reached is down to the choices made in South Africa's power sector. This is responsible for half of the country's carbon emissions of just under 450-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, according to the local Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Those decisions are made at the department of energy. It has been pushing for a new nuclear build, to replace the ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations that are run by the state-owned utility Eskom. But, at the same time, it has called for bids from private companies to build coal-fired power stations. This borrows from the platform for bids that was created for South Africa's 6 000MW independent renewable energy build. Once that department invites bids, it is up to companies to sketch out their environment impacts and get authorisation from the department of environmental affairs. It is the granting of these authorisations that civil society group groundWork objected to. A previous objection to the granting of an environmental authorisation for Thabametsi, an independent coal-fired power station, resulted in the environmental affairs minister telling the mine to do a climate change impact assessment. This was a first for South Africa. But this time, groundWork's objections were dismissed. If construction does go ahead, the two power plants will join two other power stations under construction in adding 90-million tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions to the atmosphere. The other two, Eskom-owned Medupi and Kusile, will be the world's largest dry-cooled, coal-fired, power stations in the world. Each will have a capacity of 4 800MW. Government says emissions from the new plants will be reduced because of their newer technology. Their overall impact will also be reduced as Eskom's older fleet of coal-fired plants starts to retire in the 2020s and 2030s. But the environment impact assessments of the plants does not include their wider footprint, specifically in terms of the coal mines that will be built to supply them. Critically, serious concerns have been raised about the impact these stations will have on water availability in the already water scarce areas where they are being built. Eskom uses 2% of South Africa's water and is the only entity guaranteed supply, regardless of circumstances. Medupi and Kusile have meant the construction of water transfer schemes to bring them water. This water comes from the Vaal river system, which means it falls hundreds of kilometres away Lesotho and the KwaZulu-Natal province. In the case of Medupi, the Mokolo-Crocodile Water Augmentation Project will take water from Gauteng, at an initial cost of R11-billion for construction. But water is scarce in Gauteng. Official climate projections - contained in South Africa's national climate change response strategy - show that drought will become more prevalent and more severe. Projections from the 2030 Water Resources Group show that demand for the whole country will exceed supply by 17%, a situation that will be ever-more acute in Gauteng. Medupi's demands will also dramatically increase when it installs flue gas desulphurisation technology. This technology decreases sulphur emissions, but triples the plant's water use. Farming rights in the area have been bought up to access the water rights that come with the farms, in order to supply Medupi's demand. Concerns over this impact on water resources were so great that the World Bank investigated it when granting a loan to help Medupi's construction. This noted that ""potential project-induced harm"" included ""significant water consumption raising issues of both scarcity and pollution in the local area"". The bank went on to note that ""due consideration should have been given to probable future projects in the area, e.g. additional mines and coal-fired power stations"". That reality has come to pass, thanks to environmental authorisation for more coal-fired power stations being granted. Now the country has to find the water to supply them, and a way to deal with the climate change that will be driven by more carbon emissions. \l"

Yet, African nations have overwhelmingly included climate resilient agriculture in their indicative pledges to the UN.And agriculture is seen as a major focus through a common position of the AU on climate adaptation.Agriculture employs more than 60\'e2\€  percent of Africa's working population. But low productivity and high levels of food insecurity persist. So the inclusion of agriculture in strategies should come as no surprise.The question is: how are African nations going to move from pledges to progress?The Moroccan government, host of this year's COP22 climate talks, is seeking the answer with the launch of the ambitious Adaptation of African Agriculture initiative.The initiative is high on the agenda. The aim is to mobilise $30\'e2\€  billion (R420bn) to make agriculture more resilient to the changing climate. Improved water management is one of the three key pillars of the initiative - and for good reason.Globally, agriculture uses around 70\'e2\€  percent of freshwater supply. But water sources are increasingly under threat. Droughts will be more frequent, more intense and last longer. Increasing the amount of water for agriculture through water storage at all levels from field to reservoir will be a part of the solution.But existing water sources also can be managed better. In fact, certain regions in Africa have untapped water. Where water supplies are already under pressure, improving the productivity of water use in agriculture would make more water available for other uses.The urban, energy and industrial sectors can also encourage productivity gains and more sustainable and climate resilient practices through benefit- sharing mechanisms like the Tana Water Fund. Another pillar is investment in water storage. Farmers will increasingly need to rely on water storage as part of the adaptation agenda. Improved soil management practices have potential to both improve the utilisation of water and increase production.They are increasingly seen as a natural way to store carbon, turning soils into a carbon sink. This can open up new funding prospects that will have multiple benefits.Adopting water management practices to a local context is crucial.Also key to the initiative is more efficient use of water.New efficient irrigation technologies, like drip and sprinkler irrigation, are already showing much promise. In Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, a new SMS system is being piloted, which is delivering field-specific information and advice.The Morocco climate talks are a golden opportunity for making strides on the adaptation of African agriculture. African countries now need to be empowered with the tools and strategies for taking action.Improved water management approaches may be just one piece of the puzzle, but will provide benefits for generations to come.l\'e2\€  Bird is director-general at the International Water Management Institute.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa34","Africa needs to manage food, water and energy in a way that connects all three","January 23, 2017 Monday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","There is an increasing global demand for food, water and energy. All three are inter-linked, a fact that has increasingly become the focus of attention for policy makers and governments...One initiative has been the Water-Energy-Food security nexus developed in Bonn by Holger Hoff under the auspices of the international climate change conferences of the parties (COP). The aim was to improve management of the complex links between water, energy and food systems. It is increasingly being used by international organisations to evaluate whether approaches to meeting development targets set out under the Sustainable Development Goals are coherent.Understanding the connections between basic food demands and accessibility to water and energy is also important when it comes to climate change and its impact on agriculture and livelihoods. This issue featured prominently at COP22 in Marrakech in 2016. The approach can play a massive role in reducing resource loss and maximising benefits. For example, countries like South Africa and Tanzania have started using the approach to develop policies around water, energy and food production. In South Africa the Water Research Commission has begun to use the model in national discussions on managing the effects of climate change. Tanzania applied integrated water resource management in its water sector and African Union strategy on climate change. But very little progress has trickled down to actual policy development. Regions like southern Africa need to move beyond simply having a framework for understanding the connection between the three. This is only the first step. Now more case studies are needed to see how the three components interact and also how policies can be successfully implemented. Why and where is the nexus important?Countries with severe water constraints, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, have started to develop policy that looks at all three factors. These regions have become testing grounds for the practical application of the nexus approach. Solutions, such as the development of multi-functional productive systems to improve natural resources use, have been implemented. In Jordan, these have been developed to include water, energy and food. A pilot system has been implemented around the Sahara Forest Project. This includes solar energy farming in water scarce regions.<figure class=""fig-caption"" class=""align-center zoomable""><figcaption><span class=""caption"">Over-using water for food production will have a detrimental impact on energy production. For example, Zambia relies on Lake Kariba for energy.</span><span class=""attribution"">Flickr/Joe McKenna</span></figcaption></figure>There are others signs of progress. Awareness about the challenges posed by climate change has led to the better allocation of resources through careful planning, savings and recycling. Some countries have developed national policies around these issues.And governance patterns and language in policy development have started to reflect the linkages between water, energy and food. But attempts to integrate water, energy and food management still have a long way to go. Most institutions like the various water, energy and agriculture departments or organisations operate under a complex system of unclear mandates and obscure funding and don t consult with others.This doesn t mean that efforts to shape resources management are doomed. But there is a clear need to improve how it s done.Bringing the nexus to fruitionIn southern Africa the nexus approach has been discussed by the Southern African Development Community in the water sector. One of the biggest challenges for the region is that water is distributed very unevenly. But it is short of electricity and some countries are highly dependent on hydro-power. What this means for food production is a challenge given that the over-allocation of water resources for food production would have a detrimental impact on energy production. To integrate water with food and energy, the regional body has taken steps to raise awareness of the issues. But each member state faces very different challenges. For example, South Africa is a middle-income country and has a fairly developed industrial sector that produces food. This requires concentrated investment in energy and water infrastructure, which the country has maintained partly due to its economy s size and maturity.Malawi, on the other hand, lacks the basic infrastructures to supply its population with water and access to energy. It is also much more vulnerable to the impact of drought and flood. Tanzania s economy relies heavily on agricultural production. It is therefore particularly vulnerable to changes in weather patterns. In addition, it doesn t have the capacity to adapt to these changes which limits agricultural productivity. What s neededFor a policy to be effective it must take into account what infrastructure is available in a country and a region. It must also be backed up by proper data collection and institutions must be strengthened to overcome bottlenecks. What s also important is that interventions must be designed with the involvement of all stakeholders, including consumers. A common mistake is that governments are solely responsible for managing resources. Cooperation is key. Governments, institutes, and consumers must build relationships. Discussing their needs is crucial to success.There is no one-size-fits-all approach. One common factor is that investment in innovation and technical support is vital so that a range of solutions can be developed. The nexus approach has the potential to help African countries meet sustainable development goals. This can only happen if the approach is turned into actions, like policy development and implementation.{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell\l"

In SA, that means the Cabinet sends the treaty to Parliament.For the Paris agreement, a & double trigger& is required under article 21 - 55 parties must ratify, accounting for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions.The number of parties is already at 61, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change website.The 55% of emissions requires some more large emitting countries - with percentages recorded in a politically agreed table. India has ratified. Add a few EU member states such as Germany, France and the UK (pre-Brexit), and that will push the total well over 55%. If Japan ratifies, that would add more than the 3.12% still required.This gathering momentum will lead to official ratification earlier than expected.

""While many speak, few stay around to listen; far less respond,"" he said. ""Then we wonder how and why this entity is so negatively perceived...""One of the UN's great failures has been its inability to end the five-and-a-half-year Syrian conflict, which has claimed more than \'e2\€ \£8300 000 lives.During the ministerial meeting, not only did lengthy US-Russian negotiations fail to restore a ceasefire, but the Syrian government announced a new offensive to retake Aleppo, unleashing some of the heaviest bombing of the war.Other conflicts had opposing sides attacking each other.India and Pakistan squabbled over Kashmir. Israeli Prime \'e2\€ \£8Minister Benjamin Netanyahu predicted that Israel would have a bright \'e2\€ \£8future at the UN and invited Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to address Israel's parliament - an offer Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour dismissed as ""a new gimmick.""And the United Arab Emirates accused Iran of sponsoring \'e2\€ \£8""terrorism"", a claim Tehran denies. In almost every speech, \'e2\€ \£8leaders called for global action against radical extremist groups which have spread from Syria and Iran to North Africa, Europe and the US.There were no speeches about the search for a successor to Ban, whose second term as secretary-general ends on December 31. But there was plenty of behind-the-scenes chatter about the nine candidates vying to replace him and whether the winner would be front-runner Antonio Guterres, the former Portuguese prime minister or someone from Eastern Europe which has never held the post that by tradition rotates by region, or the first woman.One of the lighter moments came in the speech of Taban Deng Gai, first vice-president of war-ravaged South Sudan, who paid tribute to Ban and recalled that President Salva Kiir gave the UN chief a ""white bull"" as a sign of peace.""It has grown and is ready to be delivered to his excellency."" - AP\l"

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa40","Responsible green finance: can investors make a real social impact?","February 7, 2017 Tuesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","At the beginning of 2017, France announced the launch of its green bonds scheme...The amount, not yet officially revealed, could be counted in billions of euros, thus constituting the first green sovereign borrowing scheme on this scale in the world. Poland launched its own green bonds scheme in late 2016, worth approximately 750mThis is still considered to be a niche market, but its development potential is enormous and has soared over the last three years, especially since the signing of Paris Agreement on climate change. How do green bonds work?Green bonds work in the same way as conventional bond issues. Those financial tools are a form of loan made by private or public corporations, governments and institutions. Under various conditions and interest rates, they provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term and diverse investments.Green bonds concern sovereign (state), private and international business markets. They represent approximately $170bn, or slightly less than 1% of the total international bond market. Unlike regular bonds, green bonds are managed directly by the company s general management rather than by the accounts management office, because of the potential impact they have on the company s reputation and image.With green bonds, it is possible to direct the amounts raised towards specific activities, assess a project s environmental risk, track funding from the central treasury department (a report audited by a third party must allow cash flows to be monitored in the issuer s statement), and ensure frequent reports on the use of the funds. Green bonds provide a vehicle for measuring the environmental performance of an investment project: the financing of a wind farm, setting up of renewable energy sites, green infrastructure, and so on. There are many advantages for investors. They will know the precise project in which their savings are invested ( I know what I m funding ) and will therefore be in a position to judge the quality of the issuer through the various assessments of the green bond s environmental risk and the issuer in general.<figure class=""fig-caption"" class=""align-center ""><figcaption><span class=""caption"">Can green bonds change and really impact social and environmental issues?</span><span class=""attribution"">bykst/piaxabay</span></figcaption></figure>The advantage for investors lies primarily in the communication and legitimacy process, given the fact that the context puts some pressure on companies to meet investors impact request. They can thus prove the sustainability of their process up to the stage of funding, by linking their words and their actions.This also ensures that a more direct dialogue between investors and issuers can be initiated than through equity funding, which does not allow investment projects to be identified consistently.What is the real impact on the environment?But the question of measuring environmental impact remains. How can the environmental benefits of an investment project be assessed? Does the solution lie in the standard application of a measuring tool or in the ad hoc measuring of each project, given that each project is funded differently? Each green bond is different and the environmental impact will therefore most probably be measured by expectations for the project, its execution and results. The effort required to set up a green bond often results in the issuer requesting additional remuneration from the investor in order to compensate for the cost of this effort. Pricing is complex, therefore, given that investors are not always prepared to pay more for a project that could have been funded by a conventional bond. This can create an imbalance between supply and demand, but as is the case with responsible equity investment, green investors in the bond market are often prepared to pay more: price is not their priority.A niche market that could growThe climate talks in Marrakesh last year allowed African countries to take a closer interest in the issue of green bonds. Morocco, for example launched green bonds in November 2016 through several banks and public companies for a total amount in the region of nearly 150 million. The Capital Markets Authority has said that the launch of the first Kenyan green bond will be realised in 2017. Other African countries such as Nigeria, the biggest economy in West Africa, are also preparing their own green bond launch. Nigeria expects a bond issue of 63 million for the funding of green projects for the first quarter of 2017 and a second issue for the end of the year.Although European countries are always considered to be leaders in the private business market of green bonds issues, the interest and appetite for the development of renewable energy and sustainable economies is growing fast on the African continent, as it is in many Asian countries including India, Japan, South Korea and especially China.Taking bonds to the next levelAt present, as is the case with responsible investment, the green bonds market is concentrated in the hands of institutional investors and asset management companies. The majority of green bonds are issued by the Chinese market, which accounts for almost half of the outstanding amounts issued in 2016. As the Chinese market is reserved for local investors, this does not allow a real expansion of the market. According to Novethic, some green bonds are also too small to allow certain large funds to subscribe to them. Taxation can also pose problems for investors. American green bonds will not be attractive for European investors from a tax point of view, as their taxation is advantageous only for investors based in the United States.Does the green bond market allow investors to make a greater impact through their investments? The requirements promoted by the green bond principles for transparency, reporting, cash flow traceability and measuring the environmental impact clearly make this possible. But the market should cover broader themes than low carbon strategies and move towards the funding of water management, deforestation and the conservation of land and ecosystems.The bubble created by the Paris Agreement should not suck the life out of the green bonds debate, even if it has the virtue of having initiated the debate, as these practices have now developed beyond the 2016 COP22.The green bond model should also be extended beyond the environment, to social issues (social inclusion through housing and employment, health issues, community and humanitarian projects). Will the social impact bonds market allow social issues to be funded with traceability, reporting and impact measurement?To achieve this, it will have to distance itself from the controversy over the state s withdrawal from the social sphere in favour of private companies, and also from the debate over the financialisation of social issues.\l"

But Oxfam has criticised the West for failing to commit to any concrete investment targets.Oxfam estimates that just 16% of the $100bn a year pledged by rich nations in 2009 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and cut carbon emissions has been paid. It has called on countries to target 35% by 2020, and 50% by 2025, via grants and other forms of financing in order to avoid the burden of ""heavy repayments"".The cost for developing countries to adapt to climate change could go as high as $500bn a year by 2050 - four to five times larger than previous estimates, according to a report released last week by the UN.Tracy Carty, Oxfam's policy adviser on climate change, blasted the lack of commitment to developing countries, warning the issue ""cannot be kicked down the road"" for any longer.

But that relationship is becoming less and less predictable due to environmental changes. ""Coastal communities are already being affected by a combination of ocean warming, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, salt-water intrusions, ocean acidification and subsequent changes to the resources they depend on for food and livelihoods,"" Graziano da Silva noted. And yet, attention to climate change impacts on the ocean has lagged behind concerns for impacts on land and atmosphere. This will have to change in order to unlock the full potential of blue growth in broader marine and maritime economies, and prevent others from losing their existing livelihoods, Graziano da Silva said. He underscored the disproportionate impacts on Small Island Developing States, saying that ""For SIDS countries, this has become a fight for survival."" In these countries, coastal communities are not only more dependent on natural resources but also less able to adapt to change - particularly those in Africa.""Port state measures essential to unlocking blue potentialClimate change is not the only challenge to coastal nations seeking to unleash their true blue potential.Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing puts additional stress on oceans and marine resources, siphoning off billions worldwide in government revenue in the process. For this reason, FAO has been urging governments to sign on to the international Port State Measures Agreement that recently entered into force and will play a key role in combatting illegal fishing and improving fisheries management.Currently, however, only 13 out of 34 SIDS countries are party to the agreement, of which only nine countries are in Africa, Graziano da Silva stressed as he urged governments to consider taking immediate action to implement the treaty. At the next Our Oceans Conference, September 15-16 in Washington DC, I would like to present publicly the list of countries that have ratified the PSMA, he said. The blue economyGlobal fish production has grown steadily in the last five decades, even outpacing world population growth. Between the 1960s and 2012, the average per capita fish consumption almost doubled, rising from just under 10 kg to more than 19 kg.But the blue economy runs on more than just fish. In all, global ocean economic activity is estimated at $3-5 trillion. Ninety percent of global trade moves by marine transport and over 30 percent of global oil and gas is extracted offshore. What's more, expanding knowledge of marine biodiversity has provided breakthroughs in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, food production, and aquaculture.Graziano da Silva highlighted the role of ocean health in the UN's new Sustainable Development Goals, along with the success of last year's COP21 Climate Conference in Paris, where marine health featured prominently for the first time. Looking ahead at the upcoming COP22 in Morocco, the FAO leader said the organization will highlight how oceans can help grow economies and manage climate change at the same time.""The goal of the international community should be not only building a sustainable green economy but also a blue one,"" he concluded.\l"

Many villagers are forced to survive on wild fruit. Maize, the country's traditional staple crop, has suffered a series of poor harvests. Late rains this year again wrecked the planting season, and the little that is growing has often been destroyed by heat. It may not help the immediate crisis, but science is providing a glimmer of hope for smallholder maize farmers in Zimbabwe. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center - known by its Spanish acronym CIMMYT -- is conducting trials in Zaka on hybrid maize seeds adapted to tackle drought and high temperatures. The seeds are developed to survive dry conditions with 60% less water than normal and in temperatures of up to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), according to CIMMYT researchers. ""If we get these new maize seed varieties that will help us a lot,"" said Ceaser Chavizha, a small smallholder in Zaka, located in Masvingo province, south of the capital Harare. Like many farmers in the region who rely on maize produce, Chavizha has been forced to survive on food handouts as his crops have been reduced to dried husks. ""We cannot continue with handouts as we have fields that we can work on to produce food for our own, so we hope the new maize seeds will help us improve our yields,"" he told AFP. Maize meal crops are ground and turned into mealie meal, used to make porridge and other food, but the El Nino-induced drought has wrecked arable fields, grazing pastures and water sources. The drought scourge is high on the agenda at UN COP22 climate talks in Morocco, where world leaders and experts are discussing how to implement the landmark Paris Agreement that was signed last year. The pact aims to cap global warming at below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F), compared with pre-industrial levels.Once referred to as the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe used to be an exporter of maize, but now aid organisations say the country requires about two million metric tonnes a year to feed itself.Cosmos Magorokosho, a senior scientist and maize breeder at CIMMYT, said the ultimate goal of hybrids was to help farmers develop long-term sustainable agriculture. ""Basically it means transferring genes from one plant to another type so that you create a new type that has the characteristics that you want,"" he said. He said CIMMYT had received $500,000 funding from USAID to develop the new maize variety for drought-prone areas in east, central and southern Africa. Magorokosho stressed that more funds were needed to extend the project, and criticised the Zimbabwe government's delay in adopting new maize hybrids. ""There is a layer of testing that is required by the authorities which is a little bit long... we would wish it is shortened so that the varieties can get quickly to the farmers,"" Magorokosho said. CIMMYT, a non-profit research project headquartered in Mexico, is also working on a vitamin A-rich maize variety which is already in production in other parts of Africa and Latin America. This year, Zimbabwe's cash-strapped government declared a ""state of disaster"" in most rural areas, with at least 2.4 million people in urgent need of food aid.Sekai Makonese, another small-scale farmer in Zaka, welcomed the potential impact of scientific intervention, saying she was counting on hybrids becoming widespread as soon as possible. ""Long ago, we used to farm maize with no problems but now we have a problem with climate change and now our crops fail before we harvest,"" she said.The Zimbabwe government is yet to approve the mass distribution of the seeds, but the product is already available at some agricultural outlets.<em>Source: </em>emAFP/em<em>.</em>\l"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa46","Reducing emissions in power sector - SA's top priority","October 26, 2016 Wednesday","Bizcommunity.com (South Africa: Other industries)","The Department of Environmental Affairs says emission reduction options in the power sector remain a priority to meet the country's overall greenhouse gas reduction targets over the coming few years...Judie Beaumont, the deputy director-general responsible for Climate Change and Air Quality, said this when the department, as well as Eskom, briefed the Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs on renewable energy and SA s greenhouse emission reduction system at the National Assembly, on Tuesday, 25 October. Emission reduction options in the power sector are absolutely critical for South Africa s overall ability to reduce our carbon emissions and to transition to a lower carbon economy overtime. If we are not able to reduce emissions in the power sector, the rest of the economy has to take deeper action. So I think just to emphasise the importance of the power sector which really is the sector that generates because of the reliance at the moment on coal-based generation is the sector that produces the most greenhouse emissions, she said.Climate change mitigation system frameworkIn 2005, Cabinet approved South Africa s climate change mitigation system framework.The framework included a number of key elements from a carbon budget for each company and desired emissions reduction outcomes for key economic sectors to pollution prevention plans by companies with carbon budgets and a reporting system to gather information on the actual emissions of users.Other measures, including the introduction of a carbon tax, are amongst those that have been identified to support or complement the carbon budget system.The system was introduced in phases. The first phase, which runs from 2016 until 2020, will be voluntary as there are no legal basis to set emissions limits for sector companies.Phase 2, which will run post 2020, will become mandatory once the climate change response legislation is in place.Beaumont said as the country is implementing the emissions reduction system, renewable energy is a critical component in that strategy.Deborah Ramalope, chief director responsible for emission reduction in the department, said the first phase was approved in 2015, together with the litigation potential analysis which will look at what is possible per sector in terms of emission reduction targets.She said the department has so far completed carbon budget with 18 companies, including Eskom, and that soon there will be draft carbon reduction plans that will help companies achieve their carbon budgets.The key sectors that are being considered for the implementation of mitigation factors include energy, transport, waste, carbon sinks, among others. From then on, companies will be required to report to the department on an annual basis to explain how they are doing in terms of meeting their carbon budgets and we will assess compliance. Eskom commits to climate change We take the issue of climate change very seriously as well as the issue of adhering to commitments made at the Paris conference, which should be probably ratified at the Conference of the Parties (COP 22). We hope that the country will sign the COP 22 agreement of November 2016 so that we remain a player in the bigger parties and groupings relating to the discussions on climate change, he said.Eskom s chief financial officer Anoj Singh said Eskom is currently compliant with respect to meeting the requirements of carbon emissions.He said Eskom currently contributes about 44.5% to the national greenhouse gas emissions, which is the budgeted amount, and this makes the power utility compliant.\l"

South Africa signed the Paris Agreement at the UN in New York in April this year.It guides international efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to meet all challenges associated with and posed by climate change.

Boosting agriculture can reduce malnutrition and poverty, create economic opportunities, and generate faster, fairer growth especially for young people.Sustainable agriculture also improves the management of natural resources such as water; conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services, and increases carbon sequestration while easing the pressures that drive deforestation. ""We have to transform agriculture to make it more productive and more resilient at the same time. This transformation will help to address, at the same time, the triple threat of hunger, poverty and climate change,"" FAO's director-general said. ""Countries are recognising this potential with unprecedented commitments.""Scaling up international flows of climate finance and unlocking additional investment in adaptation in agricultural sectors is needed to give traction to the action, he added. A concerted push to put agriculture at the center of climate action Featuring agriculture-focused initiatives, a special event co-organised by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco, is part of the Global Climate Action Agenda, led by the COP22 Climate Champions, Laurence Tubiana (France) and Hakima El Hait\'e9 (Morocco), and aimed at joining and accelerating efforts by the public and private sectors to meet international climate goals.In a bid to tackle the impact of global water scarcity, FAO launched the Global Framework for Action to Cope with Water Scarcity in Agriculture in the Context of Climate Change.Water scarcity - already a major global issue - will intensify with climate change and pressures linked to population growth. From California to China's eastern provinces and from Jordan to the southern tip of Africa, an estimated four billion people - almost two-thirds of the global population - live with severe water shortages for at least some of the time. Water scarcity ""is one of the main challenges for sustainable agriculture,"" Graziano da Silva said. ""I invite countries and partners to join this initiative.""At another high-profile side event, he hailed the timely launch of the Initiative in Favor for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, which is the Kingdom of Morocco's flagship programme and has been endorsed by 27 countries so far.The so-called Triple A ""will drive action in precisely the areas we need to transform the agriculture sectors"" - sustainable land and soil management, better water management and comprehensive climate risk management - and FAO will collaborate strongly to scale up the initiative. That will require larger climate finance flows for adaptation, and for agriculture in particular, he said, noting that currently only two percent of climate finance is being directed at the agriculture sector. ""That is extremely low, and quite below our needs,"" he said.Cost of inaction far outweighs actionThe world has signed up to the ambitious aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement to fight hunger, poverty and climate change. ""For millions of people, our actions can make a difference between poverty and prosperity, and between hunger and food security,"" FAO's director-general said.\l"

In the past, most funds have been used on mitigation projects - those intended to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. But there is a growing consensus that work focused on adapting to climate change is of equal importance and more funding needs to be devoted to it. This is a step in the right direction. With 28 African countries expected to more than double in population by 2050, and 10 African countries - Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia - expected to grow by at least a factor of five by 2100, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Africa will be hard pressed to feed itself as temperature increases drive farm production down. Higher temperatures leads to weak output in Africa<blockquote>The scientific consensus is that a temperature increase of 2\'b0Celsius would result in an average reduction of 15% to 20% in agricultural yields on the continent.</blockquote>While increases in temperature and carbon dioxide can increase some crop yields in some places, experts at the US Environmental Protection Agency have noted Africa isn t among them. In fact, the opposite is true: The scientific consensus is that a temperature increase of 2\'b0Celsius would result in an average reduction of 15% to 20% in agricultural yields on the continent. The Center for Global Development s 2011 report, Quantifying Vulnerability to Climate Change Implications for Adaptation Assistance, forecasts median agricultural productivity losses due to climate change ranging from 18% in North Africa to 19.8% in Central Africa through 2050.The weak output in Africa, reinforced by a spike in temperatures and exacerbated by extreme climate events, could create a vicious loop of food insecurity, impoverishment, mass migration and, finally, armed conflict. Climate-related migration and conflict already are a reality on the continent, and more often than not they are related to agriculture and food.The feedback loopIn addition to the moral imperative of feeding people, there is also an essentially practical argument to be made in favour of significantly increasing support for agricultural adaptation in Africa - the so-called feedback loop. By helping Africa boost agricultural production through improved soil management and irrigation techniques, as well as increased research on other farming techniques that respect the integrity of land, the global community also would be helping reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. That s because the improved agricultural practices, in a virtuous circle, would increase yields on poor farmland, reduce deforestation and improve the carbon sequestration capacity of cultivated soil.Adapting African AgricultureCurrently, agriculture and Africa are the poor relations of climate finance. Adaptation, agriculture and Africa have been understudied and underfunded and their importance underestimated. In the area of agriculture, all geographic regions combined account for only 4% of public funds linked to climate change. The African continent, home to nearly 25% of the developing world s population, receives just 5% of public and private climate funds. This is difficult to swallow when you consider that Africa is among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, while only marginally contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.By maintaining African agriculture and reinforcing its capacity for adapting to climate change, the international community can show its responsiveness to the life-and-death issue of African food security, while addressing the global imperative to reduce temperature increases.Marrakech COP22 is a unique opportunity to finally position the adaptation of African agriculture as one of the highest priority subjects. Delegates to the Marrakech climate conference can help solve this problem by reallocating available climate change resources from mitigation efforts to adaptation projects in general, and to the African agriculture in particular. For Africa and the world, it is time to consider these realities. \l"

The agreement recognises ""the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change."" This is echoed in country commitments where the agricultural sectors stand out as a priority.Now, at COP22 in Morocco, we have the opportunity to make significant progress, by making agriculture a major part of the solution.A focus on smallholdersTransformation to sustainable agriculture will require tailor-made solutions and an enabling environment, resources and time. The world's primary food producers include around 500 million smallholders and family farmers engaged in a variety of farming practices and environmental conditions. As a result, there is no single formula for sustainability.For that very reason, rapid deployment of support for that transformation is critical.In 2016, July and August were the hottest ever in recorded history, underscoring the urgent need to dramatically scale up our efforts on climate action. The good news is that a radical shift to climate-smart sustainable agriculture is possible, and rural smallholders - the most vulnerable of all - can not only adapt but actively contribute to global climate stabilisation.To do so effectively, they will need support as they do not have any reserves to invest in new farming practices.

With more than 874 million hectares of arable land - nearly six times as much as in the United States - Africa has the opportunity to ensure food security for all without repeating the environmental mistakes made by advanced economies.Africa s green industrial revolutionStatistics in the 2016 United Nations Economic Report on Africa (ERA) show a path to environmentally sound industrialisation. Investing in infrastructure so that people can power their homes with greener energy without chopping down trees will be key. With the increased wealth that an agricultural revolution might bring, we need to be conscious of not squandering our natural resources. Therefore, green power and improved livelihoods must go hand in hand. If we adopt a green agenda to improve urbanization, energy developments, and population growth, the report says, GDP per capita would more than triple to $14,000 and the number of Africans living on less than $2 a day would nearly halve to 350 million.Africa s green industrial revolution has to use the continent s abundant renewable energies. Africa consumes less than 3 percent of the total energy produced globally and accounts for less than 4 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, yet it needs more energy to industrialise. Currently, Africa uses only 2 percent of its renewable water resources and has the potential to increase hydropower generation.Greening is not just about honoring United Nations environment agreements made at the COP21 Paris climate change talks last year, or the decisions made at COP22 which will take place in Marrakesh in November. It is about combining industrialisation and technological advances that protect our natural resources in the production process. If we get this transition right, women, in particular, stand to benefit. Rural women constitute the majority of the 80 percent of agricultural production coming from small farmers, yet they have limited access and control over the means of production. With proper training, these women could boost productivity and boost their earnings, thus lifting the economy.Jobs as the multiplier effectI was entrusted with the responsibility to implement a strategy focused on health, education and financial inclusion for Ecobank Foundation, a branch of one of Africa s largest banking conglomerates dedicated to funding social projects. While it will be possible for us to make progress with our partners, we will not reach our full contribution to society until our collective investment is matched with jobs along the value chains of Africa s agricultural resources. Jobs are the multiplier effect of social investments. Unless more Africans are joining - and being retained in - the labour market, transformation will remain an elusive concept for many Africans.I am confident that my generation can deliver on the jobs promise, the same way our forefathers did on the promise of independence. We have managed to solve everyday problems by innovation out of necessity in places where energy is lacking. We can do the same for our agricultural revolution that holds the key to unlocking jobs in new sectors. With Africa s population projected to reach 2.4 billion people by 2050, current and new jobs will have to come from agriculture to quell persistent high levels of informal employment accounting for as many as 80 percent of jobs. Financing the green revolutionTechnology can help, as we have seen with M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer. With adequate regulation, M-Pesa could give rise to a mechanism to finance the green revolution. For example, InVenture delivered 200,000 loans in Kenya with repayment rates above 90 percent by using mobile data to create a financial identity for borrowers.We have already seen how this can translate into agricultural development.

In fact, it is estimated that 65 percent of Africa's population is affected by climate change...This story of failed harvest, hunger and hopelessness as temperatures rise are common across the continent. In fact, it is estimated that 65 percent of Africa's population is affected by climate change. The need for agriculture, which feeds the chronically food insecure region and forms the backbone of its economy, to adapt to these extreme weather events is becoming urgent.Yet disappointingly, here at COP22 in Marrakech, dubbed both ""The African COP"" and ""The COP of Action,"" talks to include agriculture in the climate change negotiations have once again collapsed. Disputes on how to integrate adaptation and mitigation efforts have led to any further discussions being postponed until June 2017 at the next meeting of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) in Bonn.Lack of progress at a global level makes regional action all the more critical. That is why the Moroccan government is championing the adaptation of African agriculture (AAA), through the launch of the ambitious AAA initiative.At an event held in Marrakech, scientists and policymakers from all over Africa came together to determine an action plan for implementing this initiative, based on a rich body of evidence generated by the global research network CGIAR and its many partners. Taken together with the clear desire for action by African countries that prioritised agriculture in their national climate plans, there is significant potential to transform food and farming under climate change.A number of actions were identified at the event as being the most crucial for accelerating action on the adaptation of African agriculture.Mobilising investmentRecent analysis has proven that investing in climate-sensitive practices makes both environmental and economic sense. According to a report launched by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and CGIAR last week, for each dollar invested through IFAD's Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme, farmers could earn a return of up to $2.60 over a 20 year period by applying climate change adaptation practices.<blockquote>Africa's annual need for investment in adaptation has been estimated to be between $7-15 billion per year by 2020, across all sectors.</blockquote> Despite this compelling evidence, investments are limited by availability and access to finance. Africa's annual need for investment in adaptation has been estimated to be between $7-15 billion per year by 2020, across all sectors. But only around $1-2 billion per year is available now from public sources, and Africa receives just five percent of international public climate funding. Assisting African countries to prepare economic and financial analyses of costs and returns to farmers of various adaptation actions, for example, will help countries access sorely needed finance from climate funds.Knowledge exchangeAs greater amounts of investments are mobilised into the sector, we need to ensure it is used effectively. By fostering partnerships that share knowledge, at a regional and transnational level, Africa farmers can be equipped with cost-effective and impactful approaches for adaptation.A recent knowledge exchange between Senegal and Colombia is a fine example of this. Work has been underway in Senegal to involve farmers in a new initiative for farmer-oriented climate information and weather forecasting services. This has involved marrying traditional knowledge with advanced scientific approaches, which are then disseminated in local languages via community radio.Colombian farmers have visited Kaffrine in Senegal to learn from this experience, and taking back lessons for implementing a similar project in their region benefiting 1,500 farmers.Monitoring and measuringMeasuring progress is going to be a great challenge as the Paris Agreement moves forward, and should not be underestimated. Countries will be required to report on their emissions using an enhanced transparency and accountability framework put together as part of the Paris Agreement.There is an important role here for the science community to facilitate and support this process. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) has developed a Climate-Smart Agriculture programming and indicator tool, which brings together and builds upon approaches used by major development agencies in monitoring projects. The tool helps measure outcomes related to increased productivity, food security, adaptation, resilience, and mitigation, and could be key to helping countries measure progress towards established targets.Farmers like Amon have no time to lose - they are relying on leaders and experts to take action now. Using the momentum created by the Moroccan government, Africa must move forward on adaptation for agriculture, even while global progress stalls.Elwyn Grainger-Jones is executive director of the CGIAR System Organization.Any views expressed in this article are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.\l"

South Africa is in the final stages of going through the parliamentary ratification.The task before countries is to build on and strengthen the momentum that ensured the early enforcement of the agreement. For this to happen, the issue of climate finance is critical.The reality is that developing countries such as South Africa can only scale up their climate action efforts with significant investment.Ahead of the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22This implementation refers to the provision of financial resources to enable developing countries to meet the costs of adaptation to, and mitigation of, the effects of climate change.The Paris agreement commits developed countries to provide $100-billion (about R1.4-trillion) a year by 2020 and scale that up in 2025.South Africa has consistently emphasised the importance of governments and non-state actors meeting to discuss how to find additional resources to aid our country's transition to a low-carbon, inclusive, climate-resilient economy and society.Despite facing the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality, and resulting resource and capacity constraints, we are doing our fair share towards the global effort to fight climate change.We have invested heavily in mitigation and adaptation initiatives in the green economy, renewable energy, green transport and other sectors, to name but a few.To scale up efforts requires billions of dollars in additional investment that we simply cannot find on our own. Funding for implementation includes provision for the transfer of environmentally sound, technically proven technologies, as well as for skills development and capacity building.South Africa further emphasised in Morocco this week that we need to seriously look at so-called adaptation financing before 2020: for instance, the provision of climate-change adaptation financing to help manage issues like water scarcity.Like many other countries on the continent, South Africa is semi-arid, with less than 5% of annual rainfall available to recharge our groundwater aquifers (large underground lakes). In an ever-changing climate, our existing water challenges are exacerbated.Extreme weather includes drought, which leads to diminished agricultural production and loss of food security, especially for people in rural areas.Irregular rainfall can lead to an increase in human and animal disease, including cholera, malaria and diarrhoea, thereby putting immense strain on the public health system.Flash flooding damages crucial infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications, resulting in social and economic losses.Flooding of low-lying coastal areas as a result of sea-level rise results in the loss of life and human settlements, as well as destruction of mangroves and river deltas.Groundwater can become contaminated, rendering areas uninhabitable for communities reliant on borehole water for drinking and crop irrigation.Climate change affects nearly every cog in the many wheels that keep this country running: from healthcare to agriculture and forestry, to biodiversity and ecosystems, to infrastructure and human settlements, to defence, to water and sanitation.Adapting to climate change requires a response that builds and sustains South Africa's social, economic and environmental resilience as well as our emergency response capacity - and to meet our obligations we require financial support.Although we are all ultimately impacted by the effects of a changing climate, such effects are not being felt evenly around the world.South Africa, and the African continent as a whole, are at greater risk because of low levels of development and because our climate change adaptation efforts aren't on the scale of developed countries.Scaling up the provision of climate financing is critical if we are to meet the long-term objectives of the Paris agreement. In this regard, non-party stakeholders, especially business, need to do more to support and advance the Global Climate Action agenda. Molewa is minister of environmental affairs\l"

He is confident Africa can and will unite to take its rightful place in the world, where there is full citizen participation.Bathily attended the recent UN climate change conference - COP22 - in Morocco, where he was impressed with developments.

After two decades of negotiations, the world got its climate agreement at COP21 in Paris last year  the Paris Agreement. This year's meeting in Marrakech fleshed that out and ensured its nearly 200 signatories were on the same path.That will see the world moving away from fossil fuels and aiming for zero carbon emissions by 2050. It will also, hopefully, ensure that global warming does not exceed 2\'c2\'b0C this century. Instead of a massive COP meeting, negotiators will meet twice in Germany next year in smaller gatherings to keep on tweaking things. At the heart of this process will be each country's nationally determined contribution. This is the pledge each country put forward to say how it will lower emissions, and adapt to the changing climate. South Africa's contribution covers a whole range of things, such as creating jobs in sustainable development initiatives and shutting down coal-fired power stations. But its core aim is vague  carbon emissions by 2030 could be anywhere between 198-million tonnes and 614-million tonnes. Climate Action Tracker  a nongovernmental group that crunches the numbers on each country's contribution  called South Africa's contribution ""inadequate"" because it did not match the ambition of keeping global warming below 2\'c2\'b0C. ""If most other countries follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3\'c2\'b0C to 4\'c2\'b0C."" Put together, all the contributions that have been submitted will see the world warm by 2.7\'c2\'b0C this century. These commitments are, however, just a starting point. Most countries have played it safe with their nationally determined contributions. These also only cover the period up until 2030. They are more about getting countries on the same page than ensuring that the world is saved from 2\'c2\'b0C warming. At COP22 in Marrakech, four countries took big steps towards the real goal of keeping warming below that dangerous level. The United States, Germany, Canada and Mexico published their plans for how their economies would have moved largely away from fossil fuels by 2050. Germany promised a 95% cut and the United States an 80% cut. The Climate Vulnerable Group of 47 states that face the worst impacts of the changing climate, went one further and promised to run off 100% renewables by the middle of this century.African countries took the practical path towards a similar goal, giving more details on their Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. This will see 300-gigawatts of renewable capacity built across the continent by 2030. Critically, this will be with funds from private investors, instead of from developed countries giving aid. That path has stuttered over the years and created a great deal of cynicism among African countries, which stand to lose out from the changing climate. Even the Paris Agreement's goal of reducing warming to 2\'c2\'b0C will result in warming of double that on the continent, which is why the Africa Group at negotiations argued for, and failed to get that goal to be 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Funds to build renewable energy  and adapt to the changing climate  should have come through the Green Climate Fund. In theory, this would have $10-billion a year to disburse to countries that applied for finance. It neatly solved an impasse at previous negotiations, where developing countries refused to sign up to an agreement that prevented them from exploiting fossil fuels and did not see developed countries pay for the climate damage caused by their previous use of fossil fuels. But the money isn't there. The US promised to kick things off with a $3-billion commitment. It has handed over $500-million with little more expected to come from that source  president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to cut all funds to United Nations programmes. By taking control over their own energy future, African countries have an opportunity to do another great technological leapfrog. With the exception of South Africa, most of the continent's countries have little in the way of power. Renewable energy will allow countries to get that power, while not emitting carbon. All of this means delegates left Marrakech with a clear view of the path ahead: countries doing their best and working together to lower emissions. The only spanner in that works is Trump, who could reverse all work to reduce emissions in the world's second largest emitter of carbon dioxide. With global levels at 400 parts per million  up from the stable 250 parts per million at the start of the Industrial Revolution  the world is into its sixth successive year of record-breaking heat. This year is set to be the hottest on record  the World Meteorological Organisation says it will be 1.1\'c2\'b0C hotter than it would otherwise be if humans weren't warming the planet.

He, however, said he would like Africa to have greener energy and participate more in the blue economy.While in Maputo he also visited an old friend. ""I also met former president Joaquim Chissano,"" said the former UN diplomat, whose experience, knowledge of the continent and academic qualifications place him head and shoulders above the other candidates.He also met President Jacob Zuma on Monday and had talks with him.The professor is travelling with a Senegalese delegation that includes that country's foreign minister, Mankeur Ndiaye.Bathily said he spoke to Zuma about his candidature for the coveted position that will be contested in January in the Ethio-\'e2\€ \£8pian capital Addis Ababa.""I also met former president Thabo Mbeki,"" said Bathily.""I know Chissano and Mbeki from the Struggle days,"" he said.Asked about his vision for Africa, the professor said public and private economic actors needed to pull together in order to build an ""African social base"" in order for development to take place.""Africa is lacking a vigorous private sector,"" said Bathily.""There must be free movement of people and goods in Africa.""His vision is in l"

""As usual the poorest and the hungry suffer the most and the vast majority of them are small family farmers that live in rural areas of developing countries,"" the FAO director-general said, noting how adaptation and mitigation to climate change is fundamental, and that this requires ""much better access to appropriate technologies, knowledge, markets, information and investments.""Recent international commitments for action, including the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognise the fundamental role of sustainable agriculture in addressing climate change, hunger, and poverty.The World Food Day 2016 slogan: 'Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too', underscores the fact that to feed a global population expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050, humanity needs to produce more food, but in ways that use up less natural resources and that drastically reduce loss and waste.The fight for food security is a question of PoliticsIn his address, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stressed that the fight against hunger is essentially a political issue. ""Italy maintains that the fight for food security is, at this point in history, a question of politics with a capital P',"" he added.Renzi said that the international community needs to urgently address the problems of inequality and injustice. Italy would strive to ensure that these themes are at the top of the international agenda, including at two important events in March next year: the G7 summit, which Italy will host and preside and a meeting of European Union leaders.Renzi noted that Europe should reject a ""culture of waste"". Italy recently passed a new law aimed at curbing food waste, one that was based, ""more on collaboration and less on punishment."" Another keynote speaker at today's ceremony, Princess Lalla Hasnaa of Morocco, whose country is hosting next month's COP22 climate talks, said these would be ""action-oriented"" and geared towards implementing the Paris Agreement. ""The Moroccan Presidency will seek to nurture and promote the spirit of mobilisation which prevailed in Paris in terms of increasing climate funding, developing expertise and ensuring the transfer of technology. It will lay special emphasis on adaptation, primarily for the countries of the South and for Small Island States."" Princess Hasnaa said.Pope urges solidarity with ""climate refugees""In a special message read out at the ceremony, Pope Francis linked the impact of climate change on the planet's fields, fisheries, and forests to the migration of people from rural areas of developing countries. ""The most recent data tell us that the numbers of climate refugees' are growing, swelling the ranks of the excluded and forgotten, who are being marginalised from the great human family,"" the pontiff said.""From the wisdom of rural communities we can learn a style of life that can help defend us from the logic of consumerism and production at any cost, a logic that, cloaked in good justification, such as increasing population, is in reality aimed solely at the increase in profit,"" he said. Pope Francis expressed concern that a growing number of actors in agriculture ""believe they are omnipotent or are able to ignore the cycles of the seasons and to improperly modify the various animal and plant species, leading to the loss of variety that, if it exists in nature, has and must have its role"". What may ""give excellent results in the laboratory may be advantageous to some, but it can have ruinous effects for others."" He stressed that in dealing with such issues, the world should rely more on the wisdom that farmers, fishers, and pastoralists ""conserve in memory handed down through generations.""We must change the way we approach food and agricultureUN Special Envoy on El Ni\'f1o and Climate, Macharia Kamau, for his part, urged for the need ""to build stronger solidarity, stronger actions, better partnerships and innovation, including insurance schemes that protect families and take risk out of humanitarian response"" programmes. ""The 2030 agenda, at its core, is an agenda for fighting poverty, making sure there is no hunger, and food is there for everybody. And nothing threatens that more than climate change,"" he said.""We must change the way we approach food and agriculture. Part of that change is ensuring rural smallholder producers are more resilient than ever before to the impacts of a changing climate,"" said Kanayo F. Nwanze, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). ""If we are ever to break the cycle of poverty and hunger, our attention must be focused on these smallholder producers who are the source of food for their families and communities, but are vulnerable to the effects of climate change.""Ertharin Cousin, executive director, World Food Programme (WFP) for her part said: Climate change is already stretching the international humanitarian system financially and operationally, so moving beyond disaster relief to managing risk is an urgent task for all of us. More than 80 percent of the world's hungry live in areas prone to natural disasters and environmental degradation. Climate change is not waiting, neither can we."" Mayors SummitOn World Food Day, FAO is also hosting the second Mayors' Annual Summit where mayors and senior officials from more than 45 cities will discuss progress made in meeting the goals of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa62","Starting Line Draws Nearer for Global Climate Agreement","September 22, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The Paris Climate Agreement is on the verge of coming into force after 31 nations officially deposited their instruments of ratification here Wednesday, more than doubling the number of countries which have joined so far to reach 60.However the treaty will not yet enter into force, since these 60 countries represent only 48 percent of global carbon emissions. The Paris Agreement requires at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in order for the deal to take effect.Convened by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the High Level Event on Entry into Force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change brought world leaders together to act upon commitments made to reduce global greenhouse emissions last year.""What once seemed impossible now seems inevitable. When this year ends, I hope we can all look back with pride knowing that we seized the opportunity to protect our common home,"" said Ban to delegates.Director of Strategy and Policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) Alden Meyer pointed out the significance of the event to IPS, stating: ""Political leaders see this as an important issue for their public.""Similarly, Greenpeace International's Climate and Energy Policy Advisor Kaisa Kosonen said how ""inspiring"" it was to see so many countries ratifying the agreement so soon.""It truly tells you that times have changed. If one compares the process we had at Copenhagen and you think about where we are today when the agreement is looking likely to enter into force... it is giving the agreement a very good start,"" she told IPSDuring the UN Climate Change Conference in 2009 (COP15) in Denmark, global leaders failed to commit to concrete actions to reduce emissions. The Paris Agreement now obligates governments to keep temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Many believe that the treaty will be ratified by the end of the year, less than a year since the agreement was signed, which would make it the speediest agreement to enter into force.""It's unprecedented,"" said Spokesperson for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Nick Nuttall to IPS after noting the breakneck speed in which the treaty would come into force.""Getting an agreement on climate change was one of the most difficult tasks the world has ever faced... that's a strong political signal that all governments are on board to actually make good on their pledges in Paris.""Of the countries that have joined are some of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions including China and the United States, which together account for over one third of global emissions. However many of the countries which joined the agreement early, were small island states many of which see climate change as an existential threat. Although these states face increased natural disasters and rising sea levels, their own carbon emissions barely make a dent on a global scale.China, which represents just over 20 percent of global emissions, has ambitiously committed to reduce carbon dioxide levels by 60 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The East Asian nation also aims to expand energy consumption coming from non-fossil energy to 20 percent by then. The U.S. meanwhile plans to cut up to 28 percent of the country's emissions below 2005 levels by 2025.Meyer commented on the importance of the move by the U.S., stating: ""The United States is very wealthy but is obviously not immune as we've seen from Superstorm Sandy, the recent flooding in Louisiana, the droughts and heat waves in the West... no country, no community is immune.""More countries are expected to ratify the agreement by the end of this year including Australia, Canada and the 28 members of the European Union (EU).If these promises are fulfilled, the agreement will pass the second threshold and go into effect within 30 days.But this is just the beginning, Nuttall stated. ""The Paris Agreement is a framework agreement to combat climate change but it needs some nuts and bolts put in.""Meyer echoed similar sentiments, telling IPS: ""Having the agreement in place is only meaningful if countries implement [the agreement]. It is really actions on the ground that make a difference and the jury is still out on that.""Nuttall highlighted the need for a ""rule book"" for member states to put the climate treaty into action, which many hope will be achieved during the upcoming Climate Conference (COP22) in Morocco.Meyer particularly pointed to the challenge of achieving the two degree Celsius goal, telling IPS that the pledges by themselves do not add up to meet the temperature target. But even if the international community achieves this goal, the impacts of climate change will drastically increase which will require further action.""The other side of this discussion has to be how we increase resilience to climate impacts and how we help countries and communities that are facing impacts cope with those impacts,"" Meyer told IPS. ""This is a moment which we should celebrate, hoist a glass of champagne but get back to work in the morning because there's still a lot of work to do,"" he continued.Already obstacles are arising as trade policies continue to clash with climate action.""It's clear that all policies that still favor fossil fuels or prevent countries from prioritizing renewable clean energy are harmful and should not be supported,"" Kosonen said, referring to a new controversial global trade deal Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa).According to leaked documents, the trade deal under negotiation between the EU and 22 countries may threaten the expansion of clean, renewable energy which could undermine the achievement of the Paris Agreement.However, the world is waiting for the final ratification of the Paris Agreement as it is still uncertain where, how far and how fast it will go.""The direction is clear, the commitment is clear but... can a family of nations working with the private sector and being supported by cities and regions rev up the action sufficiently quickly that we have a good chance of peaking these emissions very soon? That we will have to wait and see,"" Nuttall stated.Kosonen noted there is no room for complacency.Follow @ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/tharanga_yakuhttps://twitter.com/tharanga_yaku\l"

Growth here could reflect general growth of patenting in all technologies, and so the chart below indicates low-carbon inventions as a share of inventions in all technology areas.We can see rapid growth in the number of green patents filed over the last 30 years and particularly since 2005. Between 2000 and 2013, the number of new climate-mitigation inventions patented globally grew at an annual rate of almost 10%, more than double the rate of innovation in all technologies.

Policymakers also believe that global climate agreements cannot be reversed easily. In the meantime, stakeholders are pressing on with formulating strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\~The 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) to the United Nations' agency on climate change held on November 7 18, 2017, in Marrakech, Morocco.At the climate talks, Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, Pakistan and seven other countries ratified the December 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. A total of 111 countries, including the United States, China and Member Countries of the European Union ratified the agreement by the time COP 22 concluded. Since the Paris accord entered into force on\~November 4, quite earlier than anticipated, global action against climate change has effectively shifted to strategic programming. Therefore, in Marrakech - Canada, Germany, Mexico and the United States, published their plans to significantly decarbonise their economies by 2050. A group of 47 developing nations also committed to running entirely on renewable energy sources as rapidly as possible . Some of the plans are already gaining traction. Investments in renewable energy totalled $286 billion in 2015. This surpassed by 3% the previous high of renewable energy investment achieved in 2011. Data gleaned from Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2016, a joint publication by United Nations Environment Programme and Bloomberg, further revealed that last year, coal and gas-fired electricity generation drew less than half the record investment made in solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. The trend in renewable energy investment is a mixed bag, even in developing countries. China alone accounted for 55% of total investment last year; Africa's share was less than 5%. As climate change mitigation is being driven by investment in green energy, Africa is already taking the familiar position at the back seat on the 'green energy train'. This was not unanticipated by climate policymakers. Although China is the clear leader in investment in renewables, other developing countries, in particular the low-income countries, are not expected to be able to keep pace without international assistance. But the advanced countries appear to be reneging on their pledges to help finance both mitigation and adaptation frameworks in the developing world, including Africa.This generated some rumblings in Marrakech, with regard to the commitment by the developed countries to raise $100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate actions in developing countries.\~Disappointing as this is, the prospects of improvement in international assistance at the required scale are not assuring.<strong>International assistance waning</strong>One, virtually all the advanced countries have been bedevilled by over half a decade of weak economic growth. This has put investment in infrastructure below ideal levels, suggesting near-term pressure on the fiscal regimes to close the infrastructure gap, create domestic jobs, and boost economic growth. Two, the economic malaise is also driving populist nationalistic sentiments in Europe and the United States. The backlashes for the emerging isolationist regimes are expected to include decl"

Looking ahead, those countries which have diversified their economies, focused on energy infrastructure, and promoted industrialisation, will be best poised to overcome the current challenges and succeed in 2017.As Aubrey Hruby and I documented in a report last year, those countries that rely heavily on the export of one or two resources to drive their economic growth have suffered as a result of the emerging market downturn and its knock-on effects, both in terms of demand for their commodities and in availability of financing for their major infrastructure and other development projects.<strong>Nigeria</strong>Nigeria,\~Africa's most populous country and one which only emerged as the continent's biggest economy three years ago, is bedeviled not only by low petroleum prices, but decreased production due to attacks by the militants in the oil-producing Niger Delta region - at one point last year, the amount of crude being pumped nearly reached the lowest point in three decades.The rest of the economy in the West African giant essentially stagnated, hammered both by the government's maladroit management of the currency float and by the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari's administration to make much headway in improving the country's overall business climate, as witnessed by Nigeria's abysmal 169th place ranking among 190 countries analysed in the World Bank's Doing Business 2017 report.<strong>Angola</strong>Angola\~nudged ahead of Nigeria early last year to become Africa's biggest oil producer, thanks in part to the latter country's problems with its militants, but the distinction means less in a world of depressed hydrocarbon prices. With inflation projected to have been around 45% in 2016, while the country's currency, the kwanza, lost nearly 20% of its value during the same period, the country's grim prospects heading into the new year add to the uncertainty with the announced plans of longtime President Jos\'e9 Eduardo dos Santos to retire later this year (elections are scheduled for August).<strong>Algeria</strong>Similarly,\~Algeria's\~heavy dependence on energy exports caused the growth to slow down to an estimated 3.6% in 2016 with the World Bank estimating it will plunge further in the coming year. Low oil prices will continue to weigh on government finances as inflation and unemployment both increase; the dinar has nominally depreciated 20% over the last two years.The 2017 budget signed by the country's octogenarian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in late December raises taxes to compensate for declining revenues from hydrocarbons, signaling that the heavy public spending that enabled the regime to weather the so-called Arab Spring is no longer an option.<strong>South Africa</strong>While\~South Africa\~was spared an end-of-the-year downgrade by Standard & Poor's of its sovereign credit - it remains at BBB-, one notch above ""junk"" status - Moody's opened 2017 by placing the country on a downgrade review, a step which serves notice to investors, some of whom have fiduciary obligations barring them from doing business in places branded with ""junk"" status. Moreover, the numerous corruption scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma have divided the ruling African National Congress, already reeling from unprecedented rebuff in the August 2016 local government and municipal elections, adding to the political volatility that undermines investor confidence just as the country regained its title as Africa's largest economy.<strong>DRC</strong>Despite its wealth of natural resources, both in terms of extractives and in potential for renewable energy, to say nothing of the extraordinary human capital in its people, the\~Democratic Republic of the Congo<strong>\~</strong>will struggle economically in the coming year. Notwithstanding a rickety last-minute political deal pushed by the country's influential Roman Catholic bishops that is supposed to lead to presidential elections before the end of 2017, President Joseph Kabila's decision to violate the constitution and hold on to power despite the December 19, 2016, expiration of his final term, casts a long shadow over the fourth most-populous country on the African continent and the largest country by area in Sub-Saharan Africa.As Sasha Lezhnev of the Enough Project pointed out recently, the political crisis is not without its connection to economic woes, past and present: ""Corruption has increased and prices for the key commodities that Congo produces have plummeted in recent years, e.g. with the price of copper going down by nearly half over the past five years. Average Congolese people are bearing the brunt of this. The price of some foodstuffs is up as high as 80%; the Congolese Franc has lost 27% of its value in 2016; inflation has increased to nearly 6%; Central Bank foreign exchange reserves have decreased by nearly half (45%) over the past two years. The Congolese government is also slashing state services, with budget cuts of 22% and a further 14%, including a 90% cut in spending on healthcare equipment.""If some of the bigger and resource-dependent economies in Africa are in the doldrums, some of the continent's medium-sized and more diversified economies will make interesting watching in the new year.<strong>C\'f4te d'Ivoire</strong>\~The IMF's most recent regional economic outlook projects C\'f4te d'Ivoire's real gross domestic product (GDP) to continue growing at roughly 8% annually over the next few years, while the median for Sub-Saharan Africa will be just shy of 4.5v. According to data from the Ivorian government's Center for the Promotion of Investments in C\'f4te d'Ivoire (CEPICI), through in the first nine months of 2016, some 5,720 new enterprises were started in the country, many drawn by the business-friendly regulatory environment.<strong>Morocco</strong>Fresh off hosting the 22nd Conference of Parties (COP22) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change two months ago in Marrakech,<strong>\~</strong>Morocco\~continues to forge a role as an African - and, indeed, a global - leader on renewable energy. The kingdom, which is on track to meet more than 40% of its needs through renewable energy, primarily solar and wind, by 2020 - an extraordinary turnaround given that just a few years ago the country was, according to the World Bank, the Middle East's largest energy importer, depending on fossil fuels for over 97% of its energy.Moreover, in pursuit of the goal of making Morocco the commercial gateway to Africa as well as Africa's bridge to Europe, King Mohammed VI has been busy implementing his strategy of making Africa the ""top priority"" of his foreign policy, with a string of official visits across Africa, including recent forays to Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, that have resulted in agreements for multibillion-dollar cross-investments in the agriculture, energy, and financial sectors; as well as the historic announcement last month of a Moroccan-Nigerian joint venture to build a gas pipel"

""Sustainable agriculture is paramount to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, to sustain natural resources, to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, to achieve healthier food systems and to build resilience against crises and natural disasters,"" Graziano da Silva said. But he noted that while past developments in agriculture have led to major improvements in productivity, ""progress has been uneven"" and that ""greater emphasis must be placed on the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability"". Sierra Leone's Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security, Monty Patrick Jones, also addressed the meeting, stressing that in Africa, boosting agricultural productivity in a sustainable way is not only essential for food and nutrition security, but is also critical to eradicating poverty. In particular, small-holder farmers ""should produce food not just for the table, but also for the market,"" he said, urging governments to play their part by supporting the process and increasing investments.""We've seen an increase in investments, but only a few invest 10 percent"" of their budget on agriculture Jones said, referring to a pledge made by African leaders in the 2003 Maputo Declaration.Scientific innovation in agriculture go hand-in-hand with policy reformAnother keynote speaker at COAG's opening, Joachim von Braun, director of University of Bonn's Center for Development Research, underscored the need for scientific innovation in agriculture to go hand-in-hand with policy reform.""Agriculture and food systems are transforming, and that must be supported by a sound cooperation between science and policy,"" von Braun said.He told participants that for this purpose, an International Panel on Food, Nutrition and Agriculture should be established to assist the international community in the same way as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ""helps guide global climate policy"".FAO action on antimicrobial resistance and climate changeGraziano da Silva, noting that the ""role of agriculture goes beyond generating food and income,"" referred to FAO's recent commitment at the United Nations General Assembly to work closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to curb antimicrobial resistance (AMR).""We at FAO believe that antibiotics and other antimicrobials should be used in agriculture to cure diseases and to alleviate suffering. Only under strict circumstances could they be used to prevent an imminent threat of infection,"" the director-general said.Graziano da Silva also pointed to growing international recognition that agriculture can play a transformative role in addressing the impacts of climate change. Countries are set to gather for the COP 22 summit in Morocco in November to put into motion their pledges on climate change and FAO ""stands ready to assist governments, especially of developing countries to have access to international resources that are available to finance these actions,"" he said.FAO support for 245 initiatives in 89 countriesGraziano da Silva told participants at COAG's opening session that in 2014-15, FAO supported 245 initiatives in 89 countries to promote sustainable agricultural production practices based on participatory approaches. ""Results have well exceeded our targets. More than 80 of these initiatives were implemented in Africa alone,"" the FAO director-general said.He noted that within the Save Food Initiative, FAO supported 45 countries in reducing food waste and loss through a partnership network that includes civil society, the private sector, UN institutions, and academia.

"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa71","Convincing Investors to Unlock Africa's Green Energy Potential","November 16, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","Lowering investment risks in African countries is key to achieving a climate-resilient development pathway on the continent, say experts here at the U.N.-sponsored Climate Conference.Mustapha Bakkaoury, president of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), says his country's renewable energy revolution would not have been possible if multilateral partners such as the African Development Bank had not come on board to act as guarantors for a massive solar energy project, tipped to be one of a kind in Africa.Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone.The multi-billion-dollar solar power complex, located in the Souss-Massa-Dr\'e2a area in Ouarzazate, is expected to produce 580 MW at peak when finished, and is hailed as a model for other African countries to follow.""Africa has legitimate energy needs, and development of Africa will happen through mobilisation of energy resources,"" Bakkaoury told IPS at COP 22 after a roundtable discussion on de-risking investment in realising groundbreaking renewable energy projects.Bakkauory believes it is possible for Africa to develop its energy sector while respecting the environment. ""What we say is that there is no fatality between having energy resources and respect towards the environment, and Africa has abundant resources to do this through its key partner - the African Development Bank,"" he said, noting the instrumental role of Africa's premier multilateral financier to renewable energy in Africa.And in affirming its continued commitment to universal access to energy for Africa, Alex Rugamba, AfDB Director for Energy, Environment and Climate Change, told IPS that ""the Bank's commitment has shifted gear as it has now a fully-fledged vice presidency dedicated to Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth.""Rugamba added that the Bank has learnt valuable lessons from various initiatives it is already supporting, and knows what is required to move forward with the initiatives without many challenges. Renewable energy has been identified as a key driver for Africa's economic growth prospects, but requires multi-million-dollar investments which cannot be done by public financing alone.Private sector involvement is required to drive this agenda, a point underscored by World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development, Laura Tuck.""Private sector cannot be ignored because the money they have is more than what is available under public financing,"" she says.But the risk is believed to be too high for private investors to off-load their money into Africa's renewables, a relatively new investment portfolio with a lot of uncertainties. German Parliament State Secretary Thomas Silberhorn says the highest risk in Africa is politically related.""It's not about economic risks alone, but also political risks,"" said Silberhorn. ""You don't need to convince German investors about solar energy because they already know that it works, what they need is reliability on the political environment and sustainability of their investments.""Silberhorn, who gave an example of a multi-million-dollar project in Kenya currently on hold due to political interference, added that ways to reduce political risks should be devised for Africa to benefit from private sector investments in renewables.But even as risk factors abound, World Bank's Tuck believes there is hope for Africa, citing Zambia, where record cheap solar energy has been recorded.""Through a competitive bidding process, we have in Zambia under the Bank's 'Scaling Solar' program, recorded the cheapest price at 6.02 cents per KWh,"" she said, heralding it as a model to follow in de-risking climate investments for Africa's growth.And in keeping with the objective of universal energy for all, experts note the need to ensure that the end users are not exploited at the expense of investors.""While the state should not interfere in this business model to work, modalities have to be put in place to ensure that the people for which energy is needed, afford it, otherwise, the project becomes useless,"" said MASEN's Bakkaoury.Following up on this key aspect and responding to the political risk question, Simon Ngure of KenGen Kenya proposes a key principle to minimise political interference - involvement of the local communities.""If you involve the local communities from the onset, regardless of whether governments change, the projects succeed because the people will have seen the benefits already,"" said Ngure, who also noted policy restructuring as another key component to de-risk climate investments.Agreed that de-risking investment is a crucial component, small grants are another issue that the African Union Commission's implementing Agency, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), believes could unlock the continent's challenge of access to climate financing.NEPAD Director of Programmes Estherine Fotabong told IPS that it was for this reason that the agency established the NEPAD Climate Change Fund to strengthen the resilience of African countries by building national, sub-regional and continental capacity.""One of the objectives of the fund is to support concrete action for communities on the ground, but most importantly, to help with capacity building of member states to be able to leverage financing from complicated climate financial regimes,"" said Fotabong, citing ECOWAS which she said used the funding to leverage financing from the Green Climate Fund, one of the financing regimes under the UNFCCC.\l"

Jacob Zuma, President of Republic of South Africa","July 11, 2016 Monday","South African Official News","Introduction1. On 11 July 2016, His Excellency, President Francois Hollande of the French Republic, hosted his counterpart, His Excellency President Jacob Zuma of the Republic of South Africa, on a State Visit to France.2. On the occasion of this State Visit, the two Presidents reaffirmed the importance they attach to the relationship between their two countries, structured by a strategic partnership encompassing political, economic, social and defence matters. France and South Africa have common interests and share values, including the promotion of peace and security, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and sustainable development.Bilateral relations are rich and cover a wide variety of fields, especially in education and training, environment, health, transport, energy, research and science, arts and culture.3. President Zuma's visit precedes the centenary commemoration of the South African engagement in the First World War on French territory and the transformation of the Delville Wood Memorial to honour all South Africans, irrespective of race, who perished in the war. Tribute will be paid to their sacrifice and courage at the South African War Memorial of Delville Wood, in France, on 12th July 2016.Economy and Development, Transport and Energy5. France and South Africa recall the importance of their cooperation in the rail sector, materialised by the signing of a bilateral agreement on transport in June 2015, as well as the implementation of the Alstom Gibela-Prasa contract for the supply of rolling stock, which will create more than 30 000 industrial jobs and stimulate localisation in the field of rail transport. 6. France and South Africa place great importance on cooperation in the energy field within their strategic partnership, as exemplified by the agreement on cooperation in the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy signed in October 2014.7. Following the COP17/CMP7 and the COP21/CMP11, they give special attention to the development of a sustainable energy mix encompassing renewable and nuclear energies to reduce carbon emissions. In this respect, the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) have partnered to finance a new ""green credit l"
"COP22","South.Africa","COP22_South.Africa73","No Climate Justice Without Gender Justice - the Marrakech Pact","November 15, 2016","Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)","The historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change last year is a breakthrough commitment to respect, promote and consider gender equality and women's empowerment obligations while taking climate change action. It also committed to gender-responsive adaptation and capacity building. A year later, with the Agreement entered into force on 4 November, vigorous efforts are being made at COP 22 in Marrakech to make sure that gender equality is systematically integrated into all aspects of the implementation of the Agreement.Both gender equality and climate change champions around the globe are meeting here in Marrakesh to transform the climate change agenda into one that recognizes the rights, priorities and capacities of women and girls and harnesses their talent and leadership for effective climate proofing and response.Yesterday, on 14 November 2016, Parties adopted a decision on gender and climate change which extends the 2014 Lima Work Programme on Gender. The decision is far-reaching in that, for the first time, climate decision-makers supported the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in all areas of work of the Convention -- mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, loss and damage. Now, it is incumbent upon Parties to register in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) commitments to promote gender equality and women's empowerment.A breakthrough in operationalizing gender-responsive climate policy and action was achieved, as the decision mandates the development of a gender action plan that will propose priority areas and concrete activities for gender-responsive climate action across the various work areas of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The decision also strengthens efforts to promote the participation of women in the UNFCCC process, including in bodies established under the Convention. It enhances accountability by requesting regular reporting from constituted bodies and financial mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on how they are working to promote gender equality in their work.The global agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and arrest global warming is about more than just tackling climate change. Of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SDG-13 ""Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"" is closely linked to SDG-5 ""Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"", recognizing gender equality both as a means and an end to effective climate action is a must. Moreover, the co-benefits of climate action and gender equality also positively and simultaneously address other SDGs - on poverty eradication, health, education, economic growth, sustainable energy, water and sanitation, full and productive employment and decent work, sustainable cities, just and peaceful societies, among others. For example, UN Women launched its Global Flagship Programme on Women's Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Energy in partnership with the Government of India, the Department for International Development DFID of the UK and UNEP, which has a benefit multiplier effect. When linking efforts to achieve gender equality to climate action, we can effectively respond to the tragedy of climate change by helping to mitigate impacts and build resilient, inclusive societies.The impacts of climate change range from health threats, resources constraints, loss of livelihoods, displacement, forced migration and conflicts, energy, income and time poverty and food insecurity to reduced access to infrastructure and essential services. They all have disproportionate impacts on women and girls. Climate change impacts also exacerbate the existing inequalities, discrimination, heavy burden of care and domestic work and violence that women face in their daily lives. Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, for example, the inadequate sanitary facilities and lighting in the overcrowded camps contributed to the high instances of night attacks on women. The hardship and suffering for women and girls walking millions of miles for endless of hours to fetch water, fuel and food in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia is unconscionable and has a high opportunity cost to them and to society and the economy.Even without much support and validation, women have been on the front l"

"COP24","Hong.Kong","COP24_Hong.Kong1","Hong Kong falls 78 per cent short of 2030 carbon emissions target - study","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","Hong Kong Free Press","Hong Kong has fallen\~78 per cent short of the 2030 carbon emissions target set by C40 Cities for\~high emitting cities, a study by NGO CarbonCare InnoLab has suggested. Hong Kong is set to reduce its carbon emissions by 3.3 to 3.8 tonnes per capita by 2030, according to the\~Environment Bureau\' s  HYPERLINK Climate Change Action Plan 2030+ File photo: Citizen News. C40 Cities is an organisation of 96 major cities worldwide. It coordinates climate change activities based on the 2015 United Nations\' \~Paris Agreement to cut global greenhouse gas emissions between all nations, apart from Syria and Nicaragua. CarbonCare InnoLab released its report Paris Watch \- Hong Kong Climate Action Report \~on Tuesday. It examines the city\' s current environmental state and future targets against five other major Asian cities from the C40 Cities alliance. They include Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul, Shenzhen and Guangzhou \- chosen for their similar size, developmental status or coastal locations. Photo: CarbonCare InnoLab. The NGO said that HYPERLINK https://hongkongfp.com/2015/11/30/hongkongers-join-global-climate-march-ahead-of-paris-talks/ Hong Kong is trailing behind its counterpart cities in\~renewable energy, energy efficiency, transitioning to electric mobility, and curbing greenhouse gas emissions.  The Paris Agreement targets should be seen as an opportunity, not a burden, Albert Lai, Senior Advisor to CarbonCare InnoLab, said. He added that  doing badly on climate change will certainly mean Hong Kong will do badly at business and in other social aspects: from not being ready for climate-related business disruption, to having a poor international reputation. The findings come as representatives from 195 countries gather in\~Katowice, Poland, for the start of the United Nations \' climate change conference , COP24 , on Sunday.\~Attending parties are set to discuss details of the Paris climate accord, which aims to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celcius and to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celcius.

Hong Kong is not on track in terms of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 in line with the recommendation in the latest [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] 1.5 [degrees Celcius] report. There can be no exceptionalism for a city as prosperous as Hong Kong , said John Sayer, project lead of CarbonCare InnoLab.  The accelerating rate of global warming requires high consumption cities like Hong Kong\' s leaders to double up ambition level in fulfilling the Paris Agreement. The\~Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its  1.5 degrees Celcius report to the United Nations in October, which provided governments with a guide for tackling climate change. \"
"COP24","Hong.Kong","COP24_Hong.Kong2","If we don't act on climate change, we'll soon be up to our necks in hot water","December 8, 2018 Saturday","Hong Kong Free Press","The boiling frog fable is a well-known metaphor to describe the unwillingness of people to act in the face of gradually approaching threats. Although there appears to be little truth in the legend that a frog will remain in water as the temperature gradually rises to the boiling point, the analogy has taken hold and has been applied to many cases of human resistance to change. The frog metaphor seems particularly apt this week as delegates meet in Poland at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 24 . Air pollution in Beijing. Photo: Kentaro Iemoto via Flickr. Given the magnitude of the threat to our very existence, one might have expected that these delegates would have devised policies, or at the very least, significant incentives, during the past 23 years of conferences to make a real dent in the rise of atmospheric pollutants, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Alas, it is very unlikely that anyone here in Hong Kong has been forced to alter their lifestyle to the extent that their actions would have made a noticeable reduction in their contribution to factors that lead to global warming. In other words, although efforts such as the climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 are laudable, we observe virtually no change in people\' s behaviour to suggest we have an impending catastrophe the likes of which has never experienced before, and life on the planet itself has experienced only five times in the last few billion years. I speak of the  sixth extinction, a term that has recently entered the vernacular. COP21 participants in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Photo: Wikicommons. For example, as I enter my workplace, I see students taking the lift to go up or down one or two floors, using a tiny sip of electricity that, here in Hong Kong, is mostly generated by burning fossil fuels. Although I have never asked students about this behaviour and other similar types, such as casually opening a window in summer when the air-conditioning is too cool, or not bringing their own mug to the coffee shop, I feel certain the last thought on their minds is their incremental contribution to climate change and our approaching crisis. At these times, the frog analogy looms large. It also looms large when I observe the local diet, which is largely carnivorous. It is said that the single most effective thing any individual can do to combat global warming is to stop, or at least reduce, their consumption of meat. This is because raising cows, pigs and chickens is such an inefficient way of producing calories, and also because livestock belch prodigious amounts of methane, a damaging greenhouse gas. Instead, on almost every restaurant menu, or on every celebratory occasion, there are meals centred around meat or seafood, with low-carbon-footprint vegetables only as decorations. And let\' s not forget about those air-freighted tomatoes and blueberries in our supermarkets, wrapped in double plastic from distant destinations, that come at a carbon footprint price fifty times greater than produce arriving by sea. Photo: Luca Ricci/Facebook. At the level of society as a whole, our government has shown little interest in the big picture. Sure, there are public service announcements telling us to turn off the lights and avoid overusing the air-conditioner, but such efforts are laughably minuscule in their potential impact compared with the damage done by mega-projects like the just-completed longest sea bridge in the world. I have yet to see any serious mention of the environmental effects from the construction of this bridge. Never mind those few woeful dolphins that are destined for extinction anyway. But rather, pay heed to the unimaginable amounts of concrete and steel that were used in the bridge\' s construction. Converting limestone into cement and forging coke and iron into steel are known to be two of the primary producers of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change. And speaking of big projects, the third runway at the airport presently under construction will end up allowing three times the number of takeoffs and landings that existed when the airport opened a mere 20 years ago. Just for the record, a  fuel-efficient A380 aircraft holds over 300,000 litres of fuel. Even on short-haul flights, each passenger is responsible for the burning of hundreds of litres of fuel.

Action is required at all levels beginning with a dedicated subject on sustainability in schools where students learn how to behave and eat in sustainable ways. But most importantly we need to instil in our youth a mindset of environmental responsibility. However, this is obviously not enough because we know that if Hong Kong is the only place willing to sacrifice economic growth for the sake of the planet \- say by not building runways and bridges \- real change on a planetary scale cannot happen. Somehow, at meetings like COP 24 , the authorities need to devise a new strategy that imbues a radical way of thinking among the population of all countries about economic and population growth and the seriousness of our planetary predicament \- a mindset that considers extreme measures such as limits on the number of children a couple can have or taxes on the purchase of meat. Only then can we hope to make real progress. We are now up to our necks in uncomfortably warm 45 degree Celcius water, and the temperature is rising.

What do you have to say to people who have these concerns? Secretary for the Environment: After the COP 21, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, we saw the Paris Agreement. After that, the Hong Kong Government has set up a high level steering committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, to look after mitigation, that means decarbonisation, and also adaptation and resilience. So you are talking about the adaptation. Under the high level steering committee, we have a working group to look after the infrastructures on how to follow the latest global standards and by making reference to the local situation. It will set the latest up-to-date standards for all infrastructures, including reclamation. Under this mechanism, for whatever kind of major infrastructures and development, no matter it is near the sea or on land, they will have to follow the latest climate adaptation standards. Reporter: What about the impact of this project on marine life? How confident are you that the impact would be minimal? Secretary for the Environment: I don't think it is fair for me to comment on that. We have an established procedure, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). It is a process based on scientific and objective data. It is up to the proponents to collect the data, to put forward the proposal and to decide on how they can minimise the environmental impact. Then they have to go through the (EIA) process, which the proposals can be approved or disapproved. Through the process, there are public involvement opportunities. The public can view the assessment and express their opinions. The duty of the Environment Bureau and also the EPD (Environmental Protection Department) is to diligently administer the EIA process.

"COP24","Hong.Kong","COP24_Hong.Kong4","The climate fight's next turning point","August 29, 2018 Wednesday","EJ Insight","Next month, the Global Climate Action Summit - one of the largest international gatherings on climate change the world has seen - will be held in San Francisco. The event, whose theme is ""Take Ambition to the Next Level"", aims to serve as a launchpad for accelerated action that will enable the world to meet the goals set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It is a golden opportunity to make progress in the effort to combat global warming, but it can be seized only with the involvement of all stakeholders. With the Paris climate agreement, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperature to 2\'b0 Celsius - and ideally 1.5\'b0C - above pre-industrial levels. To that end, national governments were tasked with developing their own climate-action plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). But national governments cannot do it alone. Everyone - including those at all levels of government, as well as business leaders, investors, and civil society - must contribute. This calls for a new form of inclusive multilateralism, one that can also be applied to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which complement the Paris agreement's commitments. It is a tall order, but there is plenty of reason for optimism. There is unprecedented global momentum to build a low-carbon, climate-secure future, characterized by a dynamic green economy, a thriving society, and a healthy environment. Globally, renewable power accounted for 70 percent of net additions to power-generating capacity in 2017, according to the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report. Moreover, as part of the Under2 Coalition, over 200 states, regions, and local authorities have committed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Urban centers are also proving their capacity for climate innovation and leadership. New York City has mandated the retrofitting of 14,500 of the city's most polluting buildings. Shenzhen has become the first city in the world with a fully electric bus fleet. Curitiba, Brazil, has introduced a new model of urban food production. And Oslo has created a climate budget to guide financial decision-making. At the business level, more than 700 companies with a total market capitalization of over US$16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments, according to the We Mean Business Coalition. And 289 investors, holding nearly US$30 trillion in assets, have signed on to Climate 100+, a five-year initiative to engage with the world's largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change, curb emissions, and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures. As a result, global green bond issuance could reach US$300 billion this year. Yet we are far from being in the clear. Scientists agree that global carbon dioxide emissions must reach a turning point in 2020 if we are to achieve carbon neutrality (with emissions low enough to be safely absorbed by forests, soils, and other natural systems) by mid-century. So far, nearly 50 countries have or may have reached their emissions peaks, and more may soon join their ranks. This is progress, but it is not enough. In fact, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are still accumulating at a rate that will soon take us well above the 1.5\'b0C threshold, beyond which some of the worst effects of climate change cannot be staved off. Extreme weather already is becoming more common, as exemplified by record-high temperatures worldwide this year. On current trends, average global temperatures could well rise by 3\'b0C, imperiling vital natural systems like coral reefs, rainforests, and the polar regions. All relevant stakeholders need to strengthen their climate commitments. To kick-start that process, the Global Climate Action Summit and its partners have issued a wide array of new challenges, including zero-waste goals in cities, a target of 500 companies adopting science-based targets, and initiatives to accelerate uptake of zero-emission vehicles. Such efforts would not just protect our environment; they would also boost our economies. A recent report by the New Climate Economy suggests that, in transportation alone, a low-carbon transition would create 23 million jobs worldwide annually. Perhaps more important, a show of climate-action ambition from leaders across sectors would likely inspire national governments to increase their own NDCs ahead of this December's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, where governments will finalize the implementation guidelines of the Paris agreement. Acting alone can be difficult. Acting in concert can inspire and enable all participants to do more. And if we are to leave a healthy planet to future generations, more is what we need.

""The world has turned a corner and we must now deliver and show that promises made will be promises kept,"" he writes.He says that the main ambition of Cop26 was to preserve the 2015 Paris agreement, when countries agreed to limit global temperature rises to below 2C and try to keep them under 1.5C.""Our main ambition for Cop26 was to keep it alive, and we have done so,"" he writes. ""Yet this is a fragile win. And it will only endure if countries honour their commitments and take rapid action to deliver on the promises they have made. That is why I am absolutely committed to continuing to work with our partners around the world in 2022 to ensure that the Glasgow Climate Pact is honoured."" He adds: ""Our Cop26 achievements will come to nothing if we do not deliver on them.""Luke Murphy, the think tank's associate director for energy, climate, housing and infrastructure, said: ""We are in the grip of multiple crises with the costof-living crisis set to push millions into poverty, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which is also inflicting wider humanitarian and security consequences.

Our COP26 achievements will come to nothing if we do not deliver on them,"" he wrote in the journal Progressive Review.""It is several months since Glasgow and we must build on and protect the integrity of the Glasgow Climate Pact by showing that, collectively, the world is serious about delivering on the commitments made.""We must now deliver and show that promises made will be promises kept,"" he wrote.The summit is viewed by many campaigners as disappointing for not going much further, while defenders have said it achieved as much as could reasonably be expected at a single meeting.Either way, it is extremely important to deliver what was agreed if the world is to have any chance of preventing catastrophic climate change, experts said.The UK was the first major industrialised nation in the world to pledge to become carbon neutral, which it has promised to do by 2050.And it has made some of the steepest cuts to carbon emissions on the planet in recent decades. However, experts have said meeting its climate targets will be extremely difficult without dramatic action to accelerate reductions in carbon emissions - for example by ramping up renewable energy production.The clean electricity supply the UK needs by 2030 to meet its climate targets requires capacity of 45GW of offshore wind, 35GW of onshore wind and 45GW of solar. Currently there is 11GW of offshore wind, 14GW of onshore and less than 14GW of solar.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK11","E-MOBILITY SPOTLIGHT: Europe likely to meet COP26 zero-emission vehicle targets by 2035","April 26, 2022 Tuesday 4:16 PM GMT","ICIS Energy News","LONDON (ICIS)--European countries are on track to achieving the COP26 commitment to transition to 100% zero-emission car and van sales by 2035, according to the ICIS long-term electric vehicles (EV) forecast. This is largely due to the assumption that the proposal to increase the stringency of CO2 emission standards under the 'fit for 55' package in the EU, which allows only zero-emission light duty vehicles from 2035, will be passed, implemented and met. The transition is expected to support an increase in power demand from the transport sector in Europe over the coming years. ICIS LONG-TERM EV FORECAST According to the ICIS long-term EV forecast, by the end of the year only 1.2% of the total passenger cars in circulation within the 27 EU member states (EU-27) - amounting to over 248m - will be a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV). ZEVs include battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen. By 2030, the share of ZEVs registered within EU-27 is forecast to increase to 10%, before rising further to 27% in 2035. ZEVs are expected to account for over 48% of the total stock of passenger cars within EU-27 by 2040. When the UK is added to the EU-27 group (EU-27+UK), ZEVs are anticipated to account for 11% of all passenger cars registered in 2030. The share of ZEVs in EU-27+UK is later forecast to account for 28% of the passenger car stack in 2035, before representing half of the total vehicle stock in 2040. PATH TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES Plans of ending sales of cars with internal combustion engines (ICE), as well as promoting the sale of zero-emission cars, vary widely across Europe. Norway is the most ambitious European country, with plans to end petrol and diesel engine vehicles sales by 2025 and all new cars sales being ZEV at the same time. Three European countries - Austria, Germany and the Netherlands - have explicitly targeted ZEV sales only by 2030. The UK seeks this goal by 2035. Countries such as Greece and Slovenia meanwhile have targeted a ban on ICE sales by 2030, without setting a ZEV-explicit target. This means plug-in hybrid electric vehicles - which have a petrol or diesel engine alongside an electric motor - will still be allowed from 2030 onwards. Financial incentives such as tax benefits, purchase subsidy and free parking are important motivators for increasing growth in ZEVs, however a key differentiator is the availability of public charging infrastructure, said Man Yiu Tse, senior analyst at ICIS. ""A key challenge is to quickly build up charging infrastructure, especially for central and eastern Europe,"" added Tse. GROWING EV POWER DEMAND ICIS Long-Term Power Analytics modelling forecasts European transport demand - which is largely EV driven - to increase from 34.4TWH in 2022 to 156TWh by 2030. Demand for transport is later expected to reach 223.5TWh in 2035, before exceeding 288TWh by 2040. Its impact on European wholesale power prices will depend on the pace at which renewable capacity can be developed, allowing the increasing demand to be met at cheaper costs. EV PROPOSAL AND DECLARATION In July 2021, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal to set more ambitious 2030 targets for reducing the CO2 emissions of new cars and vans, allowing only zero-emission vehicles from 2035. Later in November, the COP26 declaration on zero emission cars and vans was launched during transport day at in Scotland. The declaration is a commitment to work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. Signatories include 17 European countries - excluding Germany and France - and other national governments, alongside regions, vehicle manufacturers, businesses, investors and civil society.

That's a strategy for exhaustion.Chris Stark""If we can move more quickly to get ourselves off that, we'll be more energy secure and we'll be helping the environment.""That was basically the message at Cop26, and of course it feels like a long time ago now, but all of that still holds.He added: ""It's not really a credible strategy to just keep reminding people about climate change and hope that they do something about it. That's a strategy for exhaustion.""What we need to be focused on is the changes that deliver these targets. That will cut carbon in the economy and have the benefit I know those changes can have to people living in this country."" Professor Iain Gillespie, chairman of the Dundee Climate Leadership Group, pointed to Dundee's climate efforts as being a factor in the city being chosen as the only Scottish location to feature on the tour.Prof Gillespie said: ""There's no city in Europe that's done as much as we have to roll out electric-powered vehicles, from the council, from the universities, from business, across the board - the charging points, the infrastructure we've got in place.""We do it at a scale which is big enough to be exportable, big enough for the climate change committee to learn from, but still at a manageable scale.""We're not a huge metropolitan centre, but we are a centre. We can operate at a scale that we can control. That's what's brought them here.""He added: ""We remain a city that's in transition. One of the things that we're in transition about is dealing with some of the areas of social deprivation.""We have a great number of our citizens living in old tenement buildings that need to be retrofitted in order to deliver on our net zero targets. We have a lot of people living in fuel poverty.""So that idea of transformation from fossil fuel heating to a future of zero-carbon heating is one that's really, really apt here in Dundee.""ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

Wasn't last autumn's conflab billed as ""the world's best last chance to get runaway climate change under control""? Not only that: to take ""immediate action to end the fossil fuel era"".Sadly, political wishful thinking has since had a nasty brush with Realpolitik in the shape of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The upshot? The fossil fuel era seems to be very much alive and kicking, what with consumers horribly exposed to soaring oil and gas prices. To boot, Europe has been forced to confront an uncomfortable truth: that whatever the sanctions on Russia, it's so addicted to Kremlin oil and gas that the Putin war machine is still raking in about $1 billion a day.Yes, Britain is far less dependent on Russian energy than its EU neighbours, not least Germany, with only 8 per cent of UK oil and 4 per cent of gas coming from Russia. But you can see why UK politicians are no longer vilifying North Sea production. And not least with Boris Johnson pledging to phase out Russian oil, though not gas, imports by the end of the year. The PM is also due to unveil a new UK ""energy supply strategy"", prioritising security and self-sufficiency: the same logic behind his zeal for nuclear power.There's been quite a shift in political mood. And it's proved the cue for Shell to resurrect its plans to develop the Jackdaw gas field, about 155 miles east of Aberdeen, that regulators rejected last year: one it says could produce 6.5 per cent ofUK gas output. Shell also kept its 30 per cent stake in the Cambo oil field project off the Shetland islands: one majority owned by Siccar Point Energy. It could yet be developed.Meantime, the Oil & Gas Authority - now cheesily renamed the North Sea Transition Authority - is planning this year to hold the first oil and gas licensing round since 2020. There's political support for it, too, what with the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, tweeting: ""The UK must back North Sea oil and gas while we transition to cheap, clean power.""Pragmatism is thankfully back on the agenda. But does that mean the government is watering down its Cop26Even so, one thing is missing from the government's post-Ukraine reassessment of the North Sea: a ministerial campaign to promote energy efficiency. There'd be less need to drill or import if consumers and businesses were incentivised to cut energy use. And not just via home insulation and heat pumps. The International Energy Agency last week proposed ten ""emergency measures"" including 10km per hour cuts on driving speed limits to reduce fuel usage, cheaper public transport fares and car-free Sundays for city centres. If the PM wants to maintain Cop26 credibility, he should drill into some of that.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

The conference was a continuation of the high-level roundtable that the British Embassy held in March 2021 in Ashgabat, ahead of the COP26.Building on the momentum and direction set out at COP26, representatives discussed the best ways to deliver stronger sectoral action to accelerate Turkmenistan\' s transition to a low-carbon, more resource-efficient and sustainable economy.Those attending the event included representatives of the ministries of Turkmenistan, the UN agencies, foreign diplomatic missions, international organisations and development partners, financial institutions, university students and others. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan moderated the event.The Turkmen Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection announced that the country\' s next set of climate change plans would soon be submitted to the UN. These plans include projects to reduce both carbon dioxide and methane emissions.UN agencies pledged to continue working with Turkmenistan to address challenges of mapping emissions, changing legislation, provide technical assistance and support education.Nick Bridge, the British Foreign Secretary\' s Special Representative for Climate Change, stressed the need to go clean and green and deliver on our promises faster. Kenan Poleo, the UK\' s Trade Commissioner for Central Asia, highlighted that change can support growth \- in the last 30 years the UK has cut emissions by 44% while growing its economy 78%.The British Ambassador, Lucia Wilde, reaffirmed the Embassy\' s commitment to support both the implementation of climate change policies and support for Turkmenistan to introduce more green energy technologies.Star speakers at the conference were youth representatives who talked of the need for action to ensure their future health, prosperity and well-being.Participants identified joint priorities and new areas of climate cooperation in the run-up to COP27. Climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions negatively affects the health and well-being of people and countries around the world. As such, experts at the event agreed that it is important to learn from each other and continue a productive dialogue and exchange of professional experience in this important area.At the end of the conference, experts and participants thanked the organisers and highlighted how important it was to continue these discussions in order to help the transition of Turkmenistan to a green economy.Share this page HYPERLINK https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fnews%2Fbritish-embassy-ashgabat-hosts-a-cop26-follow-up-conference-march-2022 Share on Facebook   HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fnews%2Fbritish-embassy-ashgabat-hosts-a-cop26-follow-up-conference-march-2022&text=British%20Embassy%20Ashgabat%20hosts%20a%20COP26%20follow-up%20conference%2C%20March%202022 Share on Twitter Published 28 March 2022Language:\~ENGLISH\l"

Adopted in 2016, the Paris Agreement aims to hold an increase in global average temperature to below 3.6\'b0F (2\'b0C) and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 2.7\'b0F (1.5\'b0C). Climate pledges made at COP26 could keep warming to just below 3.6\'baF, but only if all commitments are implemented as proposed, the scientists say. However, the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement - to keep warming to 2.7\'b0F (1.5\'b0C) or below - has only a 6-10 per cent chance of being achieved, they say. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and methane is seen as key to achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement and limiting climate change. WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT? The Paris Agreement, first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.It hopes to hold the global average temperature increase to below 2\'b0C (3.6\'baF) £nd pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F)'.It seems the more ambitious goal of restricting global warming to 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F) may be more important than ever, according to research that claims 25 per cent of the world could see a significant increase in drier conditions. Source: European Commission Hitting the Paris targets is seen as key to averting a planetary catastrophe, leading to devastation in the form of frequent climate disasters and fatalities. The new report has been led by researchers at the University of Melbourne in Australia and the International Energy Agency in Paris, France.'Our results provide a reason to be optimistic: warming could be limited to 2\'b0C [3.6\'baF] or just below, if the pledges on the table are implemented in full and on time,' they say in their paper, published today in Nature.'Peaking of global GHG emissions could be achieved this decade. But our results also provide a sobering assessment of how far current pledges are from limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C [2.7\'b0F].'Commitments made so far, especially for this decade, fall far short of what is required to limit temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C. 'Any delay in reversing the upward trend of emissions, phasing out the unabated use of fossil fuels and developing sustainable, additional and permanent negative-emissions options will put this target out of reach.' In the five years preceding the 2021 COP26 meeting, 153 parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement submitted new or updated climate mitigation goals for 2030, and 75 parties provided longer-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Net zero refers to achieving an overall balance between emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere.Net-zero organisations should be actively reducing their emissions aligned to a 1.5 C science-based target in l"
"COP26","UK","COP26_UK25","Royal Bank of Scotland post-COP26 podcast","March 1, 2022 Tuesday","Scotsman","In the latest episode of podcast series A Greener World Needs A Plan, fashion pioneer Dr Antoinette Fionda-Douglas says the event could be a real catalyst for change.The founder of Beira, which buys discarded materials from the luxury fashion industry and produces limited edition and long-lasting womenswear, says:  For me, COP26 was fantastic and I know many other businesses were really inspired by it.  It was brilliant to see fantastic green companies there learning from each other - speaking to like-minded sustainable businesses that are pushing the boundaries and making a difference. I think that's the biggest legacy from COP26. Martin Valenti, Director for NetZero at South of Scotland Enterprise, says:  Through those two weeks, it was business after business after business, 90% of them SMEs, saying \' I'm all over this agenda\' . However, there were warnings that there is still a long way to go - but that action is needed now.Darren Pirie, Royal Bank of Scotland\' s Enterprise & Climate Propositions & Engagement Lead, says:  I think [COP26] was a really good focal point to bring it all together and I'm very proud of the role the bank played. It's just the starting point, though. Martin Valenti stresses that action must be taken now, not some unspecified point in the future:  I can't stress enough to businesses: Don\' t kick this into the long grass. The important thing, for banks and others, is to convince people tomorrow is today. Net zero and the just transition aren\' t soundbites; these are real business opportunities. To support small businesses to become greener, the Royal Bank, part of NatWest Group, launched new green loans and green asset finance in February.The new financial products help fund green activities or green assets, Darren Pirie explains:  There is appetite in the marketplace for something that helps our customers highlight their commitment to the green agenda. Examples could be simple things like solar panels, an electric vehicle, or retrofitting an old building to improve its energy efficiency. Businesses are looking to make those changes [as] demonstrable examples of where they're making their business greener and living up to the net zero ambition. Our loans support those types of activities. Mr Pirie says this is part of a wider package of support for small businesses, starting with tools to help them understand their environmental impact:  At that point, we look at how we help our customers understand the action plan - what are the 2, 3, 10 key things they could do to transition to a better place on their emissions or environmental impact? Antoinette Fionda-Douglas welcomes the green loans, saying:  Smaller, sustainable businesses do need help. We're trying to do things differently and often, we're working against the status quo. That little extra help can make the difference. However, she worries the public is still uncertain just what sustainability means:  65% of people are saying \' Yeah, we want to be more sustainable\' . But I don't really think people know what sustainable is. I think there's a lack of general education about what that means in terms of the fashion industry, and a lot of greenwashing. We're used to really cheap, unsustainable prices for fashion products. And it's wrong - somebody somewhere is paying for that. There's 100-150 billion new garments made every year, and most of that is going to waste, in landfills. It's unsustainable in so many ways. Ms Fionda-Douglas says businesses have to act - and stresses that greener can be cheaper:  Small businesses sometimes think being sustainable is more expensive, but for us, it definitely hasn't been. We've sought the most sustainable solution to every decision we make and 8 times out of 10, that\' s been the cheaper option. Martin Valenti agrees:  When you get into discussions with small businesses, it\' s about saving energy, saving money. It's about not wasting resources, and about deploying new ideas. Mr Valenti says COP26 helped make people realise that it\' s not all about either-or choices. Part of the legacy for COP26 is an awakening, he explains.  We had 25 COPS before and 24 failed because we said you can have an economic outcome or an environmental one, but you can't have both. But we know that you can have your cake and eat it in Scotland. Our mindset is \' Hope mobilises, fear paralyses\' . We will not be fearful of climate change. We will be respectful of the challenge, but we'll be relentless in our pursuit to find solutions. If you get a narrative like that, people say \' Count me in\' . And Mr Valenti thinks a generational shift means we will stay firmly on the green path:  Younger people are far more savvy in this space,more hungry to see action. People used to say, \' Somebody should do something about climate change\' . What I\' m hearing now is young people going, \' Yeah, me. I'm going to do something about climate change and you're going to get out of my way\' . I like that attitude - the young breed coming through saying you guys have taken it as far as you can - we\' ve got more ideas and we\' re not as scared to take the big risks. Darren Pirie says real success for the Royal Bank\' s green approach would be if it delivers tangible benefits for customers:  We start to look at how we increase the range of financing solutions we can offer, and harness data to provide tailored, personalised support for customers. When that starts to happen holistically across all activities, that's when you can start calling it success.

They haven't'; Leading climate activist warns too many promises made on the banks of the Clyde have stil....","April 17, 2022","The Sunday Post","Vanessa Nakate was in Scotland last year when world leaders insisted nothing was more important than protecting the planet. Today, five months later, Nakate, one of the world's most influential climate change activists, says they still have to prove it.History was supposedly made at Cop26, the United Nations climate change summit, when almost 200 countries signed the Glasgow Climate Pact to limit global warming to below 1.5\'b0C.But Nakate, who has been hailed as Africa's Greta Thunberg, said some countries are already breaking the promises made on the banks of the Clyde.Nakate, who has been named one of the most influential women in the world, played an vital role in Scotland, addressing the delegates and speaking at the most important rallies, but, speaking to The Sunday Post, she admitted the subsequent months have failed to deliver the action promised in Glasgow.She said: ""We've seen how leaders for a long time have made promises and then haven't fulfilled those promises.""After Cop26, I hoped the leaders would prove us wrong by making the right decisions for the people and the planet. But so far they haven't proved us wrong.""So far the leaders have not lived up to their promises.""But Nakate, who, like Thunberg, began her climate activism with lone demonstrations, hers taking place outside the parliament in Uganda, urged the millions of people inspired by Cop26 to continue fighting the save the planet.She said: ""We need to keep speaking truth to power and we need to keep communicating the science, the climate crisis and the loss and damage that is already happening in so many countries in the global south.Among the countries which have broken their promises is Britain, which gave permission for a huge expansion to a colliery in Wales despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Cop26 pledge to ""consign coal power to history"".Meanwhile, plans for the Cambo oilfield off Shetland that seemed to be in doubt are back on the table as the Ukraine crisis threatens energy markets. After insisting it was a matter for the UK Government, Nicola Sturgeon finally signalled she would be opposed to the development. If approved, it is expected to produce oil and gas until 2050, the year by which Britain has pledged to be carbon neutral.Nakate said: ""My thoughts about Cambo are the same as they are for all new fossil fuel projects. There is no room for the fossil fuel industry if we want to have a sustainable world. We cannot eat coal, we cannot drink oil and we cannot breathe gas.""We've seen how much harm the extraction of fossil fuels has done to the planet. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has made it very clear that if we want to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C we cannot have any new fossil fuel developments.""Nakate urged the First Minister, whom she met on the opening day of the Cop26 summit, to renew her opposition to the Cambo oil field.She said: ""My message to Nicola Sturgeon would be to continue standing with us, especially when it comes to the Cambo oil field. She has said that Cambo should not be given the green light, and she should continue doing that. We need her to keep saying that there is no need to have more fossil fuel development.""Earlier this month Boris Johnson announced plans to build more nuclear power stations and maximise oil and gas reserves to help the UK reduce its dependence on Russian energy in the wake of the war in Ukraine. But Nakate said: ""We must make leaders understand that our solutions are in renewable energy, in clean energy. Nuclear power stations are not a solution if we want to limit global temperatures and protect people from catastrophe.""Energy bills are already doubling for many households in the UK in an escalating cost of living crisis, but they could rise even further if the war in Ukraine continues to disrupt gas supplies. Nakate said: ""The increasing profits that fossil fuel companies are making at the expense of people having to pay extremely high bills should show us that this is an industry that only cares for the benefit of a small group of people who are accumulating massive wealth.""Nakate spoke at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi last month, attended by ministers including the UK's Zac Goldsmith. She said: ""I asked them whether they thought it was necessary to support the people who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis.""I asked them to give me a thumbs up if they agreed and many of them did. But when I asked as a follow up question whether their countries would commit to providing money and funding loss and damage for those countries there was hesitancy.""It is clear there is a still a gap between the promises made and the action taken. It is the actions that follow that let us down.""Cop26 ended with countries signing a watered-down agreement to accelerate action on climate this decade.The deal's supporters said that it kept alive the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises above preindustrial levels to 1.5\'b0C.But Nakate said: ""One of the things I really remember about Cop26 was that while on the inside there was this kind of celebration the world was finally heading in the right direction, there was frustration from the young about what was happening and the decisions being made.""As we were coming to the end of , the Climate Action Tracker showed that the world was on track for 2.4\'b0C of warming regardless of the pledges that had been made.""That is a death sentence for so many communities, especially in the global south. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report projects that 700 million Africans will be displaced because of drought.Cop26, meeting activists from different parts of the world. It's always good to know that you're not doing this work alone and that this is a global movement. This is a global fight.""She added: ""I don't want to call a failure because even amidst all those disappointments there was this people power that continued to organise and mobilise.""To me, it was more of a missed moment, a missed opportunity to make things right. But we continue to fight again. Even when there seems to be no hope, we remain hopeful. We continue to build momentum as we head towards Cop27 in Egypt later this year.""Nakate was inspired as a teenager by Greta Thunberg to start her own climate movement in Uganda, after becoming concerned about rising temperatures in her country caused by global warming.She held her first climate strikes in 2019 outside the gates of the Ugandan parliament, often on her own, to draw attention to climate change and urge her government to take action.The same year she was invited to her first invitation to a climate conference, the UN's Climate Action Summit in New York.But she was left devastated when news agency AP cropped her out of a photo of her and four other climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2020.Nakate was the only black person in the image, and in an emotional video posted on social media she said that for the first time in her life she ""understood the definition of the word racism"".The event inspired the title for her new book, A Bigger Picture while her campaigning saw her named as one of the world's 100 most inspiring and influential women by the BBC and appear on the cover of Time magazine.She is now inspiring a new generation of climate activists in Uganda with a project to install solar panels and eco-friendly cook stoves in schools.She said: ""It gives us opportunities to carry out climate education with the students so they also know how much power they have to transform this world.""\l"

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK32","Farming: COP26 targets for cutting methane can be met, report says","April 26, 2022 Tuesday","Scotsman","That was the claim made yesterday as a new report was published by the Ruminant Health and Welfare Group which pointed out that such a reduction could be made by countering the effects of poor health, ill thrift and lowered fertility. All the major reports have recommended that livestock health status acts as a key constraint on efficient livestock production, said the report\' s author, Dr Philip Skuce of Edinburgh\' s Mordeun research centre.Putting production losses due to morbidity and mortality at close to 20 per cent, he said that these accrued not only from large-scale outbreaks of exotic diseases but also from underlying endemic diseases, including worm infestations which could lead to death, poor daily liveweight gain, low food conversion efficiency, abortion and reduced milk yields.And Skuce said that the report detailed available interventions for priority health and welfare conditions to provide a starting point for discussions between farmers and vets about identifying disease goals with methane reductions in mind.However chair of the Ruminant Health and Welfare Group, Borders farmer, Nigel Miller, said that while the science had moved on by leaps and bounds in recent times, politicians and policy development had been slow or static \- and warned that urgent action was required if  blunt solutions were to be avoided.Speaking after reports had surfaced indicating that Northern Ireland faced cutting the national cattle herd by 500,000 and the national sheep flock by 700,000 to meet methane reduction commitments, Miller said that making use of science was a far smarter way to address the issue.  It looks like the industry needs to take ownership of the exciting developments which there have been in this field and move things forward before it is too late. But Miller also said that government had to work with the industry and to identify a single carbon auditing tool for the sector to assess the impact of mitigation actions at both individual farm and national levels.This, he claimed meant that while farmers were highly aware of climate change, its impact and the challenge of moving to net zero, they were extremely disadvantaged by the lack of reliable, consistent tools.And he added that carbon calculators should not only deliver a robust basel"

The company is part-owned by the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the US in 2018. En+ confirmed that Barker attended with a pass from Russia's allocation.His resignation followed intense scrutiny of his relationship with the company, including by senior Tory party colleagues, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Share instruments in En+, which is incorporated in Russia, were HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/london-stock-exchange-suspends-trading-in-27-firms-with-strong-links-to-russiasuspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday.The presence of Barker on the list emerged in analysis of lobbying at the summit by Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and Corporate Europe Observatory, three non-government organisations. Barker was ennobled in 2015 by Cameron, after serving for four years as minister of state for climate change. Barker had served as Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle. However, he is not thought to have attended the House of Lords since 2019.A source familiar with the matter said Barker did not participate in, or attend, any official Russian government functions, meetings or receive any briefings at the climate summit.Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, said: ""The Conservatives have serious questions to answer about why it seems one of their peers was allowed to attend Cop26 as part of Russia's party.""Dodds added that ""urgent action"" was required from the Conservatives to remove people from the political party who have links to Putin's regime.Barker had been heavily criticised by Conservative party colleagues and other political parties for his prior involvement with En+. The former Tory minister David Davis said: ""As a matter of law, people like him should be disqualified from holding office in those companies.""Murray Worthy, a gas campaign leader at Global Witness, said: ""Lord Barker has serious questions to answer as to why he was registered to the world's most important climate talks as part of the official Russian delegation. As do the Conservative party, whose government was entrusted to host Cop26 and made a huge fanfare about its importance in reaching the necessary climate action to stop the heating of our planet.""While Barker will step down as chair of the listed company, En+ said on Monday that it was considering carving out a large part of the aluminium business, which included the international business of Rusal, a part-owned subsidiary.The new company would be owned by management and non-Russian investors, and potentially led by Barker, according to a report by Bloomberg News that was referenced by EN+ in its stock market statement.En+, which mainly produces aluminium but also makes significant profits from coal and other commodities, escaped direct sanctions by the US in 2019 through a deal with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) in which Deripaska's stake was reduced to below 45%, and his voting rights were reduced to 35%.Barker received \£36m in pay and bonuses in part as a reward for orchestrating the deal.Deripaska has sought to have the sanctions removed, and has consistently argued that he should not have been designated. A spokesperson for Deripaska said the US sanctions relied on ""baseless accusations"" and ""false claims"".Deripaska has in recent days expressed opposition to war in Ukraine. According to Reuters, Deripaska said: ""We need peace as soon as possible. The whole world will be different after these events and Russia will be different.""A source close to Barker said: ""The heartbreaking situation in Ukraine and the terrible consequences that flow from it are bad enough without now trying to play politics with the climate agenda. ""Lord Barker has a long history of climate activism, and while he stands by his decision to leave En+, he remains very proud of the progress he was able to achieve in helping one of the world's largest producers of low carbon aluminium and hydropower lead the way into the low carbon economy. Pretending that all Russians are bad is, frankly, appalling.""ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

Why should I study for a future that\' s falling apart in front of me, a future that\' s already been destroyed for so many?  The people in power, the people who want me in school right now, are not listening to the science and the people presenting unmistakable evidence this crisis is happening. Masie Wood, 11, from Edinburgh, said she had told her school she would be absent to join the march. We are here today because the Government can\' t be bothered to make sure we don\' t die, she said.  It\' s quite sad really. The protesters marched from the Scottish Parliament to Edinburgh City Chambers on the Royal Mile, as part of a route more than a mile long.Outside St Andrew\' s House, the headquarters of the Scottish Government, Fridays for Future campaigner Sandy Boyd said ministers had  sat around and twiddled their thumbs as our planet burns .The 18-year-old said:  This is why we are out here today. The Scottish Government is failing to protect our futures. Inside that building they are not taking emergency action over the climate crisis. Cora Gibson, 15, told protesters  Westminster fuels the fire, literally, whether its the new Cambo oil field or the cost of living, which crawls up every day, but the wages never do, or it\' s the very climate crisis itself .Caris Baker, 20, also joined the march, and said youngsters were demanding action because they were  terrified for their futures under the current climate policies. There is nothing else we can do apart from getting on streets now and making our voices heard and that\' s why we\' re here today to demand people are put over profit, she said. This is us carving out a space for young voices to be heard because no-one else is going to do it for us, no-one else is going to save us, no-one else is going to give us a space, so that\' s why we\' re here doing that for ourselves. There\' s no age limit to getting involved in this. We\' re trying to engage all the young voices we can because it\' s our future and it\' s our kids\' future. On COP26, she said the biggest delegation was the oil lobby and the action taken on the industry  wasn\' t even close to enough .The Scottish strikes \- also held in Glasgow, Dumfries, Falkirk, Inverness, Stirling and Ullapool \- were among more than 700 protests worldwide as part of the Fridays For Future movement.

In short, climate is a space where national and global interests align, he said.

Volunteers will plant and tend the forests as they grow, as well as monitor the wildlife and measure how much carbon is captured by the trees as they grow.The ""wee forests"" project will form part of the legacy of Cop26 and provide outdoor learning opportunities for schools, ministers say.The first demonstration forest was planted at West Pilton Park in Edinburgh last October. Environment Minister Mairi McAllan said the scheme would help provide access to green spaces and allow people to connect with nature.She said: ""The horrors of the Covid pandemic have changed how many of us view and value nature, and we know people want to spend more time outdoors for the benefits it brings to their mental and physical health.""Wee forests are an ideal way of achieving this, whether as a place for children to play or a quiet spot to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.""This new network of wee forests is a great example of partnership working between the public, private and voluntary sector and is an important legacy of Cop26 when the eyes of the growworld were on Glasgow and the future of our planet.""The initiative will be led by the government agency NatureScot. Its chief executive, Francesca Osowska, said: ""Wee forests are a fantastic way for people to connect with nature close to home.""We're delighted to see our demonstration project being extended to create many more pockets of nature-positive green space across our towns and cities, as a living legacy of Cop26.""Earthwatch Europe CEO Steve Andrews said: ""We are delighted to be working in partnership with NatureScot to expand the Wee Forest movement across Scotland.

Whether you agree with their tactics or not, it is impossible to deny that their actions reflect a shift in the public mood. People are more concerned about climate change than ever before.We know - thanks to a recent YouGov poll - that most Britons surveyed believe in the goals of Cop26The City of London Corporation and the Green Finance Institute hosted the Green Horizon Summit at Cop26, which brought together over 200 speakers. Here private finance tackled the big issues facing our sector in the transition to net zero.The public had enthusiasm for the destination of Cop26, but was sceptical about the journey. Three-quarters of those surveyed say they do not trust world leaders to deliver on their promises.City leaders and businesses must ask themselves an important question: how do we realise this hope, rail against the cynics, and deliver on our promises? This was especially obvious last week, on Earth Day, when the Bureau of Investigative Journalism ranked the world's top financiers of fossil fuel projects and raised concerns over greenwashing.We must show the world the City of London and the UK mean business when it comes to climate change. Cop26Building on this premise, we're hosting the Net Zero Delivery Summit in the City on the 11th and 12th of May to build on the huge momentum we saw in Glasgow and ensure commitments turn into action.The Summit will take place at the halfway point between Cop26 and the upcoming summit in Egypt. It will bring our financial and professional services together to secure London's role as a strategic leader in sustainable finance.We don't want the summit to be a carbon copy of the forum of leaders in Glasgow. Bringing their innovative knowledge with them, our financial services will be joined by business leaders presenting their best ideas for tackling climate change. We will be taking into account the environment in which we're operating: the conflict in Europe, rising geopolitical tensions across the world and increasing fuel and energy prices.There are key challenges ahead. We must ensure finance is mobilised to support the net zero transition in emerging markets, to build climate resilience in developing countries and secure a just transition to net zero. I hope you can join the Summit, which will be live streamed.As I near the end of my term, it is clear to me that leading the fight against climate change will continue to be a top priority for the City of London Corporation. We remain committed to delivering net zero through our Climate Action Strategy, which will help us achieve net zero carbon emissions from our own operations in the next five years.In the clamour of dissenting voices, our message must be clear: what will help us tackle climate change is not fine words but urgent action.\£3 Catherine McGuinness is the policy chair at the City of London CorporationClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

Many will remember that Alok Sharma did shed what looked like a tear - perhaps triggered by the 11th hour weakening of the wording around coal pushed for by China and India, or perhaps because he was over-tired. But should we be all weeping that COP26 did not do more to slow the relentless release of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere? I'm on tenterhooks... what's the answer?The short answer is we won't know for some time. It's not just what happens at a COP that matters, but what happens after in terms of countries honestly delivering on their commitments. Though, as Swedish activist Greta Thunberg might put it, there was a lot of ""blah, blah, blah"" at COP26, on some counts there was progress. Like what?The fact fossil fuels were mentioned at all in the pact, which previously had not been the case. Other positives include the side deal pledging to end deforestation by 2030, and the agreement by 100 countries to slash methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. The conference also reached a deal that will initiate international carbon markets, and, oh yeah, wealthy nations promised to meet the annual target of supplying $100 billion in climate finance by 2023.Hang on, weren't they supposed to do that already?You're not making me feel much better. I heard Thunberg called it a 'global north green-wash festival'. She did. But that doesn't mean these conferences aren't making a difference. Before the Paris agreement, the world was heading for 3.7 degrees warming by 2100 - but after, it was reduced to 2.7 degrees, and with this year's updated targets we're looking at more like 2.4 degrees. Hardly a reason to be cheerful: 2.4 degrees is disastrous. Activist Vanessa Nakate calls it ""a death sentence"". Is that you crying again?

Gas crisis shadows the road from Glasgow to Sharm el-Sheikh","FT.com"," ","While UK climate negotiators were meeting with ministers around the world at the beginning of last week about enacting the green promises in the COP26 Glasgow pact, Britain\' s leaders were defending domestic oil and gas developments and rejecting calls for a windfall tax.The gas crisis and international energy price spikes have increased pressure on the UK COP team led by Alok Sharma, which must hammer out the green deals and rally support for this November\' s COP27 UN climate summit in Sharm el-Skeikh with host nation Egypt. Asked recently about high gas prices and the net zero agenda, Sharma said:  I do not believe the two are connected. To ensure energy security and reduce greenhouse gases, countries must  continue to build out renewables, he said. At the same time, UK energy minister Greg Hands has defended new North Sea oil and gas field projects, while prime minister Boris Johnson rebuffed a windfall tax on bumper oil company profits. It would  clobber the oil and gas companies right now with a tax that would deter investment in gas just when this country needs gas as we transition to green fuel, said Johnson.The UK retains the COP presidency until November\' s formal handover to Egypt, which has appointed foreign minister and career diplomat Sameh Shoukry as HYPERLINK COP27 president.

From pledging to action The commitment, pledges and initiatives to come out of COP26 were extensive. It concludes a year of pathway setting with the launch of UK Government's Net Zero Strategy, HYPERLINK https://www.energyvoice.com/renewables-energy-transition/hydrogen/343348/mixed-reactions-from-energy-chiefs-to-eagerly-awaited-hydrogen-policy/UK hydrogen strategy HYPERLINK https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/310480/north-sea-transition-deal-lays-foundation-for-innovation-investment/North Sea Transition Deal,The policy landscape is fundamental. Scotland has strong policy and the right levers in devolved areas but the electricity market, oil and gas licences and trade to name just three remain with Westminster. Scotland must find a way to accelerate the delivery of the ambition it controls and collaborate closely with London on the rest.Offshore wind is now investable due to policy and strong co-operation. This can happen quickly for emerging technologies with the right dialogue between industry, governments and the market.Corporate responsibility shouldn't be downplayed. Many companies have yet to set net zero targets encompassing consumption related emissions. Big business was very visible at COP26 and the setting of more corporate net zero targets, with robust action plans in the short and medium term, will be an important boost to the transition not to mention valued by the markets. Technology radar Technology will drive the action. Developing and deploying technology at scale will help us achieve climate goals whilst fulfilling energy demand and, if done right, create jobs and export opportunities for Scotland.Some of the technology to make industries low carbon exists today but it is expensive, to the point of making production unprofitable. The International Energy Agency has stated about half of the technology we need to achieve the 2050 reduction targets is still at embryonic or prototype stage.Green hydrogen, which is produced entirely from renewable electricity, has great potential. Scotland has 25% of Europe's wind resource so is well placed to generate the power from offshore wind required for green hydrogen. Coupled with Scotland's oil and gas expertise and growing skills in the wind industry, this new energy market has plenty of opportunity domestically and for export.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is now in our atmosphere at record levels. Not only do we need to take action to reduce our CO2 footprint in our electricity, cars and homes, we need to find a safe way to capture and store the CO2 our industry is producing. Projects like Acorn will use Aberdeen's world-leading oil and gas infrastructure and geology to meet this challenge but it will also be driven by leaps forward in innovative technology.Delivering digital transformation, enabling remotely controlled operations, empowered by data, robotics and autonomous systems will also help industries decarbonise and accelerate the transition. Scottish Government's refreshed Digital Strategy sets a vision that ""Scotland's future will be forged in a digital world"". Invest to progress To maintain momentum, we must invest to progress. COP26 brought a renewed focus on the investment required to reach Net Zero. The HYPERLINK https://www.energyvoice.com/renewables-energy-transition/cop26/361758/sunak-cop26-public-money-climate-change/COP26 green finance summitTo help achieve the ambition of the UK Government's Net Zero strategy, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the 'Glasgow Breakthroughs' which cover five main goals including clean power, zero emission vehicles and affordable renewable and low carbon hydrogen, as well as sustainable agriculture and near-zero emissions steel production. Each 'Breakthrough' will leverage billions of funding from philanthropists, banks and the markets.Energy day at COP26 saw 90 countries and organisations sign up to hasten the end of coal, with coal-dependant countries committing to phase it out. Funding for overseas fossil projects took a hit with 20 countries committing to end finance for these projects, which in theory could free up $8bn a year to be redirected to renewable projects.Investors, businesses, cities and regions joined collective action initiatives aimed at driving economic transformation. Many are more ambitious than Governments. Over 2,000 companies have now committed to develop science-based targets to reduce their emissions, and new guidance for companies to set credible net-zero targets for corporates was released just ahead of COP26.

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK91","COP26 and the mission to save the planet","December 31, 2021","i-Independent Print Ltd","As 2021 rolled around, the UK was under pressure to deliver a successful COP26. The summit had already been delayed by a year because of the pandemic, but it was clear further delays would be unacceptable.Amid street protests and increasingly apocalyptic climate forecasts, UK ministers decided COP26 would have to go ahead in 2021. But it was the US that did much of the heavy lifting on climate diplomacy. First came the inauguration of President Joe Biden, who had promised to make climate action a key tenet of his term in office. Hours after being sworn in, Mr Biden moved to reinstate the US to the Paris Agreement, effectively bringing America back to the table at UN climate talks.This was a huge boost for COP26. As the largest historical polluter, US absence from the UN climate process under Donald Trump had been keenly felt, with annual COPs since 2016 delivering little progress.With the US back and promising to do more, the UK had an opportunity to push other polluters, such as China and India, beyond their comfort zones.Extracting promises of bolder carbon cuts was crucial for a successful COP26. Under the Paris Agreement, struck in 2015, every country had to set a plan, with targets to cut emissions before 2030. But there were no rules on how ambitious countries had to be and the original crop of national climate plans were nowhere near enough to halt dangerous warming.COP26 was to be the first formal chance for countries to come back to the table with bolder promises. But even with the US now on board, and COP26 President Alok Sharma putting in the (air)miles on a punishing schedule of diplomatic visits, it soon became clear this was not going to plan.The trouble was that world leaders had spent a year worrying about little else than Covid. Only 75 countries, representing 30 per cent of global emissions, had submitted new climate plans by the end of 2020. Together the new plans were set to achieve less than one per cent of the emissions reductions needed by the end of the decade, the UN warned in February.""Current levels of climate ambition are very far from putting us on a pathway that will meet our Paris Agreement goals,"" UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa warned at the time.Desperate to build some momentum, President Biden drew up plans for a global summit of world leaders to be held to mark ""Earth Day"" in April.Held back in the days of lockdowns, when even world leaders were forced to Zoom in to meetings, the two-day virtual event suffered some technical glitches but also managed to secure some climate wins. The US promised to halve its emissions before 2030 and to double its annual climate finance contributions, while Japan and Canada also promised to beef up their climate targets.The British PM's own efforts to drive progress ahead of COP26 were less fruitful. Boris Johnson had wanted to make climate change a central focus of his G7 summit, held in Cornwall in June.But activists left disappointed: world leaders pledged to do more to cut emissions and end the use of coal power, but without setting any firm deadl"

The first charge states that he behaved in an aggressive and sexual manner towards the woman, leaned his body in towards her and sat 'in extremely close proximity' to her. The prosecution alleges that his actions placed her in a state of fear and alarm.A second charge, brought under Section 3 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009, alleges that Ennor sexually assaulted the woman by rubbing his leg against her leg and by placing his hands around her waist and compressing it. Trial has been scheduled for August 16.Cop26 took place from October 31 'The officer is currently suspended from duty' to November 12. The meeting, hosted by the UK Government at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, was attended by world leaders including US President Joe Biden.The policing operation was the biggest ever deployment of officers - at a cost thought to be around \£3100 million - and up to 10,000 officers were on duty at any one time, a number Police Scotland said was needed for the safety of delegates, protesters and officers themselves. Many police, including those from visiting forces, were stationed at Ingliston Showground, Edinburgh, and accommodation was arranged for them in towns including in West Lothian.Before they arrived, visiting Cop26 police officers were instructed to follow the 'tone and approach' of their Scottish colleagues.Police Scotland chief constable Iain Livingstone said officers brought from every other UK police force had been sent a recorded message from him and assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins 'demanding' they respect the 'close bond of trust' with the Scottish community and uphold Police Scotland values.But the event wasn't all work and no play for the officers involved. Dozens of off-duty Cop26 officers were snapped paddling in the sea at North Berwick, East Lothian.Yesterday, a Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'The individual is a serving Hampshire Constabulary officer and is currently suspended from duty. We are unable to comment further while criminal proceedings are ongoing.'ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK105","The Times view on Cop26: A Change of Climate","December 27, 2021 Monday 1:01 AM GMT","thetimes.co.uk","Cop26 was the biggest, longest and arguably most important international conference held for years. To its British hosts, the Glasgow meeting in November was a matter of both pride and anxiety: would it achieve its ambitious goals to recommit the world to effective action to limit global warming; or would it be seen as an embarrassing failure, an ill-tempered wrangle between the richer and poorer nations over targets, dates and money?Despite intensive lobbying by Boris Johnson and environmental campaigners, there were fears that the meeting would be a flop. It augured badly that even before the opening, President Putin of Russia and President Xi of China said they would not attend - underscoring worries that both countries, so vital to concerted action, would balk at the onerous demands to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, would garner support from other big polluters such as India, and would try to politicise the conference, portraying it as a refusal by the richer West to honour its pledges of support for the developing world.The final outcome was a mixed bag. That almost 200 nations were able to agree on a communiqu\'e9 more substantial than pessimists had feared was in itself an achievement. By comparison with the predictions a decade ago, things have moved fast. Scientists said then that the world was on course for a temperature rise of 4C, a truly apocalyptic result that would have made much of the tropics uninhabitable and millions homeless. If all the pledges made at Glasgow are fulfilled, global warming could be limited to 1.8C. That is still a disaster for many. But every increment of warming prevented means fewer species driven to extinction and fewer people forced from their homes. In getting every participant to state its targets, Cop26 brings the world closer to the Paris aspiration of a 1.5C limit to warming.It is a massive assumption that these promises will be kept. Alarmingly, countries have pledged to do far less in the short term than would be required to meet their long-term goals of net zero. Poorer countries' efforts to reduce their emissions have been hampered by richer countries' failure to honour their commitments. But Glasgow did yield progress on specific issues, such as an end to deforestation, agreed even by Brazil, and programmes to reverse it. For this, real money is available: some \£314 billion in private and public funding. Cop26 also agreed to cut emissions of methane, a gas far more potent, though less long-lasting, than carbon dioxide in accelerating warming. Coal was also a key issue, though here progress was patchy. Commentators blamed China for still building coal-fired generating plants and India for not phasing out coal faster. But both have now agreed to reach net zero not long after western countries. Decarbonisation will be easiest in the West, where population growth is stalling and finance for green investment is cheap; costs for the developing world are far more burdensome.The other success was that great power rivalry did not wreck the talks. Before Glasgow, China said it could not co-operate with America on climate change, while disagreeing with it on so much else. But at Cop26 both reaffirmed their intention to work together on the issue. Glasgow also made a reality of the hopes that every five years there would be a special meeting to increase pledges, thus quickening the rhythm of global action.Much is already under way before next year's conference in Egypt: millions of people have made small changes in their lifestyle or say they are willing to do so. The science of reducing emissions is speeding up, and almost all the technology needed is already in existence. Industry is adapting because it is now profitable to go green. Climate change is still critically dangerous. But Cop26 may prove to have been a point where the dangers were faced in full.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

While we are working hard to drive down demand for fossil fuels, there will be ongoing demand for oil and gas as the UK transitions to low carbon alternatives, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee.""The statement added: ""Abandoning North Sea oil and gas overnight would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk - and leave the UK more reliant on foreign imports.""An influential report from the world's energy watchdog HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/fossil-fuels-end-net-zero-b1848938.htmlreleased in May said there can be no further fossil fuel expansion anywhere on Earth if global climate targets are to be met, and at Cop26, the final text called for ""accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".During the summit the UK government also HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop26-uk-oil-gas-costa-rica-denmark-b1955807.htmlfailed to join an international alliance aiming to end new oil and gas projects, leaving a small group of countries led by Costa Rica and Denmark, and including France, Greenland, Ireland and Sweden to forge a path away from fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the UK government was under pressure to stop plans for new drilling activity at the Cambo oil field in the North Sea, and to explain how a new deep coal mine planned for Cumbria would also fit into its plans to hit net zero emissions by 2050.According to The Times, the dinner with Mr Kwarteng and Tim Eggar, the chairman of the Oil and Gas Authority, took place in London on 16 November, just three days after the signing of the Glasgow climate pact which aims to keep in reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C.But despite the government's wooing of the firms, there remains uncertainty over the UK's commitment to fossil fuel expansion, as well as Labour in England and Wales, and the SNP in Scotland voicing their increasingly hostile attitude to fossil fuels, the Tories are also sending mixed messages.Not least Mr Kwartang himself, who wrote in HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/10/30/need-homegrown-renewable-energy-future-proof-britain/The Telegraph in OctoberThe meeting does not appear to have been enough to stop Shell from walking away from the Cambo oil field.

This will culminate in a meeting between Egypt, UAE and UK in Abu Dhabi, the first of a series of engagements between the countries ahead of COP27 and COP28.Whilst in Cairo, Mr Sharma met a wide range of Government Ministers, including Prime Minister Madbouly and Egypt's COP President-Designate, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Together they issued a UK-Egypt Joint Statement which affirms their joint commitment to accelerating the fight against climate change during this critical decade.They also agreed to continue building a partnership in 2022 that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals, in Sharm el Sheikh at COP27. This means ensuring all parties meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance.The COP President also announced the expansion of the UK Government's 'Climate Finance Accelerator' Programme to Egypt. Already successfully operating in six countries, the initiative will provide capacity-building support to promising climate projects in Egypt so that they become more bankable and appealing to investors, and can secure funding more readily.On his final day in Egypt, Mr Sharma discussed the role of the private sector in building on COP26 to achieve success at COP27, meeting with business leaders pursuing green initiatives in Egypt.COP President Alok Sharma said:COP26 was a historic, collective achievement. We kept the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees in reach and made progress on finance for climate action, adaptation and loss and damage, which will benefit countries across both Africa and the MENA region.I look forward to working with Egypt and UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively on the climate agenda. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering an ambitious COP this November which ensures urgently delivering for those most vulnerable to climate change.We all need to make further progress in 2022 and especially on delivering the $ 100 billion of finance and addressing investment needs in the most climate vulnerable countries. This will build on the Glasgow Climate Pact and secure a better future for us all.An important focus for COP27 and COP28 will be the completion of the first Global Stocktake. This will be a key part of assessing progress made by nations in implementing the Paris Agreement and setting out a clear roadmap towards achieving it. This formally began at COP26 and will conclude at COP28The UK is keen to share experiences of hosting a large international summit with Egypt and the UAE and the COP President has highlighted the COVID-19 testing procedures for providing a safe experience for all delegates at the recent COP26 gathering and collaboration with civil society.The COP President will now travel to the United Arab Emirates to see preparations for COP28 that will be staged in 2023 and will meet key government ministers, including the recently appointed Minister of Climate Change and Environment, HE Mariam Al Mheiri and UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change HE Dr. Sultan Al Jaber.Mr Sharma has been invited to take part in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, which gets underway tomorrow (Monday 17 January). The COP President will be involved in helping the UAE to illustrate its intentions for hosting COP28 and delivering on their climate commitments made over the last 12 months.Hosting the next two COPs in the Middle East and North Africa will enable the region to showcase to the world their innovative and profitable solutions which include renewable and low carbon energy, zero emissions transport, the role of nature based solutions and the role of smart agriculture.For example, the UAE continues to break records by reducing the costs of solar energy year after year and is delivering energy security through nuclear energy, all of which makes clean energy a more affordable option than fossil fuels.British Ambassador to Egypt, Gareth Bayley said:I am delighted that Mr Sharma has visited Egypt so soon after COP26. The strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Egypt will help sustain global momentum on climate change. I am particularly pleased that Mr Sharma launched our 'Climate Finance Accelerator' programme, which I hope will generate a series of inspiring low carbon investment opportunities in Egypt. It is this combination of public and private sector action which will help us avert a climate disaster.Local delivery is central to the CFA approach and the Embassy team is looking forward to working with the local delivery partners once they have been appointed.British Ambassador to the UAE, Patrick Moody said:The visit of COP26 President Alok Sharma to the UAE reinforces the commitments that the UK and UAE have made to address global challenges. Climate change is a central pillar of the UK and UAE bilateral partnership and was a key ambition of the 'Partnership for The Future' that was launched in London by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in September 2021.Together, we are already delivering solutions to achieve 'net zero' through bilateral trade and investment in clean growth and technology. Our two countries will continue to cooperate as current COP President and future hosts of this critical international forum to make sure that the global community delivers on the ambitious commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow.

It is a vital tool in the Government's commitment to tackle climate change internationally and has committed to spend at least \£311.6 billion of climate finance between 2021 and 2025.Through ICF, the UK is committed to work in partnership and support the development of a high-performing and climate-resilient economy in Egypt. Further information about UK ICF can be found in this booklet.Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA)The programme will also contribute to embedding a permanent process in each country to identify financing for low-carbon projects. This will support countries' efforts to implement their NDCs, raise their overall climate ambition, and contribute to equity and social inclusion.The CFA programme is managed by local partners in each country. It works by building the skills of project developers and potential investors to respectively attract and supply funding for low-carbon development projects.By enabling the funding of low-carbon projects, the CFA can play a part in supporting a greener recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CFA will promote sustainable growth and green development and support those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.Abu Dhabi Sustainability WeekADSW is hosted by Masdar annually. In 2022, ADSW intends to explore, through a series of high-level virtual events, opportunities for accelerating global collaboration and leadership, economic development, and technology and innovation.ADSW 2022 intends to follow the outcomes of COP26, where the world will reevaluate the roadmaps required to meet the binding targets required to mitigate climate change. The week is the first global event of the year, where policy makers, business leaders and technology pioneers can come together to turn ambition into action.UK participation demonstrates our commitment to work with and support future COP Presidencies to progress the historic commitments made at COP26.

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK135","COP26 can be seen as catalyst for positive change - Alan Nelson","January 10, 2022 Monday","Scotsman","While the two-week gathering was never going to meet the expectations of many individuals and groups who are rightly incensed about the lack of progress towards net zero, it deserves to be acknowledged for breaking new ground and creating a catalyst for positive change.COP26 featured two key moments: the deal announced between the US and China to work together on climate change, and the coming together of 197 nations which signed the Glasgow Climate Pact, keeping the focus on limiting global temperature rises to a maximum of 1.5 degrees.The Glasgow Climate Pact also includes the commitment to phase down coal-fired power generation as part of the global energy transition. While harder measures to accelerate this process were opposed by India, China and South Africa, this marked the first time that we heard a direct reference to phasing out fossil fuels, an important step forward. This comes as further momentum is also being made across the oil and gas sector as part of the global energy transition.While the COP26Many people are beginning to make choices in their daily lives that support the drive towards net zero, including making changes to their diet, their source of heating energy, or the type of car they drive. The business community is also showing real ingenuity and innovation in finding solutions, from the growing use of green hydrogen and other fossil fuel alternatives, to the development of new technologies that will help promote greater sustainability.Like many other players in the corporate environment, CMS is part of this sea change, committed to a programme of reducing and offsetting carbon emissions across our entire portfolio to net zero by 2025.Equity markets and banks are also heavily engaged, increasingly demanding companies have a strong commitment to ESG before they will provide investment. It\' s not surprising that investment in ESG funds went up 88 per cent to over $152bn in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, we\' re seeing increased levels of capital being driven towards emerging start-ups which are focused on finding innovative solutions to address environmental challenges.Additionally, during COP26 we saw the formation of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a new body which is underpinned by the race to net zero. GFANZ has been set up to help governments design policy to facilitate the creation of new green assets for investment. The UN has also indicated it will increase scrutiny of private sector commitments to net zero via the UN Principles on Responsible Investment (UNPRI) reporting framework, a move that will further incentivise financial institutions to stand behind ESG claims with real world data and robust evidence.As significant as these all developments could prove to be, perhaps the most impactful legacy of COP26We saw unprecedented levels of engagement in Glasgow with the mass mobilisation of individuals, civil society, and a range of other organisations all pushing for change. This collaboration further advanced public understanding of how climate challenges are impacting on people in different parts of the globe, and will undoubtedly put additional pressure on governments to adhere to and, in some cases, exceed their commitments towards net zero.While there were some notable disappointments in Glasgow, COP26 should be seen as a success where key agreements were made and vital partnerships were forged between nations.Far from being a \' Cop Out,\' the 2021 UN climate change conference broke new ground and has created a strong platform to move forward. We hope to see a ripple effect from this momentum which will add extra impetus in delivering a positive future for our planet and all its people.Alan Nelson is a Partner with HYPERLINK https://cms.law/en/gbr/CMS\l"

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK138","Delivering on the Glasgow Climate Pact in a changing world","April 25, 2022 Monday 1:56 PM GMT","Gov.uk","Good afternoon.Thank you President Monaco, and thank you Dean Kyte for inviting me to Tufts.Rachel, thank you for all your fabulous support and invaluable advice in the lead up to COP26. And for your friendship, which I value greatly.Ladies and gentlemen, when Charles Tufts was asked what he planned to do with his land, and his  bleak hill over in Medford, he is said to have replied,  I will put a light on it. That he did, laying the foundation for a world leading academic institution.And today, in that tradition, I want to try and shed some light on today\' s climate politics in what is a changing world.The world todayThe intersection of individually devastating world events is making global geopolitics incredibly challenging.The world has endured a devastating Pandemic.Vladimir Putin has launched an illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine.I do not think anyone can fail to be moved by the harrowing images that we are seeing everyday from that war.And it is vital for the international community to stand shoulder to shoulder with the brave people of Ukraine and provide them with the support that they need.In a recent speech by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, she described our current situation as,  a crisis on top of a crisis , with the effects of war and the effects of covid colliding.We are seeing inflation on the rise.Growth forecasts are being downgraded.To echo Ms Georgieva, this is  the most universally complex policy environment of our lifetime .So the question that I want to address today is what this means for international climate politics.Because there are some who have asked me whether on the issue of climate action the world can, so to speak, both walk and chew gum at the same time.Whether, against the backdrop of today\' s conflicts and crises, the focus on climate will fade, as more immediate threats and risks engulf the bandwidth of world leaders.Why climate ambition can surviveQuite simply, it must not.We cannot allow that to happen.The stakes are too high.The chronic threat of climate change is not going away.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently released its latest report.This synthesised 18,000 scientific papers, and was agreed by almost 200 countries.And its findings were unequivocal.To keep alive the ambition of limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees celsius, which the science tells us will avoid the worst effects of climate change, global emissions must peak before 2025 and must all but halve by 2030.Ladies and gentlemen, this is a decisive decade for our planet. It is the decisive decade.I think we all know that the invasion of Ukraine will define 2022 and is rightly the focus of the international community.And of course, the world must deal with the impact of the immediate global crisis on energy markets and the soaring cost of living that is affecting very many millions across the world.It would be illogical to suggest otherwise.I was candid about this when I spoke to a room full of energy and climate ministers at the International Energy Agency\' s Annual Ministerial Meeting last month in Paris.I told them I understood that governments need to deal with their immediate and acute energy needs.They need to keep the lights on.They need to keep homes heated.They need to make sure that factories continue to operate.Yet I also cautioned against losing the long-term view in response to the pressures of the present.And I urged them to continue moving away from dirty fossil fuels and accelerate faster towards a clean energy future,To stick with their medium and longer-term emission reduction targets.We all know doing that is absolutely vital to protecting the planet.The power sector alone accounts for around a quarter of global emissions.And we know that its future is clean.Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal and gas in the majority of countries, and they are creating very many good green jobs around the world.The US is taking welcome steps to increase clean power production.And at COP26China is one of the world\' s top investors in domestic renewables capacity.The current energy crisis has also demonstrated the broader benefits of this shift to clean power.It has made clear that homegrown renewables and clean energy, the price of which cannot be manipulated from afar are the best option for domestic energy security.And frankly, governments know this.Yes, countries are scrambling to deal with immediate supply issues, as they must.But at the same time, they are announcing plans to accelerate the move to clean power, which will decrease fossil fuel demand in the longer-term.Take the European Commission who have announced that the European Union will increase renewables deployment to help reduce dependency on Russian hydrocarbons.In the United Kingdom, we have recently published our own Energy Security Strategy.We already have the second biggest offshore wind market in the world.And we are going to significantly accelerate our deployment of wind, of solar, of nuclear, of hydrogen, which could see 95% of electricity become low carbon by 2030.Our target is to be 100% carbon free in our electricity mix by 2035.Increasingly, moving to net zero emissions, is a matter of security.So the immediate energy crisis need not damage long-term action on climate change.And whilst the global political environment is undoubtedly difficult,I believe climate can largely remain a sanctuary of cooperation within a splintered global politics.That is precisely what we saw at COP26, including in the US-China Joint Declaration on climate action that was also launched in Glasgow.The challenging global context did not begin in 2022.Last year we saw violence erupt, wars drag onward, and relations between old friends and allies strain, all as the pandemic raged around the world.But amidst all this, 197 countries came together at COP26 in Glasgow and we agreed the Glasgow Climate Pact.The risks of climate change have become ever clearer to every government.The science is increasingly stark and the extreme weather is growing in frequency and ferocity.Over the past 12 months, we have seen devastating floods in South Africa, China and Australia.And it is a fact that climate change does not, at the end of the day, recognise borders.Meanwhile, the economic opportunities presented by the move to net zero are undeniable, and the calls to action from young people, many of you here, and civil society have become louder, literally around the world.As a result, despite their differences, countries realised it was in their interests to cooperate at COP26 and make real progress on climate.And they did.The Glasgow Climate PactIt does keep alive the possibility of limiting the average rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees celsius.It calls on countries to phase-down unabated coal power and phase-out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.It contains big commitments on climate mitigation, on adaptation and on finance.And it also sets out a way forward on the crucial issue of loss and damage.I believe such commitments chart a clearer course to a clean future, and they do so more than ever before.But they will come to nothing unless we turn them into action.You will have seen a recent study in the journal Nature found that if all the commitments made at COP26 are honoured on time, we will limit the rise in global temperature to below two degrees centigrade.There are many scientists here who will be familiar with the climate science.Before the Paris Agreement was signed, scientists told us that we were heading for a 4 degree celsius rise in global temperatures.After Paris it was 3 degrees Celsius.The Glasgow Climate Pact has bent the curve to below 2 degrees.The world is moving in the right direction. Of course, the recent IPCC report, sounded a stark warning that the window of time we have left to keep 1.5 C alive is closing rapidly,but also contained hope.It showed that the rate of growth in global emissions is slowing,that economic growth can be achieved alongside ambitious emissions reductions.And that halving emissions by 2030 is possible.So we have got to seize this opportunity.We have got to accelerate the shift to a zero emissions future, and we must deliver on the promises made in the historic Glasgow Climate Pact, turning commitments into action.And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the focus of the UK\' s COP26 Presidency year.Delivering on GlasgowAnd we are pressing all governments to deliver on their commitments.Ahead of Glasgow, we held a meeting of Ministers in person in London in July 2021.That wasn\' t easy mid-pandemic.But it helped us make real progress.So next month, the COP27 President Designate and I will co-chair a meeting of a representative group of ministers from around the world in Denmark.We will be focusing on the implementation of commitments which have been made.Before , together with great support from the German and Canadian governments, we published a Delivery Plan on the $100billion-a-year of climate finance that developed countries have promised developing countries.This showed how the $100billion goal would be met, and helped to build trust and confidence.Now, of course developing countries want to see progress on this plan. I am urging all developed countries to deliver on the finance commitments they have made and put funds on the table.To slightly adapt Tom Cruise\' s immortal l"

This will culminate in a meeting between Egypt, UAE and UK in Abu Dhabi, the first of a series of engagements between the countries ahead of COP27 and COP28.Whilst in Cairo, Mr Sharma met a wide range of Government Ministers, including Prime Minister Madbouly and Egypt's COP President-Designate, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Together they issued a UK-Egypt Joint Statement which affirms their joint commitment to accelerating the fight against climate change during this critical decade.They also agreed to continue building a partnership in 2022 that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals, in Sharm el Sheikh at COP27. This means ensuring all parties meet their commitments across mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance.The COP President also announced the expansion of the UK Government's 'Climate Finance Accelerator' Programme to Egypt. Already successfully operating in six countries, the initiative will provide capacity-building support to promising climate projects in Egypt so that they become more bankable and appealing to investors, and can secure funding more readily.On his final day in Egypt, Mr Sharma discussed the role of the private sector in building on COP26 to achieve success at COP27, meeting with business leaders pursuing green initiatives in Egypt.COP President Alok Sharma said:COP26 was a historic, collective achievement. We kept the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees in reach and made progress on finance for climate action, adaptation and loss and damage, which will benefit countries across both Africa and the MENA region.I look forward to working with Egypt and UAE as hosts of COP27 and COP28 respectively on the climate agenda. The UK will give its full support to Egypt in delivering an ambitious COP this November which ensures urgently delivering for those most vulnerable to climate change.We all need to make further progress in 2022 and especially on delivering the $ 100 billion of finance and addressing investment needs in the most climate vulnerable countries. This will build on the Glasgow Climate Pact and secure a better future for us all.An important focus for COP27 and COP28 will be the completion of the first Global Stocktake. This will be a key part of assessing progress made by nations in implementing the Paris Agreement and setting out a clear roadmap towards achieving it. This formally began at COP26 and will conclude at COP28The UK is keen to share experiences of hosting a large international summit with Egypt and the UAE and the COP President has highlighted the COVID-19 testing procedures for providing a safe experience for all delegates at the recent COP26 gathering and collaboration with civil society.The COP President will now travel to the United Arab Emirates to see preparations for COP28 that will be staged in 2023 and will meet key government ministers, including the recently appointed Minister of Climate Change and Environment, HE Mariam Al Mheiri and UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change HE Dr. Sultan Al Jaber.Mr Sharma has been invited to take part in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, which gets underway tomorrow (Monday 17 January). The COP President will be involved in helping the UAE to illustrate its intentions for hosting COP28 and delivering on their climate commitments made over the last 12 months.Hosting the next two COPs in the Middle East and North Africa will enable the region to showcase to the world their innovative and profitable solutions which include renewable and low carbon energy, zero emissions transport, the role of nature based solutions and the role of smart agriculture.For example, the UAE continues to break records by reducing the costs of solar energy year after year and is delivering energy security through nuclear energy, all of which makes clean energy a more affordable option than fossil fuels.British Ambassador to Egypt, Gareth Bayley said:I am delighted that Mr Sharma has visited Egypt so soon after COP26. The strong bilateral relationship between the UK and Egypt will help sustain global momentum on climate change. I am particularly pleased that Mr Sharma launched our 'Climate Finance Accelerator' programme, which I hope will generate a series of inspiring low carbon investment opportunities in Egypt. It is this combination of public and private sector action which will help us avert a climate disaster.Local delivery is central to the CFA approach and the Embassy team is looking forward to working with the local delivery partners once they have been appointed.British Ambassador to the UAE, Patrick Moody said:The visit of COP26 President Alok Sharma to the UAE reinforces the commitments that the UK and UAE have made to address global challenges. Climate change is a central pillar of the UK and UAE bilateral partnership and was a key ambition of the 'Partnership for The Future' that was launched in London by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in September 2021.Together, we are already delivering solutions to achieve 'net zero' through bilateral trade and investment in clean growth and technology. Our two countries will continue to cooperate as current COP President and future hosts of this critical international forum to make sure that the global community delivers on the ambitious commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Government of UK.(Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK www.m2.com)) Language:\~ENGLISH\l"

More recently we've aligned our strategy to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (link to previous article) and committed to set Science Based Targets to reduce our emissions and reach Net Zero by 2050.Our sustainability strategy is ambitious, we're aiming to reduce our carbon emissions by 25% by 2025 which is aligned to the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was set in 2015 at COP21 and challenged members of the United Nations to set ambitious climate targets to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. This year sees COP26 come to Glasgow for the annual climate change conference.Subheading - What is COP26?COP26 is the 2021 United Nations annual climate change conference. COP stands for Conference of the Parties. Parties are the signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - a treaty agreed in 1994 which has 197 Parties (196 countries and the EU). The 2021 conference, hosted by the UK, together with partners Italy, in Glasgow, will be the 26th meeting of the Parties, which is why it's called COP26.United Nations climate change conferences are among the largest international meetings in the world. The negotiations between governments are complex and involve officials from every country in the world as well as representatives from civil society and the global news media.What happens at a COP26?Activity at a COP takes place in two different zones - the Blue Zone and the Green Zone.The Blue Zone is for people registered with the UN body tasked with coordinating the global response to the threat of climate change - the UNFCCC. In the Blue Zone you might be part of a national delegation, work for the United Nations and related organisations agencies or be a member of the media or not-for-profit observer organisation.In the Blue Zone, delegates from countries meet for both formal negotiations and informal consultations. They may also take part in meetings with other delegations to clarify their position and interests with the aim of reaching agreement or overcoming a negotiating deadlock. The UNFCCC will also host a range of events, including technical briefings, to support the negotiations process.The Green Zone is for the public. There will be a wide range of events, including workshops, art exhibitions and installations, as well as presentations, demonstrations of technology and musical performances for everyone to attend.How will Severfield participate?Our Group Sustainability Manager, Sara Halliday, will be attending COP26 to take part in a round table discussion, hosted by The Climate Group, on the topic of 'Shifting Systems - industry: A net zero materials revolution'. Taking part on Tuesday 9 November, 8:00am - 9:30am, Sara will be discussing our recent commitment to SteelZero and how important the transition to low embodied carbon steel production is to the construction sector.Keep an eye out on our social media channels for how we are doing our bit in the race to Net Zero - we'll be posting throughout COP26. We're also involved in an exciting project with Balfour Beatty, showcasing how we are engaged in their ambition to 'Green The Chain'.

The team are also able to clean injectors, combustion chambers, EGR valves, diesel particulate filters and sensors to help achieve optimum engine efficiency.Alex explained:  It\' s been good to see world leaders taking the issue of climate change seriously at but, if we\' re going to see change, we all need to play our part \- no matter how small.  If everyone took small steps such as emptying their vehicle regularly to carry less weight or keeping their tyre pressures topped up, they would use less fuel, resulting in lower emissions. Going one step further by using additives in the fuel system, filling tyres with nitrogen and cleaning a vehicles\' fuel system would really make a difference too. Using TerraClean, for example, not only reduces emissions but also improves the engine performance and reduces costs for the driver by increasing the lifespan of engine components.

READ MORE: What does Cop26 mean World leaders to gather for climate summit in Glasgow in November What is COP26 and why is it important Each year since 1994, the United Nations has held Conference of the Parties COP summits to coordinate global action against climate change and environmental destruction.COP26 is the 26th of these summits. It was originally scheduled to be held last year, but was delayed due to the pandemic.All 197 nations which have signed the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change will be represented at COP26.With climate change now widely recognised as the defining issue of our time, organisers will be hoping political leaders can be persuaded to commit to more ambitious emissions targets. Where is COP26 being held COP26 will take place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow. When does COP26 begin COP26 will get underway on October 31st, a day earlier than was originally planned. It will end on November 12th.Over 120 political leaders are expected to attend the event in its opening days, before leaving their aides to handle the more detailed negotiations.Altogether, around 25,000 people are expected to attend the conference.Environmental activist Greta Thunberg has confirmed that she will be one of them, despite her reservations about the summit's potential for more ""empty talk"" and ""greenwashing"".

This is the moment to get the world truly on track to address climate change and build a cleaner, brighter future. Leaders will come together for two weeks to negotiate a series of political and technical agreements to limit global temperature rises to well below 2\'b0C, with 1.5\'b0C the target. It is vital that we secure the accountability and transparency needed to enable the world to meet this goal. The UK and the EU are like-minded partners when it comes to tackling climate change. Our common ambition leads the way and sets the example for the rest of the world. Coordination between us on COP26 has been, and will be, vital to its success. We are already seeing real positive change. Countries covered by a net zero or carbon neutrality commitment now account for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and around 80 percent of global GDP. When we took the role of COP Presidency in December 2019, in partnership with Italy, coverage was less than 30 percent of worldwide GDP. ""The European Parliament Resolution on COP26 [...] shows our shared sense of urgency in forging a consensus on the necessary climate ambition to achieve global climate neutrality by mid-century"" I have been very pleased with the series of strong climate commitments from the EU. Make no mistake: these have been instrumental in driving ambition and momentum; likewise, the UK's climate commitments ahead of COP26 next month. Last year the EU announced its intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent by 2030, and later saw this enshrined in the Climate Law. This strong ambition was very welcome. But genuine implementation is what really matters in tackling climate change, and the EU has followed up with the ambitious and unprecedented 'Fit for 55' legislative package aimed at turning that target into reality. This package is aligned with our COP26 objectives - including early phase-out of petrol and diesel vehicles - and a great example of working together to drive global ambition.\~ The UK too has an ambitious emissions reduction target, or Nationally Determined Contribution, of 68 percent by 2030, with a further commitment to 78 percent by 2035. And last week the UK launched its Net Zero Strategy: the measures we are going to take to transition to a green and sustainable future. It sets out clear policies and proposals for keeping us on track for our carbon budgets, our ambitious NDC and our vision for a decarbonised net zero economy by 2050. The UK and EU approaches support COP26 objectives such as phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles, and are a great example of how we can work together to drive ambition. The additional (EURO)4bn of public climate finance announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during her State of the Union address represented significant progress towards meeting the commitment to deliver $100bn a year toward adaptation and mitigation to assist countries most impacted by climate change. ""If we are serious about the 1.5\'b0C ambition, Glasgow must be the COP that finally consigns coal power to history, calls time on deforestation, signals the end of polluting vehicles and enables the world's most vulnerable to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change"" Last week, I was also pleased to see the ambitious European Parliament resolution on COP26. This shows our shared sense of urgency in forging a consensus on the necessary climate ambition to achieve global climate neutrality by mid-century. My team have been meeting the MEPs on the European Parliament's delegation to Glasgow, explaining our vision and how the EP can support ambitious outcomes.

Seized no opportunities.``We will have fractured the trust built between nations.``And 1.5C will slip from our grasp.He said the conference had succeeded on delivering in areas that many people had not thought could be achieved, including getting all countries to agree to come back by the end of 2022 with enhanced emissions cuts.But he said: ``None of that will matter unless these commitments are turned into action.In reference to comments he made in the aftermath of the talks that 1.5C was alive, but its pulse was weak, he added: ``It was a fragile win.``That heartbeat of 1.5C will only be strengthened if people continue, if countries continue to deliver.''ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

In its current form, we took on the role of Climate Chamber in the build-up to and duration of COP26As an anchor player in Team Glasgow, we've supported the Sustainable Glasgow Board to oversee the city's plans for achieving net-zero carbon by 2030, while emphasising the importance of a circular economy and ambition to become a circular city by 2045. An integral element of this is the city's Greenprint for Investment which sets out how we'll reach those 2030 targets. It includes the SEC expansion plan and, after doing such a tremendous job of hosting COP26, we hope this ambition is realised.While as a city we look to our own sustainable targets, knowledge transfer and connecting with other cities is going to be incredibly important if we're to successfully reach 2030 targets. The global challenge we face is shared and so disseminating wisdom and lessons learned with our international counterparts will be vital to embedding growth and innovation within the economy.During COP26The prospect of opportunity is entirely more motivational and we found the business community very much engaged in a COP focused on action.We believe that cities are key to driving the changes needed, with integrated efforts on net zero, circular economy and a broader move to a just transition.Collaboration is a must if Glasgow is to succeed here, and our businesses are already leading the way. Fifty of our members engaged with HRH The Prince of Wales during a reception at Kelvingrove to recognise those tirelessly working towards a circular and net-zero economy, and we engaged with and supported a whole host of businesses in the Blue and Green Zones and throughout events across the city. Mention has been made by EY of the prospect of a Conference of Business to follow COP26, seizing the moment to scale ongoing business engagement. With the World Economic Forum and other global actors, we're also proud to back a collaborative call to action that reinforces the need for a circular economy shift, alongside net zero, to truly realise the innovative solutions needed to tackle the climate challenge, and as Bill McDonough, a leader in sustainable development and design, stated, there must be a tone adjustment to doing more good than doing less bad.As this pivotal year draws to a close, we consider how to capitalise on the many connections and developments which have been made through COP26. As with the industrial revolution, we are firmly placed to drive forward this step change and will be looking to the various Glasgow declarations on how we take further bold and courageous actions to deliver on these prospects which have Glasgow's name at their core.Alison McRae is senior director of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

At US$80/bbl, this would near $1 trillion (on a post-tax, post-capex, pre-financing and dividends basis).The report notes that as governments align around net-zero goals, it is likely that next year will see more carbon taxes enacted to meet COP26 pledges - while governments may also target outsized cash flow to fill pandemic-induced budget deficits.WoodMac notes that while windfall taxes on sectors such as energy are possible, so are more holistic energy fiscal terms and incentives for new developments such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen.COP26However, he noted: ""Lending will not dry up immediately.

The National Trust, RSPB, Woodland Trust and Wildlife Trusts are also urging Mr Johnson to make sure the new payment system for farmers ensures nature - and climate-friendly farming, and to boost tree planting with largely native trees in the right place.The seven New Year resolutions also include ensuring the network of protected sites is big enough and sufficiently well managed to protect nature and the carbon stored within them.A commitment from the Government to restore 30% of land and sea by 2030 for nature is welcome, the organisations say, but they warn that only 3% of land can currently be said to be specifically protected for nature.The organisations also want to see a new duty that requires future climate risks and hazards to be taken into account in all public decision making, to support the changes needed to help communities and landscapes adapt to climate change impacts.Restoring all peatlands - the UK's largest natural carbon sink and key wildlife habitat but one which is putting out emissions because of its degraded state - would save far more than it would cost, the groups argue.Protection should be increased for the marine environment to harness its carbon storing potential, with highly protected status for all seagrass habitats, renewed pledges to protect coastal areas such as salt marsh and curbs on fishing which harms the seabed and releases carbon.The conservation organisations are urging the Prime Minister to build on the pledges to tackle the climate and nature crises made at the key Cop26 talks in Glasgow in November 2021 with the actions they have set out.Dr Darren Moorcroft, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, said: ""We need the UK to show real leadership in the major international conferences on climate and biological diversity.""Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, said: ""We now need new guarantees from the Government that deliver on the important commitments for nature secured at Cop26.""Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, warned: ""There's still a huge gulf between rhetoric and reality to tackle climate change.""National Trust director general Hilary McGrady said: ""We are today calling on the Prime Minister to build on the pledges made at and commit to a series of New Year resolutions to nature that ensure our natural defences against climate change are protected and nurtured in 2022 and beyond,"" she said.A Government spokesperson said they were ""absolutely committed"" to tackling climate change.They added: ""We are taking action to limit rising temperatures, with new pledges to cut carbon and methane emissions, end deforestation, phase out coal and provide more finance to countries most vulnerable to climate change.""\l"

The precise meaning of 'phase-down' - whether it applies to all coal production, what the time scale involved is and whether links exist with coal 'phase-out' - remain essentially unclear.It is a common fact that diplomacy is most successful where forms of words chosen to reach agreement between parties elude precise meanings.Apparently, the diplomatic endgame brought tears to the eyes of Alok Sharma.Cop26 is being heralded as a 'success' because it has seemingly kept alive the 'flame of 1.5 Celsius'.Currently, inclusive of Cop26 pledges, Carbon Action Tracker forecasts an increase of 14% in carbon emissions by 2030 and not a reduction of 45% (required to keep global temperature rises within 1.5 Celsius). Carbon Action Tracker also forecasts temperature rises between 1.8 Celsius (its most optimistic scenario where 2030 targets are met and all Cop26 pledges are delivered) and 2.7 Celsius (if not) by the end of the century.There is an alternative sceptic view which has it that, although achieving such huge carbon reductions in a short period of time may be near impossible, keeping the tiny, guttering 'flame of 1.5 Celsius' alive usefully allows ownership of any historically monumental failure to achieve carbon cuts and prevent dangerous global temperatures to be shifted to the Egyptian rather than UK government.

Countries agreed emissions cuts but not nearly sufficient to keep the planet within 1.5C. However, they are due to revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions targets by the end of 2022 (not 2025 as it would otherwise have been). In other words, next year is where the life support, and \\xE2targets\\xE2 fight, will continue.\\xE2Accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal and inefficient fuel subsidies\\xE2 is an uninspiring, weak passage but, however unsatisfactory, it is critical and a signal. That signal must be followed by the rapid phase out of all fossil fuels. Offers have been made on methane, deforestation and finance, that, if fulfilled, could buy some breathing space.

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK192","'The most challenging summit anybody's ever held': Cop26 COO Wasim Mir on last year's climate conference","February 15, 2022 Tuesday 1:00 PM GMT","Civil Service World (online)","There are many things Wasim Mir can do, but one thing he cannot do is bend time and space. Cop26's chief operating officer certainly never expected to be explaining that at a logistical briefing at the start of the climate-change conference in November. \~ Cop president Alok Sharma was, he recalls, ""very keen for people to voice their concerns about logistics upfront"". The briefing was one way to make this happen, and was where ""one delegation raised a concern with me when I was at the podium - there must have been 500 people there in the plenary - that the venue was very big, so was there anything I could do to create a shortcut through it? The way the venue was set up, it kind of elongated from one end to the other. So unless I created some kind of time warp, it was quite difficult to create shortcuts."" Mir says he used his ""best diplomatic skills"" - honed during a career spent largely in the Foreign Office and the UN - ""to explain how the venue worked, and how we'd done everything we could to make sure that people could travel quickly around it"". Despite its strangeness, the question was one of the simpler ones Mir has had to navigate over the last few months as he has overseen operations for Cop26. The UK's Cop presidency brought about what he thinks may just have been ""the most challenging summit anybody's ever held"". This is also the most challenging job he's ever had, he adds - and for a longtime diplomat who has worked in Brazil, New York and at the UK Representation to the EU, that is saying something. Even under normal circumstances, the Conference of the Parties is a massive undertaking. Mir was the ""gold command"" of a cross-civil service team made up of officials from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office - the department most experienced at leading massive events - and the Cabinet Office. Among the many items on the operations team's to-do list was organising transport to get 120 world leaders safely into Glasgow; planning out how rooms would be used for each of the summit meetings; and working with Police Scotland to make sure people could protest, but in a way that didn't disrupt proceedings. Then there was accommodation to secure. Most of the UK civil servants working on Cop were asked to stay in Edinburgh to free up government buildings and hotel space so delegates could stay nearby - ""you've got people coming from, you know, the Pacific islands for three days and they need to be heard, we wanted them to be in the best shape possible to help with the negotiations."" And there is no denying that the venue was big. Because of social distancing requirements, Glasgow's Scottish Event Campus had to be expanded using temporary structures to accommodate the more than 30,000 delegates. Cost-saving requirements meant construction on parts of the venue didn't begin until a few weeks before the conference started, and Mir stresses that there was ""a lot to do, right until the end"" of the project - not helped by the fact that the boyband JLS was performing in the venue's main arena just a week before Cop26 began. A month out from the opening ceremony, Mir admits risk ratings for several parts of the conference operation were marked red, and ""a lot of things were worrying"". But while the unexpected did happen - with the collapse of a crane bearing a Cop26 banner providing one memorable example - it did come together. ""You do your planning as well as you can and you make sure you've got the right things in place to be able to respond. You can't control everything,"" Mir says. The days leading up to the conference and the first few days when the World Leaders Summit took place were especially taxing as the team was on high alert for any last-minute snags, he adds. ""After that, we got a little more in the groove of how we were running things.""\~ ""I didn't really expect it would be part of my role to field complaints from one set of delegates that it was too cold and another set of delegates that it was too warm"" In those early days, Mir - who spent three years as deputy head of mission at the British embassy in Brazil and led a UN team in the early 2010s that brought together governments to set the global agenda for tackling HIV - found himself running around making sure thermostats were adjusted. ""I didn't really expect that would be part of my role, to field complaints from one set of delegates that it's too cold and another set of delegates that it's too warm,"" he says with a smile. Going with the flow Underneath the clatter of all the preparations was the hum of fear that Cop might have to be cancelled. ""The government was really, really committed to going ahead. But the one thing we've learned about Covid is it's been unpredictable and we knew if there was a massive change in the circumstances in Scotland, that could have consequences,"" Mir says. ""Luckily, we never got into that situation."" But an enormous amount of planning went into keeping the risk of people contracting the virus - and spreading it to the rest of the city - as low as possible. All of the attendees had to be vaccinated before travelling, with officials using UK and UN diplomatic networks to deliver doses to several countries where vaccines were not readily available. It was agreed that all Covid vaccines would be accepted, to lower the barrier to delegates from countries where UK-approved jabs were not being offered. After arriving, attendees had to take daily rapid tests, with some 600,000 tests handed out altogether. ""That's not all that simple, because you're dealing with people from almost 200 different countries. Some people aren't used to not just taking the lateral flow tests, but also uploading them,"" Mir says. A testing centre was set up on site with the capacity to process 3,000 people a day for those who had trouble taking tests in their rooms. One unexpected hurdle was that delegates using VPN services based in different countries ran into trouble when trying to upload their test results. That meant calling in the team running the GOV.UK website to forge a workaround. Mir says that, in the end, the anti-Covid measures worked ""better than we thought"": the infection rate among attendees was a quarter of that seen in the population of Glasgow at the time. But it wasn't enough for the event organisers simply to prevent a coronavirus outbreak - and this is where Mir's diplomatic savvy came into play. ""I come from a background of doing a lot of negotiation; we were very conscious that as we did the operation, we had to make sure it didn't just work for our Covid measures, but it worked for delivering negotiations,"" he says. ""We had to make sure it didn't just work for our Covid measures, but it worked for delivering negotiations"" For one thing, social distancing presented not just a logistical challenge, but a diplomatic one. If distancing restrictions meant a meeting room's capacity was limited to 144, that meant not all of the 196 participating countries could have people in the room. A digital platform was set up to enable those who couldn't be physically present to participate in a meaningful way. Organisers were mindful of how being unable to have in-person meetings had hampered multilateral conversations on climate change in the past, and Mir says digital channels ""needed to take account of how negotiation dynamics work, in terms of when people could actually access it just to watch or for two-way communication"". The system also had to allow for participants having to self-isolate - ""but participate in a way that doesn't turn it into a virtual meeting, which then limits our chances of success"". An uphill battle There were other times Mir found himself drawing on his negotiating skills when preparing for Cop26One skirmish in that battle was over the testing infrastructure that government medics determined was needed to make the conference possible. That meant drawn-out conversations with the Treasury to secure funding not just for the testing facilities, but for people who could work with NHS Test and Trace to make the operation work in the context of Cop26.\~ Asked why he thinks getting resources out of the Treasury took so much cajoling, Mir says it was ""perhaps because we were not used to doing things this complicated; we perhaps underestimated a little of what was required"". ""Maybe part of it was the way we were doing this under these circumstances, but it did mean that we had to really push very hard to get people in place,"" Mir says. ""It made it harder to deliver."" Atmospheric change There are few who would conclude that the pledges which ultimately came out of the Cop26 summit represented an unqualified success. Indeed, many felt the Glasgow Climate Pact did not go far enough, as illustrated by Alok Sharma's tearful apology after the agreement was watered down by a last-minute amendment to the text on coal. But Mir says global leaders did take some big steps forward at the summit - completing negotiations on the Paris rulebook that sets out steps towards a zero-carbon future, which have been rumbling on for six years. ""I think all that played a little role in making people feel that the UK as a whole was there to try and help them as much as we could. That, I think, creates the atmosphere where people are willing to make compromises and put their necks on the l"

Fighting back tears, he apologised for the process that had been followed in Glasgow.And while he did not apologise for the outcome to the negotiations, his dejection and despair were clear.COP26 was about steering the world to relatively safe harbour on the climate crisis - in practical terms assuring the Paris Agreement target of a 1.5 degree uplift in global temperatures is actually delivered.But with India and China - two of the world's greatest polluters - putting up a last-minute fight to ditch a pledge to ""phase out"" coal and instead phase it down, an opportunity was lost.It may just be one word, but it gives the wriggle room for coal to continue to be a source of power and heat for years to come.That coal was even on the table could be seen as a win given the reticence in some quarters in years past to even have the debate.But activists called for real action in Glasgow and, while headway was made on a number of important fronts, the outcome was unsatisfactory.

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK200","Europe poised to meet EV targets by 2035","April 29, 2022 Friday 3:41 PM GMT","ICIS Chemical Business","European countries are on track to achieving the COP26 commitment to transition to 100% zero emission car and van sales by 2035, according to the ICIS long-term electric vehicles (EV) forecast. This is largely due to the assumption that the proposal to increase the stringency of CO2 emission standards under the 'Fit for 55' package in the EU, which allows only zero-emission light duty vehicles from 2035, will be passed, implemented and met. The transition is expected to support an increase in power demand from the transport sector and in certain chemicals and polymers demand in Europe over the coming years. ICIS long-term EV forecast According to the ICIS long-term EV forecast, by the end of the year only 1.2% of the total passenger cars in circulation within the 27 EU member states (EU-27) - amounting to over 248m - will be a zero emission vehicle (ZEV). ZEVs include battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen. By 2030, the share of ZEVs registered within EU-27 is forecast to increase to 10%, before rising further to 27% in 2035 when all new vehicles sold are expected to be ZEVs. ZEVs are expected to account for over 48% of the total stock of passenger cars within EU-27 by 2040. When the UK is added to the EU-27 group (EU-27+UK), ZEVs are anticipated to account for 11% of all passenger cars registered in 2030. The share of ZEVs in EU-27+UK is later forecast to account for 28% of the passenger car stock in 2035, before representing half of the total vehicle stock by 2040. Path to zero emission Plans of ending sales of cars with internal combustion engines (ICE), as well as promoting the sale of zero emission cars, vary widely across Europe. Norway is the most ambitious European country, with plans to end petrol and diesel engine vehicles sales by 2025 and all new cars sales being ZEV at the same time. Three European countries - Austria, Germany and the Netherlands - have explicitly targeted ZEV sales only by 2030. The UK seeks this goal by 2035. Countries such as Greece and Slovenia meanwhile have targeted a ban on ICE sales by 2030, without setting a ZEV-explicit target. This means plug-in hybrid electric vehicles - which have a petrol or diesel engine alongside an electric motor - will still be allowed from 2030 onwards. Financial incentives such as tax benefits, purchase subsidy and free parking are important motivators for increasing growth in ZEVs. However, a key differentiator is the availability of public charging infrastructure, said Man Yiu Tse, senior analyst at ICIS. ""A key challenge is to quickly build up charging infrastructure, especially for central and eastern Europe,"" added Tse. ICIS Long-Term Power Analytics modelling forecasts European transport demand to increase from 34.4TWH in 2022 to 156TWh by 2030. Demand for transport is later expected to reach 223.5TWh in 2035, before exceeding 288TWh by 2040. Its impact on European wholesale power prices will depend on the pace at which renewable capacity can be developed, allowing the increasing demand to be met at cheaper costs. EV proposal In July 2021, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal to set more ambitious 2030 targets for reducing the CO2 emissions of new cars and vans, allowing only zero emission vehicles from 2035. Later in November, the COP26 declaration on zero emission cars and vans was launched during transport day at in Scotland. The declaration is a commitment to work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035. Signatories include 17 European countries - excluding Germany and France - and other national governments, alongside regions, vehicle manufacturers, businesses, investors and civil society.

It is a conference that will likely determine what type of world we pass on to future generations.Success will ensure our children and grandchildren can prosper. Failure could spell disaster for life as we know it. Known as COP-26 for short, the United Nations Climate Conference is one of the last opportunities countries will have to come together and solve mankind's greatest challenge - a challenge for its very survival.Six years ago the world saw the birth of the Paris Agreement, which was a milestone in global efforts to address climate change. It resulted in a binding agreement, uniting all nations to a common cause.But it was just the beginning. And yesterday the world began to converge on the great city of Glasgow for the COP26 the next and very crucial step on the path to preventing irreversible and catastrophic climate change.Extreme weather can be seen across the world. This summer we have seen devastating floods in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America. A year ago, Honduras was hit by two ferocious hurricanes leaving significant economic and human damage.Honduras, as a vulnerable country, has a very important voice and its example can lead others to take important steps. Many climate-vulnerable countries are leading the way in reducing emissions.I congratulate Honduras for submitting early this year its updated NDC. Until 2030, Honduras is committed to carrying out adaptation and mitigation actions in the face of climate change. The country will aim to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 16%, restoring 1.3 million hectares of forests and reducing firewood consumption by 39%.Therefore, I congratulate the Honduran delegation, led by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is in Glasgow to join forces on all these issues.

Phasing out coal has been a major issue in COP26. However it is reported that even if the use of fossil fuel was ended immediately the emissions from animal agriculture alone would make it impossible to limit global warming to the 1.5C target.An analysis in 2014 by the Natural Resources Defence Council in the US showed that beef alone was responsible for 34 per cent of all food-related greenhouse gas emissions in that country.As well as global warming, animal agriculture is a leading cause of habitat destruction, desertification, wildlife extinction and ocean dead zones. Although COP26 addressed deforestation, delegates failed to mention that an estimated 80 per cent of global deforestation is caused by the expansion of animal agriculture. Animal agriculture also uses a considerable amount of water. A global scientific study revealed ""animal products have a large water footprint relative to crop products."" To make matters worse, animal agriculture is also a cause of land, water and air pollution.The conditions in which many farmed animals are kept has resulted in the over-use of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are among the gravest health threats to humans. Health officials say this will only get worse if the overuse of these drugs continues.Low on the list of priorities for animal agriculture, welfare standards vary considerably worldwide.Even though the UK boasts of high standards, many undercover investigations have revealed heartbreaking conditions and treatment of animals. A recent expose by Sky News about beef production in Brazil revealed sickening cruelty. The feature said that it was impossible to trace where the beef was eventually sold.There has never been a better time to reduce meat consumption or give it up - for the planet, for health and for the animals.Elizabeth Allison,ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

And the Climate Change Committee, the statutory body that advises UK and devolved governments on emissions targets, has warned that the government's climate policies are not sufficient to meet its own targets.It reminds Johnson and Sunak that these instructions cannot just be for other countries: as the holder of the continuing COP presidency for the next year, the UK government must lead by example and implement them at home.The letter therefore calls for a new cross-governmental initiative to review how current policies could be implemented more quickly, and what new policies could accelerate action.Among areas the letter proposes for further policy development are for partnerships with businesses and unions in high carbon sectors to establish ""just transition plans"". These would give businesses, workers and communities protection from potential adverse impacts of decarbonisation and support a transition to greener business models and jobs.Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said: ""Our call for a significant increase in public investment in green tech and industry will safeguard jobs in Britain's industrial heartlands."" This, she said, would also help create ""good quality new jobs across the UK"".

It is a conference that will likely determine what type of world we pass on to future generations.Success will ensure our children and grandchildren can prosper. Failure could spell disaster for life as we know it. Known as COP-26 for short, the United Nations Climate Conference is one of the last opportunities countries will have to come together and solve mankind's greatest challenge - a challenge for its very survival.Six years ago the world saw the birth of the Paris Agreement, which was a milestone in global efforts to address climate change. It resulted in a binding agreement, uniting all nations to a common cause.But it was just the beginning. And yesterday the world began to converge on the great city of Glasgow for the COP26 the next and very crucial step on the path to preventing irreversible and catastrophic climate change.Extreme weather can be seen across the world. This summer we have seen devastating floods in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America. A year ago, Honduras was hit by two ferocious hurricanes leaving significant economic and human damage.Honduras, as a vulnerable country, has a very important voice and its example can lead others to take important steps. Many climate-vulnerable countries are leading the way in reducing emissions.I congratulate Honduras for submitting early this year its updated NDC. Until 2030, Honduras is committed to carrying out adaptation and mitigation actions in the face of climate change. The country will aim to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 16%, restoring 1.3 million hectares of forests and reducing firewood consumption by 39%.Therefore, I congratulate the Honduran delegation, led by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is in Glasgow to join forces on all these issues. Honduras has shown important leadership in the fight against climate change and I encourage the country to work constructively with partners to achieve a successful COP26.

It's a partnership that serves as a high profile example of the industry's transition away from fossil fuels - but did it accomplish much for the brand?Data from YouGov BrandIndex UK shows that, over the Cop26 conference from 31 October to 13 November, Impression scores for Jaguar (a net measure of overall positive and negative sentiment towards a brand) rose from 11.6 to 15.5 (+3.9), while Recommendation scores jumped up from -1.8 to 6.9 over the same period (+8.7). The automaker, whose IPACE vehicles were provided to senior politicians and other important conference attendees, also saw Reputation scores - a measure of whether consumers would be proud or embarrassed to work for a brand - improve dramatically: increasing from 11.3 to 20.9 (+9.6).The event even seems to have had a positive impact on overall brand health too. Index scores - a measure of brand health calculated by the average of Impression, Quality, Value, Satisfaction, Recommend, and Reputation scores - doubled from 4.7 to 10.1. While metrics further down the purchase funnel like Consideration remained relatively static over Cop26, if the point was to burnish Jaguar's ecological credentials, it may have worked: the public were more likely to have a positive opinion of the brand across several measures than before the conference.Data from YouGov Profiles shows that seven in 10 Britons think electric cars are the ""future of the motor industry"", and two in five say they try to buy only from companies that are socially and environmentally responsible. Rather than being dragged into this future kicking and screaming, Jaguar's partnership with Cop26 suggests an understanding of popular sentiment - one that was, in this case, rewarded.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

The S6 pupils were leading the COP26 event in our assembly hall and helped organise the content.\\xE2They got a huge amount of leadership skills out of it, which is great for their UCAS applications, and the S1 pupils really got to integrate with senior pupils, which they really enjoyed.\\xE2Ross Greer, who represents Renfrewshire as Green MSP for West Scotland, attended the morning event to answer questions from pupils.Natalie Don, MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, also attended at the school in the afternoon to speak with students as the main part of the mock COP26 event got under way.She said: \\xE2I was delighted to attend Park Mains High School\\xE2s S1 COP26 event to see a very informative presentation by the pupils focusing on the contributions by various countries and companies regarding climate change, and the steps they are taking towards achieving net zero carbon emissions.\\xE2It is extremely important that the voices of young people are listened to on vitally important issues such as tackling climate change so it was brilliant to chat to some of the pupils to hear their thoughts on what our priorities should be for the years ahead.\\xE2As well as running the mock COP26 event, the secondary school has a very active eco-club which organises a weekly bottle drive to raise money for charity.The school is also in the process of working to get its eco-flag and has started collecting crisp packets to help create blankets for homeless people.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

Every action taken today will impact their future and it's vital that they therefore have their say on what they want for a cleaner and greener future.'This survey shows that children and young people understand the climate emergency and recognise that renewable energy has a crucial part to play as we move forward, electrify our lives and reduce our carbon footprint. We fully support the call for more renewable energy and we're doing everything we can to make it happen - investing almost GBP4 billion to double our current renewables capacity by 2025, with plans to treble it by 2030.'Importantly, the survey also shows that young people know we all have the power to make a real difference to the environment by making changes in how we live our lives. Whether that's in how we travel around, the food we eat or the clothes we wear - it all matters - and it's great that COP is inspiring such positive action from young people.'With human behaviour responsible for many of the changes to our planet, the only way we'll be successful in tackling the climate emergency is by everyone joining in and doing their bit. Young people understand that - it's something we can all learn from and something that can give us all hope for a clean energy future.'As part of its COP26 education programme, ScottishPower Renewables is also working with Glasgow Science Centre on a Renewables Challenge for 124 primary schools and 10 secondary schools.

Perhaps cement should have been on the list tooShockingly, the conference declaration was the first ever to mention fossil fuel emissions in the context of climate change.\~ Aligning the legitimate rights of most of the world's population to a quality of life with challenging fossil fuel reduction targets was never going to be easy, and the fair ""phasing down"" of fossil fuel use will be the defining geo-political problem of the next 30 years.As a result, measured against the key aim of ""keeping 1.5 alive"", the conference fell short of hope if not its limited ambition. An assessment of the latest Nationally Defined Contributions (NDCs) by Climate Action Tracker (CAT) shows that there is a 50% chance that the CO2 budget for the 1.5\'baC global warming target will be exhausted by the early 2030s.\~That is even before the UK plans to phase out gas boilers. Clearly the trajectory will need to accelerate, but who is going to jump first?>> All our COP26 coverage in one placePart of the problem is that major emitters including China, Australia, Russia and Brazil did not propose tougher targets for COP26.\~ That means that a lot of progress on NDCs will be needed over the next 12 months. If that does not happen, then the focus of COP27 will need to shift decisively to resilience and adaption. This is already an urgent requirement.\~A big disappointment in the final agreement is the shameful rejection of the proposed Loss and Damage Fund designed to support countries affected by climate change. This short-term decision will do little to win hearts and minds of developing nations and shows that the liabilities of the developed world will only grow and grow.Turning closer to home, construction had a high-profile COP26, and it is fair to say that both the CLC and UKGBC achieved a high profile on the COP fringe, with the launch of the Net Zero Whole Life Carbon Roadmap and the publication of the first update of the ConstructZero Performance Framework. I enjoyed the CLC sessions and in particular appreciated the examples of pragmatic steps being taken to remove carbon from construction through choice of materials, wider adoption of manufacturing and a more mindful management of the vehicle fleet.\~Carbon trading could hold the key to the creation of a genuinely global market for high quality carbon abatementFor me, the most striking presentation came from Darren James of Keltbray, highlighting the firm's commitment to expand the use of low carbon concrete.\~ Darren nailed home the point that everyone in the project team, from client and funder to engineer and QS, has a role in enabling or delaying the adoption of this critical material.\~ The argument could have been made at any point over the past 15 years or more, but I feel we are reaching a tipping point in the adoption of low-carbon cement.In the run-up to COP26, the prime minister helpfully summarised the priorities as being coal, cars, cash and trees. Perhaps cement should have been on the list too. Cement accounts for 8% of global carbon emissions and, if it were a country, it would be the world's third-biggest emitter after China and the US. Now that deforestation targets have been agreed, perhaps cement should be added to the 3Cs of climate change for COP27?There was another agreement in connection with carbon trading that will also accelerate the decarbonisation of cement. Carbon trading is a dry issue that has remained unresolved since the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. It could hold the key to the creation of a genuinely global market for high quality carbon abatement.The new agreement will create a centralised carbon trading system and will underpin bilateral trading of credits between nations. Crucially, the quality of credits will improve, attracting large volumes of investment into abatement schemes such as afforestation and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).\~Ultimately this means that more cement users will pay carbon credits, which in turn will drive demand for low-carbon materials. Products are likely to be more expensive, but crucially, investment in expanded manufacturing capacity will follow alongside other net-zero manufacture such as the plasterboard plant that St-Gobain is\~ already developing in the UK.\~\~If the construction sector asks what COP26 did for it, accelerated carbon trading is the answer.The danger with a high-profile event such as\~ is of course that, once the delegates have gone home and the conference set-up has been struck, then the world reverts to existing habits.\~ The UK was the first nation to be on a legally binding trajectory to net zero and it is arguable that we are doing our bit.\~\~However, the UK is behind the curve and our trajectory is neither deep nor fast enough to keep 1.5 alive. The reality is that events like COP26 can achieve only so much, but then other actors need to crowd in to finish the job - governments, business, people. Rather than looking back to what COP26 could have achieved, we all now need to decide what more we can do.Simon Rawlinson is a partner at Arcadis and a member of the Construction Leadership Council\l"

Experts roundly agreed these natural disasters were more severe as a result of the world warming up.And predictions suggest average temperatures for the year will confirm 2021\' s place among the top seven hottest years since records began.It was against this background the United Nations brought its annual climate talks to Glasgow in November.COP26 was seen as the most significant UN climate summit since 2015, when the Paris Agreement was set out.In a speech at the outset of the summit, World Meteorological Organisation secretary-general Professor Petteri Taalas gave a disturbing round-up of recent occurrences and warned they would soon be commonplace.

On top of this, an increase in global temperature would lead to entire communities being swept away in storms, with category 4 and 5 tropical storms becoming more common on a yearly basis. What does the final agreement say?COP26 ended with the formation of the Glasgow Climate Pact- an agreement built upon the foundations laid out by the Paris Agreement of 2015.Below is a breakdown of the various components of the agreement made last weekend.Fossil fuelsThis was one of the most notable topics of conversation at COP26, as up until now no agreement has ever been made that explicitly refers to fossil fuels.Despite significant progress being made regarding the inclusion of fossil fuels in COP26's agreement, a last-minute dispute over coal use on Saturday evening almost derailed the entire conference.Initially it was agreed that countries would  accelerate efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and accelerate the phase-out of  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies .However, following a push led by China, and backed up by India, it was decided to change the language from accelerating the  phase out of unabated coal to  phase down - a move that prompted angry responses from vulnerable countries.Nevertheless the addition of fossil fuels to the agreement is a historic step forward towards halting the climate crisis. FinancesDespite the 2015 Paris Agreement stating that at least $100 billion per year in climate finance was necessary to halt the climate emergency, many countries have not yet made the steps to reach this target. The failure of rich countries to meet this was a popular topic of conversation at this month's summit, and on Sunday a new commitment was made by nations to now deliver on their promises every year through to 2025.Cutting emissionsThis means that countries with weak climate plans will now be under more pressure to improve their plans by next year.The countries that are most affected by this new agenda are China, Australia, the US and Saudi Arabia.Despite the progress of this agreement, Australia has already suggested it will ignore calls to update its target.When is the next summit?COP 27 was originally expected to take place from 8 to 20 November 2021.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, COP 26 was rescheduled from November 2020 to November 2021.As a result, COP 27 will take place from 7 to 18 November 2022, giving countries a year to meet the requirements laid out in the Glasgow Climate Pact.Support the YEP and become a subscriber today.

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK274","COP26","FT.com"," ","COP26 enters its final stretch, many of those here in Glasgow are in a reflective mood, considering what has been achieved at the summit  and the huge amount that has not.One thing on many people\' s minds is the unprecedented business presence at COP26, and the corresponding influence that big companies have had on the conversation on the ground. For Jules Kortenhorst, a veteran COP-goer and head of the influential non-profit consultancy RMI, businesses\' interest in climate action is much welcomed  but also a trend to be handled with care.Kortenhorst told me that he met with more Fortune 100 chief executives at COP26 than at the previous 10 UN climate summits combined.  For 15 years I\' ve been coming to this party, he said.  Now new friends are showing up at the party, and that is encouraging . . . They\' re quickly learning where the bar is, and how to dance, but we\' re not yet 100 per cent sure that they can be good partygoers. The key, Kortenhorst said, would be serious measurement and accountability mechanisms to gauge businesses\' progress in mitigating their environmental impact. That was a significant focus of the HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/d91b5934-de9e-4eef-a008-697bce53263f Big Read that Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and I wrote this week, which looked at the rising scrutiny that has accompanied the explosion of corporate messaging on climate action.As this is the last of our special daily editions during COP26, below, Gillian and I consider the summit\' s five biggest talking points.

Nuclear power has traditionally been seen as HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/0d0e300c-18da-449f-a545-100ab2dd207e  villain number one https://www.ft.com/content/0823c7a9-ca75-4a75-96cb-e0c006ca791c mea culpa by GillianTalking pointCOP26 looks set to fall short of achieving the serious global breakthroughs needed to tackle the climate crisis  but it has provided plenty of food for thought for those tracking the business and economic implications. Check out HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/f3ce7f9e-a987-4ab3-ae4d-ae4bff283635 Gillian\' s column1. Carbon pricingSix years after Article 6 of the Paris agreement set out the basic principles for a well-functioning international carbon market, it\' s far from clear that COP26 will move the world much further towards implementing them. But there seems to be an emerging consensus on the need to substantially expand and strengthen existing carbon pricing mechanisms  and to create entirely new ones  to align businesses\' and consumers\' economic incentives with the drive for a lower-carbon economy. Expect increasingly tough scrutiny of the voluntary carbon offset market, and a more prominent debate around the rollout of carbon tax regimes.2. Assessment and transparencyIn the months leading up to , there was a striking pick-up in complaints of  greenwashing , and warnings that companies must deliver credible, short-term action alongside their lofty, long-term environmental goals. There has been a huge focus in Glasgow on the need for better mechanisms to assess corporate progress on this front. Executives and investors will need to pay close attention to initiatives such as the IFRS Foundation\' s new International Sustainability Standards Board. And those relying on voluntary offsets to achieve their net-zero goals should be prepared for much tougher standards.3. Energy security has inevitably had an impact on the conversation at the summit, and related concerns will remain live in the months ahead. It has been a big obstacle to accelerating the demise of coal-fired power, particularly in China. And with governments also nervous about the supply of liquid and gas fuels, that\' s a headache for those hoping to see a rapid phase-out of the trillions of dollars in subsidies dished out to the global fossil fuel industry.4. TechnologyIn the past fortnight there have been some intense conversations about the technology that could prove crucial in the climate battle. One especially hot topic is nuclear power. The UK and French governments, for example, are stepping up their focus on nuclear as a significant plank in the global climate response, while some in the environmental movement remain leery. Another area of controversy is hydrogen: expect more arguments over the need to ramp up funding for  green hydrogen  which uses renewable energy-powered electrolysis  and whether there is any place for  blue hydrogen, which is derived from natural gas. The debate is picking up, too, about the storage systems that will be required as part of renewable-heavy electricity grids. Should the world focus on scaling up large-scale lithium ion batteries, or on potentially more efficient, but still emerging, alternative technologies?5. China-US relations HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/5685fb73-8018-4ef0-bfd3-fd70e6aa0cbb excellent FT analysisQuote of the day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxD5OsS2Z3A called for continued progress on climate agreements as the official COP26 policy discussions come to a close.  1.5 degrees is still in reach but [it] is on life support . . . hope should be sustained until the very last moment. I still hope for a big push today and tomorrow for an agreement on increased ambition. Beyond Glasgow: The worldview Geopolitical tension between the US and China remains, but at least one area in which there is  more agreement between China and the US than there is disagreement , is climate, HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/52782a97-0f77-4d1c-bfc4-419d17a485e9 according to China\' s top climate policymaker Xie Zhenhua. The angst that exists between the world\' s two largest economies is downplayed in the newly signed agreement that sets the US and China on a path to boost climate co-operation. But the question remains whether the bilateral pact will lead to action. As part of the statement, China pledged to begin addressing its methane emissions, but the agreement otherwise had little in the way of details. This is on top of the fact that President Xi Jinping failed to attend the conference in Glasgow and the country has HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/1b203a3e-efdf-49b8-8fa9-72f9ec963501 dragged its feet on agreeing to phase out coal. Still, China has expressed frustration that its climate action has not been  appreciated . This week, Wang Yi, a senior adviser to the Chinese delegation, HYPERLINK toldThe Guardian that the criticism on China was  based on incomprehension or misunderstanding . HYPERLINK https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202111/11/WS618cf7e1a310cdd39bc74d48.html wrote on Thursday that China had demonstrated  goodwill through the climate agreement, which could help to address the  protracted, though fruitless, blame game going on between Beijing and Washington .Meanwhile, Xi HYPERLINK https://english.cctv.com/2021/11/11/ARTIk6P4B4cyq2qzgDCDzO87211111.shtml?spm=C69523.PDoRdCIUTBov.S54480.4 said in a speech to Asian business leaders that China would  strike a balance between the green transition and the living needs of its people, as he reinforced China\' s call for rich nations to step up their climate-related support for developing ones.  Developed economies should act on a sense of being in the same community with other economies, he added.Under the new China-US  working group to be set up under this week\' s agreement, this bilateral climate conversation is set to continue despite the wider strategic tensions  and China will hope that it may yet make the world  appreciate its green agenda.

What is Cop26? Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year is the 26th iteration of the annual meeting. HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop26-glasgow-news-boris-johnson-today-b1948885.htmlFollow Cop26 Glasgow news live: Latest updates from climate summitThe 197 signatories, or ""parties"", to the UNFCCC will all be represented in Glasgow, along with tens of thousands of negotiators, government officials, businesses and activists, all hoping to make their voices heard and see a comprehensive plan drawn up to realise the goals of the 2015 HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paris-agreementParis Agreement and avert the global climate catastrophe our planet faces. What is the UNFCCC? The UNFCCC was first signed at the June 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by 154 nations and was intended as a treaty to rein in ""dangerous human interference with the climate system"", primarily by stabilising the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, whose unchecked dispersion drives HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/global-heatingglobal heating. The framework called for ongoing collaboration on scientific research and regular meetings, negotiations and policy agreements between world governments to ensure fragile ecosystems were not unduly damaged by climate change, that the global food supply remained unimpeded and that economic development was allowed to proceed sustainably. What is the Kyoto Protocol? The first significant agreement between parties to the treaty was the HYPERLINK Kyoto Protocol , which was signed in the Japanese city in December 1997 and set strict emission reduction targets on six gases for 37 industrialised nations and the European Union, but not the US or other major carbon-emitting superpowers like China and India.Following ratification by Russia and Canada, the protocol came into effect in February 2005 and aimed to reduce harmful emissions in participating countries by five per cent from 1990 levels in phase one (2008-12) and by an ambitious 18 per cent in phase two (2013-20), an extension agreed in December 2012 and known as the Doha Amendment.While events like the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the global financial crisis of 2007-08 did help to bring down rates of industrial pollution, a UN Environmental Programme report published at the end of phase one in 2012 found that emissions had nevertheless boomed by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010 despite the recent efforts of the protocol's participants, again underlining the scale of the task and the need to swap fossil fuel dependance for more renewable sources of energy before the damage becomes irreversible. What is the Paris Agreement? The more wide-ranging Paris Agreement, drafted in December 2015, signed in April 2016 and intended as a successor to Kyoto, applied to all 195 signatories and not just the more developed nations, obliging everyone to do their part to keep the global temperature rise well below 2C by the century's end and for all nations to hit net-zero emissions by 2050.This time the US was on board, until, that is, HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trumpDonald Trump succeeded HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/barack-obamaBarack Obama and withdrew from the agreement, only for the Republican to lose the White House after just one disastrous term and be replaced by Democrat HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joe-bidenJoe Biden , who swiftly rejoined on his first day in the Oval Office.Countries signed up to the Paris accord are committed to nationally-determined contributions, individual emissions reductions targets tailored to their particular circumstances that are reviewed and reassessed every five years. Why does Cop26 matter? Cop26 is seeking to firm up those commitments made in the French capital and its HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-goals/specific stated concerns""Around the world storms, floods and wildfires are intensifying,"" the HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/uk-presidency/Cop26 website states , stressing the urgent need to act.""Air pollution sadly affects the health of tens of millions of people and unpredictable weather causes untold damage to homes and livelihoods too.""But while the impacts of climate change are devastating, advances in tackling it are leading to cleaner air, creating good jobs, restoring nature and at the same time unleashing economic growth.""Despite the opportunities we are not acting fast enough.

He was forced to pull out of a live appearance on The Sunday Show , BBC Scotland's politics programme, and was interviewed by video link instead.""I don't feel too bad but I am confined to quarters,"" he told the programme. ""So far Covid doesn't seem to have had a big impact on the summit, but we will see.

The Scottish government is offering booster shots.Hospital cases throughout Scotland hit a three week low of 841 on Saturday, including 59 in intensive care, but infection rates have been fluctuating over the last month with no clear trend.Glasgow now has one of the lowest case rates in Scotland at 223 per 100,000, well below the average of 333 per 100,000 and half the rate of East Ayrshire, which has more than 500 per 100,000.Cases are allocated to local authorities based on home postcodes, so the data may not capture positive cases among delegates.Tens of thousands of people marched through Glasgow to show their support for tackling climate change on Saturday, posing a possible infection risk to local residents.John Swinney, the Scottish minister for Covid recovery, told MSPs on Thursday that public health officials were monitoring transmission in and around Cop26 closely. ""A lot of people have come into the country for the summit,"" he said. ""As we have flagged up to parliament already, there is the possibility of a rise in infection rates over the autumn or winter which might put further strain on the system. We have to be mindful of the fact that we are dealing with a moving picture on the data.""Betts offered a downbeat assessment of the progress of the Cop26 conference, saying it was ""not going to be the meeting that solves the climate problem in a single bite"".""The truth is we have made significant progress in tackling climate change and we will have made more at this meeting, but it is just nothing like enough so we are going to need to accelerate,"" he said.He welcomed ""ambitious commitments"" from South Africa, Columbia, Argentina and India, but criticised China for failing to set similar targets.""If you aggregate all of the [agreements] together, and you have to make a lot of assumptions, maybe we might be on track for something like [2C of warming],"" he said.

It is now within reach.""At COP26 in these final days we just need to reach out together and grasp it.""So my question to my fellow world leaders as we enter the last hours of COP26 is - will you help us do that?""Will you help us grasp the opportunity or will you stand in the way?""He also highlighted a conversation he had with Surangel Whipps, the president of Palau, who said if big economies don't do more they ""might as well bomb his islands"".Before COP26This is a document that basically sums up everything discussed at the conference, and details what progress needs to come from the negotiations that have taken place.Yesterday leaders, including Boris Johnson, were asked to examine a draft of this document and agree on its contents.The document says vulnerable nations must get more help to cope with the deadly impact of global warming, and says more finance is needed for them beyond the promised $100 billion a year by 2020, which will now not be delivered until at least 2022.It adds that countries need to speed up the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels, although it is likely there will be strong resistance on this from some countries.It also says countries should submit a long-term strategy by the end of next year for how they will meet net zero, and says UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres should gather world leaders together in 2023 to consider how efforts to reach climate change targets by 2030 are shaping up.Ultimately, it reiterates the importance of meeting the terms and conditions of the Paris Agreement which says global warming needs to be limited to well below 2 degrees, preferably 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial levels.However scientists have warned that to meet these targets global emissions need to be cut by 45% by 2030 and then to zero by the middle of the century.\l"

It usually accounts for about half the domestic total. Moreover, some meeting venues have low ratings for energy efficiency.Leaders negotiate deals most effectively face-to-face. And a virtual preparatory meeting in June suffered from timezone underlaps and tech hitches. But many COP26 attendees will be bag carriers, lobbyists and other inessential tag-alongs.

What is Cop26? Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year is the 26th iteration of the annual meeting. HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paris-agreementParis Agreement and avert the global climate catastrophe our planet faces. What is the UNFCCC? The UNFCCC was first signed at the June 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by 154 nations and was intended as a treaty to rein in ""dangerous human interference with the climate system"", primarily by stabilising the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, whose unchecked dispersion drives HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/global-heatingglobal heating. The framework called for ongoing collaboration on scientific research and regular meetings, negotiations and policy agreements between world governments to ensure fragile ecosystems were not unduly damaged by climate change, that the global food supply remained unimpeded and that economic development was allowed to proceed sustainably. What is the Kyoto Protocol? The first significant agreement between parties to the treaty was the HYPERLINK Kyoto Protocol , which was signed in the Japanese city in December 1997 and set strict emission reduction targets on six gases for 37 industrialised nations and the European Union, but not the US or other major carbon-emitting superpowers like China and India.Following ratification by Russia and Canada, the protocol came into effect in February 2005 and aimed to reduce harmful emissions in participating countries by five per cent from 1990 levels in phase one (2008-12) and by an ambitious 18 per cent in phase two (2013-20), an extension agreed in December 2012 and known as the Doha Amendment.While events like the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the global financial crisis of 2007-08 did help to bring down rates of industrial pollution, a UN Environmental Programme report published at the end of phase one in 2012 found that emissions had nevertheless boomed by 32 per cent between 1990 and 2010 despite the recent efforts of the protocol's participants, again underlining the scale of the task and the need to swap fossil fuel dependance for more renewable sources of energy before the damage becomes irreversible. What is the Paris Agreement? The more wide-ranging Paris Agreement, drafted in December 2015, signed in April 2016 and intended as a successor to Kyoto, applied to all 195 signatories and not just the more developed nations, obliging everyone to do their part to keep the global temperature rise well below 2C by the century's end and for all nations to hit net-zero emissions by 2050.This time the US was on board, until, that is, HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trumpDonald Trump succeeded HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/barack-obamaBarack Obama and withdrew from the agreement, only for the Republican to lose the White House after just one disastrous term and be replaced by Democrat HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joe-bidenJoe Biden , who swiftly rejoined on his first day in the Oval Office.Countries signed up to the Paris accord are committed to nationally-determined contributions, individual emissions reductions targets tailored to their particular circumstances that are reviewed and reassessed every five years.

More than one in five savers (22%) report being unhappy with the results of COP26, while a further 22% feel the world's governments won't solve climate change.In contrast, when asked about the power of investments to significantly cut carbon emissions, 72% of Brits expressed an interest in learning more or already believed it could drive real change. On average, a UK pension pot finances 23 tonnes of CO2 emissions through the businesses it invests in, and millions of UK savers may unknowingly be invested in high carbon emitters, by virtue of being in their default workplace scheme, as more than 95% of savers are.Despite more than a quarter (26%) of respondents revealing that they are likely or very likely to switch to a green pension to reduce their emissions, only 1% of UK consumers report being currently invested in a green pension. Top barriers to switching include a belief that individuals don't have a choice because their employers pick their plan (28%), not knowing how to switch as their pension feels very complex (13%), and believing that they've not saved enough for their pension investments to matter (12%).These views highlight the importance of savers' considering consolidating their workplace pensions into a fund that aligns with their vision for the future when they move jobs. It also reinforces the need for the pensions industry to provide digital solutions that enable savers to see how much they have saved and manage their pots simply.Clare Reilly, Chief Engagement Officer at PensionBee, commented: ""Our research highlights that most savers across the UK have little faith in the key agreements made by politicians at COP26, and instead believe in the power of their investments to decrease carbon emissions.Since its launch last year, PensionBee's Fossil Fuel Free Plan has attracted many new people to responsible investing. As evidenced in our recent survey, the plan has not only succeeded in engaging a mainstream audience in an important debate but also in widening participation for more people to use their pensions to address the climate crisis.

On the Cities, Regions, and Built Environment Day at COP26, I met with representatives from councils across the world, who all recognised the role they must have in meeting the climate targets.""Councils are huge procurers of goods and services; they own buildings and use energy; they manage fleets of vehicles; they educate and support skills development; they are responsible for waste collection and have an influential role over the local environment, and all this on a world-wide basis.""So when we argued that we should be included in the Glasgow Agreement, it was for all this to be recognised, for the responsibility of our councils to be acknowledged and action expected from us all. And by succeeding in having the local and regional included in the final outcome from Glasgow, it is giving a message to national governments that councils everywhere need to be properly resourced to be able to adapt as we must. It is also clear that communities have a role in responding to climate change.""Councils work more closely with communities than other spheres of government, and by forming partnerships together and providing local leadership, many local steps can be taken world-wide to reaching the climate targets.

Please read on for our summary of the key events from the first week of COP26.Some, but not all, of the world's top carbon emitters have committed to taking action: HYPERLINK https://www.actuarialpost.co.uk/images/pic_hymans_cop26_1_111121.jpgLink to ImageSource: Climate Action Tracker.Perhaps most notably is the commitment from India to target net zero emissions by 2070. Although this target is later than required under the Paris Agreement, it is a significant step in the right direction given the nation is one of the world's top carbon emitters. According to Thomas Hale, Oxford University, based on commitments made at COP26, over 90% of global GDP (and 84% of carbon emissions) is now covered by a net zero target. This signifies a material step forward.Closer to home, Rishi Sunak announced that the UK will require companies listed on the London Stock Exchange to publish their plans for delivering net zero by no later than 2050, by 2023. Although further detail is required, one should expect this to signal a significant wave of action to address climate change in the UK. Other commitments made during the week included: Around $18bn pledged globally to assist with the transition from coal to clean energy; 28 countries joined an international alliance to phase out coal, but China, US and India did not commit; The US, UK, France, Germany and the EU announced plans to fund South Africa's transition away from coal; Around 100 nations and parties signed a global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% of 2020 levels by 2030; A number of nations, including the UK, announced plans to tackle deforestation over the period to 2030; African nations have committed to spending $6bn on adapting to climate impacts.Was the first week of a success? The IEA estimates that the various commitments made during the week could reduce global warming potential from 2.7 degrees to 1.8 degrees. Although this doesn't quite reach the 1.5 degree target set out in the Paris Agreement, it would represent a strong step towards this goal, provided that those responsible adhere to these commitments.What matters now is the action that countries take over the next few years to back up these actions. This means that politicians must put in place the necessary policies and regulations, and sell changes to local electorates.Pessimism is in the air Friday 5th November was Youth and Public Empowerment Day at . Greta Thunberg suggested that 'our leaders are not leading' and casted doubt over the validity of commitments made during the week. The lack of representation from China and Russia has also been used widely as a symbol of failure at COP26.COP26 HYPERLINK Link to Image The first week of COP26, on the face of it, appears to have been positive, with more of the world covered by a net zero target and significant levels of capital committed to addressing climate issues. However, as ever, the rhetoric needs to back this up with quick and concerted action, with critics likely to be of the view that ""we have been here before"". Those responsible for pension schemes will have an important role to play to make sure that their fund managers hold individual companies and entities to account relative to these higher standards, and be prepared to take action if efforts to progress don't go far enough.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

Under the proposals the Woodhouse colliery, near Whitehaven in Cumbria, would be the UK's first new deep coal mine since the 1980s. It would extract coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea, 85 per cent of which would be exported.According to a report in The Sunday Telegraph, Michael Gove, the levelling-up, housing and communities secretary, could approve the contentious new mine as soon as next month. The coking coal would be used by the steel industry, but critics have said it is unnecessary now that hydrogen and electricity-based technologies can be used to make steel. The mine has already attracted international condemnation, with Joe Biden's climate envoy John Kerry criticising the plans ahead of the Cop26 summit hosted by the UK last year, calling coal ""the dirtiest fuel in the world"".""Senior Conservative Party sources"" told The Sunday Telegraph that Mr Gove is believed to be supportive of the plan to open the mine, and his decision will largely hinge on recommendations set out by the Planning Inspectorate.

It is a conference that will likely determine what type of world we pass on to future generations.Success will ensure our children and grandchildren can prosper. Failure could spell disaster for life as we know it. Known as COP-26 for short, the United Nations Climate Conference is one of the last opportunities countries will have to come together and solve mankind\' s greatest challenge \- a challenge for its very survival.Six years ago the world saw the birth of the Paris Agreement, which was a milestone in global efforts to address climate change. It resulted in a binding agreement, uniting all nations to a common cause.This cause was to adapt to the effects of climate change, limit the increase in global average temperature to well below two degrees, pursuing efforts towards 1.5, with respect to pre-industrial levels. In Paris, world leaders provided the world with consensus, ambition and hope.But it was just the beginning. And yesterday the world began to converge on the great city of Glasgow for the COP26 the next and very crucial step on the path to preventing irreversible and catastrophic climate change.Extreme weather can be seen across the world. This summer we have seen devastating floods in central Europe and China, raging wildfires in North America. A year ago, Guatemala was hit by two ferocious hurricanes leaving significant economic and human damage.The impact of a relatively small temperature increase is already posing challenges to humanity. It does not require a vivid imagination to picture how much more serious the impact of climate change will be if we do not act now.Guatemala, as a vulnerable country, has a very important voice and its example can lead others to take important steps. Many climate-vulnerable countries are leading the way in reducing emissions.I witnessed with great enthusiasm a week ago the granting of forest concessions in Pet\'e9n and how the Maya Biosphere Reserve is a lung of the world that counteracts global emissions. I am also proud of the efforts that the UK is making to create a greener future.But to make the difference needed to meet the 1.5 degree temperature limit to be enshrined in the Paris Agreement much more is needed. All countries need to set ambitious emission reduction targets, businesses need to adapt and create new green pathways to success and individuals need to change their lifestyles and leave behind a greener footprint.COP26 is not a photo shoot. It is not a talking shop. It is a forum where the world\' s leaders and country delegations must map out a better path. A path leading to the preservation of the world as we know it.Therefore, I congratulate the Guatemalan delegation that will soon travel to Glasgow to join forces on all these issues. Guatemala has shown important leadership in the fight against climate change through its emission reduction policy, in the protection of forests and also in the preservation of water sources.All of this is crucial in creating a future, which we can look forward to with more optimism, boost economic growth and create prosperity. We must all do our part because the world will either succeed or fail as one. Moreover, we are almost at the end of the road.In the next few days, we will see a series of excellent articles in HYPERLINK https://www.prensalibre.com/tema/cop26/ Prensa Libre addressing the issues of COP26 and its relationship with Guatemala.

This means the West Midlands public transport network will not produce carbon emissions, which contribute to global warming.As part of this, the mayor will show off two zero-emission trains built in the West Midlands - one powered by an electric battery and another powered by hydrogen. Mr Street said: ""The West Midlands was the birthplace of the first industrial revolution, but the advances it brought came at a heavy price for our planet.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"
"COP26","UK","COP26_UK306","Has the Cop26 deal achieved what it needed to?","November 14, 2021 Sunday 12:23 AM GMT","The Independent (United Kingdom)","Cop26 has finally concluded with the agreement of the Glasgow Climate Pact.The intense negotiations among 197 nations - with the aim of preventing catastrophic global warming - went down to the wire with a lengthy, 24-hour delay and then last-minute interventions to water down language on coal by India and China.Following the conclusion, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said it had been an ""extremely challenging conference"". Cop26 was postponed for a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and participants have faced issues with access due to vaccine requirements and travel restrictions.Mr Guterres called the approved texts a ""compromise"".""They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions,"" he said.He then reiterated his remarks from beginning of . ""We must accelerate action to keep the 1.5 degree goal alive,"" he said. ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. It is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.""Whether the Glasgow pact achieves what set out to do, has received a middling grade.The agreement does not close the gap to the aspirational 1.5C of the Paris deal - but then, few expected that it would.Rather it keeps ""alive"" that possibility. Helen Mountford, vice president of climate and economics at World Resources Institute, said that the purpose of the agreement in Glasgow was to put in place firm processes to close the gap to 1.5C.One significant achievement of the Glasgow deal was that countries were ""requested"" (strong language by UN standards) to set more ambitious 2030 emissions-reduction targets, and return before the end of 2022 with plans for how they would go about this. This is a step up from the previous date of 2025.Recent HYPERLINK https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop26-glasgow-summit-climate-pledges-b1954207.htmlanalysis shows that countries' current 2030 plans would result in 2.4C of global heating by 2100, far above the 1.5C aspiration of Paris, and the ""well below"" 2C it set as the safe outer limit.Whether countries will work towards these tougher plans remains to be seen. ""We will really know if it has succeeded when we come back next year and see what countries have done. It's really about what they do this coming Monday morning,"" Ms Mountford said early on Saturday.The UN chief has also said that climate promises ""ring hollow"" when fossil fuel subsidies are still in existence. The value of fossil fuel subsidies globally was around $6 trillion last year, according to International Monetary Fund. The final Glasgow pact did not end the measures that artificially lower the cost of oil, gas and coal but instead called for ""accelerating efforts"" to phase out ""inefficient"" subsidies. A global call for ending coal use also fell short. In a sudden, last-minute move, China and India intervened to water down language in the final text: meaning that a call to ""phase out"" unabated coal power was changed to ""phase down"".The text also noted with ""deep regret"" that developing countries had not made good on its $100bn finance commitment, made a decade ago, for developing and vulnerable countries to help them adapt to ever-worsening climate extremes. That goal remains far off. OECD analysis found last month that $100bn will not be reached until 2023. The amount was supposed to have been reached in 2020 and sustained to 2025.Some gains had been made at Cop26 on the greater recognition of ""loss and damage"".""Loss refers to things that are lost for ever and cannot be brought back, such as human lives or species loss, while damage refers to things that are damaged, but can be repaired or restored, such as roads or embankments,"" Saleemul Huq, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development, previously told HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-dealing-with-the-loss-and-damage-caused-by-climate-changeCarbon Brief.

The Wee Woods project in East Renfrewshire aims to plant 12,000 trees across the council area by next month.Ms Young said: ""The more we increase outdoor experiences and education, the more we bring up a generation of people who care about the planet. ""We\' ve had two years of so many young people being inside because of the coronavirus. There is now a potential for kids to be outside and being involved in outdoor learning brings out so many opportunities to learn about the environment."" Environment minister Mairi McAllan said:  This new network of Wee Forests is a great example of partnership working between the public, private and voluntary sector and is an important legacy of COP26 when the eyes of world were on Glasgow and the future of our planet. Confirmation of the deposit return scheme \- a recycling system where consumers pay a small deposit for plastic and glass bottles \- being delayed by the Scottish Government was  crushing , Ms Young said, as she hopes more will be done to address this issue.Ms Young said:  What I want to talk about with the Scottish Government is we have amazing targets, but how are we going to get from A to B.

The new version omits ""2100.""COP26 President Alok Sharma has made ""keeping 1.5 alive"" his mantra for the outcome of the Glasgow talks.Felix Schenuit, a visiting fellow with the Berlin-based research institute SWP Europe, said the tweak in the text is significant. It closes a backdoor that would have allowed the world to heat beyond 1.5\'b0C in the next few decades, before dropping back to that level by 2100 by sucking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ""Politically, the new version is more ambitious wording,"" he said.Avoiding an overshoot ""requires incredibly rapid emissions reduction,"" said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist with Berkeley Earth. However, that's ""not consistent with the level of commitments we've seen from countries"" at COP26, he added.

By contrast, the Edinburgh Festival is estimated to generate more than \£3500m in direct spending for Scotland's capital and surrounding area - according to a report by theCentre for Economics and Business Research.Mackay said: ""It's a provisional estimate based on the number of people we know will attend.

""Keeping 1.5 alive"" All countries committed in the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change to limit global warming to well below 2C compared with pre-industrial times and to ""pursue efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C.Since then, greater scientific understanding of the severe impacts of warming above 1.5C have prompted countries most vulnerable to climate change to demand that the second so-called ""aspirational target"" is achieved.Cop26 president, explained the importance of limiting warming to 1.5C in a speech in Paris in mid-October: ""At 1.5C, 700 million people would be at risk of extreme heatwaves. At 2C, it would be 2 billion. At 1.5C, 70 per cent of the world's coral reefs die. At 2C, they are all gone. If temperatures continue to rise, we will step through a series of one-way doors, the end destination of which is climate catastrophe.""The average temperature has already increased by 1.1C and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) HYPERLINK warned in a report in August: ""Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5C or even 2C will be beyond reach.""The IPCC said global emissions needed to fall by 45 per cent on 2010 levels by 2030 to limit warming to 1.5C. A HYPERLINK UN report this month said that emissions would rise by 16 per cent by 2030 based on the national pledges made by countries to date.There will be some new announcements on emissions targets for 2030 during Cop26, with India possibly making the most significant new contribution.However, they will definitely not add up to anything like the 45 per cent cut needed. That will not stop Johnson claiming success in ""keeping 1.5 alive"" because he is hoping Cop26 will agree a mechanism under which countries will come up with new, more ambitious targets for 2030 over the next two years. Cash Wealthy nations pledged in 2009 to deliver $100 billion a year of public and private money from 2020 to help poor countries cut their emissions and adapt to climate change. The target was missed in 2020 and will HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-says-cop26-climate-summit-will-be-touch-and-go-3tsppbhbdnot be met until 2023, according to a report published this month by the UK government. Sharma has admitted that the failure to meet the target has undermined trust in the Cop26 negotiations and he is hoping the conference will deliver more promises of funding to make up the shortfall. He also wants to shift the balance of funding provided so that more money goes to help developing countries adapt to climate change. At present most of the money is linked to projects that will cut their emissions but they say they need urgent help to cope with the increased droughts, floods, heat waves and crop failures already being caused by climate change.There will also be discussions at Cop26 on setting a new climate finance target for 2025 onwards. The Least Developed Countries, a 46-nation negotiating bloc at that includes Senegal, Bangladesh and Yemen and represents one billion people, want the annual total to rise to at least $200 billion a year, according to their chairman, President Chakwera of Malawi. Coal Sharma has said that he wants Cop26 ""to be the Cop where we consign coal power to history"".Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has called for all OECD countries to phase out coal-fired power by 2030 and non-OECD ones to do so by 2040.G20 countries HYPERLINK https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cop26-pay-more-or-climate-plans-will-crumble-boris-johnson-tells-rich-nations-vzb0nnvhhagreed at the weekend to end financing for coal plants overseas by the end of this year but they rejected a proposal to stop using coal power in their own countries. Australia, India, China and Russia, which rely heavily on coal production and consumption, were among the countries which refused to sign up to an end date.Sharma is hoping Cop26 will deliver an agreement on helping wean developing countries off coal by supporting their transition to cleaner sources of energy. Trees A multi-billion pound package is expected to be agreed at Cop26 to help achieve the global goal set in 2014 of ending deforestation by 2030.

"COP26","UK","COP26_UK331","'Getting the mix of voices right': Our panel of experts give verdicts on COP26","December 10, 2021 Friday 12:01 AM GMT","energyvoice.com","With COP26 now in the rear-view mirror, Energy Voice has assembled a panel of experts to give their verdicts on whether the summit really was a climate change turning point. Prof. Paul de Leeuw, director, RGU Energy Transition Institute: 'Expectations were inevitably sky high' With the global spotlight on COP26, the largest global gathering of world leaders and with the future of our planet at stake, the expectations of the UN conference in Glasgow were inevitably sky-high. Many expected COP26 to be the moment to get the world back on track and for it to be a final chance to address global emissions in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.After two weeks of carefully orchestrated discussions, speeches, negotiations and multiple drafts, the Glasgow Climate Pact was HYPERLINK finally agreed in extra time.Although over 90% of the global economy is now committed net zero, compared to around 70% only a year ago, COP26 unfortunately failed to get global agreements and commitments to limit global warming to 1.5 \'b0C from pre-industrial levels and to mobilise the funding required to assist developing economies to address the immediate impacts of the climate emergency.With the UK holding the COP presidency for the coming year, it will now need to play a global leadership role to ensure the initiatives agreed at COP26 are being advanced. It also needs to ensure that material progress is being made ahead of COP27 on global emission reductions and on accessing additional financial support for developing countries.This global leadership position will provide an excellent opportunity for the UK to demonstrate the art of the possible in terms of climate policy, carbon reduction initiatives, financial support, technology development and how to do all of this in a managed, just and fair way. Ollie Folayan, chair of AFBE-UK Scotland: 'At least two-thirds of the planet were missing from the debate' As we slowly emerge from lockdown and take stock of the past two years there are two things we have a better appreciation of today. The first is our connection to one another; the second is our increased reliance on technology.Those themes were central as the attention of the world focused on Glasgow and the 26th conference of parties (COP26) summit.The crowds gathered inside and outside the SEC and speakers from Barack Obama to Sir David Attenborough all passed on their words of wisdom.However, there remained unanswered questions.Her speech pointed to the fact that the voices of at least two-thirds of the planet were missing from the debate as was the presence of two of the world biggest emitters.My take from an Aberdeen perspective was conveyed in a BBC Scotland radio interview during COP26. I stressed the importance of viewing the energy transition not as a sudden switch but as a patchwork of solutions that begins with minimising the adverse environmental impact of our current activities and progresses to the devising of technologies that can enable greater reliance on renewable sources.The industry has the capacity to deliver the energy transition if it can train its workforce in specific areas such as the digitisation. I also said that governments will have to invest the funds if technologies for carbon capture and storage and for renewable energy sources are to be commercially viable.While few objective observers would describe the COP26 as a roaring success, most believe that the measures agreed would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, as well as the target-setting there is a need for many more voices to be brought into the discussion and more technology for a diverse and innovative workforce to develop. Adam Price, Aberdeen Climate Action: 'It makes me proud to live in Scotland' COP26 is over; what was good and what was bad? What was definitely good was the massive media coverage of climate change, raising awareness amongst many who had not thought about it seriously, including in my family.COP26 was governments and powerful organisations came together, talked mostly sincerely about the challenges and collectively offered new, bolder targets that seem to promise a real difference in the likely temperature the planet will reach.What is worrying is those targets are still nothing like enough to keep warming down to 1.C, so there is much work to do in the next COP. And there was not enough realistic, detailed actions with short timeframes to address the need for very urgent action.What was also virtually missing was discussions on what is called ""loss and damage"". Here, poor countries already profoundly harmed by sea level rise and extreme weather argue for damages from those countries or organisations that caused climate change, a concept that USA and EU are resistant to. COP26 managed at least to get this on the table and the next COP will be the first to put it on the main agenda, increasing the political pressure.The Scottish Government is the only government in the world to commit funds to loss and damage with a \£31 million fund, announced at . It may be a drop in the ocean compared to the harm done to poor countries by the economic development of the richer countries, but it's a start and it makes me proud to live in Scotland. Claire Wallis, partner & renewable energy specialist lawyer, CMS: 'Notable disappointment on the final wording' The announcement that the US and China will work together to limit global temperature rises was possibly the highlight of the event, although there was also notable disappointment with the wording of the final global climate deal. It contained the first-ever commitment to reducing coal, the fossil fuel most responsible for greenhouse gases, but this will not be enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.It will now require innovation and investment to deliver and ultimately surpass the commitments that were made in Glasgow. While there's no single measure that will do this, the further development of clean hydrogen fuel offers a viable alternative which can be used to decarbonise many highly polluting sectors for decades to come.With investment in clean hydrogen gaining momentum, it offers real potential for the Scottish economy as we seek to transition away from fossil fuels. Scotland has substantial offshore wind resources which can provide energy required to produce green hydrogen. Our established oil and gas industry, existing infrastructure and commitment to net-zero make Scotland ideally placed to become a global leader in production and export of clean hydrogen. Dan Carter, global director of decarbonisation and new energies at Wood: 'There's positivity tinged with a little bit of disappointment' COP26 reinforced the road towards meeting decarbonisation targets and requirements. Most countries have pledged to cut carbon emissions to below a level that will meet the 2\'b0c temperature rise scenario.Some of the action doesn't necessarily support the goal to meet the 1.5C rise that has been hovering around since COP25 as the overarching ambition.There's positivity tinged with a little bit of disappointment. Most major geographies have come back with revised climate targets by the end of 2022, but we still don't have to mechanisms by which to monitor and enforce those globally to ensure that progress is being achieved.I think that's something perhaps that the following COPs in Egypt and Abu Dhabi really need to focus on - how are we making sure that we're living up to the commitment that we're making?Carbon pricing is really the only fiscal lever that can be applied to make sure that countries don't end up offshoring CO2 and that everybody is proceeding towards a common goal.We have technology solutions that can help meet net zero goals, whether that's hydrogen or carbon capture and storage, but we need a bit of a kick so that those technologies begin to be deployed at pace.From there, we can begin to work out how to bring the capital and operating costs down so that we can distribute and development them more widely.The carbon price would provide that kick start.ClassificationLanguage:\~ENGLISH\l"

It is hoped the HYPERLINK https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/detaildetail in the draft text will form the basis of an agreement at the end of the conference -Friday November 12.The document calls on countries to strengthen their emissions-cutting plans in the next year in a bid to keep a goal to limit warming to 1.5C within reach.It also calls for faster phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels - a first for a UN deal - but there is likely to be strong resistance to this from some countries and it could be taken out of any final agreement. What else has been agreed at COP26? World leaders have made a spate of announcements on issues from cutting methane emissions to action on coal and deforestation. Deforestation More than 100 world leaders promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal.Brazil, where large swathes of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, was among the signatories.Trees can absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide -one of the key greenhouse gases adding to global warming -which makes ending deforestation vital in the fight against climate change. Methane A pledge to cut 30 per cent of methane emissions by 2030 has been agreed by more than 100 countries.Cutting methane, a powerful but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas which comes from sources including fossil fuel extraction and livestock farming, is seen as making a significant short-term contribution to climate action.Half of the world's top 30 methane emitters, including the US, EU, Indonesia, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico, Nigeria, Iraq, Vietnam and Canada joined the pledge -but China, Russia and India have not yet. Coal As COP26Coal remains the single biggest contributor to climate change. Although progress has been made in reducing its use, it still produced about 37 per cent of the world's electricity in 2019. Money An initiative bringing together some 450 banks, pension funds and other financial institutions, who between them control $130trn (\£396.3trn), will see a shift towards ""clean"" green such as renewable energy.

During the pandemic, with more people than ever concerned about business impact, ESG investments outperformed other investments and showed resilience through wave upon wave of Covid outbreaks. Deloitte estimates that ESG-mandated assets could grow to half of all managed assets in the United States by 2025 (from just over 25% in 2018), and continue growing in the years to come. In 2015, 193 companies adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Now, 8,550 companies in the MSCI All Country World Index have been measured from \' strongly aligned\' to \' strongly misaligned\' against the UN SDGs.There is also significant opportunity to generate value, with the UN estimating around US$12 trillion in global economic value waiting to be unlocked from integrating ESG principles. Sustainable brands have been shown to grow 1.6 times faster than non-sustainable brands. Unfortunately, because companies are aware of the demand for sustainable products and services and sustainable investing, there are groups that resort to shortcuts, like greenwashing, or falsely representing a business as sustainable. However, Dr Emiko Caerlewy-Smith, chief executive at KIT Consulting, recently highlighted that to ensure data integrity, available data could enable investors with a growing appetite for positive environmental and social impact investments to make more informed decisions. To this end, COP26 has triggered the formation of the International Sustainability Standards Board, which will develop sustainability standards for all companies to report against in future. Mbali Makhathini, head of ESG at Melville Douglas, explained how the evolving investment landscape required a deeper understanding of investors\' concerns and interests in their development of an ESG Strategy. James Hibbs, head of Melville Douglas diversified investment solutions, believes there is an undeniable investment case for investing responsibly. \' Investing in companies that make positive impact produces competitive long-term returns for investors, as ESG acts as a fundamental risk-management tool that shields investors from financial loss. Melville Douglas launched the responsible portfolios over four years ago and has delivered outperformance for their clients, without taking undue additional risk,\' he adds. Language:\~ENGLISH\l"

Cop26 president Alok Sharma has certainly put in the miles, travelling the world many times over to build support and momentum.Yet there are fears that Britain's diplomatic efforts pale into comparison with those of France in the build-up to Paris in 2015, and that our Prime Minister, in particular, has not yet managed to rally the world. Because the brutal reality is that, in Glasgow, triumph and disaster cannot be treated just the same.The success or failure of this conference will not be the result of one man's actions, as much as Boris Johnson may occasionally cosplay the great man theory of history.

Limiting warming not only to ""just below"" 2C but to the Paris targets of ""well below"" 2C or to 1.5C ""urgently requires policies and actions to bring about steep emission reductions this decade"" aligned with bringing global carbon emissions down to zero overall - net zero - by mid century, scientists warn.The paper looked at new or updated commitments for action in the next decade that had been submitted by the end of the summit, under a ""ratchet"" process in the Paris treaty to increase ambition to drive down fossil fuel emissions and other pollution causing climate change. The study also included long-term pledges to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 or later.""Our results provide a reason to be optimistic: warming could be limited to 2C or just below, if the pledges on the table are implemented in full and on time.""Peaking of global greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved this decade.

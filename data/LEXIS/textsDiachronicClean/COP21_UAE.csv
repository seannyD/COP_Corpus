""I'm reasonably optimistic and convinced that world leaders will adopt a very ambitious universal climate change agreement at this COP21 ,"" Mr. Ban told the UN News Centre in an interview at the Parisian headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UNESCO. ""We've been working very hard, very long \- the time for action is now. I have seen growing political momentum among member states. They know that they have to take action."" Ahead of COP21 , the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, the UN entity organising the conference, has already received some 180 voluntary climate action plans from countries. Formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, these will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached. As more and more INDCs were submitted, Ban Ki-moon said that this shows that nations are prepared to take meaningful action to address climate change. Many countries have also indicated they would like to see a mechanism in the agreement that will allow them to ramp up their ambition to reach the goal of limiting a global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The UN News Centre asked the Secretary-General what makes him optimistic that, in a world full of disease, war and famine, world leaders can work together instead of in their own self-interest. ""[Climate change] doesn't care about national boundaries,"" he said. ""This is a global phenomenon and [leaders] understand that investing wisely in climate change will help their national economy boost. There are many countries who are investing in sustainable energy including solar energy. It's skyrocketing."" The UN climate conference will officially open today when the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, is elected President of COP21 . Negotiations towards a final agreement are expected to conclude on 11th December. \"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE6","COP21 and shaping buildings for the future","February 9, 2016 Tuesday","ConstructionWeekOnline.com","Two decades of UN talks have finally led to an agreement concerning strong emissions targets. Last month almost 200 nation representatives met at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ). They committed to keep temperature rise below 2\'b0C, an unprecedented move to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order to stop the dangerous consequences of climate change. Climate change is a complex topic with severe consequences around the world. In order to find an effective solution to successfully reduce GHG emissions, all disciplines need to work together. Over 30% of global GHG emissions are attributed to the building sector. If we concentrate on creating efficient buildings, we can solve a fair share of the climate change crisis. Energy efficiency and conservation is the most cost-effective and economically beneficial path to transition to sustainable energy systems. Returns from energy efficiency in buildings are not only limited to environmental and economic factors; they can deliver many social benefits. Moreover, they help to optimise the indoor air quality leading to improved health, higher productivity and motivation. [[banner]] The efforts of fast-developing countries, such as the UAE and the neighbouring Gulf countries, on energy efficiency will have a significant impact on building climate resilience for the future. In the UAE, the major source of emissions is energy consumption in buildings, with the largest contributors being cooling and ventilation systems. We have a responsibility to shape our buildings and infrastructure towards a sustainable future. The potential is there, the technology is ready, and the reasons to act are clear. Governments in the region have shown their commitment to implementing energy conservation policies and standards for buildings and appliances. However, close collaboration between the government and the private sector is essential. Are we doing enough? How can we close the gaps? What are our roles as developers, contractors, consultants or specialists? Efficiency must be the common denominator for any project\' s sustainable and commercial objectives. Increasing energy efficiency requires a focus on stringent KPIs, clear definitions of efficiency and quality and tracking. Persistent pursuit of efficiency and passive performance without compromising the occupant\' s wellbeing is crucial. If the project fails to maintain these key elements while staying cost effective, taking capital and operating expenses into consideration, it can result in a waste of resources. Clients and developers need to include energy efficiency in their KPIs and commit to it. Architects, consultants and contractors must communicate and collaborate with each other at the earliest possible stages. We\' ve seen beautiful and highly efficient designs in the region that do not cost more per square meter than any  business as usual project. Early communication and teamwork are the key factors in achieving smarter buildings. However, this is just the beginning and any design can become obsolete quickly if it is not properly operated and maintained. Facilities management and maintenance companies need to catch up with the integration of advanced building technologies. Energy audits and commissioning services are great tools that help identify and implement energy efficiency measures in existing and new systems using a whole systems approach leading to optimisation. Buildings have a long life expectancy. Failing to act now may result in a dramatic increase of GHG emissions which will remain for decades. We have the ability to shape the future of the world for better or for worse. It is in our hands to prove that simple solutions are possible for complex challenges. As Albert Einstein once said:  It\' s in crisis that invention is born, as well as discoveries, and big strategies it\' s during crisis that we can show the very best in us.

A new initiative to build climate resilience in the world's most vulnerable countries was launched by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and 13 agencies of the UN system. ""Three out of four humanitarian disasters are now climate-related,"" Mr. Ban told delegates attending a High-level meeting on climate resilience at the Paris-Le Bourget site, COP21 's main venue. ""Economic losses have increased by more than half over the past decade. Ecosystems, and food and water supplies are under increasing pressure. The hardest hit are the poor and vulnerable \- including small farmers, fishing communities and indigenous peoples,"" warned the UN chief. According to the UN, the new initiative \- called 'Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape' \- will strengthen the ability of countries to anticipate hazards, absorb shocks, and reshape development to reduce climate risks. It is expected to help address the needs of the nearly 634 million people, or a tenth of the global population who live in at-risk coastal areas just a few meters above existing sea levels, as well as those living in areas at risk of droughts and floods. The world is now experiencing a strong El Nino event, which could place as many as 4.7 million people at risk from drought in the Pacific alone. Over the next five years, the Initiative is set to mobilize financing and knowledge; create and operationalise partnerships at scale, help coordinate activities to help reach tangible results, catalyze research, and develop new tools. The Secretary-General also joined the launch of the International Solar Alliance, set up by the Governments of India and France. In the presence of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the UN chief said the Alliance will ""enable solar-rich developing countries to make the best use of an abundant, free natural resource."" Other news at the opening of COP21 included a pledge by 11 donor countries of close to $250 million dollars in new money for adaptation support to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), a climate fund hosted by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The Communique calls on the international community to increase efforts to phase out perverse subsidies to fossil fuels by promoting policy transparency, ambitious reform and targeted support for the poorest. In addition, the World Bank announced it has been working with four European countries \- Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland \- to set up a new $500 million initiative that will find new ways to create incentives aimed at large scale cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries to combat climate change. The initiative, called the Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, will reportedly help developing countries implement their plans to cut emissions by working with them to create new classes of carbon assets associated with reduced greenhouse gas emission reductions, including those achieved through policy actions. Twenty countries, all of them major economies, launched Mission Innovation, a landmark commitment to dramatically accelerate public and private global clean energy innovation, including doubling their current investments in the sector. According to UNFCCC, these national commitments ""are coupled with a major, independent private sector initiative spearheaded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in which entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses will deploy billions more dollars to drive innovation from the laboratory to the marketplace."" Finally, the opening of COP21 also included new partnerships forged between world leaders from major forest countries who today endorsed forests as a key climate solution. Additional initiatives and pledges are expected during the two-week conference, which is scheduled to end on 11 December. \"

Many of the events on the second day of the global gathering in Paris, France took place in the context of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) \- a joint undertaking by the Governments of Peru and France, the Office of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the organizer of the current conference, the 21st meeting of the Convention's States Parties. The Action Agenda was launched in December 2014 by the previous meeting of the UNFCCC parties in Lima, Peru. As highlighted in a press release issued by UNFCCC, the LPAA aims to strengthen climate action beyond COP21 , by ""mobilizing robust global action towards low carbon and resilient societies and providing enhanced support to existing initiatives."" During the two-week conference, 12 thematic focus events are being organized to expose how climate issues affect various sectors and to suggest relevant solutions to tackle them. On Tuesday, with forests and agriculture taking center stage, leaders from governments, the private and public sectors, civil society and indigenous peoples voiced their environmental concerns. This included how agriculture, forestry and other land uses are responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions \- about half of that from deforestation and forest degradation, mostly driven by demand for food and wood products and inequities and inefficiencies in the use of land for their production. ""Forest countries in partnership with other governments, the private sector and civil society are set for an increased international effort to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation in a few decades,"" said Peru's Minister of the Environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal speaking at a press conference. ""The success of the LPAA and its action area on Forests relies on effective synergies between state and non-state actors, between investment and forest management \- all together rallied behind sustainably managed forests as a common goal,"" he added. According to UN estimates, approximately one billion people depend directly on forests for their livelihoods and each year, approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. This loss of forest cover is said to be responsible for roughly 11 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, governments and organizations, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), announced six new cooperative initiatives that aim to protect the long-term livelihoods of millions of farmer and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The entities highlighted how agriculture is one of the sectors most seriously affected by extreme climate but it also accounts for 24 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change. The initiatives focus on four key areas: soils in agriculture, the livestock sector, food losses and waste, and sustainable production methods and resilience of farmers. The new partnerships are expected to deploy money and know-how across both developed and developing nations to help hard-pressed farmers become key actors in the global drive to achieve a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. UNFCCC said today's events reveal the ""effective and concrete progress"" that can be made when a wide, international set of stakeholders work together to build resilience and low-carbon systems of production in agricultural and food systems. \"

The 6th ministerial Conference of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF), takes place from November 1 to 4 in Riyadh. The meeting takes place just one month ahead of the highly anticipated United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris and is a significant platform to reinforce the kingdom\' s commitment to achieving excellence in all areas of its industrial operations to support the global goal of achieving sustainable economic development, social development and environmental protection, said a statement. The meeting, organised by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and the CSLF Secretariat, will be attended by ministers and senior officials holding portfolios related to the environment, energy and sustainable development from 22 CSLF member countries, it said. Petroleum and Energy Ministers from the GCC region will also join the meeting which will be opened and co-chaired by Ali I Al Naimi, Saudi Arabia\' s Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, and Dr Ernest Moniz, US Secretary of Energy. The kingdom joined the CSLF in 2005 and has been active in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon sequestration is the process of capture, utilisation or long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This process will either mitigate or defer climate change. It has been proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of greenhouse gases, which are released by burningfossil fuels. The mission of the CSLF is to facilitate the development and deployment of such technologies via collaborative efforts that address key technical, economic, and environmental obstacles. Khalid Abuleif, lead climate change negotiator for Saudi Arabia at COP21 , said:  The forum is testimony to Saudi Arabia\' s strong advocacy of developing and pursuing a wide range of clean greenhouse gas (GHG) energy technologies and GHG management solutions and initiatives that complement its traditional oil and gasactivities.  As the most reliable energy supplier to the world, Saudi Arabia has a major role to play in shaping the future energy landscape in a GHG constrained world. To achieve this holistically, we have already in place a comprehensive carbon sequestration strategy which complements the kingdom\' s broader GHG management framework, he added. \"

[[banner]] Al-Muraikhi was attending a session on \' Role of Oil & Gas Technology to address Climate Change Challenges\' which discussed the role of oil and gas technologies and R&D towards combating the effects of climate change and raise support for response measures. This was aimed at the Gulf Cooperation Council as well as the OAPEC countries. Al-Muraikhi noted that the $1bn JBOG project will result in a 90% LNG carbon reduction, equivalent to annual greenhouse gas (GHG) savings of 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. It will go towards recovering 29 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) of gas per year; enough to produce 750MW of electricity or to power 300,000 homes. Recently achieving a major milestone marking its 1000th loading, safely recovering approximately 535,000 metric tonnes of LNG, the JBOG facility only started operations in October 2014. How the process works is, as the -160oC LNG is loaded onto the LNG ships, around one per cent of the LNG evaporates owing to the difference in temperature between the LNG and the ship tank. JBOG collects the boil-off gas and transports it to a central compressor area, where the gas is compressed, and then sent back to the LNG plants to be used as fuel gas or converted back into LNG. The specially built compressor is the first of its kind and the largest managing such low pressures and high volumes. The JBOG project is the biggest project of its kind and one of the largest environmental investments in the world.

""The sheer numbers underline the urgency of acting now,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, in a press release. ""Today's children are the least responsible for climate change, but they, and their children, are the ones who will live with its consequences. And, as is so often the case, disadvantaged communities face the gravest threat,"" he continued. Climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions. UNICEF is underlining that these events can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea.

The two Committees organised a joint conference on 19 November in Brussels to ensure that their potential to help combat climate change is recognised in the COP21 international climate talks in Paris which will start end of November. In his opening speech, EESC President Georges Dassis reminded national leaders who will attend the COP21 conference that Europeans and citizens around the world expect ""a binding, ambitious and universal agreement and also a structured way of involving civil society, which is indispensable for its success."" He called on the negotiators not to lose the contact with ordinary people: ""State leaders must not forget that it is the citizens who will drive the change"". Karl-Heinz Lambertz, Vice-President of the CoR, said: ""We, regions and cities, are often more ambitious than states on climate policy. We know the development opportunities and the weaknesses in our cities and regions. We are now ready to go further on climate action. But we need adequate support. We need a climate governance system that works and that brings into accord all levels of government and an agreement that explicitly refers to local governments."" The two EU bodies have closely aligned their positions on many of the major issues that will be decided by national leaders at the summit, which should culminate in a long-term global agreement on how to prevent runaway climate change. Transition towards a low-carbon economy and society is already happening at grassroots' level with many communities leading the way, in particular thanks to partnerships between sub-national governments and civil society organisations. National governments sometimes fail to recognise and empower bottom-up initiatives, but the success of international climate action will depend on harnessing the ideas, knowledge and energy of businesspeople, consumers, trade unions, NGOs, communities and local and regional authorities. Both the CoR and the EESC are intensifying their efforts to ensure that an agreement in Paris explicitly recognises the role of citizens and of local and regional authorities in tackling climate change, empowering them and giving them more possibilities to translate global climate policy-making into further concrete, meaningful, transformative actions. \"

Together with the International Indigenous Peoples' Forum on Climate Change, UNDP is bringing indigenous leaders and high-level government officials together, often for the first time, to ensure that the priorities of indigenous peoples, whose lands are often seized for intensive greenhouse gas-emitting development, are embedded in national proposals for the conference, widely known as COP21 . It highlighted research showing that secure rights to indigenous and community-held land protect against deforestation, which with other land uses represents 11 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change. It noted that a review by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 119 national plans to combat the problem submitted as of last month makes no mention of indigenous peoples. Forests owned and controlled by indigenous peoples and local communities contain about 37.7 billion tons of carbon, 29 times more than the annual emissions of the world' passenger vehicles, according to estimates by the World Resources Institute and Rights and Resources Initiative. But more than 80 per cent of all lands utilized or occupied by indigenous peoples lack legal protection, and are highly vulnerable to being seized by private companies, individuals, and governments themselves, in a non-stop drive toward carbon-intensive investments in agriculture, logging, mining, oil and gas, dams and roads, and tourism. ""The same development that fuels climate change, continues to rob indigenous peoples of their human rights,"" Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, said, stressing the need to protect those right and the traditional knowledge that has kept ecosystems healthy. \"

It is not just that, floods, storms and other extreme weather events have left 4.1 billion people injured, homeless or in need of emergency assistance. ""It is, hence, imperative that the United Nations climate change conference , widely known as COP21 , must be a turning point towards a low-emission, climate-resilient future when it starts in a week's time in Paris,"" said Gulf Today in an editorial on Tuesday. The talks on November 30th are tasked with crafting a 195-nation pact to curb greenhouse gas emissions. According to the latest figures, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 percent of emissions, have already submitted national climate plans with targets, known as the INDCs. UN experts say that if successfully implemented, these national plans could bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Although that would mean significant progress, there is still a long way to go. As per UNISDR data, flooding accounted for 47 percent of all weather disasters over the last 20 years, affecting more than 2.3 billion people, the vast majority of whom live in Asia. A full 75 percent of the 4.1 billion people affected were in either China or India, underscoring the extent to which densely populated areas in those countries were disproportionately vulnerable. In Copenhagen in 2009, the last time countries sought to craft a climate deal, but failed, it was agreed that poorer nations vulnerable to global warming impact would receive US$100 billion per year from 2020. The money is meant to help them give up fossil fuels and to shore up defence against climate-driven food scarcity, heat waves and storm damage. The developing nations are seeking assurances that the flow of money will be recession-proof and come from public sources. There is less clarity as yet on this aspect. Though world leaders have expressed their support for the COP, mere rhetoric will not help. Now the world has a chance to steer towards a low-carbon, climate resilient future.

COP21 is a United Nations framework on climate change that is aimed at promoting further growth of the global sustainability industry. Commenting on the development, Kamal shared:  COP21 is a further extension of what has already been happening in the economy and globally for quite some time we are approaching what is termed the carbon bubble. Elaborating, Kamal explains:  The carbon bubble is the idea that perhaps we have already seen the peak demand for oil and if we've seen the peak demand for oil, that's one challenge to the evaluation of all those investments.  The other challenge is that we've seen the peak price, and those are related but necessarily identical items. In either case there is a significant risk to investors who have predicated their primary portfolios around fossil fuels. With a set cap on global warming, nations and business practices will be challenged to implement better regulations and technologies towards reducing fossil fuel consumption, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions. While the GCC market has already made significant advances in launching sustainability initiatives and practices, Kamal stresses there is a still a need to change market behaviour.

One entity that he applauded for making headway in this arena is Etihad ESCO.  I think it\' s very interesting that now in Dubai there is a government-related organisation [Etihad ESCO] that is as of January, going up to the public domain and rating buildings, based on their energy efficiency, commented Kamal.

Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of State and Special Envoy for Energy and Climate Change, who represented the UAE at the pre- COP21 meeting, told participants that all parties to the convention recognise the climate change challenges. The UAE ratified the Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, in December 1995 and was the first country to ratify the second Kyoto Protocol phase in 2012. The aim of COP21 is to reach, for the first time, a universal, legally binding agreement that will enable us to combat climate change effectively and boost the transition towards resilient, low-carbon societies and economies. Al Jaber stressed the need to distinguish between the future commitments of advanced and developing countries to reducing CO2 emissions, which should strike a balance between the responsibility of industrialised countries for large rates of emissions, on the one hand, and the need for allowing developing countries, which have not contributed to the current challenges, to complete developing their infrastructure for various sectors, on the other. Al Jaber called for intensifying efforts in the lead up to the COP21 conference in December to support the conclusion of an agreement that would enable all countries to take clear measures to curb the consequences of climate change while taking into account the different priorities of each country. ""The directives of the UAE leadership focus on co-operation with the international community and substantial efforts to reduce the consequences of climate change,"" he said, stressing that the UAE considers climate change as a challenge that can be countered through focussing on positive opportunities made available by innovative solutions. He noted that the UAE and its regional partners, member states of the GCC in particular, are coordinating efforts to include their economic diversification strategies in a new pact, as these strategies ensure energy security through a diversified energy mix that includes hydrocarbons, peaceful nuclear power and renewable energy. Al Jaber also urged participants to adopt the UAE's positive vision focussed on finding practical and innovative solutions through renewable energy projects that create new jobs as well as through drafting legislation that ensures a desired balance between the demands of development in developing countries and the international community's contribution towards reducing CO2 emissions. The minister noted that during the past two days of the COP21 ministerial-level meetings, participants edged closer to consensus on clarifying the differences on how to define a developing country and an advanced country. He said he believes the meetings will help reach a better understanding of the varied and common responsibilities of all countries, where the participation of all involved parties should take into account the circumstances of each involved country. He further noted that for the UAE and its regional partners, any new convention should be in line with the foundations of COP21 and provide support and opportunities for the desired continuous sustainable development and economic progress through diversifying sources of income.

The second ministerial consultation discussions focused on two important issues, which representatives hope will be resolved ahead of COP 21 : how the new agreement can include a mechanism to help countries adapt to the physical impacts of climate change, and mechanisms for providing support, through finance, technology transfer and capacity building, to developing countries. Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Peruvian Minister of Environment and current COP President, together with Laurent Fabius, French Foreign Minister and incoming COP President, are hosting the series of ministerial consultations with important players in the negotiating process. This second consultation was attended by over 35 ministers, including those from the United States, United Kingdom, China, Germany, Egypt and India. The UAE delegation was led by Dr. Thani Ahmad Al Zeyoudi, UAE Permanent Representative to the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, and Director of Energy and Climate Change at the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Al Zeyoudi said, ""The United Arab Emirates is committed to supporting France, as incoming President of COP21 , in its efforts to find effective and fair solutions to the global challenge of climate change. Through our active participation at these discussions, we are working to enhance cooperation among participants and are gaining recognition as leaders in this field. ""The United Arab Emirates is showing that climate solutions can be made effective and competitive. By sharing and building on our experience, we are helping the world deal with the major global challenge of climate change while creating economic opportunities and building a more diversified economy for the UAE."" The UAE delegation held a number of bilateral meetings to discuss how the UAE can cooperate with other countries in the run up to COP 21 and address climate change. COP 21 is the 21st session of the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and is considered the most important in years. Countries have set a deadline of 2015 to agree a framework for international efforts to combat climate change. All of the world's 193 countries plan to send ministers, with some planning to send heads of state. COP 21 agreement will call on all nations to share their actions to limit emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, as well as diversify their economies. It will also establish systems for reporting and assessing progress and for providing finance to poorer countries to support their efforts. In September, the UAE, together with Peru and France, will host a high-level leaders breakfast on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, which will bring together ministers and leaders from the private and non-government sectors to discuss how the outcomes from COP 21 can mobilise investments in clean energy. The UAE has rapidly emerged in recent years as a leading investor in clean energy technologies, one of the key strategies to mitigating climate change. This has included investments in solar power such as the Shams 1 solar plant in Abu Dhabi and the Mohamed bin Rashid Solar Park in Dubai, introduction of energy efficiency standards, establishment of world-class research centres such as the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, and the development of carbon capture and storage technologies. The first of the ministerial discussions was held in July, and the French government is expected to host further sessions before the COP21 meetings, which will be held in Paris from 30th November to 11th December, 2015. \"

In this regard, Abdulhadi Nasser Al Marri, head of the Ministry of Environment's climate change department, gave a presentation on the sidelines of the conference within the Gulf pavilion on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) report that Qatar submitted in November. Al Marri reviewed aspects of the report and how it reflects Qatar's ambitions and intended contributions to back international efforts to tackle the impacts of climate change. Meanwhile, Masoud Jarallah Al Marri, head of the ministry's agricultural research department, gave a lecture on the importance of preserving plant genetic resources and protecting them from the effects of climate change. The lecture focused on genetic resources as the raw material on which agriculture relies and, hence, preserving it helps agricultural development, which in turn contributes to achieving food security. In addition, the lecture touched on Qatar's efforts in preserving genetic resources by gathering plants from land and keeping them in the Ministry of Environment's genetic bank. In another activity for the Qatari delegation, Hashim Mohamed Al Sada of the General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa) gave a presentation at the Gulf pavilion on renewable energy, in which he discussed the renewable energy in Qatar and the existing initiatives such as Tarsheed as well as underway or understudy projects to make use of the renewable sources of energy such as the sun and wind.

The Dubai-based AESG specialises in services that help reduce the ecological footprint of the built environment.Given the UAE\' s efforts to position itself as a global leader in green economy and sustainable development, Alabbar expects to see the energy conservation market strengthen in 2016 as more and more companies look at the benefits it offers. I think it\' ll continue to grow. Globally, every country has to be on board now, he told MEConstructionNews.com.  The leadership in the UAE has been remarkable in that sense. All the initiatives that are being pushed forward are sustainability focused, and I think that in 2016, we\' ll continue to see that take hold. Alabbar added that almost every building that AESG is working on currently, especially the government projects, have very high sustainability aspirations. They\' re not just looking to comply, they\' re looking to see how far they can push the boundaries. I think that will continue in 2016, and I think for all companies that have sustainability ingrained in what they do, I think it\' ll be beneficial for them and for the region. As a result of this changing mindset, a number of energy service companies (ESCO) are looking to tap into the energy conservation market, Alabbar said. With AESG having expanded its operations in 2015, the sustainability expert predicted that a number of firms would be following its lead and look to participate in a rapidly growing market. The ESCO framework only really came into play within the last two years or so. In that sense, it\' s only a two year old established industry, so it\' s still in its early stages, but it\' s developing very quickly. There\' s a lot of ESCO companies setting up shop, and I\' ve personally been in touch with a few to provide some guidance in terms of how they work in the market here, he explained. There\' s also a lot of international ESCO companies that are setting up operations in Dubai to get involved in the market, so it\' s definitely growing and we\' re starting to see the first projects implemented, and clients and ESCOs are starting to see the financial savings from these projects, and that really does accelerate the market. \"

The speech is part of Al Tayer's participation in the UAE delegation to the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). Al Tayer emphasised that the UAE is a pioneer in the transition towards a green economy, implementing green initiatives, adopting economic diversification and its commitment to achieving sustainable development, based on knowledge, innovation, and sustainable green growth, to achieve economic prosperity. This is achieved by launching ambitious initiatives in renewable energy, solar energy, smart grids and developing a strategy to reduce carbon emissions. Al Tayer noted that the UAE was one of the first countries to support the international society to meet the challenge of climate change and one of the first nations to endorse the extension of the Kyoto protocol in 2005 to limit greenhouse gases in industrial countries. It was the first nation from the region to sign the Copenhagen Accord at COP15 to limit emissions. Al Tayer called on all nations to work more closely and enhance cooperation to reach an agreement at COP21 , noting that the great Arab historian Ibn Khuldoun said that the greater the social cohesion, the greater its economic growth. Al Tayer said he was confident that all nations will work together towards the greater good, as does the UAE. ""As mandated by President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and to support the vision of Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, we are moving forward with solar power projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park will generate 1,000MW of solar power by 2020. The UAE has made considerable progress in bringing renewable and clean energy to the region, despite having one of the largest oil reserves in the world. Our capital, Abu Dhabi, is the first outside Europe and New York to house the headquarters of a United Nations Agency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA),"" said Al Tayer. Just a few days ago, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, launched the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to make Dubai a global centre of clean energy and green economy. The strategy sets the ambitious target of solar power generating 5,000MW by 2030, which will be 25% of Dubai's total power output, to save approximately up to 4 million tonnes per annum in emissions, the equivalent of planting about 100 million trees per annum. Dubai also aims to have solar panels on the rooftops of all buildings in the Emirate by 2030. By then, 80% of the waste will be converted into energy as well. ""We will not rest in 2030, as His Highness has decreed that the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 target is that 75% of Dubai's total power output will come from clean energy by 2050, so our city will have the lowest carbon footprint in the world by then. Our nation is fully within the sunbelt's higher levels of radiation and so our commitment to combatting climate change comes primarily in the form of harnessing that power to manage rising surface temperatures. We will continue our efforts through the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence, formed in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme, to develop Clean Development Mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to pre-industrial levels to support this goal."" He said Sheikh Mohammed has committed a US$136 million (AED 500 million) fund that will be invested directly in research and development for next-generation clean energy sources. And Dubai will host the Solar Decathlon Middle East in 2018 and 2020 to bring solar power and sustainability even closer together through innovation. ""Financing a transition to a low-carbon world requires determined and timely deployment of smart public policies. The Dubai Green Fund proposed by Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 will contribute over USD 27 billion (AED 100 billion) towards clean energy projects in the Emirate and will establish a Free Trade Zone specifically for green investments. Dubai is already making best use of Public-Private Partnerships to make these projects a reality, as proven by Dubai getting the world's lowest tariff for utility scale solar power."" ""The UAE has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), together with 145 other countries, to tackle climate change, especially in terms of environmental stewardship of energy by conserving our natural resources, such as the increase of renewable targets I have mentioned, and the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy's Carbon Abatement Strategy to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021."" He added that collectively, the INDCs can slow the rise in temperature. Although they are not sufficient to limit global temperature rising to the recommended level of 2 degrees Celsius this century, the INDCs assessed in the Emissions Gap report represent a historic step in the de-carbonising of our economies. To close the gap and limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, it is essential that a new universal climate agreement is adopted by governments at COP21 . ""We are here to work together with you to achieve these goals. We are increasing our momentum, driven by the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the UAE Vision 2021 and the Dubai Plan 2021, to grow sustainably and to reinforce Dubai's position as a global hub of clean energy and its transition towards a green economy."" ""Climate change is a reality, and something our nation is not just talking something about, but is actively doing something about. Our nation takes its commitments and the vision of its leaders very seriously. We will make that brighter future for your children, our children, and their children. I trust that we are all united in this goal,"" concluded Al Tayer. \"

The UAE delegation to the two-day forum, held on the side-lines of the 70th United Nations General Assembly, was led by Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of State and Special Envoy for Energy and Climate Change. Representatives from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States also attended the meeting. Dr. Al Jaber said, ""Moving to a clean energy economy provides an opportunity to promote continued economic growth and sustainable development as part of a vigorous response to the challenges posed by climate change. In common with the MEF, we have identified an urgent need for the deployment of clean energy technologies at the lowest possible cost, to drive transformational progress. ""The UAE's participation, alongside 17 of the world's leading economies, is a testament to the country's commitment to sustainable development, and its leadership in the deployment of the clean energy technologies necessary to mitigate climate change."" Discussions at the Forum focused on a number of important issues that, it is hoped, will be resolved ahead of the COP 21 meeting. These issues include the contribution of developed nations and developing nations to the mitigation of climate change, the scope of the climate agreement and whether or not it should include an additional long term goal beyond limiting global warming to less than 2C and how to finance the climate related projects, including enhancing developing nations access to climate-friendly investment. The MEF's New York meeting was the third to be held this year and a fourth is scheduled to take place in November. The UAE has rapidly emerged as a leading investor in clean energy technologies, one of the key strategies to mitigating climate change. This has included investments in solar power, such as the Shams 1 solar plant in Abu Dhabi and the Mohamed Bin Rashid Solar Park in Dubai. Other measures include the introduction of energy efficiency standards, the establishment of world-class research centres such as the Masdar Institute, and the development of carbon capture and storage technologies to allow the use of fossil fuels while capturing the resulting emissions underground. Launched in 2009, the MEF is intended to facilitate a candid dialogue among major developed and developing economies, help generate the political leadership necessary to achieve a successful outcome at the annual UN climate negotiations, and advance the exploration of concrete initiatives and joint ventures that increase the supply of clean energy while cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The Forum is not an alternative to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change process, but is intended to inform and complement and make a major contribution to success in the UN negotiations aimed at achieving a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world. \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE50","Paris COP21, climate change and decarbonisation","December 21, 2015","Gulf Business","As world leaders look at their climate policies in Paris, GCC nations should do the same, writes Nasser Saidi We have entered the 'Anthropocene age' where humans are systematically destroy- ing their environment, their livelihood, their home and their planet. Past geological epochs were the result of external forces of nature or cosmic events. This time it is human action that is leading to calamitous climate change. An Intergov- ernmental Panel on Climate Change report has warned that the world is on a path that could, if left unchecked, deliver a global average temperature rise of 4\'b0C or more by the end of the century. A temperature increase of 4 or 5\'b0C or more has not been seen for tens of millions of years (homo sapiens have been around for 250,000 years) and is likely to be enor- mously destructive. Too much or too little water has the potential to cause severe and\~sustained conflict and the migration of hundreds of millions. Not to mention, the decimation of animal and plant \- life and habitat. Managing climate change is today the central challenge facing humanity. But will we take action now or procrastinate? Some 200 global leaders are sched- uled to meet for the Paris Conference of the Parties 21, in an attempt to finalise an inter- national agreement to limit global warming and adapt to its impacts. The proposed deal calls on countries to transparently report on greenhouse gas emissions and commit to ramp up climate action over the next few decades. Any agreement is unlikely to be legally binding. However, the 'intended nationally determined contributions' are what sets the Paris talks apart from past attempts at a global climate agreement in Kyoto in 1997 and the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009 The World Resources Institute states that the clean energy plans of Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Indo- nesia, Japan, Mexico and the United States \- which together account for more than 65 per cent of the world's primary energy demand \- would more than double their annual clean energy supply by 2030. Yet commitments should include not just tar- gets but also policies and measures, and local institutions, to implement them. Paris COP21 is a chance to build understand- ing not only of threats and risks but of the opportunities that lie in the transition to the low-carbon economy. Where do the Gulf Cooperation Council nations stand on these issues? GCC pollution levels and commitment to INDC The GCC has some of the world's highest per capita consumption rates of fossil fuel energy and electricity. As a result, it has some of the highest CO2 emissions in per capita terms. Vehicular emissions are one of the main sources of air pollution in the GCC. It may not be well known but the United Arab Emirates tops the world for exposure to tiny air pollutants, accord- ing to the World Bank. The UAE's PM 2.5 level (which measures tiny airborne pollut- ants smaller than 2.5 microns) stood at 80 micrograms per cubic metre in a report this year. Much higher even than countries such as China (73 micrograms) and India (32\~micrograms). Qatar stands second among the GCC nations, with its level at 69 micro- grams and Saudi Arabia quite close at 62. Earlier in November, Saudi Arabia sub- mitted its intended nationally determined contribution, revealing its aim to slash its emissions by up to 130 million tonnes by 2030. Shy on details, the document does not mention the current levels of green house gas emissions. It underscores the fact that its plan is dependent on 'robust' oil export revenues over the coming dec- ades and the country 'reserves the right' to update its plan. The UAE, in October, announced its target to increase low-carbon energy con- tribution to the overall energy mix from 0.2 per cent in 2014 to 24 per cent in 2021. To achieve this target, the UAE will imple- ment energy efficiency measures, feed-in tariff reforms and demand-side manage- ment initiatives. Such measures would include dissemination of information to consumers about their power consumption patterns, implementation of electric appli- ance entry efficiency standards and setting water and energy consumption standards for buildings. It is the economics that matter The New Climate Economy report by The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate identifies 10 key areas of opportu- nity for stronger climate action. These could bring significant economic benefits. There is the potential to achieve at least 59 per cent and as much as 96 per cent of the emissions reductions needed by 2030, to keep global warming under 2\'b0C. The report has four main points. One, moving to a low carbon infrastructure is not a 'climate cost' but a 'climate investment'. Two, emissions need to stabilise at a lower level than previously thought. Three, clean energy is keeping a lid on the cost of a low carbon transition. We should invest at least $1 trillion a year in clean energy, compared to current levels of $260bn. Four, any Paris agreement needs to include a 'ratchet mechanism' \- a facility for a regular review and revision of targets, given the falling costs and rising awareness of countries. There is no trade-off between invest- ments required for a low-carbon economy and economic growth. 'Climate' must be integrated into economic decision-making\~processes at the levels of government, soci- ety and businesses. This requires a major shift by policymakers and business leaders in their strategic outlook. It is also urgently required in the Middle East and North Africa region where oil producers are at the crux of energy market developments. Moving the GCC to decarbonise Energy consumption patterns in the GCC region are unsustainable. Due to high and\~growing air pollution levels and carbon footprints, the region faces high risks from climate change. What should they do to decarbonise? (a) Phase out fuel subsidies\~In addition to imposing large fiscal costs, energy subsidies distort consumption and production patterns, and encourage energy intensive activities. A recent Inter- national Monetary Fund report found that post-tax subsidies, accounting for environ- mental and other damages resulting from subsidies, are projected to reach $5.3 tril- lion in 2015. This is equivalent to 6.5 per cent of global gross domestic product and a staggering 13 to 18 per cent of regional GDP in the Middle East and North Africa plus Pakistan region. Eliminating energy subsidies by raising energy prices to inter- national levels would improve energy efficiency in all sectors and generate sub- stantial environmental and health benefits. (b) Impose a carbon tax A carbon tax is usually defined as a tax based on emissions generated from burning fuels. This will transform energy investment, reduce fuel consumption, increase fuel efficiency and sharply reduce the carbon emissions that are driving global warming. A carbon tax creates incentives for energy consumers to use cleaner fuels and adopt new clean technologies, thereby reducing the amount they pay in carbon tax. For the GCC nations, a carbon tax would also be a way of diversifying revenue. (c) Invest in intelligent, clean infrastructure (e) Develop renewable energy financing Green financing, including green bonds and Sukuk, is attracting new investors as part of sustainable finance. The UAE, which is hosting the International Renew- able Energy Agency, has an open and developed international financial sector proficient at financing hydrocarbons. It can become the first global hub for renewable energy finance, tapping the Gulf region's enormous financial resources.

Addressing a gathering of more than 650 delegates from government agencies, UN organisations, NGOs, the private sector, academia and civil society, Dr. Anwar bin Mohammed Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Federal National Council of Affairs, said the summit was being convened in the wake of the 193-member United Nations General Assembly formally adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 'Delivery of sustainable development goals remains a central and key priority at the heart of our vision for shaping a world where all people enjoy peace and prosperity,' he stated, adding, 'What makes me optimistic is the availability of multiple solutions that can help realise sustainable development goals in reality. Over the past years, the UAE experiment has shown that sustainable solutions can provide a basis for our investment to achieve development and growth and constitute key elements in our international relations in the broader sense.' Outlining the UAE's efforts in this respect, Dr. Gargash said, 'The UAE views renewable energy as an integral part of its international network of partnerships. The UAE pledged to offer US$840 million to 25 developing countries to push efforts aimed at mitigating the impact of poverty and creating economic opportunities through renewable energy projects. As a host of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UAE has pumped billions of dollars into renewable energy sources across the world. The fact that the seat of IRENA is in the region underlines our commitment and leadership in renewable energy.' The UAE, he added, was working to protect oceans and hosted the first Blue Economy Summit in 2014. It will host the second such Summit during the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in January 2016. He indicated that conserving biodiversity and protecting endangered species were key drivers for forging close international partnerships in the field, noting the efforts made by the Mohammed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (MZSCF) which has saved more than 1,200 threatened, endangered or nearly extinct species around the world. On climate change, the minister said addressing the phenomenon would be a major step in our multilateral efforts and the UAE will be among the most active participants at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP 21 ) next December, where it will work diligently to help conferees produce a positive outcome. The conference's objective is to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, agreed to by all the nations of the world. He stressed the need for accurate, real-time data to address and tackle climate change and its impact, pointing out to the launch of the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI) in 2002 under the directives of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan to achieve more cost-effective and relevant environmental data collection and assessment.

We call for a climate change agreement that promotes: Strong and effective action to limit climate change, and avoid unacceptable risks to global health. Scaling up of financing for adaptation to climate change: including public health measures to reduce the risks from extreme weather events, infectious disease, diminishing water supplies, and food insecurity. Actions that both reduce climate change and improve health, including reducing the number of deaths from cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases that are caused by air pollution (currently over 7 million each year). We commit to leading by example, by: Raising awareness of the health effects of climate change and the potential health co-benefits of low carbon pathways, among health professionals and the general public; Contributing to the development and implementation of measures to limit climate change and protect our countries, workplaces, and communities; Working to minimize the environmental impacts of our own health systems, at the same time as improving health services. Climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, a WHO press release said. Health professionals have a duty of care to current and future generations. You are on the front line in protecting people from climate impacts - from more heat-waves and other extreme weather events; from outbreaks of infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue and cholera; from the effects of malnutrition; as well as treating people that are affected by cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases caused by environmental pollution. Already the hottest year on record, 2015 will see nations attempt to reach a global agreement to address climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) in Paris in December. This may be the most important health agreement of the century: an opportunity not only to reduce climate change and its consequences, but to promote actions that can yield large and immediate health benefits, and reduce costs to health systems and communities. \"

Al Lamki comments came during Masdar's participation in the Bloomberg New Energy Finance ""The Future of Energy Summit."" The two-day summit, themed 'The Age of Plenty, the Age of Competition,' saw over 2000 executives and thought leaders discuss the opportunities and challenges in the energy industry and the current trends that are reshaping the energy-mix across all four corners of the world. The conference comes on the back of a record year for the renewable energy industry, which saw over USD 330bn invested globally. This year's summit included a keynote speech delivered by US Secretary of State John Kerry. In his remarks, Kerry highlighted how the UAE is committed to diversifying its energy use and ""in particular increasing renewable energy in fuel mix at unprecedented rates."" As part of Masdar's participation at the summit, Al Lamki spoke on the plenary session ""After Paris: How will things be different?"" to discuss the momentum after Paris climate negotiations in December 2015. The event touched on many of the themes that were debated during Global Action Day, the first global event post- COP 21 held during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in January. Al Lamki said, ""In 2015 we took a big step forward, not least with the way that both the public and private sphere came together for the Paris climate change meetings. The economic and business case for renewables is there, which was in part led by organisations such as Masdar pushing smart collaboration and partnership models."" Al Lamki pointed to the Zayed Future Energy Prize for evidence of how businesses and other organisations can help governments reach the targets set at COP21 and in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by providing clean, affordable energy. The prize has been empowering innovators in Africa to develop solutions in clean energy that transform the lives of hard to reach, off-grid communities \- improving health, creating jobs and boosting economic growth in the process. Joining Al Lamki on the COP 21 panel were Delphine Eyraud, Senior Policy Advisor, Climate Negotiations COP 21 Presidency, French Ministry of Environment; Zia Khan, VP for Initiatives and Strategy, the Rockefeller Foundation; and Jeff McDermott, Managing Partner, Greentech Capital Advisors. Moderating the panel was Michael Liebreich, Founder and Advisory Board member of BNEF and Chair of the Advisory Board of WiSER (Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy), a UAE-founded initiative between Masdar and the Zayed Future Energy Prize. Al Lamki further reinforced the potential for growth in the renewables industry across MENA during a Masdar-convened event ""Wind and Solar in the Middle East and North Africa."" He discussed how the region has experienced record levels of clean energy investment in 2015. Solar investment alone grew from about USD 160 million in 2010 to about USD 3.5 billion in 2015 according to the MESIA Outlook Report 2016. During the course of the event, panelists and leading experts in their field discussed how wind and solar are becoming increasingly viable and competitive as forms of energy. This surge has been driven by a cost effective investment environment and regulations that are providing the confidence for alignment between businesses and those shaping policy. Mr Al Lamki continued ""The market in the MENA region is maturing, and this is leading to greater business opportunities. Masdar has been at the forefront of this trend, driving the development and commercialisation of renewable energy and sustainable technologies across the globe."" Masdar has been at the forefront of the UAE's efforts to deploy clean energy at home and abroad, while driving sustainable economic growth, employment, innovation and prosperity. Masdar has nearly 1.5 GW of renewable energy projects either in operation or under development globally. The portfolio of projects underlines the operational excellence at the heart of Masdar's experience in the renewable energy industry. \"

China and the United States are the world's two largest carbon emitters, although China's emissions are almost twice that of the US and about two and a half times that of the 28-nation European Union. World leaders approved the historic climate change deal on Saturday in the first-ever agreement to reduce carbon emissions from most countries around the globe. Getting China on board was especially important for the success of the United Nations climate change conference . China and the US reached an agreement last year under which America intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025. For its part, China committed to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20 percent by 2030. Obama spoke with Xi, as well as the leaders of France, Brazil and India, last week as negotiators were finalizing the climate deal in Paris. He praised the deal on Saturday, calling it ""a turning point for the world."". \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE65","U.S. crude ends bearish month with slight losses, ahead of OPEC meeting","November 30, 2015 Monday","Forexpros","Investing.com - Investing.com -- U.S. crude futures inched down on Monday, amid a stronger dollar as investors continue to await Friday's critical OPEC meeting for potential shifts in supply-demand dynamics on global energy markets. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for January delivery traded in a broad range between $41.52 and $42.60 a barrel on Monday, before settling at $41.63, down 0.09 or 0.20% on the day. After jumping above $42 in U.S. morning trading, U.S. crude futures pared earlier gains in the afternoon session reversing territory just before the close. Despite a significant rally in late-November, WTI crude futures still closed the month down by roughly 9%. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude wavered between $44.51 and $45.74 a barrel before closing at $44.58, down 0.27 or 0.59% on the session. North Sea brent futures ended the month with a four-day losing skid, closing November down by approximately 8.5%. Meanwhile, the spread between the international and U.S. domestic benchmarks of crude stood at $2.95, below Friday's level of $3.12 at the close of trading. Any fluctuations in crude prices this week are expected to be minor before OPEC's pivotal meeting on Friday in Vienna. Earlier this month, Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Naimi, the Saudi Arabian minister for petroleum and mineral resources, indicated that the world's largest crude exporter is ready to use all tools necessary in order to reduce instability in energy markets worldwide. Last November, OPEC rattled markets when it left its production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day. The position triggered an extended battle with U.S. shale producers for market share, flooding markets with a glut of oversupply. As a result, crude futures have slumped by more than 40% over the last year spending the majority of 2015 near lows not previously seen since the Financial Crisis. Elsewhere, U.S. president Barack Obama and Russia president Vladimir Putin spoke for approximately 30 minutes on Monday on the sidelines of United Nations Climate Change Conference outside of Paris. Obama expressed regret over last week's downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey, while the leaders both discussed tensions in Syria related to the nation's civil war, according to multiple reports. Crude prices are sensitive to any signals of heightened geopolitical instability in the Middle East. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.25% to an intraday high of 100.35. The index, which is up by nearly 15% over the last year, is approaching a yearly high of 100.38 from March 13.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE66","'Global Clean Water Alliance \u8211  H2O minus CO2' launches in Paris during COP21","December 5, 2015 Saturday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","PARIS, 5th December 2015 (WAM) --- With water security becoming one of the most imposing long-term challenges for many countries, the Global Clean Water Alliance \- H2O minus CO2 launches in Paris as a collaborative global climate initiative and one of the key components to the Lima Paris Action Plan. The Alliance has an initial group of more than 80 signatories from government as well as the public and private sectors. As a founding signatory, Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company, is encouraging governments; energy, water and related industry stakeholders - including laboratories and research organisations; universities and NGOs to join the Alliance. With access to drinking water already a major challenge for as much as one quarter of the world's population, and further forecasts predicting that by 2030, 47% of the global population will face water scarcity, The Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance \- H20 minus CO2 is one of the few climate initiatives dealing with the water-energy nexus and climate change. The Alliance's goal is to seek solutions that will substantially reduce the projected increase in CO2 emissions from the desalination process, as global demand for drinking water continues to grow. The Alliance's action plan could see a decrease in emissions from 50MTCO2 up to as much as 270MTCO2 per year by 2040. The action plan includes obtaining amplified commitment by all Alliance members to use clean energy sources to power new desalination plants and to retrofit existing plants, whenever possible. Further focus is on improved energy efficiency of desalination processes, increased efforts on R&D and demonstration projects, better dissemination of innovative technologies, capacity building and analysis and formulation of adequate policies and regulatory frameworks. The concept note of the Alliance underlines that the initiative will ensure the sustainability of the entire desalination process is taken into account beyond the sole issue of energy sources. ""The government of the UAE has long recognised the potential impact of climate change on the future of the country and the region. The UAE was in fact the first country in the region to set renewable energy targets and has recently announced a commitment to increase clean energy to 24% of the country's total energy mix by 2021,"" said Dr Ahmad Belhoul, CEO of Masdar. ""Recognising our responsibility in helping to ensure water and energy security, Masdar's association with the Alliance, clearly demonstrates our dedication to transforming the climate change narrative. As one of the most water-scarce countries on the planet, the UAE is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies to improve the energy efficiency of the desalination process. This is an integral part of Masdar's remit as we continue to provide a platform for the development and deployment of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies locally, regionally and globally \- while creating a new clean energy growth-generating sector in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the greater UAE,"" he added. ""IDA is proud to be a founding member of the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance. We have long been a champion of environmental responsibility in desalination practices including lower energy consumption and an increase in the use of renewable energy to power desalination, resulting in the reduction of CO2 emissions. This has been a goal of IDA's Energy and Environmental Task Forces, and we believe that the GCWDA initiative will bring us ever-closer to realizing this objective,"" said Patricia A. Burke, IDA Secretary General. ""Access to water of the populations of the South and many other areas even in industrialized countries will be secured in the future due to renewable energy and innovation,"" said Jean Louis Bal, President, Syndicat des Energies Renouvelables, France. Masdar is leading innovation on water desalination through the development and activation of advanced and innovative desalination technologies with significantly enhanced energy efficiency. Masdar launched a groundbreaking pilot seawater desalination programme earlier in November, targeted to dramatically reduce the energy intensity of desalination. The project offers four viable solutions for renewable-powered energy efficient desalination, transforming the desalination industry into a more sustainable model that can be used across the globe. Phase one of the programme will concentrate on demonstrating energy-efficient systems on a small scale for at least 15 months. These technologies have never been used on a utility scale anywhere in the world. Stakeholders from industry, research institutions, universities and other organisations from the following countries have already pledged support to the Alliance including: Australia, Belgium, China, Comoros, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the USA and Singapore. \"

The debate focused on one of the core issues to come out of the COP21 global climate agreement; how to ensure the effects of climate change that are already taking place are mitigated for the most at risk communities across the globe. The panel debate included a keynote speech by Dr. Han Seung\- Soo, the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for Disaster Risk Reduction and Water and Former Prime Minister of South Korea, a presentation by Dikirani Thaulo, Teacher-trainee at the Zayed Solar Academy in Malawi and panellists, Noaman Al Adhami, Senior Director Business Development at Vestas Wind Systems, Ami Valdemoro, COO of Liter of Light; Caesar Mwangi, CEO of SunnyMoney; and Ewa Wojkowska, Co-Founder and COO of Kopernik. Keynote speaker, Dr. Han Seung-Soo, offered his thoughts on the panel, saying: ""There can be no doubt that the world is seeing the effects of climate change. This is why a global agreement at COP21 was an absolutely necessity. To this end it is important that we are empowering those most at risk through energy innovations. These innovations can take many forms and it is heartening that the Zayed Future Energy Prize is leading the way in recognising and giving a platform for pioneers in this field."" In addition to the negative consequences of a warming planet, upwards of 1.3 billion people across the globe currently lack access to affordable and reliable electricity \- with dramatic consequences for human health, education, and economic wellbeing. Experts believe that to eradicate poverty in a world experiencing more frequent climate-related disasters such as stronger hurricanes and severe heat waves, there is a need to put in place the safety nets that can keep poverty at bay while also cutting emissions. This requires robust and sustainable energy innovations. Moderator of the panel, Michael Liebreich, Founder and Chairman of the Advisory Board at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: ""One of the most impressive things about the prize is that there are so many winners and past finalists that are on the front-lines of climate action, innovating and helping to re-shape communities for the better. They are not just creating new technologies, but innovating right across the value chain, creating new business models too. That is particularly important in places where there are problems of energy access and water scarcity, where very often the technologies already exist, but it takes a special type of ingenuity and perseverance to get them into people's hands at scale."" The complexity of climate change means that there are no easy answers. With the COP21 agreement and the signing of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the UN General Assembly in September, the international community has recognised that urgent action is needed. This underlines the foresight shown by the UAE leadership in establishing the prize to support efforts on these issues. Dr. Nawal Al-Hosany, Director of the Zayed Future Energy Prize, added: ""One of the most important aspect of the global discussion on climate change has been the need for mitigation and adaptation to our changing environment that is already taken place. There are communities today where these negative changes is an everyday reality and it is only through energy innovation that they have hope for a better and more sustainable tomorrow. I am proud of all those that are part of the prizes global community that have already been inspired to strive to create energy innovations and I am also delighted to see how the prize has continued, since its inception, to empower others to make significant and lasting social impact."" \"

Coordination and unity of purpose on this issue was critical to the global community's long-term sustainable development and security. This was aired at a special session that looked at, among other issues, how countries were working together to address climate change and advance renewable energy in the run up to COP21 in Paris. The UAE Minister of State and Special Envoy for Energy and Climate Change, Dr Sultan Al Jaber, opened the session, highlighting the role that the UAE through Masdar and the Masdar Institute were playing in addressing climate change and advancing the clean energy industry. The United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, The Right Honourable Mr Philip Hammond, delivered a special address at the gathering hosted by Masdar \- Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company. Other speakers were the British Foreign Secretary's Special Envoy for Climate Change, Sir David King, and the Director-General of IRENA, Adnan Amin. Just this week, the UAE submitted its Intended Nationally-Determined Contribution (INDC), a comprehensive plan of actions to mitigate climate change, to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The proposed climate actions plan \- which reflects the UAE's economic diversification strategy and its commitment to sustainable development \- sets the UAE's national target to generate 24 percent of the country's electricity from clean energy sources by 2021. It also harnesses innovation and green growth to ensure prosperity and environmental protection. Dr Sultan Al Jaber said the UAE and the UK enjoy a deep-rooted and mutually-beneficial relationship that spans trade, investment and commerce. ""A central part of our partnership is our shared belief in clean energy \- the role it plays in economic development and the pathway it represents to securing a sustainable energy future. For example, offshore wind energy in the UK is a tremendous success story, and one that has played a key role in the country's renewable energy transformation. The UAE is proud to have contributed to this success through the investment made by Masdar,"" he added. Mr Hammond \- who praised the UAE's commitment to reach its target outlined in its INDC plan as ""bold and impressive"" \- said the UAE was investing in some of the world's largest solar power plants, and was at the forefront of innovation in technologies such as high-efficiency solar-powered desalination. With a 35% stake in the Dudgeon offshore windfarm, and a 20% stake in the London Array offshore wind project in the outer Thames estuary, the UAE's investment of around 1 billion pounds made it one of the largest investors in the UK's wind energy sector. ""You have the world's seventh largest reserves of oil and gas, and we all know these will continue to be important for decades to come. But it is much to your credit that, despite that, you are already planning for a future beyond oil,"" he said. Commenting on the upcoming COP21 gathering in Paris, he said that because climate change was a global challenge ""our political response to it also has to be global"". He was positive that a strong and effective deal among participants at COP21 was within reach, which would contribute to level the playing field, catalyse investment, and spur innovation. ""More than 150 countries have made commitments to reduce their emissions over time. Not only developed countries, but also large emerging economies, are taking real steps towards a safe, sustainable energy future \- and the prosperity it will deliver,"" he added. The UK currently has 5GW of offshore wind energy installed \- half of the world's total capacity. Of this 5GW, Masdar has delivered 12% of that capacity through the world's largest offshore wind farm, the London Array.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE86","Aiming for the sun","January 31, 2016 Sunday","Capital Business","More and more, our planet is getting affected by climate change, which puts societies, environments and people at risk. Luc Grare, Senior Vice President Sales and Marketing, REC gives us more details about their activities as a global provider of solar energy solutions and explains how the global solar industry has a bright long-term future. In your opinion, how is climate change affecting our planet? Climate change has a very high awareness in the wide public as well as by governments, organizations and business on a global scale - for good reasons. Based on the most recent Synthesis Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is clear that climate change has widespread impacts on human and natural systems in every region already today and that drastic mitigation efforts have to be launched now to limit the temperature increase to below 2C. The most severe observed global impact from climate change is the increased average temperature by 0.85C compared to pre industrial levels. This is resulting in a) heat waves, like this summer in Europe, b) further water scarcity, e.g. in California, US this year, or c) reduced crop yields in African regions and Australasia. However, more and more people clearly understand the urgency of fighting climate change, reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and switching to renewable energies. What reforms are currently gaining momentum? 40% of global energy related CO2 emissions are coming from the power sector. Therefore, it makes sense for governments, organizations and business industries to focus efforts on increasing energy efficiencies and switching to low-carbon energies like solar. In line with the UN Climate Change conference, COP21 , governments are setting ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions, increasing share of renewable energies in the electricity mix and increasing efforts on energy efficiencies. The European Union, #3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions contributor worldwide, e.g., targets to increase the share of renewables in the electricity mix to at least 45% by 2030. The UAE has set a target of increasing clean energy contribution to the total energy mix from 0.2% in 2014, to 24% by 2021. Allocating increased budgets for renewable energies and related technology, like storage, while at the same time reducing fossil fuel subsidies is also gaining momentum on a global scale. With, in particular, solar and wind becoming more and more competitive, tenders are becoming the standard mechanism for utility scale projects. During the last six years, global PV system costs decreased by half. By 2020, a further decrease of 40% is expected, which will reach a global average of 5-8 USD cents per kWh. The LCOE for utility scale solar PV installations in the UAE is in the range of 5-10 USD cents per kWh and lower than in Germany for example. Dubai focuses on a PPA approach (Power Purchase Agreement) for utility scale projects and net metering scheme for rooftop PV installations. Looking at Europe's experience, the largest boost for solar (both utility scale and residential) was given by Feed-in-Tariffs schemes, which can be an alternative in the Middle East region. Net metering scheme is a good solution, with credit transfers from month to month, resulting in an attractive payback time on CAPEX of 6 years for large industrial and commercial installations based on current tariffs. What is the role that solar energy can play for the betterment of the climate and the economic development? With 40% of global energy related CO2 emissions coming from the power sector, the widespread deployment of carbon-free, zero-harm and affordable energy sources represents the only path for bringing emissions under control while powering the world. Solar energy fits the bill. It is one of the cleanest energies around, with the lowest impact on the environment. REC has shown that a leading energy payback time of around one year is possible for solar panels. Solar installations are also quicker to set up than any other renewable energy sources - a vital consideration in regions such as Africa, where there are still more than 600 million people without grid access. Here, solar can be a clean, reliable source of energy to replace the still widespread diesel-powered generators and their harmful emissions. Cost is also decreasing at an impressive rate. Of all the renewable energies, solar is getting cheaper the fastest. With photovoltaic systems now costing half what they did just six years ago, solar energy is achieving grid parity - the cost level at which solar is competitive with conventional sources of electricity - in more and more regions. A recent Deutsche Bank report found that solar has reached grid parity in roughly half of 60 countries studied, including large markets such as the USA, Japan and Germany, with China and India close behind. Deutsche Bank also noted that prices could fall up to 40% by 2020, giving solar even greater appeal. Germany's Fraunhofer Institute predicts solar will be the world's most common energy source by 2050, powering 40% of global electricity needs, at generation costs as low as 2-4 eurocents per kWh. What do you expect from COP21 ? REC is confident that the upcoming U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP21 ), marks a global tipping point in the fight against climate change. Around 170 developed and developing countries worldwide submitted well in advance of COP21 their ambitious pledges to reduce carbon emissions. Including major emissions contributors like China, U.S., India and the European Union, these submissions represent around 90% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. This is an incredible achievement already and it increases the likelihood that the world's nations will sign an historic binding universal agreement to significantly reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of renewable energy. However, what really matters is the road after Paris. Targets just on paper bring nothing. How will it address the solar industry? We believe the global solar industry has a bright long-term future, with solar energy becoming increasingly competitive worldwide. A strong agreement at COP21 , should further increase solar's momentum, likely even above actual industry forecasts. Can you tell us about REC's activities in the Middle East? With our high quality solar panels and German engineering expertise, REC is well positioned in the Middle East region. Especially with our new, award-winning TwinPeak solar panels, we are demonstrating a higher performance even in desert areas due to an innovative design and a better temperature coefficient. This results in a higher yield per sqm, which is in particular of interest for rooftop installations with limited space available. In Dubai, we are in particular looking into commercial rooftop installations. Most recently, we are strengthening our position with a new rooftop solar installation for BMA International's Redtag Group. This is our first project framed by Dubai's new renewable-energy net metering initiative. This initiative, called ""Shams Dubai"", aims to diversify the country's energy mix to include more clean and renewable energy sources. In Egypt, we recently signed a strong cooperation agreement with Orascom and have been already awarded for a first 50 MW project as part of the FiT. This demonstrates our commitment to the region. What are the steps needed to enhance the environment and ensure sustainability in this part of the world? Despite the ongoing transition from policy-driven to economics-driven energy markets, renewable energies still need stable and reliable targets, mechanisms and commitments by governments. Policy changes and reversals create uncertainty and slow investment. 1. Set ambitious mid- and long-term targets for renewable energies and reducing carbon emissions - it's achievable. 2. Review achievements regularly and adapt carefully policies but don't overrule the market. 3. Define clear phase out of fossil fuel subsidies step by step to increase transparency and a fair comparison with renewable energies. Fossil fuel industries received USD 550 billion in subsidies in 2013, four times more than renewable. 4. Allocate increased budgets to further incentivize renewable energies and support related emerging technologies like storage and smart metering. 5. Establish a carbon market to ensure a real price for CO2 emissions and consider climate costs of fossil fuel energy of up to USD 0.13 per kWh. The average price for global energy-related CO2 emissions in a carbon market is USD 7 per ton of CO2, while in markets with fossil-fuel consumption subsidies the incentive is equivalent to USD 115 per ton of CO2 on average. For all steps: Learn from other leading markets like Germany and benefit from their industry's know-how. Can you share with us some examples on recent installations with REC panels? Besides the above mentioned Redtag installation, we have installed a solar test facility in the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. With at least 128 solar panels installed of various technologies, including multicrystalline, monocrystalline, and thin film, this will be the biggest solar panel test facility worldwide. Furthermore, REC panels with total size of 635kW are powering one of the terminals at the Al Maktoum International airport in Dubai. Together with Viridis Holding, an asset management and investment company, REC has jointly submitted an ""Expression of Interest"" to the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) to submit a competitive bid for a part of the remaining 800 megawatts (MW) at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. What do you foresee for solar markets worldwide? What are REC's plans and expectations in the region for the next few years? Countries in the Middle East clearly aim to diversify their energy mix to include more clean and renewable energy sources. Impressive solar projects like the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, with a planned capacity of 1GW by 2019 and 3GW by 2030, are emblematic of a wider push toward solar energy in the region, despite being among the largest producers of fossil fuels worldwide. The same is demonstrated by the already submitted pledges in advance of COP21 . Therefore, we expect a bright future for solar in the Middle East. IHS expects that the market will take off in 2017, passing the 1GW mark of new installations, and reaching almost 2GW in 2019. With an office in Dubai and a track record of various local installations, REC is well positioned for a sustainable growth in MEA. We are focusing on the UAE, Egypt, Oman and Jordan, where we are expanding our resources to better serve the market needs. With the regional market further growing, we will continue to expand also our Dubai office by investing into sales, marketing and technical support resources. To keep on growing with the markets worldwide, REC is continuously expanding its production capacities: In 2015, our module capacity will increase to 1.2 GW from nearly 1 GW and will be further expanded to around 1.7 GW by the end of 2016. \"

ICT offers significant environmental benefits in addition to reducing carbon emissions. The most substantial benefits identified by this study include: increasing agricultural crop yields by 30 percent, saving 25 billion barrels of oil per year and saving 300 trillion liters of water per year.  An assessment of eight sectors of the global economy energy, food, manufacturing, health, building, work/business, learning, mobility/logistics shows that ICT could generate over $11 trillion in economic benefits per year by 2030, the equivalent of China's annual GDP in 2015.  ICT will connect 2.5 billion additional people to the ""knowledge economy"" by 2030, giving 1.6 billion more people access to healthcare and a half-billion more people access to e-learning tools.  Worldwide growth of the digital economy continues to accelerate, providing the scale necessary to drive greater connectivity and new, disruptive business models. And, as opposed to the old production-line economy, individuals are firmly in the center of this process. ""The ICT industry offers tremendous benefits: more resource and cost-efficient businesses that are less harmful to the environment, improvements in services with significant societal benefits and new sources of economic growth,"" said Neves. ""This new study is based on in-depth modeling, unprecedented in its range, into the potential for ICT to disrupt business as usual and radically reshape the way we live, as well as reducing the impact that continued economic growth has on our environment. ICT can help break the link between economic development and resource depletion, with emissions savings close to 10 times those generated by the ICT sector itself."" ""The SMARTer2030 report comes six months before the crucial United Nations climate change conference in Paris in 2015,"" said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres. ""The long term outcome of the new agreement requires a peaking of global emissions in ten years' time and a dramatic bending of the emissions curve thereafter. This report underlines the pivotal role of ICT in assisting to achieve these aims."" ICT-enabled services could also generate US$6 trillion in ICT-enabled annual revenue opportunities and US$5 trillion in annual savings from lower consumption of energy, fuel and other resources, according to the report. SMARTer2030 follows GeSI's 2012 report, SMARTer2020, which calculated reduced greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. In addition to identifying the business benefits of technology enabled sustainable business models, the new report goes further by pointing to three important changes accelerating ICT's potential to drive these benefits:  ICT now puts the user at the center of solutions, empowering individuals with services from patient-centric e-health to flexible, on-demand learning.  As the number of connected devices is expected to grow to 100 billion by 2030 , the potential to drive societal and environmental value grows significantly.  ICT is enabling new and profitable disruptive business models that are separating growth from carbon and resource intensity. Peter Lacy, managing director of Accenture Strategy, said: ""This US$11 trillion opportunity shows that digital can improve the financial and business case for investing in socially and environmentally responsible products and services. Not only are new technologies easily available, but they are able to directly improve the quality of people's lives. And they are now able to do so at massive scale, enabling sustainable business models to become mainstream and a source of competitiveness and growth."" SMARTer2030 identifies three key stakeholder groups and recommends actions the could prioritise for a more sustainable, profitable future:  Policy makers should create the right policy environment. In particular, setting national CO2 targets, recognizing the critical role of ICT, creating investment incentives to connect the unconnected with new infrastructure and ensuring a stable and balanced regulatory approach to ICT.  Businesses should recognize the growth and innovation opportunities enabled by ICT that make sustainable investments viable.  Consumers should be encouraged to adopt technology solutions that promote resource efficiency, such as those typified by the sharing economy. \"

The official opening ceremony was attended by Sheikha Lubna, who gave a keynote speech at the outset of the conference, Professor Reyadh AlMehaideb, Vice President of Zayed University, and a number of representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the private sector, senior administrators, faculty members, and university students. The one-day conference is organised by Zayed University College of Sustainability and Human Sciences in collaboration with the Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, and the Regional Office for West Asia, ROWA. The forum aims to evaluate outcomes from the Paris Conference of the Parties, COP21 , meeting with special focus on their impact on the UAE and GCC region. It also serves as a platform for decision makers, scientists, young researchers, and private sector representatives, who interacted and discussed the research agenda for the future. In her address on the occasion, Sheikha Lubna said, ""The rapid rate of population growth, had triggered an ever-increasing demand on industrial activities which, among many other anthropogenic activities, result in an excessive release of greenhouse gases, and in particular carbon dioxide. The level of CO2 emissions had increased from 280 part per million (ppm), prior to the industrial revolution, to 379 ppm in 2005, reaching a current level of 400 ppm. These emissions are causing the world's climate to change, leaving serious impact on our planet's environment and the way we live. Several studies reported an increase of the average global air temperatures by 1.5 C since the early 20th century, and an increase by about 1 degree over just the last 30 years."" She added that the COP meeting concludes repeatedly that business, as a usual scenario, is not the way to go when dealing with climate change. ""This is mainly due to the fact that climate change knows no boundaries. No country can address climate change on its own. This is a challenge that needs to be dealt with globally. However, there are several standing challenges which will be addressed by the experts of this timely gathering,"" she said. Sheikha Lubna said, "" COP21 , for the first time, brings all nations into a common cause based on their historic, current and future responsibilities. The universal agreement's main aim with regard to climate change is to keep a global temperature rise, this century, well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5 degree Celsius limit is a significantly safer defence line against the worst impacts of a changing climate."" The minister went on to emphasise that climate change issues are cross-disciplinary and trans-boundary issues and that sustained cooperation of academic institutions and stakeholders in private and public sectors is a key to release the promises of the green low carbon economy. \"

As world leaders gather to discuss commitments necessary to prevent average temperatures from rising by more than two degrees, ""we are already crossing tipping points for families and communities,"" he said at the UN Climate Summit COP21 . That the poor and most vulnerable peoples are already suffering from the brunt of climate changes they did the least to cause is ""clearly an injustice,"" he said. Graziano da Silva spoke at a special event on agriculture co-organized by France and FAO and held under the aegis of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda that showcased existing solutions to the challenges of climate change, including FAO's Blue Growth Initiative and its Save Food Initiative. At a related event focusing on forestry, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo noted the importance of forests in responding to climate change and reducing hunger and poverty and responding to climate change. It is important to make sure that high quality research and analyses is actually used, she said. - A hand-in-hand approach FAO argues that hunger and climate change must be tackled ""hand-in-hand,"" at the same time, an approach that requires building more sustainable, productive and resilient agricultural sectors, Graziano da Silva said. Actions geared to that end can transform human lives and also ""cut across the usual distinction between adaptation and mitigation,"" he added. While the inhabitants of the 50 poorest countries are responsible for less than one percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), many developing nations have prominently focused on their agricultural sectors as part of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) that all countries are required to formulate. Wealthier nations must now support their less developed peers to ""bring their INDCs to life,"" Graziano da Silva said, saying the international community can help them move to the next stage by identifying ""specific adaptation strategies, finance opportunities, technology transfer and robust data collection and monitoring."" FAO is ready to support its members in implementing their plans and help them ""seize the transformative potential"" of resilient agricultural sectors, he added. Noting how many problems - climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, women's empowerment along with food security - are intertwined, Graziano da Silva quoted UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon: ""Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all."" ""At FAO we firmly believe that sustainable agriculture is certainly one of these solutions,"" he said. It is now time to act after more than two decades of talking about climate change, he said. ""This Conference ( COP21 ) must be the beginning of a new era on how to tackle climate change. We have a long way ahead"" he said. - Healthy soils ""Sustainable soil management will benefit all and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Agenda by 2030,"" Graziano da Silva said at another event launching the ""4 pour mille initiative,"" a French-led voluntary action plan seeking to raise soil carbon stocks by 0.4 percent a year in order to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide while also boosting soil fertility. The initiative, which endorses the application of agrocecology and related agricultural practices, calls on states, local authorities, companies, farmers' organizations, non-governmental organizations and research institutes to commit to farming methods that maintain or enhance soil carbon stock wherever possible, and to preserve carbon-rich soils. \"

ACWA Power, in collaboration with TSK, will develop and operate the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, to produce 200MW of photovoltaic (PV) solar power. The project, one of the largest strategic new Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects in the renewable-energy market worldwide, occupies 4.5sqkm and will avoid 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. The second project, the Hassyan Clean Coal Power Plant, will be developed and operated by a consortium of Harbin Electrical International and ACWA Power. The project utilises ultra-supercritical (USC) technology which requires less coal per megawatt-hour than conventional coal fired power stations due to higher performance efficiency, leading to lower Green House Gas emissions. These emissions are being cleaned to an extra tough level of standards not adopted in any coal fired power plant either in operation or construction in the world. By delivering a low electricity cost of 4.501 US cents/kWH, the project is also opening the opportunity for implementing Carbon Capture in the future as the total cost of the coal fired power and carbon capture could well be not significantly out of line with other carbon \' low\' or carbon \' nil\' options such as gas fired power or CSP solar power for base load application. The plant is \' future proofed\' by incorporating provision for easy integration of carbon capture equipment in the future, the company said in a press release. Both projects are in line with the \' green economy\' initiative for sustainable development championed by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The initiative is a central piece of the Supreme Council of Dubai\' s Integrated Energy Strategy 2030, designed to diversify the UAE\' s energy mix and reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants. The COP21 climate change deal, signed recently in Paris, confirms that the leaders of 200 nations are now committed to embracing renewable energy as an important tool to curb emissions and global warming. Commenting on what the deal meant for the countries of Middle East and Africa, Paddy Padmanathan, president and CEO of ACWA Power, said:  The deal signed in Paris has the potential to fundamentally change for ever the way the world generates and utilises electricity.  We welcome the commitment embedded in the agreement to rapidly move towards both \' low\' and \' no\' emission power generation which is a game-changer. At ACWA Power we\' re already supporting diversification of the energy mix to include renewables in the Arabian Gulf, and to ensuring that GCC nations have the tools to deliver a sustainable energy strategy for future generations without compromising on employment creation and economic development . ACWA Power also has renewable energy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa where its first project, Bokpoort Concentrated Solar Power Plant, the world\' s largest storage solar farm, has recently come on line at full capacity. It is a greenfield project being developed on a BOO (build, own and operate) basis located in the Northern Cape province of South Africa with a net generation capacity of 50MW with 9 hours of thermal energy storage, thus making it the CSP power plant with the longest duration of thermal storage in the world.  Proudly being a Saudi Arabian company we\' ve been leading the way to propagate the deployment of renewable energy well ahead of COP21 , Padmanathan commented.  ACWA Power was one of the first companies to declare a voluntary target of adding 5% power generation from renewable sources to its asset portfolio within the following five years and pushed ahead to embark on pace setting projects challenging the cost paradigm in both CSP and PV solar technologies. As we achieve our targets we will start to avoid more than 2.4mn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year within the next three years, he added.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE106","Electric and hybrid transportation on the rise in GCC","February 21, 2016 Sunday","ArabianSupplyChain.com","The GCC region is currently witnessing the emergence of electric and hybrid modes of transportation, most notably in the UAE, according to the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), a leading transport consultancy and research firm. The company has further pointed out that pioneering users of this new modes of transportation include GCC governments that are in the process of offering green public transportation solutions and business enterprises that have started to operate an electric powered fleet of vehicles. The development complements the results of the recent United Nations COP21 Climate Change Summit in Paris, which highlighted the need to cut greenhouse gasses, such as CO2, by as much as 80 per cent in many countries by 2020. In response to this call, the UAE has welcomed the COP21 accord to cap global warming--leaving strong assurance of a highly renewable and sustainable future. According to TRL, the substantial adoption of electrified powertrain vehicles plays a critical role in the move to meet air quality and emission targets. The proportion of these Electrified Vehicles (EVs) are set to increase in the next few months and it is highly recommended that we take the cue from countries that have adopted these new transport modes to learn more about these vehicle solutions. As such, TRL has identified this emerging market's key drivers, which includes vehicle availability; government incentives to purchase and charge vehicles; network of charging stations; public awareness and the desire to 'go green.' Dubai has actually been witnessing the initial presence of a few EVs and have already established an initial network of around 100 charging stations. In addition, select manufacturers have already expressed their move to introduce hybrid or fully electric models in the UAE.  TRL has long been pursuing an electric vehicle (EV) program of research and we have initially implemented a technology agnostic approach to all of our work-- forming objective views based on the evidence and facts we uncover through our research, said Akin Adamson, director, Middle East region, TRL.  Our goals in our EV research program is to identify the technologies that are likely to provide the biggest benefits under different conditions and develop an understanding of how the real-world use of these technologies may be affected by user and consumer behaviour, he added. Recent reports have clearly shown that transport infrastructure, particularly the internal combustion engine, are significant contributors to poor air quality, especially in urban environments. EVs offer an ideal solution for tackling current air quality problems as they provide zero tailpipe emissions, as well as grid-to-wheel CO2 emissions already below most internal combustion engine vehicles. However, current EVs are far more suited to short, urban journeys rather than inter-urban and rural use. Range and utilization are constrained by battery limitations and charging times, so for longer journeys on strategic roads or outside of cities, EVs are often not yet practical. This issue will be one of the topics to be discussed at Solar Middle East, the most comprehensive gathering of solar technology suppliers in the region, which will be held from March 1 to March 3, 2016 at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC). During the event, Adamson will be part of a panel discussion entitled, \' Are we there yet? Electric transportation commercial and regulatory outlooks.\' The event runs in strategic partnership with the Government of Dubai and supported by a network of key regional associations, Solar ME provides direct, established access to MENA\' s emerging solar markets.  Regardless of the method chosen to achieve electrification, the concept of recharging vehicles on the move, combined with other initiatives, could play an important role in helping many regions to achieve their vision of becoming smart, connected and sustainable. In line with this, TRL remains steadfast in its commitment to provide key analysis, data and strategic reports to help these governments in their efforts to adopt sustainable and green modes of transport, concluded Adamson.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE110","Mr Efficient: Veolia s Antoine Frerot","May 6, 2016 Friday","ArabianBusiness.com","Efficiency is the epitome of French-based energy giant Veolia. The $13bn firm has made a considerable amount of its wealth from adhering to the principle of being efficient and generating new methods of resourcefulness. It is no surprise, therefore, that global chairman and CEO Antoine Fr\'e9rot is bullish about growing Veolia's business in the GCC, a region where energy savings are as prevalent now more than ever amid current economic challenges. ""We could save 20 percent of the energy which is used in this country, and that's the case in all other parts of the world,"" Fr\'e9rot says. Veolia, listed in Paris with a market cap of $13.84bn, provides environmental management services, including drinking water treatment and distribution, wastewater and sanitation services, and waste management and energy services. A world leader in its water services business, the 160-year-old company posted $28bn in revenue last year, with 174,000 employees across five continents. It has been in the Middle East for 25 years, employing about 3,100 people. Last year the firm reported $233m in revenue. Almost half of the company's revenue in the GCC comes from a joint venture with Majid Al Futtaim Ventures called Enova, an energy and multi-technical services company. Fr\'e9rot believes the time is right to accelerate its growth. ""We think that in the field of energy efficiency, which today is about half of our actual activity in the region, we could double [current revenue of] \€ 100m [$114m] in the next five years,"" he says. He also forecasts ""a lot"" of expansion in wastewater reuse in the region, as well as modernisation of waste treatment equipment, including waste to energy services. ""I think we could add 50 percent on what we have today, meaning the \€ 100m we have today could be \€ 150m ($172m)."" Through Enova, Veolia is planning to develop its energy services and introduce efficiencies in the UAE's mega malls, hospitals and universities. ""In big buildings you use a lot of energy,"" Fr\'e9rot says. Veolia's UAE joint venture with Majid Al Futtaim Ventures, Enova, employs more than 2,000 people. The GCC's huge population growth also makes it a top candidate for energy efficiency programmes. ""The GCC is probably the one part of the world where the growth in population is the highest for the last ten years, and probably for the next ten years,"" Fr\'e9rot says. ""The condition of life [in the GCC] is not so easy compared to others, you don't have a lot of fresh water, it's very hot and you use energy to live. So it's typically a region where energy efficiency is useful to continue to have this sustainable development; to continue to grow by using less energy resources would be key in the future."" Ironically, Fr\'e9rot predicts that water  a scarce resource in the region  savings could be made in the future by moving away from the very desalination plants that Veolia is currently building in the GCC. ""We could continue to make desalination plants but I will propose to the authorities to perhaps spend more energy on water reuse instead, because it is, in my mind, more efficient, and more useful. It is cheaper,"" he says. Reusing water also reduces transport costs and pollution, Fr\'e9rot says. In Ajman, Veolia is using recycled wastewater for irrigation, but he insists that it could also be treated to become potable water if needed. Fr\'e9rot says he has the figures to prove it. Veolia also has developed a counter-terrorism system for public water supplies, where any traces of pollution can be detected in real time, allowing the water management authority to shut down an entire system before the pollutant reaches households. The technology has not generated significant interest in the GCC, but Fr\'e9rot says he is hopeful some governments will eventually be keen to install the system that has been used at major events in recent years, including the London Olympics. Veolia is also keeping an eye on Iran, a country that could offer significant business, but Fr\'e9rot remains cautious. ""There are some needs with the municipalities and the industrials,"" he says, ""and now we will be able to begin discussions, given the new geopolitical situation."" Veolia is a global leader in optimised water resource management. Still at the early stages of those talks, Fr\'e9rot says the size of the market is potentially eight times that of the UAE, based on the size of the population alone. ""The needs should be proportional to the population, but the final means to pay is not the same,"" he says. ""They need some expertise for labs, especially for water and energy, [before energy efficiency systems can be implemented]."" Iran's re-entry into the oil market has been partially blamed for keeping oil prices low, both because of the additional supply and Saudi Arabia's refusal to freeze its own supply unless Iran does too. Fr\'e9rot says the lower prices have positive short-term benefits, including saving on energy costs ""on a short-term basis"". ""On the longer term, we are involved with the oil industry to help them develop their businesses and for sure the small level of oil [price] today affects all the investment of building new wells, so we didn't have a lot of new projects during the last month. Despite that, we signed during the last three months two or three big projects because even if they don't build new wells, [they need] to keep operating the previous ones."" Older wells require five times as much water to pump oil. Fr\'e9rot says such wells require water recycling facilities. The biggest impact of the low oil price for Veolia is on its municipal clients, compared to industrial clients. In 2015, municipal clients represented 56 percent of Veolia's activity and Fr\'e9rot says the lower price has forced clients to alter their funding model. ""Municipal clients for the oil-dependent countries [will] not completely cut the projects but transform them from public finance projects to PPPs [public-private partnerships] or concession contracts, asking also for an offer of financing on long-term,"" he says.\~ ""We had that ten years ago. A lot of desalination, wastewater, or water treatment plants were financed through PPPs. It stopped five years ago to come back to a more classical way. But there is so much money around the world looking for good projects  [there is] more money than good projects."" When asked how the global economy is affecting Veolia's business, Fr\'e9rot describes it as ""not very exciting for the past two years"". However, the economy is not the most important driver for Veolia's activities. Fr\'e9rot says Veolia has demonstrated the relevance of its strategy despite a difficult economic environment. Further down the line, the impact of COP21  the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gases and stabilise the increase in temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius  will be felt not only by companies like Veolia, but by industries the world over. Veolia has been a strong supporter of lowering carbon emissions, and Fr\'e9rot was one of 78 CEOs who promoted the transition to a low carbon economy in an open letter to governments around the world. Agreed in Paris in December, Fr\'e9rot says the potential impact of COP21 for business everywhere will take time.\~ ""Before the COP21 COP21 , the question was no more why, but what should the international committee do to tackle this pollution,"" he says. The next question to be answered is 'how', which Fr\'e9rot says will take some years and many more 'COP' (Conference of Parties) events to answer the question. ""And it's only when we know 'how' to do, technically and economically, that we will have some business consequences of this issue globally,"" he says. The most common solution is to implement relevant legislation. ""Technically, we already have some solutions and they will get progressively better. But economically, the problem today is to [legally] pollute is free [but] the [impact of the] pollution is costing money. The sole way to push polluters to pollute less is to give a cost to the pollution,"" he argues. A carbon tax is the simplest way, he says, rather than a complex carbon emissions quota market, such as those in Europe and China. ""I would prefer, personally, to begin with a simpler system with a carbon tax where the pollution will have a cost, but also to decrease the cost of depollution, to use this money to subsidise partially the depollution, meaning that [it will be] twice as quick to make depollution systems profitable compared to polluting,"" he says. Would the GCC ever see a carbon tax? Veolia this month has secured a seven-year waste management contract in Oman. ""Even in Europe I don't see it,"" he replies, with a shrug of his shoulders. As he says, it will take time, but following our discussion, Fr\'e9rot says he plans to use some of his time in the region to engage with governments on COP21 . ""I will discuss with different interlocutors, including government officials, about the profit of energy efficiency,"" he says. ""This profit could be environmental of course, but also economical. I will explain to them even without a carbon price system. It is really interesting for cities or industrials to go through this way of energy efficiency because you could get the same use of energy by using less initial energy, by cutting the loss of energy, by capturing and recycling lost energy, by transforming waste into energy and so on."" He says through better management of the different types of energy on the industrial platform or in cities, there are immediate savings in terms of costs and emissions. ""It's a good first step before waiting for any price on pollution,"" he says. ""You could find energy efficiencies for a lot of different things, like hospitals, malls, cities, by using more cooling networks rather than individual cooling systems."" Ever efficient, always looking for ways to improve. That is Veolia and its CEO.

The report, 'Shock Waves: Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty', finds that poor people are already at high risk from climate-related shocks, including crop failures from reduced rainfall, spikes in food prices after extreme weather events, and increased incidence of diseases after heat waves and floods. It says such shocks could wipe out hard-won gains, leading to irreversible losses, driving people back into poverty, particularly in Africa and South Asia. ""This report sends a clear message that ending poverty will not be possible unless we take strong action to reduce the threat of climate change on poor people and dramatically reduce harmful emissions,"" World Bank Group President, Jim Yong Kim, has said. ""Climate change hits the poorest the hardest, and our challenge now is to protect tens of millions of people from falling into extreme poverty because of a changing climate,"" the World Bank chief explained. Efforts to end poverty, the linchpin of the 17 new Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in September, could be derailed if the impacts of climate change on poor and vulnerable people and communities not effectively addressed. According to the report, the poorest people are more exposed than the average population to climate-related shocks such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves, and they lose much more of their wealth when they are hit. In the 52 countries where data was available, 85 per cent of the population lives in countries where poor people are more exposed to drought than the average. Poor people are also more exposed to higher temperatures and live in countries where food production is expected to decrease because of climate change. Released less than a month before negotiators gather in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP 21 , the report shows how ending poverty and fighting climate change can be more effectively achieved if addressed together. \"

""Many world leaders, non-government organisations and private investors will have the opportunity to share experiences and strengthen cooperation.

She noted that the Climate Change Agreement struck in December with the international consensus ""is a true translation of the vision of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan 50 years ago. Figueres said at COP 21 in December in Paris, governments reached an historic climate change agreement. The Paris Agreement unites the world in action to meet the challenge of climate change and can be the spark that ignites a new model of global growth. More than 150 Heads of State and Government opened COP 21 and expressed inspiring support for an ambitious agreement. The conference featured countless examples of business and investors, cities and regions already acting on climate change.

""We need to accelerate the speed, scope and scale of our response, locally and globally,"" UN chief told participants of the Climate Action Summit 2016 in Washington D.C, a two-day meeting that started yesterday and aims to strengthen the multi-stakeholder approach to climate implementation. The event is expected to deepen and expand the action coalitions of government, business, finance, philanthropy, civil society and academic leaders launched at the Secretary-General's Climate Summit 2014 in New York. Noting that the current Summit would focus on six, high-value areas of multi-stakeholder partnership: sustainable energy; sustainable land-use; cities; transport; and tools for decision-making, the UN chief underscored that strong partnership would be needed at all levels to tackle those challenges. ""No sector of society and no nation can succeed alone. I encourage you to collaborate. Innovate. Invest. Together we can build the world we want,"" he said. The signing of the Paris Agreement on 22nd April received overwhelming support from all regions of the world; never before had so many countries signed an international accord in one day. Adopted in Paris by the 196 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at a conference known as COP21 last December, the Agreement's objective is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to strive for 1.5 degrees Celsius. It will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification. ""Two of the world's largest emitters \- China and the United States \- have pledged their continued commitment and collaboration,"" Mr. Ban stressed, noting that leaders must turn the ""promise of Paris"" into action and implementation as soon as possible.

Morocco and France, which will assume the presidency of the upcoming COP21 and COP22, call for seizing the occasion of the Paris and Marrakech conferences to speed up the transition towards a green global economy, reconciling legitimate aspirations for development with the pressing need for resources' sustainability and the reduction of environmental risks. The Tangiers' Call recalls that Morocco and France are committed to sparing no effort to work for the adoption, during the Paris conference, of a legally-binding universal, global, sustainable, and balanced agreement, based on the UN framework agreement on climate change and allowing to curb global warming under 2 degree Celsius and achieve a carbon-free economy. It also underlines that the Marrakech conference will be a crucial phase in this regard, adding that this long-term effort depends on the fact that all countries will declare their national contributions before the Paris conference, in addition to the elaboration of national carbon-free development and adaptation plans on the long term. Morocco and France call on developed countries to state the financial support which they have already provided and intend to give in the coming years to reach the goal of mobilizing 100 billion dollars yearly starting 2020 from public and private resources in favor of actions to fight climate change in developing countries.

Global policy and business leaders will convene today in the UAE capital to kick off Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2016, or ADSW, the largest gathering on sustainability in the history of the Middle East. Attracting more than 33,000 delegates, including over 80 government ministers and visitors from 170 countries, ADSW - hosted by Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company - addresses the interconnected challenges of energy and water security, climate change and sustainable development. ADSW 2016 is anchored on four key pillars: policy, business, leadership and awareness/research. Use of renewable energy must be increasedSilvia RadanThe need to double the investment in renewable energy globally by 2030 to limit the rise in temperature by a maximum of two degrees Celsius and thus avoid catastrophic climate change consequences was at the forefront of COP 21 , the UN climate change conference in Paris last December.And it will continue to be at the upcoming assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency and Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week.""The assembly will be the first inter-governmental meeting after COP 21 and there will be follow-ups on the decisions taken in Paris,"" said Timothy Hurst, chief communications officer at the Irena.Some 800 ministers and government officials are expected to attend the Irena's annual assembly on January 16 and 17. Among them will be officials of countries accounting for more than 90 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.""Over 190 countries have put down on paper their plans to cut emissions, which mostly involves increasing renewable energy usage,"" pointed out Hurst.Worldwide, conventional energy (fossil fuels) accounts for two-thirds of global emissions, the main reason for climate change.Based on current policies and those under consideration by the 190 nations at COP 21 , the share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption will only increase to 21 per cent by 2030, still causing an increase in global emissions.At this rate, if all emission cut plans are implemented, global temperature rise would reach 2.7 degrees celsius, leading to melting of glaciers, sea level rise and coastal floodings, loss of food crops and general social and economic turmoil.According to the Irena, to remain under a safe two-degree-Celsius temperature rise, governments need to reach a 36 per cent share of renewable energy in their total energy mix by 2030. This, though, would require the rate of renewable energy uptake to rise by one per cent every year until 2030, a six times increase from the present levels, meaning doubling the investments in renewables to over $500 billion by 2020 and further up to an annual average of $900 billion between 2021 and 2030. The figures may seem ambitious, but Irena believes they are achievable.Furthermore, renewables have created an entirely new employment sector with 7.7 million people working in this field in 2015, an 18 per cent increase from 2014.- HYPERLINK mailto:silvia@khaleejtimes.com silvia@khaleejtimes.com {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell The week officially begins today with the sixth general assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, a key event in the policy pillar. Permanent representative of the UAE to the Irena Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi said: ""The global community took important steps in 2015 to advance sustainability issues with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Today, global leaders arrive in the UAE for Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week to take the next step in moving the sustainable development agenda forward."" ""The Paris Agreement set a long-term vision for the deep reduction of global emissions and the need to decarbonise the energy sector,"" said Irena director-general Adnan Z. Amin. ""The Irena Assembly must now take the next steps and establish a blueprint for action to meet our climate goals and set the world on a path to a sustainable energy future."" On Friday, the Irena hosted Legislators Forum 2016 as the first event of its kind. It facilitated dialogue between legislators on the deployment of renewables and critical elements of the energy transformation underway in countries around the world. On Monday, ADSW will host its joint opening ceremony, followed immediately by the awards ceremony of the eighth edition of the Zayed Future Energy Prize. Monday will also feature Abu Dhabi Global Action Day. This conference is aimed at turning the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into practical and innovative policy, investment, technology and partnership solutions, with a focus on identifying actions that can be taken by both the public and private sectors. Dr Ahmad Belhoul, chief executive officer of Masdar, said: ""Masdar is proud to once again host Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week. While there is no silver bullet to the challenges of sustainable development, these challenges represent a compelling economic opportunity - leading to more jobs, innovation and prosperity. ADSW 2016 will represent an important platform for the business community to cement the partnerships and collaborative initiatives that will promote sustainable development and the adoption of renewable energy.""

It also exchanged views on other issues, in particular, preparations for the COP21 /CMP 11 in Paris; the status of the UN post-2015 development agenda; the Organization's ongoing cooperation with the International Energy Forum and the International Energy Agency; the ongoing collaboration with various international organizations within the G-20; as well as OPEC's ongoing energy dialogue with the European Union, the Russian Federation, and others. The meeting had discussed, inter alia, oil market fundamentals and the global economy, with participants concluding that market stability remains a common objective for all producers, attainable through cooperative effort. Participants agreed to convene again before the end of the year. The Conference reviewed the oil market outlook, as presented by the Secretary General, in particular the demand and supply projections, and the outlook for the second half of 2015. The Conference noted that the global economic recovery had stabilized, albeit with growth at moderate levels. In the current year, GDP growth is projected at 3.3%, with this expected to be at a slightly higher level of 3.5% for 2016. Recording its continued concern over market volatility and the challenges faced by the global oil industry as a whole, the Conference observed, further, that the sharp decline in oil prices witnessed at the end of last year and the start of this year \- caused by oversupply and speculation \- had now abated, with prices moving slightly higher in recent months. The Conference noted that world oil demand is forecast to increase in the second half of 2015 and in 2016, with growth driven by non-OECD countries. On the supply side, non-OPEC growth in 2015 is expected to be just below 700,000 barrels per day, which is only around one-third of the growth witnessed in 2014. The Conference also observed the recent build in stocks and the surplus of oil in both OECD and non-OECD countries, which has resulted in stock levels that lie well above the five-year average in terms of absolute volumes, indicating that the market is comfortably supplied. \"

Non-hydro sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic panels (solar PV) will represent nearly half of the total global power capacity increase of over 700 GW, more than twice Japan's current installed power capacity, the Paris based IEA said in its annual market report, which was released at the G20 Energy Ministers meeting in Istanbul. The energy watchdog of the developed world anticipates that the share of renewable energy in global power generation will rise to over 26 percent by 2020 from 22 percent in 2013 a remarkable shift in a very limited period of time. ""By 2020, the amount of global electricity generation coming from renewable energy will be higher than today's combined electricity demand of China, India and Brazil,"" states the report, which sees the geography of deployment increasingly shift to emerging economies and developing countries. In fact, China alone is expected to account for nearly 40 percent of total renewable power capacity growth, requiring almost one-third of new investment to 2020, while India's share is expected to be 9 percent and Brazil 5 percent. Thus breaking the trend of economic growth leading to higher emissions, over the next five years fossil fuels will fire only half of new power stations being built across the world, the IEA report states. ""Renewable energy will represent the largest single source of electricity growth over the next five years, driven by falling costs and aggressive expansion in emerging economies,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told reporters. Birol however emphasised that government support for renewable projects remains critical as investors would be driven away if policies are not consistently supportive. Though solar and wind energy plants also have issues such as generation from solar panels shutting down at night and windmills able to work only when the wind is strong enough, but regulatory risks were a bigger concern, he stated. ""While variability of renewables is a challenge that energy systems can learn to adapt to, variability of policies poses a far greater risk,"" he said. Unlike in the past, when economic growth invariably led to higher emission of pollutants, renewable energy is offering a new paradigm. ""We see promising signs that emission and economic growth are decoupling. Renewable energy has played a crucial role here,"" he said. What is equally encouraging is the fact that the emerging economies are taking bigger steps in this direction, driven in China's case by need to cut down on local pollutions. Birol pointed out that the cost of renewable energy was also falling in part due to China's push for solar energy, which has helped cut costs by two-thirds in the past five years. Apart from solar energy, the costs of onshore wind energy have also fallen by one-third, but prices of offshore wind energy were still going up. An improving picture for renewables can have positive ramifications for global climate change negotiations. At the same time, a clear, supportive outcome from the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris in December could create a virtuous cycle for renewable deployment by increasing long-term policy vision and predictability.. \"

The country seeks to adopt best practices and environmental stewardship in energy through various strategies, action plans and initiatives. Dubai in particular has established ambitious clean energy goals, with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, DEWA, doing its part by increasing its renewable energy targets, better managing energy demand, and further reducing carbon footprint in accordance with the comprehensive strategic guidelines established by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy. The specific national contributions are intended to reduce emissions to slow the pace of rising temperatures. While they alone are not enough to limit the rise to the recommended level of 2 degrees Celsius this century, the INDCs assessed in the Emissions Gap report represent a historic step towards de-carbonising economies. To close the gap and limit global temperature increases to at most 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, it is essential that a new universal climate agreement be adopted by governments at COP 21 . ""Financing the transition to a low-carbon world requires smart government policies implemented in a specific and timely manner. While the international climate agreement expected to be signed in Paris will smoothen the path for organisations and companies, getting a head-start in the movement towards a low-carbon economy will most definitely provide a long-term competitive advantage, with partnerships to act as essential tools for achieving this goal,"" added Al Tayer. ""Companies can now determine how much emissions to cut to support the global goal of avoiding the 2 C increase in the Earth's temperature. This is achieved using methods based on the latest scientific climatic knowledge. For its part, the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence has intensified its efforts to work with major corporations to establish a green economy through its issuance of the State of Green Economy Report 2016. As one of the commitments made during the Dubai Declaration of 2014, the report offers a platform for local and international experts to share research, tools, and replicable initiatives,"" added Waleed Salman, Chairman of the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence. ""These INDCs reflect the commitment of the global community to begin a new era of reduced global warming. Governments from all corners of the globe have signified through their INDCs that they are determined to play their part to achieve this end,"" said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). For the first time, the Earth is expected to experience a temperature increase of one degree centigrade in 2015. This makes it higher than the registered rates before the industrial period, for the first time, according to the Meteorological Office of the Hadley Centre for Climate Science and Services and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, UK. Temperatures around the world have averaged 1.02C, above the 1850-1900 period, between January and September of this year. This new data requires immediate action in step with the growing momentum of efforts to address climate change as the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP 21 ) approaches. The projected one-degree increase is a concerning development, considering how as the world draws closer to a two-degree rise, the chances of the earth's major ecosystems being unbalanced becomes greater, according to the Meteorological Office of the Hadley Centre for Climate Science and Services. The World Meteorological Organisation reports that the two most critical greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and methane, both of which reached record highs last year. Scientists warn that beyond 2030, the Earth's ability to adapt to unabated climate change will be limited. The Emissions Gap Report, an authoritative assessment undertaken by a team of leading scientists and modelling experts from around the world, presented a review of the 119 Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \"

Commercial real estate benefits greatly from IoT implementation. IoT creates a unified view of facilities management as well as advanced service operations through the collection of data and insights from a multitude of sensors. ""Especially in large sites, such as industrial zones, office parks, shopping malls, airports or seaports, IoT can help reduce the cost of energy, spatial management and building maintenance by up to 30 percent,"" added Ms. Tratz-Ryan. The business applications that are fuelling the growth of IoT in commercial buildings are handled through building information management systems that drive operations management, especially around energy efficiency and user-centric service environments. In 2016, commercial security cameras and webcams as well as indoor LEDs will drive total growth, representing 24 percent of the IoT market for smart cities. IoT deployment in commercial buildings will continue to grow at a rapid pace over the next few years, and is on pace to reach just over 1 billion in 2018. ""Incentives into the deployment of IoT in commercial real estate will fuel its development,"" said Ms. Tratz-Ryan. ""The U.K.'s building information modelling (BIM) mandate, for example, requires that all public sector construction commencing in 2016 complies with BIM (level 2)."" BIM utilizes data models coming from various information sources including IoT, which will be used by commercial real estate in the future. Continues on next page [[page-break]] In smart homes, the consumer IoT applications that are fuelling growth are smart TVs, smart set-top boxes, smart bulbs and various home automation tools such as smart thermostats, home security systems and kitchen appliances. ""The growing maturity of smart home platforms through an ecosystem of home appliances, infotainment and home sensors will mean that smart home investments overtake those of commercial buildings in 2018,"" said Ms. Tratz-Ryan. Smart homes will represent 21 percent of total IoT use in smart cities in 2016, and will record the highest increase over the next five years. ""Device and wireless standards will be embedded in more devices. Homes will move from being interconnected to information- and smart-enabled  an integrated services environment that will provide value to the home and the individual ambience,"" added Ms. Tratz-Ryan. At the United Nations' climate change and sustainability conference, COP21 in Paris, many cities are pledging on environmental goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve environmental standards. ""Thanks to data collected from sensors, smart cities can interact and engage with residents and businesses, creating a collaborative environment,"" said Ms. Tratz-Ryan. In Singapore, for example, sensors in bus stops can identify people with different needs  buses are announced early to allow enough time for elderly people to be ready to board. In Malaga or Madrid, environmental sensor-mounted bikes or mail carts register air pollution, with the data uploaded onto a Web portal accessible by the public. ""Citizens can actively contribute to the development and strategic direction of their city,"" added Ms. Tratz-Ryan.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE166","Masdar CEO reflects on Year of Innovation, looks ahead to Year of Reading","December 31, 2015 Thursday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 31st December, 2015 (WAM) -- Masdar CEO, Dr. Ahmad Belhoul, has issued a statement outlining his perspective on the new Year of Reading and what it means for Masdar. Dr. Belhoul also highlights the importance of the upcoming Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week as a platform to catalyse continued innovation in the new year. ""The world is witnessing rapid change and continuous development. This is as true in the world of renewable energy and sustainable development, as it is elsewhere. The UAE leadership has long recognised that innovation, be it through new ideas or ground-breaking technology, is fundamental to the preservation of resources, diversification of the energy mix and the mitigation of climate change. When the UAE government announced 2015 would be the 'Year of Innovation', Masdar committed to re-doubling its efforts to grow its innovation ecosystem, not just for the benefit of the UAE but the wider global community. At Masdar, innovation is not just about invention, it is also about taking something that already exists and improving it, by challenging conventional thinking. One such example is water desalination. In November, Masdar launched a ground breaking pilot seawater desalination programme, aimed at dramatically reducing the energy intensity of desalination. The project offers four viable solutions for renewable-powered energy efficient desalination, transforming the desalination industry into a more sustainable model that can be used across the globe."" Dr. Belhoul went on to give examples of the practical application of innovative thinking, citing Masdar's partnership with ADNOC to create the joint venture Al Reyadah, the Middle East's first specialised company focusing on exploring commercial-scale Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage projects. The long-term goals of the programme include building a national network that captures carbon from power generation and industry, and using it for enhanced oil recovery. The benefits of reinjecting carbon dioxide rather than natural gas include securing the long-term storage of CO2 that contributes to climate change and preserving cleaner-burning natural gas so it can be used for power generation, or for transport. Another first, The Solar Hub, adds to the nation's innovation agenda by expediting the development of new solar technologies suitable for harsh desert environments. Located in Masdar City, this facility is the first independent, high quality solar testing and R&D facility in the region. By capitalising on the UAE's strengths as a renewable energy hub, the facility gives the global solar industry a foundation for research, new product development and collaboration with local and international companies. Another pioneering initiative, The Catalyst is the region's first technology startup accelerator focused on sustainability and clean tech. A partnership between Masdar, BP and Masdar Institute, The Catalyst, backed by US$ 5 million in funding from BP, supports fledgling innovators in the fields of energy, water and clean tech with seed funding, training, mentoring, and work space. Highlighting the unique positioning of The Catalyst, Dr. Belhoul said, ""In the nine years since our inception, Masdar has transformed from a bold idea into a commercially-viable renewable energy company. We want to leverage our own experience, as well as our unique infrastructure and assets at Masdar City, to create a platform for start-ups with similarly bold visions for sustainable technologies and turn their ideas into commercial realities."" A further example of innovation in action is the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, the UAE's most sustainable office building that was inaugurated in June. Located in Masdar City, the building will use 42 percent less energy than global energy-efficiency standards. It is also expected to use 50 percent less water and 64 percent less energy than similar commercial buildings in Abu Dhabi. Dr. Belhoul explained that the 2016 edition of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, ADSW, assumes added importance, as it will be the first opportunity for thought leaders, policy markers and investors to address the challenges of renewable energy and sustainable development, following the COP 21 climate change agreement. ""Just because the Year of Innovation has come to an end, it does not mean the end of innovation. Innovation takes place all year round, every year at Masdar. In light of the global consensus formed around the COP 21 climate agreement, the global community must commit to re-doubling our efforts to innovate and address the energy and sustainability challenges we all face,"" Dr. Belhoul said. ""As the region's largest gathering on sustainability, ADSW plays a significant role in stimulating international dialogue and action on renewable energy and sustainability. The knowledge exchange that will take place will inform solutions to the challenges the world faces for years to come."" That is why Dr, Belhoul believes that the UAE government's declaration that 2016 will be the Year of Reading is critically important and will contribute to innovative thinking in the future. ""Without reading, there can be no knowledge. And without knowledge there can be no innovation. And without innovation there can be no development,"" he said. ""As we enter the Year of Reading, Masdar will continue to be a platform for everyone who wants to learn more about sustainability."" \"

The additional 842 MW power is being sourced from six different wind and solar power projects in three different countries. All the projects are scheduled to be commissioned in the next two years, Google said in a blog post. Some of the deals were reportedly signed several weeks ago, but Google chose to announce them at a time when over 180 countries are deliberating at the UN climate change summit COP21 , being held in Paris, to forge a consensus agreement on ways to cut down on carbon emissions widely believed to be changing the Earth's climate. ""We've signed six large-scale Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which are long-term financial commitments to buy renewable energy from specific facilities,"" Google said in the blog post. Together with the new deal, the Alphabet Inc. unit now has contracts for 2 gigawatts of renewable energy worldwide, according to Google. The power-purchase agreements run from 10 to 20 years. ""It's the largest, most diverse purchase of renewable energy by a non-utility,"" Michael Terrell, Google's principal of energy and global infrastructure told Bloomberg in an interview. ""We wanted to send the message that corporate America is really committed to driving the transition to a clean-energy economy,"" Terrell said. Of the deals announced Thursday, Google will buy 200 MW power from Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc.'s Bluestem wind project, and 200 MW from Electricite de France SA's Great Western wind project. Both the projects are being set up in Oklahoma. Another contract for 225 MW of wind power has been signed with independent US power producer Invenergy LLC. In Chile, Google will source 80 MW solar power from Acciona Energia SA's El Romero farm, based in the Atacama region. The company has also agreed to buy 76 MW of wind power from Eolus Vind AB's Jenasen wind project in Sweden's Vasternorrland County. In July, Google had committed to tripling its purchases of renewable energy by 2025 from levels of 1.1 gigawatts of such power it had already contracted till then in a span of five years. ""Google has already committed to purchase more renewable energy than any other company. Now, through a series of new wind and solar projects around the world, we're one step closer to our commitment to triple our purchases of renewable energy by 2025 and our goal of powering 100% of our operations with clean energy,"" the US tech giant stated. Google signed its first large-scale PPA with a wind farm in Iowa in 2010. Last week, Google had finalized a deal to source 61 MW from a solar farm in North Carolina under a new state program that lets companies buy renewable energy directly from local utilities. ""Today's agreements will add an additional 842 MW of renewable energy capacity to power our data centers. Across three countries, we're nearly doubling the amount of renewable energy we've purchased to date. We're now up to 2 gigawattsthe equivalent to taking nearly 1 million cars off the road,"" Google stated. Earlier this year, Google had announced plans to locate its newest data center on the site of a retiring coal plant and fully power it with renewable energy from day one. Beyond powering its own operations with renewables, Google has made separate agreements to fund $2.5 billion into 22 large-scale renewable energy projects over the last five years, from Germany to Kansas to Kenya. These investments have been in some of the largest and most transformative renewable energy projects in the world with a goal to help drive renewable energy development not only as a customer but also as an investor.. \"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE170","Al Zeyoudi says UAE will sign new global deal on climate","April 4, 2016 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 4th April, 2016 (WAM)--Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, has revealed that the UAE will formally sign Conference of Parties ( COP ) 21 global climate agreement on 22nd April 22, adopted by more than 195 countries at last year's climate change summit in Paris. He added that the deal aims to reduce global warming and is expected to replace Kyoto Protocol that ends in 2020. Al Zeyoudi stressed the importance of the show hosted annually in Dubai, and pointed out that the UAE was a strategic wood re-export centre, thanks to its strategic and logistics location globally. He said the Dubai WoodShow has drawn participations from many countries reflecting their confidence in the market. Al Zeyoudi made the statement while inaugurating 'Dubai WoodShow 2016' on Monday. He noted that more than 250 companies from 42 countries are taking part in the show which targets traders, architects, decision makers from the contracting, environment and other relevant sectors, said the organisers. He said that the UAE has been financing over 30 renewable energy projects worth $840 million in 28 emerging countries under an ambitious funding programme launched six years ago. Legal trade of timber and the significance of dealing with licensed exporters of timber will also take a huge deal of discussions at the show which runs until April 6. According to the minister, the wood trade is very significant to the UAE where 70 per cent of wood goes to construction sector and 30 per cent to other various sectors which demonstrates the vital role of wood in the country's development. On the woodshow, Al Zeyoudi said, ""Based on my observation during the tour, this exhibition is up to the environmental standards where exhibiting companies are deploying stringent measures in wood production."" Wood is used as a major material for building in the GCC and it is also highly used in interior designs. The show encourages the use of wood with adherence to green and sustainable buildings in the region as well as in the UAE. \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE171","Does OPEC have a future?","April 30, 2016","Gulf Business","Dr Nasser Saidi examines the survival chances of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries amid low oil prices and the growth of renewable energy With oil prices down by almost 70 per cent from mid-2014, and touching multi- year lows recently, economies across the globe are gradually adjusting to the 'new oil normal' and the massive transfer of real income from producers to consumers. The market has changed radically from the days when the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was formed in the 1960s. Set up with the objective of coordi- nating and unifying petroleum policies among its member countries to ""secure fair and stable prices"" and ""maintain ef cient, economic and regular supply of petro- leum"", OPEC is a cartel. The cartel survived (unlike private sector cartels) because it was formed by governments that could acquire and maintain a monopolistic situation. But does it have a future? For the last 40 years, the Gulf Coop- eration Council countries, with the biggest producer Saudi Arabia in the lead, acted as\~swing producers, able to control prices. With relatively cheap production costs and a high level of proven reserves, Saudi Arabia could single-handedly send prices up (by pump- ing less) or down (by pumping more). But market forces responded to OPEC actions. Cuts in OPEC production to raise prices led to higher market shares for non- OPEC producers. When Saudi reduced its output by three-quarters from 10m barrels per day in 1980 to under 2.5m in 1985- 86, the result was higher prices but also a boom in exploration, investment and then production in places such as Britain and Norway, and then farther a eld in Africa and Latin America. The 'new oil normal' This time round, OPEC led by Saudi has opted for a predatory pricing strategy to drive new, higher-cost, tight oil producers out of business. In 2015, the world pro- duced 96.3m bpd of oil while it consumed only 94.5m bpd \- meaning that each day about 1.8m barrels went into storage tanks. Global oil and gas investments fell 22 per cent in 2015, down to $522bn, and are expected to fall further in 2016. Indeed, Arctic oil exploration has been frozen and globally oil firms have sus- pended investment of around $380bn. In an attempt to prevent further oil price falls, an agreement was reached in February 2016 to freeze output at January levels. But with Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq pump- ing at close to record levels, the freeze is unlikely to do much to curb the oversupply. Indeed, the structure and dynamics of the oil market has radically changed over the past decade; we are in the era of the new oil normal. What is different this time around? New energy supplies: Shale and renewables\~In its heyday, the market share of OPEC producers was around 50 per cent when\~there were few alternatives to fossil fuels. Now, it supplies around 30 per cent of the world's oil. New sources of oil have emerged. The shale industry has grown and over the past ve years around 4.2m bpd have been added from North America's shale produc- ers. Although accounting for only 5 per cent of global production, shale has had a determining impact on the market. Shale oil producers are using new technologies (hydraulic fracking) to access resources formerly considered too hard and costly to extract. The cost of extraction (rig and drill- ing costs) has fallen sharply \- so much so that that some wells can make money with prices around $40-45 a barrel, according to Rystad Energy. With declining produc- tion costs, shale producers are here to stay. The return of Iran, Libya and Iraq to the oil market adds to the supply overhang. The lifting of sanctions on Iran promises to bring an additional 600,000 bpd and to send oil prices down to their lowest levels since 2003. The other major source of new energy has been the revolution in renewables \- solar, wind, water, geothermal and bio-mass. Renewable energy has made enormous strides. A record $329bn was invested in clean energy in 2015, despite persistently low oil prices. The forecasts are striking. By 2040, the world's power-generating capac- ity mix will have transformed from today's system composed of two-thirds fossil fuels to one, with 56 per cent from zero emission energy sources. Renewables will command just under 60 per cent of the 9,786GW of new gen- erating capacity installed over the next 25 years and two thirds of the $12.2 tril- lion of investment. The cost of solar power has declined by some 70 per cent over the past ve years, while modern wind turbines ""Emerging market economies enjoyed spectacular growth in the decades from the mid- 1980s all the way through to the global nancial crisis, almost doubling their contribution to world GDP and acting as the main engine of global economic expansion, leading to a surge in demand for oil and commodities"" Portrait by Gausa Viktor Danusovich\~produce 15 times more electricity than the typical wind turbine in 1990. The bottom line is that renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuel. Technological innovation is leading to lower costs and there is a growing adoption of renewables in all energy applications; in households, businesses and public uses. Whether increased supply from shale or substitution and competition from renewable energies, these supply side factors all imply down-\~ward pressure on oil prices\~and OPEC's resources. Moving to a\~decarbonised world\~Demand side factors are also\~leading to downward pressure on oil prices. The heralded fourth industrial revolu- tion will be associated with growing energy ef ciency and the decarbonisation of our societies and economies. We are living through the end of the oil age. The new oil normal is the end for OPEC The new oil normal and its underlying demand and supply fundamen- tals have permanently altered the structure and dynamics of the oil market. The oil world that OPEC helped build is defunct. The raison d'\'eatre of OPEC has been overwhelmed by struc- tural and technological change and innovation. To quote former Saudi oil minister Sheikh Zaki Yamani: ""The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone nancial crisis, almost doubling their con- tribution to world gross domestic product. But there is a slowdown in emerg- ing market economies. The International Monetary Fund estimates that, although EME growth still accounts for over 70 per cent of global growth, economic activity has been subdued in these nations with growth expected at 4.3 per cent this year. In particular, China, the world's second biggest economy that had been growing at double-digit rates, has slowed down to below 7 per cent growth \- leading to lower growth in demand for oil. In addi- tion, as China rebalances its economy, moving away from energy-intensive heavy industry and manufacturing toward con- sumption and services (while investing heavily in renewable energy), the previ- ous fuel-hungry nation's need for oil is on a downward trend. Energy e ciency and COP21 Two other factors also imply a lower trend in the demand for oil. One is that coun- tries are becoming more energy ef cient. Transport, buildings, industry, manufac- turing and services are all more energy ef cient and industrial applications of energy ef ciency can deliver 100 per cent payback in ve years. Organisation for Economic Develop- ment and Cooperation energy consumption is now as low as it was in 2000. Despite GDP growing by 26 per cent, energy con- sumption per capita declined by 9 per cent. Increasingly, countries are decoupling economic growth from energy consump- tion growth with energy ef ciency being the main contributing factor. A similar energy efficiency trend is happening in emerging economies as a result of growing investment in energy ef ciency, notably in pollution conscious China. The second factor is the recent Confer- ence of the Parties 21 agreement promises to peak greenhouse gas emissions ""as soon as possible"" and to keep global tempera- ture increases ""well below"" two degrees centigrade. COP21 commitments imply gradual decarbonisation, a downward shift in demand for fossil fuels and substi- tution towards cleaner fuels such as gas, plus new investments in renewable energy, energy ef ciency and clean energy genera- tion capacity. In addition, an energy storage techno- logical revolution is happening. The cost of energy storage (batteries and other forms of power storage) is expected to drop to $100 per kWh in the next ve years, against $250 now, to the advantage of renewable energy. In turn, this will favour electric vehicles, with recent research forecasting that EVs will represent up to a quarter of all cars on the road by 2040. and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil."" For OPEC has a dim future. Shale oil producers are now the marginal produc- ers amid vocal dissension and discord within the cartel as to how to deal with the reality of the new oil normal. Then there is the growing competition from renewable energy in a world facing cli- mate change calamity and increasingly committed to decarbonise. Oil prices are likely to remain depressed over the medium and longer-term. The future is for decarbonised econ- omies, increasingly reliant on renewable energies. So OPEC should transform itself into the Organisation of Renewa- ble Energy Countries. The GCC countries should heed the warning of the new oil normal and change strategy over the next decade. They should phase out fuel subsidies, introduce a carbon tax and invest mas- sively in energy ef ciency and renewable energy \- notably solar \- to become global centres of research and development, production, export and nance in rela- tion to renewable energy. \"

""The alliance aims to reduce the amount of greenhouse emissions caused by desalination by up to 70 percent before 2035 by finding cleaner alternatives to an energy-intensive process that is a major part of the UAE's environmental footprint,"" said The National in an editorial today. ""Finding cleaner and smarter ways to produce the country's potable water supply makes sense, not just for the environment, but also for the economy. The need for secure access to clean drinking water is a major issue around the world. A United Nations report published in March showed that demand for water will keep increasing to the point where, if we fail to tackle this problem, the planet may only be able to supply 60 percent of its needs by 2030. ""The UAE is well-positioned to take on this task, being host to both the global headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency, Irena, and the World Future Energy Summit, which provides a platform to discuss ideas and issues related to sustainability. Last month, four Masdar City-based energy companies, Abengoa, Suez Environment, Sidem/Veolia and Trevi Systems, started operating experimental, small-scale, environmentally-friendly desalination plants at Masdar's Al Ghantoot facility. And this month, Masdar launched a groundbreaking pilot seawater desalination programme that promises to significantly reduce the amount of energy used in the process. ""Building on these initiatives in partnership with other advanced countries will help establish the UAE as a leading centre for know-how in this area. Masdar will work closely with its global collaborators on a range of issues relating to sustainability and clean water. This will enable an exchange of ideas and technologies that will boost local research and development, and help find innovative solutions to the global problem of water security. ""New technologies such as solar desalination and geothermal desalination will cost large sums to develop, but the need is critical. With renewable energy becoming increasingly important, the UAE can build on what it has already achieved and reap the rewards of being a centre of excellence,"" concluded the daily. \"

The first inauguration took place in Tuvalu on Tuesday and was attended by Dr Mohammed Al Qubaisi, director of the energy affairs division in the Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tuvalu's Prime Minister Enele Sosene Spoaga, and Tuvalu's Governor-General Otinielu Tauteleimalae Tausi. ""As a strong supporter of COP 21 as well as the energy-related sustainable development goal adopted by the United Nations, Masdar's efforts to limit the impact of climate change, including our commitment to broaden access to clean energy for a greater number of people, are clearly demonstrated through the delivery of the solar plants of Tuvalu and Kiribati,"" Dr Ahmad Belhoul, chief executive of Masdar, said. ""This project would contribute approximately 40 per cent towards the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation peak demand which could save more than 200,000 litres of diesel fuel per annum, about eight per cent of the annual fuel consumption of the Fogafale Power Station."" Development of the 500 kW solar and water protection project on Tarawa, Kiribati, was started in December 2014, and completed in August this year. It will officially be inaugurated later this week. The republic, comprising 33 coral atolls, lies in the Central Pacific, and has a population of more than 100,000 - half of whom live on Tarawa atoll where the capital, South Tarawa, is situated. ""The renewable energy to be delivered through the solar and water protection plant in Tarawa helps the country overcome not only the constraints of natural fuel resources, but also eases access to large numbers of individuals and families to sustainable electricity provision,"" Waysang Kumkee, Minister for Public Works and Utilities of Kiribati, said. The projects form part of the UAE's support for economic and social development of Pacific island nations, while also showcasing the viability of sustainable clean energy development models. The projects also aim to reduce the Pacific island nations' dependency on imported diesel, freeing up essential financial resources for other developmental projects.

""The launch of the Quest CCS project in Alberta, Canada, is remarkable, as it provides another excellent example of the fact that CCS is about so much more than just coal-fired power,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. ""It can be used in many industrial sectors where no other solutions exist to significantly reduce the CO2 footprint."" The IEA also pointed to the timeliness of the launch of the project, as momentum builds ahead of the UN climate negotiations ( COP-21 ) that start in three weeks. Dr. Birol added: ""The launch of a new CCS project is particularly significant ahead of the Paris climate negotiations, as world leaders will be looking to strike a deal for deep emission reductions. Quest provides further proof that CCS is emerging as a real option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" The IEA Executive Director also congratulated Canada and the Province of Alberta for their role in making the project a reality: ""Getting the Quest project up and running is another great example of how Canada is a leader in CCS,"" he said. Canada last year launched the world's first large-scale power station equipped with CCS technology. The IEA believes that CCS plays a key role in an ambitious, climate-friendly future energy scenario, accounting for one-sixth of required emissions reductions by 2050. IEA analysis also shows that without significant deployment of CCS, more than two-thirds of current proven fossil-fuel reserves cannot be commercialised before 2050 if the increase in global temperatures is to remain below 2 degrees Celsius. The Shell Quest project, inaugurated on Friday near Edmonton, captures more than 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 at Shell's Scotford upgrader. The CO2 is transported via a 60-kilometer pipeline to where it will be injected and permanently stored in the Basal Cambrian Sand, a geological formation more than 2 000 meters underground. The Scotford upgrader and the Quest project are part of the 255 000-barrel-per-day Athabasca Oil Sands Project. The world's first CCS project, Sleipner, started in Norway in 1996 and continues to operate today, storing nearly 1 million tonnes of CO2 yearly in the North Sea. CCS projects are entering operation, under construction or in advanced stages of planning in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, bringing the world towards the threshold of 10 million tonnes of CO2 captured and verified as stored every year. \"

""The first step must be a politically credible trajectory for mobilizing $100 billion dollars per annum by 2020. The methodology for deciding what is climate finance, and how private finance is counted, needs to be developed by all concerned \- developed and developing countries alike,"" Mr, Ban told a gathering of Climate Finance Ministers in Lima, Peru. The Secretary-General is currently in Lima, Peru to participate in the 2015 Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund. In his remarks to the Ministers, he urged the developed countries to mobilize new climate finance resources beyond their official development assistance (ODA) and above what is already on the table, stating that 'mobilization is about more than accounting.' The UN chief also commended Germany, France and the United Kingdom for making pledges recently to double their public climate finance commitments. He asked other countries to make similar announcements before a UN conference in Paris, known informally as COP 21 , where global leaders and international organizations will meet in December to agree a historic universal climate change accord. ""[Such announcements] are essential for strengthening equity and global solidarity. Trust can also be strengthened through innovative financing mechanisms that provide debt relief and new resources to strengthen the resilience of small island development states and least developed countries,"" Mr. Ban continued.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE177","Masdar, France set up water desal alliance","January 1, 2016","Gulf Industry Worldwide","The quest for water security took a step forward following the launch of a clean water alliance between Masdar, Abu Dhabi\' s renewable energy company, France and other members of the International Desalination Association (IDA). H20 minus CO2 was set up during the COP21 UN climate meeting in Paris, France. As a founding signatory of H20 minus CO2, Masdar called upon governments as well as energy, water and related industry stakeholders including laboratories and research organisations, universities and NGOs to join the alliance. Those who have already pledged support to the alliance include stakeholders from industry, research institutions, universities and other organisations from Australia, Belgium, China, the Comoros, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the UK, the US and Singapore. Masdar said the H20 minus CO2 was launched as a collaborative global climate initiative and one of the key components to the Lima Paris Action Plan. It has an initial group of more than 80 signatories from government as well as the public and private sectors. With access to drinking water already a major challenge for as much as one quarter of the world\' s population, and further forecasts predicting that by 2030, 47 per cent of the global population will face water scarcity, the alliance is one of the few climate initiatives dealing with the water-energy nexus and climate change, it stated. Its goal is to seek solutions that will substantially reduce the projected increase in CO2 emissions from the desalination process, as global demand for drinking water continues to grow. The action plan could see a decrease in emissions from 50 MT CO2 up to as much as 270 MT CO2 per year by 2040, said a statement from Masdar. The action plan includes obtaining amplified commitment by all alliance members to use clean energy sources to power new desalination plants and to retrofit existing plants, whenever possible, it added. Further focus is on improved energy efficiency of desalination processes, increased efforts on R&D and demonstration projects, better dissemination of innovative technologies, capacity building and analysis and formulation of adequate policies and regulatory frameworks. The concept note of the alliance underlines that the initiative will ensure that sustainability of the entire desalination process is taken into account beyond the sole issue of energy sources. Commenting on the initiative, Masdar CEO Dr Ahmad Belhoul, said:  The UAE government has long recognised the potential impact of climate change on the future of the country and the region.  It was in fact the first country in the region to set renewable energy targets and has recently announced a commitment to increase clean energy to 24 per cent of the country\' s total energy mix by 2021. Belhoul said as one of the most water-scarce countries on the planet, the UAE is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies to improve the energy efficiency of the desalination process.  This is an integral part of Masdar\' s remit as we continue to provide a platform for the development and deployment of renewable energy and low-carbon technologies locally, regionally and globally \- while creating a new clean energy growth-generating sector in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the greater UAE, he added. IDA secretary general Patricia A Burke said the association was proud to be a founding member of the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance.  We have long been a champion of environmental responsibility in desalination practices including lower energy consumption and an increase in the use of renewable energy to power desalination, resulting in the reduction of CO2 emissions. This has been a goal of IDA\' s Energy and Environmental Task Forces, and we believe that the GCWDA initiative will bring us ever-closer to realising this objective, she stated. Jean Louis Bal, the president, Syndicat des Energies Renouvelables, France, said:  Access to water of the populations of the South and many other areas even in industrialised countries will be secured in the future due to renewable energy and innovation. Belhoul said Masdar was already spearheading innovation on water desalination through the development and activation of advanced and innovative desalination technologies with significantly enhanced energy efficiency. The project offers four viable solutions for renewable-powered energy efficient desalination, transforming the desalination industry into a more sustainable model that can be used across the globe.

The third Ariane 5 launch of the year took place on July 15 at 6:42 pm local time in Kourou, French Guiana, from the Guiana Space Center (CSG). Star One C4, built by Space Systems/Loral (SSL), is the company's tenth satellite. It will increase Embratel Star One's telecom, broadcast and Internet service capacity in Brazil, other South American countries, Mexico and the United States. Arianespace and Embratel Star One have teamed up successfully for the last 30 years, with Arianespace launching all of the company's satellites. With Star One C4, Arianespace and SSL celebrate their 50th joint mission to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). Arianespace's current launch manifest includes 14 more SSL-built satellites to be launched. Built by Thales Alenia Space, the MSG-4 satellite will carry on the mission assigned to EUMETSAT's Second Generation satellites. EUMETSAT is the European Meteorological Satellite organization, dedicated to monitoring weather, climate and environmental conditions. Its meteorological observation services, primarily intended for Europe, will also extend to encompass Africa (including Reunion Island), the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of South America. The partnership between Arianespace and EUMETSAT, serving all European citizens, reaches back to 1981; MSG-4 is the tenth Meteosat satellite to be launched by Arianespace. Shortly after the announcement that the two satellites had been injected into orbit, Arianespace Chairman and CEO St\'e9phane Isra\'ebl said: ""Arianespace is very proud of having successfully completed this evening's dual launch, orbiting the Star One C4 satellite for the private operator Embratel Star One, to bolster its position in the Americas; and the MSG-4 satellite for the European organization EUMETSAT, which will be able to commission the fourth and last of its second-generation satellites. I would like to thank our customers for their continuing loyalty, which has been unflagging for more than 30 years. Along with them, we are very honoured to launch these satellites that will improve life on Earth and support sustainable development, just a few months before the COP 21 climate change conference. ""I would also like to thank all our partners who contributed to this sixth launch of the year, the 66th successful launch in a row and the 80th overall for Ariane 5: ESA, prime contractor for the Ariane program; all European companies who contribute to Ariane under the direction of industrial prime Airbus Safran Launchers; the satellite manufacturers SSL and Thales Alenia Space; CNES-CSG and companies at the launch base; and of course the men and women of Arianespace, whose commitment and professionalism are clearly reflected in the success of this sixth launch of the year."" \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE179","Jordan's King Abdullah II inaugurates Middle East's first utility-scale wind farm, a joint project of Abu Dhabi's Masdar, InfraMed and EP Global Energy","December 17, 2015 Thursday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","TAFILA, Jordan, 17th December, 2015 (WAM) --- His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn al-Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan inaugurated today the first utility-scale wind power project in the Middle East with high-level officials from across the Middle East in attendance, including HRH Prince Talal bin Muhammad; Dr Abdullah Ensour, the Prime Minister of Jordan; Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and Chairman of Masdar; Dr Ibrahim Saif, Jordan Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources; Bilal Rabie Bilal Al Bodour, UAE Ambassador to Jordan; and Dr Ahmad Belhoul, CEO of Masdar. Built by the Jordan Wind Project Company (JWPC), the wind farm is a joint project of Masdar, InfraMed and EP Global Energy. ""The vision of Masdar is to drive innovation and push the boundaries in the advancement of renewables \- to improve existing methods or find new solutions that will be more effective, more efficient and more affordable. If the watchword in our industry leading up to COP21 in Paris was 'commitment', with the historic climate accord now reached, the next phase will be all about £ction'. This project is a concrete example of action - providing energy security while offsetting carbon emissions and diesel use,"" said Dr Ahmad Belhoul, CEO of Masdar. ""One of the most important issues for our region is securing a sustainable energy future. Finding solutions is critical to our continued economic and social development. This is a historic day for the Middle East as the Tafila Wind farm shows the region is committed to expanding access to new forms of clean energy. Masdar is proud to have been a key partner in the Tafila project,"" he added. Jordan has long relied on fuel imports, especially diesel, to electrify the country's homes and businesses as the nation lacks sufficient domestic energy supplies. The Tafila Wind Farm puts Jordan firmly on the renewable energy map and will help diversify the country's energy portfolio. It will account for almost ten per cent of Jordan's renewable energy target for 2020. The 117 megawatt installation, which will provide three per cent of the Kingdom's total energy needs, will create enough electricity to power 83,000 homes while reducing the country's emissions by 235,000 tonnes annually. With Jordan's domestic electricity demands estimated to grow five per cent annually through 2020, the Tafila Wind Farm is critical to the production of new sources of energy to prevent future shortfalls while doing displacing future greenhouse gas emissions. Located 183 kilometres south of Jordan's capital, Amman, the farm is the first wind power project to be developed under Jordan's 2010 Renewable and Energy Efficiency Law. Its 38 turbines have been fully commissioned and are projected to generate 400 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually. ""Jordan's commitment to renewable energy proves that the Middle East is poised for a new era in investment and economic development,"" added Belhoul. ""Masdar's investments in new infrastructure projects like Tafila, as well as our global portfolio of wind projects including the London Array and Dudgeon, will benefit both companies and citizens throughout the region and around the world. Masdar is always evaluating new projects of this scope and scale to help the economies of the Middle East become more diversified and resilient."" With the World Energy Council projecting energy consumption in the Middle East and North Africa region to soar by as much as 114 per cent by 2050, it is incumbent upon countries to deploy new sources of energy in order to meet future demand. Renewables can complement current and future hydrocarbon supplies while also reducing nations' exposure to energy price volatility. In striving to reach its renewable energy target, Jordan implemented a feed-in tariff to provide investors market stability, price certainty and attract businesses that are considering projects in the Middle East region. A feed-in tariff guarantees a universal tariff for renewable power producers and encourages investors and contractors to commit to long-term power generation contracts. Often viewed by energy analysts as the quickest path towards accelerating renewable energy deployment, the feed-in tariff in Jordan is the first such scheme within the Middle East and North Africa region. The Jordanian government continues to highlight the importance of these projects not only in terms of providing jobs, but also for accelerating progress on its national development plan, Jordan Vision 2025, which was announced last May. Masdar is Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company which works to advance the development, commercialisation and deployment of clean energy technologies and solutions. The company serves as a link between today's fossil fuel economy and the energy economy of the future. Wholly owned by the Mubadala Development Company PJSC, the strategic investment company of the Government of Abu Dhabi, Masdar is dedicated to the United Arab Emirates' long-term vision for the future of energy and water. \"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE182","Top four survival tips in times of low oil prices","January 25, 2016 Monday","ArabianOilandGas.com","With oil prices plummeting to below $30 dollars a barrel for the second time this week, here are fourmain areas business leaders in the oil and gas sector need to master if they want to survive the storm. Growth Management Identify and post-pone projects with a high degree of uncertainty. Be especially ruthless with any at the early stages of development which can be killed without much fuss.Seek partners to share in the risk \- and of course, reward, of projects. For example, through part-sale of operating interest in new discoveries. If you can, explore opportunistic growth via acquisition in areas with room for consolidation, for example oilfield services. There is no reason that the current environment should lead toe a growth paralysis mindset. There could be valuable growth opportunities right now, for example via M&A or by continuing investment in nationally important, high-profile projects with longer-term value. Cost Management Do not throw out the baby with the bath-water. Concentrate your asset sales on those not central to long-term strategy as much as possible. Organisations with a strong core focus are always better prepared in times of extreme stress or volatility. Where redundancies are inevitable, manage them carefully to account for skills-gap impact, and ensure readiness for future growth when the oil price rebounds. Re-negotiate discounts with contractors to manage service costs and on-going expenditure. There could be room here as many suppliers may prefer lower margins to idle machinery in the challenging times we are currently experiencing. Funding Management.In the near term it can often all be about survival but do not lose sight of a credible growth story for the longer-term. To give your organisation the best chance of attracting funding, ensure the security of your current income stream, even if it is reduced. That stability is key to ensuring there is a consistent stream if income. It is important to model the impact of rising interest rates on sourcing bank and debt funding. Seek a realistic picture as oil prices cannot be modelled on a safe, upward trajectory to pay for higher rates with future income as they have been in the past.As minimising risk and exposure becomes critical, explore non-debt options for funding. For example, with specialist equity investors who play exclusively in the oil and gas sector. In short, private equity funds are going to be your friends. Managing externalities Your organisation should aspire to a clear and respected voice on key sector issues such as the advocating role of government, whether via regulations and global transparency frameworks, or tax incentives to support reduced revenues. On a similar note, the inevitable short-term fire-fighting should not come at the expense of the long view. You should also be looking at on-going evaluation of strategic issues such as climate change policy ( COP 21 ), and its implications in the near and longer term. The above findings have been extracted from a recent report by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). \"

""What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save it,"" Obama said at the UN climate change summit COP-21 , being held at the Le Bourget conference center outside the French capital two weeks after the bloody terror strikes by the IS. ""We have come to Paris to show our resolve,"" Obama said, saying he offered condolences to the French people. Obama joined leaders from 150 nations in pledging action against climate change, and termed the conference a ""turning point"" in the battle against one of humanity's gravest threats. ""The growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other,"" Obama said in a speech. ""What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet.""

Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Jose Graziano da Silva and French Minister for Agriculture, Stephane Le Foll, warned that failure to do so would unravel recent progress made in combating world hunger. Mr. da Silva and Mr. Le Foll made their appeals at a CFS side event. The CFS is an intergovernmental body that serves as a forum for the review of food security and nutrition policies. Both Mr. Da Silva and Mr. Le Foll urged countries to reach an agreement on how to combat climate change ahead of the upcoming UN conference in Paris, known informally as COP 21 , where global leaders and international organizations will meet to reach consensus on a historic climate change accord. The FAO Director-General hailed the international community's recent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes the eradication of hunger and extreme poverty. He emphasized that, in order to achieve these goals, agriculture and food systems that are more productive and adapted to climate change are needed. ""We can end extreme poverty and hunger by 2030,"" said Mr. Da Silva. ""We know what works and we have the tools for it, but we know climate change threatens to derail our efforts. It is already impacting on food security and making hunger eradication even more difficult."" ""We believe that agriculture in the broad sense \- including forestry, fisheries and aquaculture \- can and must play a central role in addressing climate change, particularly in adapting its impacts, such as water scarcity, soil salinity or increasing pests and diseases of plants and animals,"" he added. Mr. Le Foll cautioned that everyone on the planet would bear the consequences ""if the world's leaders cannot find agreement on tangible and concrete objectives"" to curb global warming. Noting that agriculture is often viewed as a problem due to its role in greenhouse-gas emissions, Mr. Le Foll called for the need to make progress with techniques that ""allow us to be more economical and consume less energy."" Mr. da Silva said that the world's poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the droughts and floods caused by global warming. He also noted the additional challenges faced by family farmers, fishermen and community foresters, who were both highly dependent on the world's natural resources and also the first to suffer due to climate-related shocks: ""they are the least responsible for climate change and cannot be expected to bear the costs of adaption to climate change,"" he said. He called for policies and investments to adapt agriculture to climate change, including reducing deforestation and overfishing, improving soil fertility and achieving lower emissions.

These are among the key findings to be presented in the final results report from World Wide Views, the largest ever global citizen consultation on climate change carried out among 10,000 citizens in 76 countries across all time zones on the same day in June. The final report is being launched on Saturday, 26 September at a high-level event during the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. The response from citizens, which was overwhelmingly in favor of strong and ambitious climate action, highlights the global public's conviction that governments need to reach a strong and effective new climate change agreement at COP 21 , the UN climate change conference in Paris, in December. Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said: ""The voice of ordinary citizens of men and women North and South, East and West has now been heard ahead of Paris and that voice is clear and consistent: they want a strong and durable global climate agreement that will, over the decades to come, restore the balance of planet Earth and avoid dangerous climate change."" ""World Wide Views has also shown that people everywhere have a deep understanding of the challenge and the paths we must greater finance for climate action; building more progress in line with the different capacities of countries; strengthening the role of citizen participation in the UN climate negotiations. The worldwide consultation revealed a global citizenship both well-informed and motivated about climate change but which wants to know more about the concrete issues so it can take a direct part in the solutions. This requires a sharp and sustained focus on education, training and public awareness at all levels of government, society and enterprise to empower everyone to take climate action. The UNFCCC supports these initiatives under its ACE (Action for Climate Empowerment) initiatives. WWViews results are based on well-established principles for citizen participation. They offer detailed insights into lay people's views on climate change and energy, and unique input on how to implement global policies to deal with these issues. The results show a clear worldwide support by citizens for their politicians to take ambitious action against climate change. A total of 97% of citizens across the globe want a Paris agreement to include a long-term goal for zero emissions by the end of this century, and two-thirds of the citizens want this goal to be legally binding for all countries. The strong support for taking action also reflects a high level of concern for the effects of climate change \- among the 97% of participants worldwide who are concerned about the effects of climate change, 78% declared they are ""very concerned"". Although results differ between the 76 countries, there are only minor differences between continents, developed and developing countries and generations. Interestingly, young and adult participants voted in very similar ways. \"

Governments today asked the two delegates who are co-chairing the negotiations to table text in mid-July that begins shaping what will be the Paris agreement and what will be the supporting decisions the so called 'Paris Package'. The decisions will operationalize the ambition contained in the Paris Agreement which is aimed at deeper, more accelerated and long term global action to address climate change: namely by keeping a global temperature rise under 2 degrees C while protecting the vulnerable from harmful impacts. The co-chairs text should also make it easier for governments including ministers to identify the key political decisions that will have to be taken at and in advance of the UN climate convention conference in France. Several key ministerial meetings have been organized over the coming months including by the French Presidency of the UN climate conference. ""The path to Paris is now happening on both the political and negotiating levels and with a mood of exceptional confidence and engagement what is being managed here is no longer resistance to an agreement but complexity, enthusiasm and an understanding that every nation is playing its part,"" said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). ""The negotiations are also occurring against the backdrop of an accelerating wave of climate action from non-State actors including cities, regions, territories and companies which is contributing confidence to the process,"" she said. to ensure the world remains on track to deliver in Paris,"" said Ms. Figueres. ""Governments are committed to reach an agreement that sets down the pathways and the supporting structures for a century-long transformation that allows all countries to reach a sustainable, clean energy future,"" she added. ""What is occurring is in many ways unprecedented in the history of international cooperation in respect to vision and scale. Everyone's concerns are being accommodated and everything has to move in parallel it is understandably a complex but now also a very dynamic process,"" said Ms. Figueres. During the Bonn meeting, the global commitment to keep the world below a 2?C temperature rise received significant impetus from the industrialized G7 nations. The G7, at their summit in Schloss Elmau, Germany, issued a final communique which emphasized that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required with a decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century. They also said they would continue efforts to provide USD 100 billion a year by 2020 to support developing countries own climate actions. Meanwhile, a new report from the UN Environment Programme found that non-State climate initiatives might bring emissions savings of close to 1.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020. Countries under the UNFCCC reconvene in Bonn from 31 August to 4 September where the new text developed by co-chairs Ahmed Djoghlaf of Algeria and Daniel Reifsnyder of the United States will form the basis of the next round of negotiations.A further round of negotiations is scheduled for October in advance of the Paris climate conference ( COP 21 ). \"

Below are select comments and quotes: EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER: Today the world is united in the fight against climate change. Today the world gets a lifeline, a last chance to hand over to future generations a world that is more stable, a healthier planet, fairer societies and more prosperous economies. This robust agreement will steer the world towards a global clean energy transition. US SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY: This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizen, not for any one country, or any one bloc, but for everybody here who has worked so hard to bring this across the finish line. It is a victory for all of the planet and for future generations. We have set a course here. The world has come together around an agreement that will empower us to chart a new path for our planet, a smart and responsible path, a sustainable path. HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We cannot afford to be slowed by the climate skeptics or deterred by the defeatists who doubt America's ability to meet this challenge. That's why as president, I will make combating climate change a top priority from day one, and secure America's future as the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. BERNIE SANDERS, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT: While this is a step forward it goes nowhere near far enough. The planet is in crisis. We need bold action in the very near future and this does not provide that. COP21 conference in Paris have culminated in a global deal, with the whole world now signed up to play its part in halting climate change. In other words, this generation has taken vital steps to ensure that our children and grandchildren will see that we did our duty in securing the future of our planet. What is so special about this deal is that it puts the onus on every country to play its part. INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND CHIEF CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Governments must now put words into actions, in particular by implementing policies that make effective progress on the mitigation pledges they have made. That is why my key message is to price carbon right and to do it now. WORLD BANK GROUP PRESIDENT JIM YONG KIM: We welcome the historic agreement that has just been reached in Paris. The world has come together to forge a deal that finally reflects the aspiration, and the seriousness, to preserve our planet for future generations. We called for strong ambition, for remarkable partnerships, for mobilization of finance, and for implementation of national climate plans. Paris delivered. Now the job becomes our shared responsibility. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY: The IEA congratulates all Parties, under the leadership of the French Presidency, for the successful conclusion of the landmark Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is nothing less than a historic milestone for the global energy sector. It will speed up the transformation of the energy sector by accelerating investments in cleaner technologies and energy efficiency. PRAKASH JAVADEKAR, INDIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER: We have opened a new chapter of hope in the lives of 7 billion people on the planet. We have (the planet) on loan from future generations.

GERMAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER BARBARA HENDRICKS: ""For the first time all the countries of the world are together on the path to save the planet ... we fought for a long time and today we've reached a solid agreement. It is a historic turning point."" PAUL POLMAN, CEO, UNILEVER: Today's agreement demonstrates without question that it is possible for us to come together in common cause to address the greatest challenges we face, preventing tragedy for the many millions of people vulnerable to the effects of climate change and securing the economic prosperity of the world in the 21st century. The result is an unequivocal signal to the business and financial communities, one that will drive real change in the real economy. The billions of dollars pledged by developed countries will be matched with the trillions of dollars that will flow to low carbon investment. PHILIPPE DEFOSSES, DIRECTOR OF FRENCH PENSION FUND ERAFP: The Paris agreement marks a tipping point. Going forward the world has a shared vision that will lead inexorably to investors moving away from fossil fuels and towards a future powered by low carbon energy. Investors will encourage every country keen to build a sustainable economy to develop a long-term low-emissions development strategy, including carbon pricing schemes, so that investors know ambition levels over the short, medium- and long-term. JEFFREY SACHS, DIRECTOR OF THE EARTH INSTITUTE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: The diplomats have done their job: the Paris Agreement points the world in the right direction, and with sophistication and clarity. It does not, however, ensure implementation, which necessarily remains the domain of politicians, businessmen, scientists, engineers, and civil society. GE SPOKESPERSON: We applaud governments on this important milestone and look forward to reviewing details of agreement. GE will continue to lead business in combatting climate change by working across sectors to drive innovation, invest in new technologies and scale new business models.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE190","Japan eyes Hydrogen Future","January 31, 2016 Sunday","Capital Business","In search of its energy independence and environmental credibility, Japan, the sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, has surprised everyone with a new vision to create a ""hydrogen society"", a dream that leaves some experts skeptical. The country will reveal more to the world with a new commitment to reduce emissions by 26% between 2013 through 2030, by presenting its plans at the UN International Climate Conference ( COP21 ). The conference is being held in Paris between November 30 and December 11 of this year. ""Hydrogen is the energy of the future,"" says Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, eyeing a market of no less than one trillion yen (7.5 billion euros) annually from the hydrogen economy by 2030. Japan sees a great opportunity to promote this innovative technology during the Olympic Games in Tokyo coming in 2020. The project has gained importance after the disaster at Fukushima, which deprived the country of all nuclear power on the archipelago for two years. Since the program inception in 2009, Japan has equipped more than 100,000 homes with fuel cells powered by hydrogen. Utilizing a device the size a refrigerator at each house to generate electricity. An energy farm (as the Japanese say an ene-farm unit) pumps natural gas from a local utility into a fuel cell, which uses a processor to extract the hydrogen and mix it with oxygen from the ambient air. The reaction produces enough power to cover about half the energy demand for an average family. The byproduct is excess heat that supplies a home with hot water. Japan's objective is to equip 1.4 million households by 2020 and 5.3 million in 2030 with these fuel cells. Costs may prove dissuasive to the achievement of Japan's goals. Despite government subsidies and the support from companies like Panasonic and Toshiba, these systems remain expensive - costing two million yen (Pound 15,000 euros) each. However, it should be noted that most new energy sources such as wind power and solar were subsidized at their early stages. In the automotive sector, Japan is leading Germany and the United States, thanks to the launch, in late 2014, of the ""Mirai"" vehicle (meaning future in Japanese), by Toyota which is the first production car in the world powered by hydrogen. The Mirai's fuel cell stack combines outside oxygen with hydrogen taken from its two on-board tanks to produce electricity, which in turn is stored in a battery to power a single, 152bhp (brake horsepower) electric motor. This in turn drives the front wheels through a fixed-ratio transmission. The only waste product at the tailpipe is water. Despite the hefty price tag (more than 60,000 euros), there is demand. Production is starting with 700 vehicles this year. The advantages are zero CO2 emissions and driving autonomy (a range of 502 kilometers) similar to that of a car with a gasoline engine and a refill time between three to five minutes. ""The FCV (""Fuel Cell Vehicle"") reveal themselves as the ideal eco-friendly cars,"" said Hisashi Nakai, an expert of the strategic planning department of Toyota. ""The main problem is cost. Since the project just began, cost reduction is not achieved from one day to the other,"" he explains. Responding to a question about the possibility of explosion risks of this highly flammable gas, Nakai responded and said, ""the hydrogen tank can withstand any shock. We have performed hundreds of tests, including shooting the tank directly with a gun (firearm) and it did not explode."" Toyota is not alone. Honda plans to launch in March of 2016 its version of a hydrogen vehicle with a fuel cell and Nissan has joined the government in this venture, despite their initial reluctance. Less than 30 hydrogen, fueling stations exist across Japan. The cost per fueling station is expensive since it requires an investment of approximately 3 million Euros for each station. Security controls are very strict to avoid the smallest leak of this colorless and odorless gas. Another major drawback is that currently, hydrogen is produced mainly from hydrocarbons that emit greenhouse gases during the production process. ""Selling a hydrogen economy without changing its production structure is heresy!"" admitted Franc. Japan hopes to achieve in the medium term a ""green"" hydrogen using water electrolysis. The ""Mirai"" vehicle requires 5 kilograms of hydrogen to fill its two tanks. At a cost of 8.72 euros per kilogram filling up will cost 43.60 euros according to Toyota. The car averages approximately 100 kilometers per kilogram of hydrogen, which is nearly four times the cost of driving a Toyota Camry hybrid. However, the pioneering Mirai owners will fuel their cars for free using access cards or codes provided by Toyota for the first three years; thus starting the Japanese initiative to fuel vehicles using the most abundant element on earth. \"

Therefore, the water sector is vital and very important for us in the UAE."" He explained that the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, which is held in January each year, includes ""the Global Water Summit"" during which many partnerships with government and private sector are struck to develop the efficiency of production of electricity for water desalination, as well as the development of new techniques in water desalination, Dr. Al Jaber said the experiences launched in the Global Water Summit have considerably benefited the UAE. He added, ""We came to Paris to demonstrate our experiences in the sectors of clean energy and water during various sessions of the negotiations."" Al Jaber explained that the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance, is a new initiative dealing with the issues of water desalination, involving many stakeholders of the sector, research institutions, universities and other organisations, government and private sectors of the UAE, Europe and North and South America and Asia. The alliance aims to address the issue of water scarcity and minimise the impact of the climate change and environmental impacts of these technologies, reduce dependence on energy and reduce the cost of energy used in water desalination. He said, ""We hope this meeting and platform will lead to an important starting point, We are optimistic about the current talks in Paris."" The minister pointed out that the UAE had an influential and effective role in these meetings, citing that the UAE and the French side held several meetings to discuss this file, most recently in September on the sidelines of meetings of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York, where ""we had a meeting attended by a number of foreign ministers and specialists from the public and private sectors to discuss the climate issue, in particular the meetings of Paris."" Dr. Sultan Al Jaber pointed out that the participation and attendance at the Conference of States Parties participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the French capital Paris, shows how the world's attention to this issue. The world today pays special attention to the issue of climate to reduce its repercussions. He explained that the presence of more than 150 heads of state and governments and more than 120 foreign ministers and the CEOs of companies and government institutions, shows that the world is already beginning to realise the importance of this issue and that there must be a solution and a comprehensive agreement that meets the needs of national issues relating to each individual state, and that the deal should have tangible and feasible economic results. Dr. Al Jaber referred to the voluntary contributions made by more than 186 countries, adding that it is an unprecedented and unusual, praising the role of the Secretariat of the United Nations and the competent French authorities for this momentum and these contributions at the conference, which will have an important and effective role in reaching a comprehensive deal that satisfies each party's ambition. \"

""In Dubai our production capacity 470 MIG per day of desalinated water. This summer we reached a peak load of 350 MIG per day and out of this 20 million is produced using Reverse Osmosis (RO) technology. Also in Dubai most of the plants are using Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) technology, and only 6 % use RO technology. So 70 % of our production is from the waste heat and it is fuel free . This means that its carbon footprint is zero. Also we combine water and power to improve efficiency while reducing capital and operating costs as it is,"" HE said. ""In line with the newly launched Dubai Clean Enery Strategy 2050 , it is not feasible to retrofit the exsiting plants by PV or solar panels. So to reduce carbon emissions in the future, these MSF plants needs to be connected to a central solar plant. Our Future strategy consists of building ROs to meet water demand since they require only 30 to 40 % of energy required for MSF (which Energy intensive technology). Our carbon abatement strategy focuses on reducing carbon emissions by 16% by 2021, DEWA contributes by more than 50% of this target.

The goal of the investment fund designed to promote zero-emission technologies is to help speed up the pace of innovation in order to fight the effects of climate change. ""Given the scale of the challenge, we need to be exploring many different paths and that means we also need to invent new approaches,"" Microsoft CEO Bill Gates said in a statement ahead of the official launch of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition here Monday as world leaders and climate negotiators from around the world gather to negotiate over 12 days how to slow global warming. More than 25 investors from 10 countries are part of the coalition, which has pledged undisclosed billions of dollars for innovation and research. ""Private companies will ultimately develop these energy breakthroughs, but their work will rely on the kind of basic research that only governments can fund,"" said Gates on his blog. More than 190 nations, accounting for 90 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, are participating in the summit, which is expected to see some tough negotiations as the developed countries try to get the developing countries to also share the burden of funding new green technologies while each country sets out plans to limit their carbon dioxide emissions to limit global warming. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition (BEC) plans to invest in a number of sectors including electricity generation and storage, transport, industry, agriculture and energy system efficiency. It is primarily interested in research efforts linked to ""novel technologies and innovations which enable current technologies to be dramatically more efficient, scalable, or cheaper."" During the UN Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP-21 ), which got off to a grand start Monday, Gates will be meeting leaders to tie up Mission Innovation funding. Gates says that wind and solar power have a part to play in a future without carbon footprints, given the scale of the challenge in keeping the world operational as fossil fuels become more scarce, ""many different paths"" need to be explored. ""We already invest in renewable and clean energy for our Facebook facilities today, but we believe that building a positive future for the next generation also means investing in long term projects that companies and governments don't fund. This is an important focus for us, and we'll share more about it in the coming days,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated in a blog post. ""We won't be able to make meaningful progress on other challenges -- like educating or connecting the world -- without secure energy and a stable climate."" The coalition will be focusing its resources on government-funded innovation that comes from countries signed up to the Mission Innovation initiative. Global investment in clean energy rose to $270 billion last year, the first significant increase after a three-year lull in investment. China led the way with $89 billion in new money for renewables, followed by the US at $51 . The tumbling costs of renewables solar, for example, has dropped in price by 70 percent since 2009 has helped bolster installation but experts have warned that dependency upon fossil fuels will need to be reduced more quickly if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change fueled by greenhouse gases. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, most of the world's electricity can and must be produced by low-carbon sources by 2050. The panel said that renewables needed to grow from a 30 percent share today to 80 percent of power generation by 2050, with fossil fuel energy without carbon capture and storage technology phased out by 2100.. \"

""The climate conference in Paris later this year is at the very top of the international agenda. I expect a bold and meaningful outcome at the Conference of Parties in December,"" said the UN Secretary-General in his remarks to the French diplomatic corps, which has been meeting this week in Paris. ""I was especially glad to be invited to attend your gathering this year because of the historic efforts that are under way to chart a new development path for the human family,"" Mr. Ban continued, adding that the climate negotiations cap a ""transformational"" year for human progress. In March, he said, the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, agreed on important steps to build more resilient societies, while in July, the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, in Addis Ababa, revitalised the global partnership for development. ""And earlier this month, in New York, Member States agreed on the final text of an inspiring new development agenda that will guide us through to the year 2030,"" he mentioned, rejoicing that world leaders will formally adopt it next month. Calling the 17 adopted Sustainable Development Goals a ""path to sustainable development,"" the Secretary-General said they offered a ""blueprint"" for ending poverty in all its dimensions ""without leaving anyone behind"" and identified the fundamental links between promoting prosperity and ensuring peaceful societies and respect for human rights. But unless the world takes urgent action on climate change, sustainable development will not be achieved, he warned. ""In my engagement with leaders, I have made it clear what I believe a meaningful (climate) agreement could include,"" referring to the expected outcome of the 21st meeting of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), widely referred to as COP-21 . Second, he continued, an agreement must be durable so that it provides the private sector with the predictability and policy frameworks it needs to invest in clean energy and climate-resilient approaches. ""Third, it must be flexible so that it can provide incentives and incorporate more ambitious, science-based nationally determined targets over time,"" the Secretary-General recommended. Fourth, it must uphold the principle of equity, support the adaptation needs of developing countries, and demonstrate solidarity with the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Fifth, it must include credible, clear mechanisms for measuring, monitoring and reporting progress in a transparent manner on a full range of actions, Mr. Ban went on to say. And sixth, credible climate financing is essential, he stressed, recalling that it is ""imperative"" that developed countries provide greater clarity on the public finance component of the $100 billion before the Paris conference, as well as on how they will engage private finance. The UN chief said that therefore he is engaging with leaders ""from north and south"" to make sure this goal is met and is considered credible by all. An agreement must also acknowledge the need for long-term, very significant financing beyond 2020, and the Green Climate Fund must be up and running, with funds that can be disbursed before Paris, he emphasised in conclusion, encouraging countries and companies to ""take the lead"" in developing clean energy technologies and markets. \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE198","News anytime, anywhere","March 14, 2016","Broadcast Pro Middle East","Using a new generation of mobile IP transmitters, Sky News Arabia's\~field reporters now capture and stream live, broadcast-quality video from any location on earth. Dave Mace, Head of Projects and Future Technology for Sky News Arabia, shares more details with BroadcastPro ME An IP video revolution is sweeping the world of remote electronic newsgathering (ENG) and satellite newsgathering (SNG). With competition heating up among news organisations around the world, the ability to deliver live, broadcast-quality video of a breaking story \- when and where it happens \- has become paramount to the success of any 24-hour news operation. Abu Dhabi-based broadcaster Sky News Arabia, which has a forward-thinking technology team and extensive reach across Europe, Africa and the Middle East with an ever-increasing network of OTT and IPTV distributors across the globe, says that adopting IP video transmission solutions right from its launch in 2012 has helped empower its journalists to break stories as they happen, even from the most remote locations in the world. ""Long ago, ENG/SNG technicians had limited choices for getting a video feed out of a remote site: satellite or microwave,"" explains Dave Mace, Head of Projects and Future Technology for Sky News Arabia. ""While satellite and microwave technologies may give an operator control over the connection and can offer signal capacity required for high-bit-rate video, they are usually expensive to acquire, staff and maintain, and it's not always practical to deploy an ENG or SNG truck \- especially if the news is breaking in a highly remote and rugged location lacking in accessibility and satellite or network coverage."" More recently, professional IP video acquisition tools have changed the rules for ENG and SNG. Using the latest generation of highly portable and rugged mobile IP transmitters, field reporters are now able to capture and stream live, broadcast-quality video from virtually any location on the planet. Another ENG breakthrough is the emergence of Ka-band and BGAN IP-over-satellite systems that can acquire live HD video at significantly lower cost, with greater portability, than Ku-band SNG terminals. ""With the launch of SNA in 2012, we had a prime opportunity to put these new technologies into practice. At the time, we adopted what was then considered the state-of-the-art transmitter, a product that enabled us to drastically extend our newsgathering reach to areas that couldn't be reached by the vehicles,"" explains Mace. ""As time went on and technology progressed, however, the video quality from these systems were not able to meet our standards. Any degradation in bandwidth or satellite coverage and we were unable to sustain a consistent picture,"" he explains. After evaluating a number of vendors late last year, SNA chose Dejero to expand its IP transmission capabilities. ""The Dejero technology met our requirements in several key ways, the most significant being its outstanding picture quality and reliability,"" explains Mace. ""Dejero transmitters offer intelligent bonding capabilities that enable them to manage and bond a range of wireless connections, including 3G/4G/LTE, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and even microwave and satellite. This means we're able to deliver optimal picture quality with low latency over multiple IP networks, even in areas with extremely limited bandwidth."" To begin, SNA deployed two LIVE+ mobile transmitters into the field to see how they performed and how engineers and reporters took to them. ""The teams instantly loved them, so we began rolling out more units to fixed bureaus in Jeddah and Kuwait City. After the initial success with these previous-generation units, we've now added several new-generation LIVE+ GoBox transmitters by Dejero. Specifically designed for newsgathering teams and video content contributors on the move, the rugged and portable LIVE+ GoBox enables our mobile journalists to broadcast live from virtually anywhere or record HD video for later broadcast. ""Reporters can grab a LIVE+ GoBox and head to the scene to capture and transmit live reports, or record up to 40 hours of HD video, and field camera operators can also use the system for DTL positioning and for sending rushes from the field. The LIVE+ GoBox is extremely easy to set up and use, with one-button start-up, automatic input and format detection, and a simple, intuitive interface with confidence monitoring. The built-in intelligence continuously adapts the systems to network conditions for top video quality."" To further extend its field newsgathering capabilities, SNA has also deployed several camera kits outfitted with a Mac laptop and an iPhone running Dejero's mobile contribution software LIVE+ NewsBook and LIVE+ Mobile App. ""In concert with a BGAN terminal or one of our SNG flyaway kits, LIVE+ NewsBook turns the Mac into a highly versatile go-anywhere video uplink solution for transmitting live HD or SD video feeds, as well as recorded and edited files, back to the broadcast facility in Abu Dhabi. Also, we've issued iPhones running the LIVE+ Mobile App to every SNA reporter and field engineer, as well as many other employees \- giving about 40 personnel the ability to use their iPhones' built-in cameras and cellular and Wi-Fi connections to instantly transmit live video,"" explains Mace. He adds that the NewsBook and Mobile App software applications perfectly illustrate the reach of IP video transmission technology. ""In effect, we've created a news force of at least 100 people who can cover stories as they break, at any time and from anywhere the staff members happen to be. For big stories, they can use their phones to go live until the SNG vehicles and additional reporters arrive."" Although there are still other solutions in the SNA environment, Mace explains that more than 40% of the network's field newsgathering is now accomplished with Dejero transmitters. Two recent high-profile stories covered with the GoBox transmitters were the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference ( Cop21 ) and the November terrorist attacks in Paris. ""The terrorist attack, in particular, was a rapidly evolving story that required our reporters to be extremely nimble and reach areas that even our smaller trucks equipped with flyaways couldn't access. With the GoBox transmitters, we were able to broadcast critical information live, as it happened,"" he explains. Mace calls SNA's IP newsgathering capabilities ""a point of pride"".

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE201","National climate targets signal 'unprecedented momentum' for climate agreement in Paris \u8211  UN report","November 8, 2015 Sunday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","New York, 7th November, 2015 (WAM) \- Implementation of the national climate plans prepared by countries ahead of the Paris climate meeting will limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, but a new climate agreement can encourage further action that will be necessary to limit global temperature rise to 2 degree Celsius by 2100, according to a new United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report. The sixth Emissions Gap Report is an assessment undertaken by a team of leading scientists and modelling experts from around the world. It presents a study of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by 146 countries party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by 1 October \- and up to 88 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2012. At present, 155 countries have submitted their plans. According to the UN, these INDCs will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, COP 21 , to be held in Paris, France starting at the end of November. UNEP's new report underlines that the national targets represent GHG emission reductions of four to six gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2030 compared to projected emissions under current policy trajectories. However, an additional 12 gigatonnes are required to close the gap and maintain a ""likely chance"" of staying below the 2 degree Celsius target. ""The challenge is to bend the emissions trajectory down as soon as possible to ensure that the net zero emissions goal in 2060-2075 is within reach,"" the UN's environmental programme underlined in a press release. ""The INDCs assessed in this Emissions Gap report signal a breakthrough in terms of international efforts to bend the curve of future emissions,"" he explained. ""While in themselves not sufficient to limit global temperature rise to the recommended level of 2 degrees Celsius this century, they represent a historic step in the direction of decarbonizing our economies. However, in order to close the gap it is essential that the Paris Agreement adopt a dynamic approach in which ambitions, the mobilization of climate finance and other forms of cooperation can be adjusted upwards at regular intervals."" If all INDCs are fully implemented, UNEP says the 2030 emissions gap would still be 12 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, putting the world on track to a temperature rise of around 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, and bringing significant climate impacts. However this scenario assumes that nations would not review and further accelerate efforts in subsequent years. The report also shows the uncertainties that exist for different scenarios based on the best available scientific evidence, and recommends early action on climate to keep costs as low as possible and avoid deeper and more challenging cuts later. The UNEP report also found that implementation of the INDCs will likely have benefits beyond the estimated reductions to GHG emission levels as new climate policies and actions are being galvanized by the process. It shows that the preparation of the INDCs has incentivized the exploration of links between development and climate, and the development of new national climate polices, and may be considered as the first step in a transition towards low-carbon economies. In the meantime, the Paris agreement could build on and support these processes and provide the framework for mobilization of the enhanced mitigation efforts required, the report says. In addition, it highlights how enhanced energy efficiency \- with a particular emphasis on industry, buildings and transport \- and expanded use of renewable energy technologies for power production will be critical. Other key sectors emphasized in the studies include forestry, agriculture and waste. In recognition of the significant opportunity for climate change mitigation through forest-related actions, the report also includes a focus on REDD+, a mechanism being developed by Parties to UNFCCC to reward developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Forest loss reached 7.6 million hectares per year between 2010 and 2015, and reportedly accounts for the largest portion of emissions from land use. Finally, the report finds that the impact of actions by International Cooperative Initiatives \- such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the Compact of Mayors, and the Cement Sustainability Initiative \- can also be significant. \"

DEWA also launched its 'Shine a light on Climate Action' campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of the increasing effects of climate change, and emphasise the importance of the rational use of electricity and water. ""We are pleased to organise this event in partnership with the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and the Emirates Wildlife Society (EWS), in association with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and in cooperation with Dubai Properties Group (DPG). This supports the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, who has laid down the foundations for a sustainable future for present and future generations through a vision, creative initiatives, and quality programmes. The directions of His Highness have been translated into real initiatives with close follow-up from His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, which has helped Dubai to become a world model for clean and renewable energy, sustainability, and other environmental issues that are of interest to governments and individuals alike,"" said Al Tayer. ""Dubai was the first Arab city to participate in Earth Hour in 2008, to support and incubate initiatives and events that promote public awareness on environmental issues and the sustainable development of the UAE, the region. We are proud of the community's participation in this annual event, and how much energy consumption levels have been reduced by over the years. This supports the long term Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative, launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to achieve sustainable development in Dubai, and enhance its position as a global hub for trade, finance, and green economy, creating a sustainable future for the Emirate. Earth Hour 2016 also adheres to the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to transform the Emirate into an international hub for clean energy and green economy, making Dubai the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2050,"" added Al Tayer. Al Tayer noted that the UAE was one of the first countries to support the international society to meet the challenge of climate change and one of the first nations to endorse the extension of the Kyoto protocol in 2005 to limit greenhouse gases in industrial countries. It was the first nation from the region to sign the Copenhagen Accord at COP15 to limit emissions. ""As part of the UAE Government's solid commitment to enhancing cooperation with the international community to address climate change and showcase our active role in adopting best sustainable practices based on renewable energy projects and support for their related research and development, DEWA was part of the UAE's delegation to the 21st annual session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). In cooperation with some of the world's most important leaders, we forged an international Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) to develop an international framework of standards and guidelines directed towards managing the effects of climate change,"" said Al Tayer. Al Tayer urged government and private organisations, and individuals, to combine efforts to achieve the Dubai Plan 2021 to make Dubai a smart, integrated, and connected city whose resources are sustainable. The collective efforts will conserve energy and will help reduce the carbon footprint, create a sustainable future for coming generations, and enhance the pillars of sustainability: ""Earth Hour goes beyond turning off the lights for one hour. It is an international call to strengthen collaboration to promote a culture of conservation, and make it a part of our daily lives. This supports our efforts to promote sustainable development."" ""Today we unite to achieve our noble goal of ensuring prosperity for the citizens and residents of the UAE, as well as for all humanity. Earth Hour is an opportunity for us to gather and express our support for the planet we live in, and our commitment to making changes to limit climate change. Previous years witnessed an amazing response to Earth Hour activities, by uniting official and public efforts. The level of participation seen by this event emphasises the UAE community's commitment to supporting efforts to preserve the environment and combat climate change, and set the standards for sustainability by promoting the rational use of environmental, and energy resources,"" said Amal Koshak, Senior Manager of Marketing Communications at DEWA. There were a range of family-friendly entertainment and activities at the event to promote environmental awareness. There was a Heritage Village with workshops for children, arts and crafts activities, a marine conservation area and traditions foods, henna painting, and an Emirati wedding exhibit, with free dates and Arabic coffee on hand as well. Many organisations had stands to promote the rational use of energy and water at Earth Hour. They included the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, the Roads and Transport Authority in Dubai, the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, the Community Development Authority, Dubai Corporation for Ambulance Services, Dubai Silicon Oasis Authority, Emirates Environmental Group, and Dubai Airport Free Zone.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE204","Soils are endangered, but the degradation can be rolled back, says FAO","December 4, 2015 Friday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ROME, 4th December 2015 (WAM) --- The world's soils are rapidly deteriorating due to soil erosion, nutrient depletion, loss of soil organic carbon, soil sealing and other threats, but this trend can be reversed provided countries take the lead in promoting sustainable management practices and the use of appropriate technologies, according to a new UN report released Friday. The Status of the World's Soil Resources produced by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)'s Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils brings together the work of some 200 soil scientists from 60 countries. Its publication coincides with World Soil Day which is celebrated on 4 December and also the end of the UN International Year of Soils 2015 an initiative which has served to raise global awareness on what has been described as ""humanity's silent ally"". ""Let us promote sustainable soil management rooted in proper soil governance and sound investments. Together, we can promote the cause of soils, a truly solid ground for life,"" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a message for World Soil Day. Soils are vital for producing nutritious crops and they filter and clean tens of thousands of cubic kilometres of water each year. As a major storehouse for carbon, soils also help regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, thus fundamental for regulating climate. Yet the overwhelming conclusion of the report is that the majority of the world's soil resources are in only fair, poor or very poor condition and that conditions are getting worse in far more cases than they are improving. In particular, 33 percent of land is moderately to highly degraded due to erosion, salinization, compaction, acidification, and chemical pollution of soils. ""Further loss of productive soils would severely damage food production and food security, amplify food-price volatility, and potentially plunge millions of people into hunger and poverty. But the report also offers evidence that this loss of soil resources and functions can be avoided,"" said FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva. Writing the foreword to the 650 page-long report, he expressed the conviction that the contents will ""greatly assist in galvanizing action at all levels towards more sustainable soil management,"" adding that this was in line with the international community's commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. :: Impact of population growth, urbanization and climate change Changes to the condition of soils are primarily driven by population growth and economic growth, factors that are expected to persist in the decades to come. The report notes how to feed a global population that has grown to some 7.3 billion today, over 35 percent of the Earth's ice-free land area has been converted to agriculture. The result is that soils that have been cleared of natural vegetation to grow crops or graze livestock suffer from sharp increases in erosion and steep losses in soil carbon, nutrients and soil biodiversity. But urbanization is also taking a major toll. The rapid growth of cities and industries has degraded increasingly wide areas, including by contaminating soils with excess salt, acidity and heavy metals; compacting them under heavy machinery; and sealing them permanently under asphalt and concrete. Climate change - which is currently the focus of the UN COP21 conference in Paris - is a further strong driver of soil change, the report finds. Higher temperatures and related extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and storms impact on soil quantity and fertility in a number of ways, including reducing moisture and depleting the layers of nutrient-rich topsoil. They also contribute to an increase in the rate of soil erosion and shoreline retreat. :: Achieving healthy soils The report focuses on the 10 main threats to soil functions: soil erosion, soil organic carbon loss, nutrient imbalance, soil acidification, soil contamination, waterlogging, soil compaction, soil sealing, salinization and loss of soil biodiversity. It notes how there is a general consensus on soil-related strategies that can, on the one hand, increase the supply of food, while on the other, minimize harmful environmental impacts. The solution proposed is one that centres on sustainable soil management and which requires the participation of a broad level of stakeholders ranging from governments to small-holder farmers. Erosion, for example, can be curbed by reducing or eliminating tillage - digging, stirring, and overturning of soil - and using crop residues to protect the soil surface from the effects of rain and winds. Similarly, soils suffering from nutrient deficits can be restored and yields increased by returning crop residues and other organic material to the soil, employing crop rotation with nitrogen-fixing crops, and making judicious use of organic and mineral fertilizers. The report identifies four priorities for action: Stabilize global stores of soil organic matter, including both soil organic carbon and soil organisms; Stabilize or reduce global use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer, while increasing fertilizer use in regions of nutrient deficiency; and, Improve our knowledge about the state and trend of soil conditions. Such actions need to be supported by targeted policies, including: support for the development of soil information systems to monitor and forecast soil change; increasing education and awareness on soil issues, by integrating this into formal education and across the curriculum - from geology to geography, from biology to economics. investing in research development and extension, to develop test, disseminate sustainable soil management technologies and practices. introducing appropriate and effective regulation and incentives. This could include taxes that discourage harmful practices such as excessive use of fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. Zoning systems can be used to protect the best agricultural soil from urban sprawl. Subsidies could be used to encourage people to purchase tools and other inputs that have a less harmful impact on soils, while certification of sustainable crop and livestock practices can make produce more commercially attractive at higher prices. supporting achievement of local, regional and international food security by considering countries' soil resources and their capacities to manage them sustainably. :: Key findings: Erosion carries away 25 to 40 billion tonnes of topsoil every year, significantly reducing crop yields and the soil's ability to store and cycle carbon, nutrients, and water. Annual cereal production losses due to erosion have been estimated at 7.6 million tonnes lost each year. If action is not taken to reduce erosion, a total reduction of over 253 million tonnes of cereals could be projected by 2050. This yield loss would be equivalent to removing 1.5 million square kilometres of land from crop production \- or roughly all the arable land in India. Lack of soil nutrients is the greatest obstacle to improving food production and soil function in many degraded landscapes. In Africa, all but three countries extract more nutrients from the soil each year than are returned through use of fertilizer, crop residues, manure, and other organic matter. Accumulation of salts in the soil reduces crop yields and can completely eliminate crop production. Human-induced salinity affects an estimated 760,000 square kilometres of land worldwide \- an area larger than all the arable land in Brazil. Soil acidity is a serious constraint to food production worldwide. The most acidic topsoils in the world are located in areas of South America that have experienced deforestation and intensive agriculture. \"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE208","Engineering growth","February 1, 2016","Gulf Construction","Doosan Babcock will providing maintenance services to two major industrial facilities under its latest key contracts Doosan Babcock, a specialist engineering company, is on a mission to extend the lifespan of the region\' s industrial infrastructure and had already secured a number of important contracts with leading players across a range of industries in the UAE. These include contracts with Emirates Steel, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), Abu Dhabi Gas Industries (Gasco) and Taweelah Asia Power Company (Tapco). The company, which offers construction, upgrade and after-market services and technologies to the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, as well as the nuclear and thermal power industries, is currently working on three major long-term maintenance agreements (LTMA) \- two with Gasco, which is part of Adnoc Group, and one with Tapco.  Under the five-year contracts (with Gasco), we will provide essential maintenance and shutdown services for a plant at Abu Dhabi\' s Habshan and Bab complex, one of the world\' s largest gas processing complexes, Chris Behan, general manager UAE of Doosan Babcock, tells Gulf Construction. This contract is currently in the mobilisation stage prior to the site services commencing in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, Doosan Babcock has an eight-year maintenance contract with Tapco for technical support, parts, equipment, repair and maintenance, including outages on static equipment. The agreement will ensure the optimum performance of six thermal boiler units, five heat recovery steam generators (HRSG), 13 multi-stage flashing (MSF) water desalination units and 12 potable water tanks. The project team is currently executing the work scope related to the Winter Outages 2015/16. Behan says 2015 was an excellent year for the company in the Middle East. Besides winning major contracts, Doosan Babcock also opened a new office in the region.  We celebrated the official opening of our Mena Engineering Consultancy Hub in Abu Dhabi in November, with a full-day technical seminar for customers and potential customers. We\' ve also expanded our presence in the Middle East from 10 to over 100 employees, he says.  As operators in industries such as oil and gas continue to face pressure to maximise operational cost and efficiency, we\' re confident that 2016 will be a strong year for us in the Middle East. Behan ... excellent year. Doosan Babcock Part of Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction of South Korea, Doosan Babcock traces its origins back to 1891 when it was first established as Babcock and Wilcox in Glasgow, UK. The company set up its Middle East and North Africa (Mena) operations in 2013 and the opening of its Mena Engineering Consultancy Hub in Abu Dhabi last November was another milestone in its history in the region. The new facility is designed to provide a range of specialist engineering services to help customers in the power, water, oil and gas, petrochemical and industrial sectors maintain and extend the life of their plant. Doosan Babcock\' s technologies and services today serve a range of sectors, including oil, gas and petrochemical, pharmaceutical, nuclear and thermal power, renewable energy and maritime. Originally, the company was established as a boiler OEM (original equipment manufacturer), however, with the arrival of nuclear power, from the 1950s onwards, services and technologies for the nuclear power industry began to play an increasingly important role in Doosan Babcock\' s commercial operations \- and continue to do so today. Many of the specialist engineering skills and technologies developed by Doosan Babcock over this period were applicable to a range of industries other than power generation, hence the company\' s move into the North Sea oil and gas sector in the 1980s. More recently, customers in all sectors have increasingly turned their focus to deriving the best operational efficiency and performance out of plant, as well as extending the operating lifetime of existing plant, rather than invest in new infrastructure. For example, many oil and gas assets developed during the boom years of the 1970s and 1980s are still actively producing today, well beyond their intended lifespan, thanks to advances in oil recovery methods. At the same time, pressure to maintain the rate of production is mounting. This means that many oil and gas operators are increasingly looking to extend the life of their plant and increasing the rate of hydrocarbon recovery, according to Behan.  This focus on asset integrity management and life extension is prevalent across all the industry sectors served by Doosan Babcock and our technological expertise has meant that we\' ve been able to successfully respond to this with condition assessment and interpretation services, tailored asset lifetime strategies and risk-based programme for safe and compliant plant \- all backed up by our specialist engineering capabilities, he says. He continues:  In the power generation sector, we\' ve also seen the move away from the combustion of fossil fuels, which has continued to gather pace in recent years, as most recently witnessed in the outcome of COP21 (the United National conference on climate change held in Paris, France). This is resulting in a greater reliance on other sources of energy, such as nuclear power, renewables and decentralised energy sources, which continues to shape the way Doosan Babcock\' s business is evolving. Doosan Babcock\' s scope of activities is essentially building, maintaining and extending the life of industrial plant for customers around the world, using specialist technologies and engineering expertise.  We are also able to draw on the backing of the global Doosan Group, which allows us to deliver a true \' one-stop shop\' package. A recent example of this in action is our LTMA with Tapco to provide essential maintenance and technical support services to the Taweelah B Power and Water Desalination Plant. This allows us to combine our OEM engineering, integrity management and mechanical maintenance expertise. Although the scope of works will be led by Doosan Babcock, technical expertise will also be provided by other members of the multi-disciplinary Doosan Group, including Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction\' s Water Business Group and HRSG specialist Doosan Engineering and Construction, Behan says. Doosan Babcock has significant experience in supporting its clients as their assets age and their condition needs to be carefully managed to improve plant reliability and efficiency. Recently, the company executed the refurbishment of fired heater units whereby its engineers conducted detailed condition assessment of the plant materials, developed complex repair methodologies, and successfully executed the repair and refurbishment on site.  This is a fine example of Doosan Babcock\' s unique \' one-stop shop\' service offering, Behan remarks.  Being part of the global Doosan Group gives us a unique competitive edge, as it allows us to offer customers combined OEM engineering, integrity management and mechanical maintenance expertise. We will be looking to leverage this capability further during 2016 and beyond. He also points out that as a global business, Doosan Babcock takes great care of corporate social responsibility (CSR).  Our UAE team participates in community days on a regular basis. For example, we recently took part in the \' Water for Workers Programme\' . The team visited several construction sites in Dubai providing some light refreshments to the workers, giving them the chance to take a deserved break in the heat of the day, and emphasising that their efforts are greatly valued by the community, he says. Growth strategy Doosan Babcock has an established business in Qatar and has plans to penetrate the markets in the other GCC and Mena countries between 2016 and 2020.  Our growth plans for 2016 onwards are focused on service, sector and geographical expansion in the Mena region, Behan says.  We are focused on growing our offshore oil and gas and nuclear business in the UAE, further growing our engineering capabilities within our Mena hub, and expanding the business further in high-potential Mena countries such as Kuwait. Its customers in the region include Gasco, Tapco, Emirates Steel, petrochemical giants such as BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and INEOS, pharmaceutical clients such as GSK, and power generation/utilities names such as EDF Energy and E.ON. Employing around 4,000 staff, the group\' s turnover in 2014 was \£3534 million ($762 million). \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE209","UAE among top 10 countries for LEED Green Building: US Green Building Council Index","August 8, 2015 Saturday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 8th August, 2015 (WAM) \- The UAE led the Middle Eastern countries in green building applications, according to the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) international rankings of the top 10 countries for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) in 2015, the world's most widely used and recognised green building rating system. 'The United Arab Emirates (3.13 million of cumulative gross square metres, GSM) has had strong green building years. The UAE increased its total amount of LEED-certified space by 72 percent over last year, and climbed from ninth place overall in 2014 to eighth overall in 2015,' the USGBC said, noting that the UAE ranked ahead of Turkey and Sweden. The total GSM of LEED-certified and registered space of the UAE is 53.44 million and with the total number of LEED-certified and registered projects at 910. Commenting on the global landmark milestone, Abdullah Al Muaini, Director-General of the Emirates Authority for Standardisation and Metrology (ESMA), said, 'This new achievement is a fruit of the long-term national initiative launched by Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2012 to build a green economy in the UAE under the slogan, 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development.' The new strategy aims to establish the UAE as a world leader in green economy and a centre for export and re-export of products and green technologies. It also aims to maintain a sustainable environment to support long-term economic growth. The UAE seeks to be a global hub and a successful model of the green economy so as to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of development being experienced by the country, and to preserve the environment for future generations. The initiative includes a wide range of programmes and policies in the areas of energy, agriculture, investment and sustainable transport, in addition to environmental and constructional policies to raise the quality of life in the UAE. 'The ESMA is currently preparing a package of green applications which, when complete by the third quarter of 2015, will contribute to sharpen the nation's competitive edge globally,' he said, indicating that these programmes, which cover an array of fields like energy management systems, deployment of renewable energy, and environment efficiency of products, will enable the UAE to maintain its world leadership. He admitted that raising energy efficiency of existing buildings would remain a tremendous challenge and requires all stakeholders to consider applicable technologies and mechanisms to reach that goal. However, ESMA is ready to join forces with its strategic partners to implement its programme for rehabilitating these buildings in line with green building standards, he said. He said that there was also a need to launch encouraging initiatives and creative funding solutions to implement energy efficiency strategies. The ESMA chief explained that the UAE was the first GCC country to have introduced the Lighting Products and Lighting Products Control Regulation, which seeks to replace low quality, inefficient lighting products currently in the market with safe, high quality and energy efficient ones. Built on the European lighting system, the UAE model is one of the most important national strategies to reduce energy usage and protect the environment. In introducing the lighting system, he said the UAE was expected to reduce energy consumption by 500 MW, which means the UAE can stop the operation of a medium gas-fired energy generation plant for six months. COP21 climate negotiations this December. ""International demand has grown steadily for tools supporting sustainable economic growth, and it has become increasingly clear that we are reaching a tipping point around environmental sustainability. It is now impossible to view social and economic development as separate issues from a robust sustainability agenda,"" said Rick Fedrizzi, CEO and founding chair, USGBC. ""The global success of LEED in these countries is a sign that international business leaders and policy makers recognize that a commitment to transforming the built environment is crucial to addressing major environmental challenges. The countries on this list are pushing this commitment forward."" The 10 countries that made the list for 2015 are geographically and culturally diverse, representing seven of the world's 20 largest single-nation economies by gross domestic product (GDP) (China, Germany, Brazil, India, Canada, South Korea and Turkey), as well as six of the top 11 emitters of greenhouse gases (China, India, Germany, South Korea, Canada and Brazil). While Canada tops the list, Brazil and the Republic of Korea have moved up in the rankings and Turkey and Sweden are new to the Top 10 this year. This is the second year that USGBC has provided rankings on the Top 10 Countries for LEED outside of the U.S. The analysis used to develop the list ranks countries in terms of gross square meters and numbers of LEED projects to date. LEED-certified spaces use less energy and water resources, save money for families, businesses and taxpayers, reduce carbon emissions and create a healthier environment for residents, workers and the larger community. The U.S., the birthplace of LEED, is not included in this list but remains the world's largest market for LEED. The U.S. is the world's largest economy by GDP as well as the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Every day, nearly 172,000 GSM of space is certified using LEED, and there are currently more than 69,800 commercial and institutional projects representing 1.23 billion GSM of space participating in the green building rating system. An additional 76,500 residential units have been certified under LEED for Homes. LEED projects can now be found in more than 150 countries and territories across the world. Canada ranks number one on the list as the largest user of LEED outside of the U.S. with 26.63 million GSM of LEED space. There are now over 4,814 LEED-registered and LEED-certified projects representing 63.31 million GSM of LEED space in Canada. China (21.97 million GSM), India (13.24 million GSM) and Brazil (5.22 million GSM), three of the four BRIC economies, finished second through fourth on this year's list, respectively. These three countries currently represent more than 33 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, with China and India representing the largest source of projected growth in global emissions in the coming decades. The Republic of Korea (4.81 million GSM) and Taiwan (3.84 million GSM) join China in providing a strong East Asian contingent to the 2015 rankings. Having two of the original tiger economies join China, India and Brazil on this year's list demonstrates that LEED is taking hold in some of the world's fastest growing economies, and that green buildings have enormous strategic value in terms of controlling emissions in countries that many climate watchers have noted hold the key to staving off the worst impacts of climate change. Germany (4.01 million GSM) and Sweden (2.54 million GSM) represent Europe on this list, with Germany finishing sixth and Sweden making the list for the first time in 10th place. Both nations are routinely cited for their innovation and leadership in international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Middle Eastern countries, United Arab Emirates (3.13 million GSM) and Turkey (2.95 million GSM) have both had strong green building years. The UAE increased its total amount of LEED-certified space by 72 percent over last year, and climbed from ninth place overall in 2014 to eighth overall in 2015. Turkey made the Top 10 list for the first time in the nation's history, finishing ninth overall. \"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE211","UAE, Tuvalu and Kiribati inaugurate two clean energy plants in the Pacific","October 14, 2015 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 14th October 2015 (WAM) --- Two Pacific island nations will this week inaugurate individual solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants funded by the United Arab Emirates and developed by Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company. Starting yesterday, Tuvalu inaugurated a 500 KW solar PV power plant on the atoll of Funafuti. A 500 KW solar PV and water protection plant on the Tarawa atoll of the Republic of Kiribati, will also be officially inaugurated this week. The inaugurations mark the completion of the two solar PV projects co-designed and managed by Masdar in cooperation with the governments of the Pacific island countries of Tuvalu and Kiribati. The projects form part of the UAE's support for economic and social development of Pacific island nations, while also showcasing the viability of sustainable clean energy development models. The projects aim to reduce the Pacific island nations' dependency on imported diesel, freeing up essential financial resources for other developmental projects. The plant located on Funafuti \- the most populated atoll that hosts the capital of the Tuvalu island nation \- was funded by the US$50 million UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund through the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. The majority of the system is built on a 4 metre-high structure creating 1,840 m2 of shaded public space that is limited on the atoll. In addition, it includes a new workshop-storage facility with 540 m? floor space, as well as further space for office and recreational use. The Funafuti solar and space creation project will not only supply electricity to over 800 homes by yearly generating 783,000 kWh, but will also save 206,000 litres of diesel each year \- bringing about a saving of US$280,000 and a reduction in CO? emissions of 570 tons annually The inauguration in Tuvalu was attended by Dr Mohammed Al Qubaisi, Director of the Energy Affairs Division in the Directorate of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) at the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), and Tuvalu Prime Minister the Honourable Enele Sosene Spoaga, as well as the Governor General the Honourable Otinielu Tauteleimalae Tausi. Dr Ahmad Belhoul, CEO of Masdar, speaking from Abu Dhabi, said: ""These two projects not only demonstrate the UAE and Masdar's commitment to helping Pacific island nations deploy sustainable renewable energy solutions, which play a vital role in driving forward the social and economic development for the people of Tuvalu and Kiribati, but clearly, and equally important, also highlight the ongoing work we are doing to combat climate change through our renewable energy projects."" According to Dr Belhoul, the acceleration of the adoption of renewable energy and reduction of pollution are imperatives to promote climate change mitigation \- and therefore the diversification of the energy mix through deployment of renewable energy is considered vital to this goal. ""As a strong supporter of COP 21 as well as the energy-related sustainable development goal adopted by the United Nations, Masdar's efforts to limit the impact of climate change, including our commitment to broaden access to clean energy for a greater number of people, are clearly demonstrated through the delivery of the solar plants of Tuvalu and Kiribati,"" he added. The Honourable Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, said: ""The Solar Space Creation Project could not have come at a better time as the price of fuel has soared in recent years. This project would contribute approximately 40% towards the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation peak demand which could save more than 200,000 litres of diesel fuel per annum, about 8% of the annual fuel consumption of the Fogafale Power Station. The existing total generation capacity equals 1.8 megawatts of which 22% is by the Solar Space Creation Project"". Development of the 500 KW solar and water protection project on Tarawa, Kiribati, was started in December 2014, and completed in August this year. It will officially be inaugurated later this week. The republic, comprising 33 coral atolls, lies in the Central Pacific, and has a population of more than 100,000 \- half of whom live on Tarawa atoll where the capital, South Tarawa, is situated. The plant protects the only aquifer located on the island that has been under threat of contamination due to high levels of human migration to the area as a result of limited living space. The plant features advanced technologies to control output and will annually deliver 855,000 kWh to 860 homes. It will cut back on more than 227,000 litres of diesel, resulting in an approximate saving of US$265,000 which may be repurposed for other developmental areas. The plant will also reduce CO? emissions by 627 tons each year. The Honourable Waysang Kumkee, Minister for Public Works and Utilities of Kiribati, said, ""Sustainable energy is a prerequisite for developmental and economic growth for any society. The renewable energy to be delivered through the solar and water protection plant in Tarawa helps the country overcome not only the constraints of natural fuel resources, but also eases access to large numbers of individuals and families to sustainable electricity provision."" Of the projects being delivered under the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund, several have already been delivered or are currently under construction. The first completed project was the 512 KW solar PV installation in Tonga, while others include the first ever 550 KW wind farm for Samoa, and three micro grid solar plants in Fiji that supply clean energy to some of the nation's outer islands, as well as the solar plants for Tuvalu, Kiribati and Vanuatu. Further projects in the Marshal and Solomon islands, Palau and Nauru are under construction as planned, with yet another project for the Federated States of Micronesia to be signed shortly. \"

The comments came during the forum's first plenary session today called ""The Global NCD Response: Taking Stock, Looking Ahead"", chaired by the CEO of the World Heart Federation and Vice Chair, NCD Alliance, Switzerland Johanna Ralston. Keynote Speaker, Professor Srinath Reddy, President, Public Health Foundation India, said, ""We perceived that NCDs were neglected by leaders globally and took this as an affront but now we have to step up and assist governments in implementation and capacity building strategies to tackle NCDs."" In outlining a way forward Professor Reddy highlighted targets for 2025 which included having member states set targets in line with WHO recommendations which are; member states to have a reliable system for generating mortality cause data; member states to have a comprehensive health survey every five years, members states to have an integrated action plan for NCDs and their risk factors and finally for member states to have implemented reduction measures as set by WHO/ FCTC at the highest level of achievement. In closing Professor Reddy said, ""We must execute the politics of presence. Are we there at Cop 21 ; are we there at UHC Meetings or Women's Health Meetings or Urban Health Meetings to discuss areas of convergence? We must be present at these meetings to strengthen the health system for better control of NCDs. We need to utilise all the opportunities we have and act with resolve, mobilise political will and we need to amplify cooperation and accelerate action. NCDA lead the way. "" HRH Princess Ghida Al-Talal, Chairperson, Board of Trustees, King Hussein Cancer Foundation, Jordan said, ""The role of civil society is incredibly important, as it is representing the will of society at large but it has no power if we do not work hand in hand."" Princess Ghida outlined the work of the King Hussein Cancer Foundation which she said had made great successes in raising awareness and generating treatment programs. ""In Jordan we come from a region that has has seen its healthcare infrastructure decimated. Countries surrounding us like Palestine, Yemen, Syria and Iraq all send their cancer patients to Jordan for treatment and so we have implemented cancer cost coverage campaigns to support this. This work is important as cancer has no boundaries; it affects the young or old, rich or poor so it is vital we do this work together."" The session, that provided an overview of the up-to-date global response to NCDs including commitments, targets and adopted plans, also heard from Dr Bente Mikkelsen, Head a.i. of the Secretariat of the Global Coordination Mechanism and Interagency Task Force, WHO, Switzerland, who said, ""The significance of a strong civil society movement cannot be underestimated. It is obvious we need a strong social movement to address NCDs and I applaud the NCDA for its investigation in to the strength of the civil society movement. It is also clear that the voice of the affected has to be strong to really hold governments accountable."" The final panelist of the plenary session heard from a young person with diabetes who has pledged to use her experience to create awareness about the disease and living with an NCD. Krystal Boyea, of the IDF Young Leaders Programme, Barbados said, ""I cannot underestimate the importance of having young people involved in the NCD response. This is currently overlooked in the fight against NCDs despite 70% of premature deaths being as a result of behaviors set as an adolescent or youth. This exacts a huge burden on resources and building a healthier future depends on creating interventions at this critical phase of development. Most prevention measures are not targeted towards youth so I would encourage ensuring youth participation in all policy discussions."" The session was followed by the first workshop stream under the topic ""Translating Global NCD Commitments to National Action in the Post-2015 Era"" with co-chairs, Ms Johanna Ralston, World Heart Federation, Switzerland and Dr Beatriz Champagne, CLAS, Argentina, USA.

WETEX is organised under the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and under the patronage of HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minister of Finance and President of DEWA. The delegation includes Hussain Lootah, Executive Vice President of Transmission, Waleed Ali Salman, Executive Vice President of Strategy & Business Development, Dr. Yousef Al Akraf, Executive Vice President of Business Support & Human Resources, Matar Suhail Salem Al Mehairi, Vice President of Distribution Asset Management, Mohamed Al Shamsi, Vice President of Water & Civil Projects and Water Maintenance, Moza Al Akraf, CIO, Faisal Al Dashti, Senior Manager of Information Security, Ahmed Belarti, Senior Manager of Smart Services, Mohamed Abdulkarim Al Shamsi, Senior Manager of Sustainability & Climate Change, and Ahmed Abdullah, Senior Manager of External Communications. During the visit, Al Tayer commenced his first meetings with Ahmed Aboutaleb, Mayor of Rotterdam, HE Abdallah Hamdan Al Naqbi, Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and high-profile representatives of Dutch companies operating in energy, water and environment. Al Tayer praised the efforts of the UAE Embassy in the Netherlands. In his speech, Al Tayer highlighted opportunities for cooperation between Dubai and the Netherlands, the potential of the energy and environment sectors in the UAE, and cooperation on renewable and clean energy projects, and plans that Dubai has for the future. ""Our nation is blessed with leaders who have a real vision of a brighter future that incorporates sustainability at the heart of our daily lives. HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, have both mandated that Solar Energy and sustainability are essential to the future of our nation,"" said Al Tayer. ""The UAE's commitment to combatting climate change and developing renewable energy is already well-established. As well as supporting the COP21 accords in Paris, the UAE hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency. Dubai intends to generate 75% of its total power output from clean energy by 2050. This target is part of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum last November,"" added Al Tayer. ""This strategy has defined our efforts to develop the efforts of our Emirate and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority to bring solar power to our citizens and residents. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar park, which is the largest single-site solar park in the world, will generate 1,000 megawatts by 2020 and 5,000 megawatts by 2030, which will save approximately 6.5 million metric tons per year in carbon dioxide emissions,"" added Al Tayer. ""This will mean our city will have the lowest carbon footprint in the world by then. Our nation is fully within the Sunbelt's higher levels of radiation and so our commitment to combatting climate change comes primarily in the form of harnessing that power to manage rising surface temperatures. And with a target for solar panels to cover Dubai's buildings by 2030, a vision can make the difference."" ""We are working with international players to form public-private partnerships that are based on the independent power producer model to achieve these targets. We are on track to deliver a dedicated supply of 100 megawatts from the solar park to the World Expo 2020 that will take place in Dubai."" ""Supporting these promises, requires the robust financing of the transition to a low-carbon economy.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE224","Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park highlights Dubai's international position in sustainable development","May 5, 2016 Thursday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","DUBAI, 5th May, 2016 (WAM) -- With sustainable development being the focus of major international activities and events in 2015, the focus on climate change, the importance of preserving natural resources, and dependence on clean and renewable resources to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and the Earth's rising temperatures, the 2015 UN Climate Conference in Paris was one of the most important activities worldwide, gathering presidents, kings and leaders to combat climate change and reach a new international agreement for forming a framework for efforts to address the effects of climate change. The UAE participated actively in the conference, with its delegation promoting the UAE's pioneering projects on climate change and the search for sustainable energy resources. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park had a great influence on COP21 , as it reflected the UAE government and the visions of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to show the considerable importance attached to environmental sustainability and the happiness and living standards of the UAE's citizens, residents and visitors by providing a healthy environment for the public that is ideal for living, working, and visiting. This supports the UAE Vision 2021's goal to transform the UAE into one of the best countries in the world by 2021, and the Dubai Plan 2021 for the emirate to become a smart, integrated, and connected city that sustainably manages its resources and has a clean, healthy and sustainable environment in line with Dubai's development strategy. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and MD and CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, DEWA, highlighted Dubai's adoption of a clear strategy and ambitious vision for developing and establishing sustainable energy projects in Dubai. Dubai has raised its targets for renewable energy mix to 7% by 2020 and 25% by 2030, based on the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050. DEWA's efforts support the long-term national Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative launched by H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to build a green economy in the UAE. DEWA 's vision is to ensure the emirates' continuous growth and, at the same time, protect its natural resources and shape the future of energy in the region as a whole. This will achieve sustainable development and promote the welfare and well-being of citizens, residents, and visitors, and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. ""The importance of the project lies in two points: it is the first of its kind in the region, and in its capacity. It is the first of several promising projects to use renewable energy to generate electricity in Dubai. Generating electricity by using solar power, which is available in our country all year round, requires the latest technologies available in the global market. This plays a major role in supporting our country's sustainable development plans, preserving our natural resources, and protecting the environment,"" said Al Tayer. H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park at Seih Al Dahal in early 2012. The first phase was successfully completed after one year, with a capacity of 13 megawatts, MW. Since the project was launched in October 2013, it has been able to produce clean energy and reduce carbon emissions and has been adopted by the Dubai Executive Council as a model for clean development. The first project of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, based on the independent power producer, IPP, model, achieved great success. It is another pioneering accomplishment that takes Dubai and the UAE to the forefront in the region in producing renewable and clean energy. H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has inaugurated the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in November 2015. The second phase is based on the independent power producer model and will be operational by April 2017. DEWA increased the capacity of the second project to 200MW, which will be ready by April, 2017. DEWA also increased the capacity of the third phase of the project to 800MW, based on the independent power producer model. This is another achievement that will put the UAE at the forefront of clean and renewable energy generation in the region. The park will also house several world-class facilities, including a 400/132-kV substation rated at 570 megavolt-amperes, MVA, at a cost of AED275 million. All of these elements contributed to DEWA winning the Best Sustainable Project of the Year in the UAE at the 2014 MEED Quality Awards. This is the first time this award was given to a renewable energy project in the region. DEWA also won an award for Distinguished Technical Project at the 18th Dubai Government Excellence Programme Awards, DGEP. ""H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launching the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park marks the beginning of a new era of an economy that is based on environmental sustainability and clean energy. This supports the vision of His Highness for Dubai to be the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world. This also supports the long-term National Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative launched by His Highness to build a green economy in the UAE. Additionally, the park affirms Dubai's leading role in solar energy and creates a new sector in the region. Our wise leadership realises the importance of providing energy supplies and finding alternative solutions to traditional energy, and the importance of developing renewable and alternative energy because of its direct impact on sustainable development,"" said Al Tayer. DEWA received 5 bids from international organisations for the third phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The lowest recorded bid at the opening of the envelopes was 2.99 cents per kilowatt hour. The next step in the bidding process will review the technical and commercial aspects of the bids to select the best one. DEWA had released a request for the Expression of Interest, EOI, for the 800MW third phase of the solar park on 8th September, 2015, and received 95 EOI responses from international solar organisations between 8th and 29th September. DEWA requested that companies submit their requests for qualification before November 2015. This was followed by a Request for Proposals, RFP, to qualified bidders on 28th December 2015. On completion of the third phase, the park will ultimately generate over 1,000 MW by 2020 and is planned to generate 5,000 MW by 2030, at a total cost of AED50 billion. DEWA will invest AED65 billion in Dubai's energy and water sector over the next five years to meet increasing demand. This will provide considerable investment opportunities, support the growth of a green economy and create a competitive advantage for the UAE in clean energy and energy-efficiency technologies. DEWA has also allocated over AED2.6 billion to support electricity, water and renewable energy infrastructure projects according to the highest international standards. This will contribute to the organisation of the best World Expo in 2020 in Dubai. DEWA will focus on renewable energy sources to support the Dubai Expo's theme of 'Connecting Minds, Creating the Future' and its three sub themes of Sustainability, Mobility, and Opportunity. The pioneering solar park includes a centre for innovation equipped with the latest renewable clean energy technologies, which will also be a museum for solar and renewable technologies. The Solar Park includes a Research and Development, R&D, Centre for conducting studies on industrial and social needs and scientific research on renewable energy. It also acts as a link between researchers and developers to develop strategies for productive and innovative ideas. The Solar Park has two test technologies for photovoltaic panels and for concentrated solar power, CSP, as well. The first centre tests 30 types of photovoltaic panels from international manufacturers. The panels are studied, evaluated, and tested for long-term reliability against the weather conditions faced by the region. The park will also have a training centre and a special conference centre to act as a platform for the exchange of expertise, information and innovation, and will use the best advances in R&D to achieve sustainable development. The Solar Testing Centre at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is one of the biggest photovoltaic testing centres in the region, and one of the most important and best centres in the world. DEWA places the highest emphasis on research and development to support the vision and directives of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to enhance innovation in line with the National Innovation Strategy to make the UAE one of the most innovative countries in the world. Research and development and solar energy testing increase the reliability and durability of photovoltaic modules and consequently reduce risk and uncertainty in photovoltaic performance due to the severe conditions and long periods of time under which photovoltaic modules are required to operate. Further analysis on the tested modules will provide valuable information on the technology characteristics that can help improve photovoltaic performance in the region under various climates. The Solar Testing Facility will play an important role in supporting this initiative. DEWA has developed the standards and the guidelines for connecting low- and medium-voltage Distributed Renewable Resource Generators to its network. It is currently working on an equipment-eligibility scheme to ensure compliance with these requirements. The R&D team is currently engaging in various international solar energy initiatives and projects across the world. DEWA is seeking participation and leadership in a number of projects in the GCC photovoltaic laboratory network and the Photovoltaic Quality Assurance Task Force. TUV Rheinland has developed a training programme for DEWA staff for the implementation, operation, testing and reporting phases. The Testing Facility studies and evaluates the performance, long-term stability and reliability of various photovoltaic panels using the most sophisticated and accurate equipment. The highest standards and techniques of testing, controlling, monitoring, evaluation and reporting are applied. The centre will test solar cell technologies and photovoltaic panel technologies and manufacturing for greater flexibility. This centre will also assess other aspects to cope with various weather conditions and the surrounding environment in both cases when photovoltaic panels are used in open spaces or integrated into buildings. The main tasks of the solar testing facility include dust impact and mitigation modelling, understanding physical and chemical properties of local dust and surfaces, field tests for new approaches, understanding the effects of soiling, module lifetime modelling, endurance tests, analysis of activation energy for field defects, reliability and quality modelling, field failure or degradation prediction correlation with current accelerated tests, development of new accelerated tests customised for Dubai's climate, and technological assessment of performance. The Testing Centre has several sections including a measurement room, control room, and offices. A test site has four racks of photovoltaic modules in rows, each tilted differently to simulate all installation conditions and designs. Data is displayed in parallel as per remote transfer to DEWA offices or to the control room at TUV Rheinland in Cologne, where detailed analysis of the data will be carried out. The centre supports DEWA 's vision of enhancing sustainability in energy supplies, diversifying energy resources, and creating a work environment that encourages innovation. It also advances Dubai's strategy of building a knowledge-based economy by improving efficiency criteria and supporting renewable energy initiatives, especially those related to solar energy, as well as DEWA 's other activities. The centre also enhances Dubai's position as an international centre of research and development in solar energy, smart grids, and electricity and water efficiency. It will improve the capabilities of buildings in these sectors so Dubai can meet its sustainable development requirements. It will contribute to the establishment of an innovative platform for renewable energy and clean technologies, with the requisite national workforce to be trained to use them. The centre is scheduled for completion by the 1st quarter of 2017. \"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE228","UAE takes responsibility to stand with allies very seriously: Yousef Al Otaiba","January 31, 2016 Sunday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 1st February, 2016 (WAM) -- UAE Ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, has made a speech at the Washington DC based Center for Strategic and International Studies, during which he said that the UAE takes responsibility to stand with its allies in the fight against terrorism, laying out a positive agenda for the Middle East and referencing the annual Joint Military Dialogue between the UAE and the US. when officials from both nation's armed forces engaged in discussions around shared challenges and threats. The ambassador described how the UAE is the promise of a new Middle East, a safe haven of stability, opportunity, and tolerance in the most difficult of neighbourhoods, saying, ""The character of our people and of our leadership is deeply rooted in unity at home, compassion for others, and openness in minds, markets, and faith. We are 1 million Emiratis and 8 million foreign nationals representing virtually every country on earth, living and working together peacefully in the region's strongest economy. We in the UAE entirely reject the notion that we are doomed to perpetual conflict in the Middle East. We believe there is enough room, in geography, theology, and economy, for everyone."" But in the fight against extremism, Al Otaiba highlighted how like-minded people and countries, such as the UAE and the US, must meet the immediate challenge of extremism and aggression in the region. ""Daesh is today's most pressing danger and it must be destroyed, but there is also the continuing concern of the Islamic Republic of Iran."" ""In our view, Daesh is a creeping cancer that weakens states, increases sectarian tensions, and has been directly responsible for the death, casualties, and displacement of millions of people, most of them Muslims. We are experiencing a wave of Daesh-directed and inspired violent extremism that is rocking the Middle East and reaching deep into Europe, America, and Asia. We have seen the murderous spread of Daesh, from a concert hall in Paris to a social service centre in San Bernardino, in Mali and Egypt, Beirut and Baghdad, and, most recently, in Jakarta and Istanbul. The UAE's men and women in uniform have been in this fight for years. We are in it today, and we are prepared to do more."" The UAE has taken a lead in setting up the Hedayah Centre in Abu Dhabi. Hedayah equips communities and governments with the tools to counter violent extremism and terrorist recruitment. Their experts have trained imams, worked in schools, and assisted officials in many countries to develop community-based counter-radicalisation programmes. Another new initiative is the Sawab Centre, established by the UAE and the US in July 2015. Experts from Sawab, which means ""doing the right thing"" or being on the ""right path,"" work side by side to counter extremist propaganda on social media, in both Arabic and English. One recent Sawab campaign highlighted the brutal stories of what happens to Daesh defectors, while another provided first-hand stories of women and girls who had escaped from the self-described Caliphate. ""Let's be clear,"" the ambassador continued, ""The war against Daesh is not a war against Islam. On the contrary, it is a battle to save Islam from a death cult that is hijacking an entire religion to sell an ideology of hate and murder, and in this struggle of ideas, it must be Muslims who lead. That's why we, as proud Muslims, are committed to charting an alternative way forward. Muslim countries, led by Saudi Arabia, have formed a new coalition to coordinate across all areas of counter-extremism. The overwhelming opposition to Daesh in the Muslim world leaves no doubt as to who is hijacking our religion, and defeating their ideology will take more than force alone. This brings us to the third, and most enduring, front in the fight. To win, it is not enough to only describe what we are against, we must also define what we are for."" The UAE, he said, is taking the lead to offer a new vision for young Muslims and the region, an alternative ideology, unafraid of modernity, and looking to the future. It's a path guided by a phrase oft-repeated by Muslims all around the world: ""In the name of God, the most merciful and most compassionate."" Respect, inclusion, peace; these are the true tenets of Islam. Ours is an Islam that empowers women, embraces others, encourages innovation, and welcomes global engagement."" The ambassador drew attention to the UAE's commitment to openness and tolerance, referring to the appointment of Dr. Amal Al Qubaisi as president of the UAE's Federal National Council, the first woman in the region to lead a national assembly, or the November meeting of the Muslim Council of Elders. Established and supported by Emirati leaders, the council is an international body of Islam's most prominent, forward-thinking scholars that is giving greater voice to moderate Islam. It is modernising the way Islam is taught in schools, developing new training programs for imams, and updating Quranic commentaries. The UAE, he said, is building a knowledge economy anchored by world-class academic institutions. ""New York University Abu Dhabi is bringing together the brightest students from around the world. From 400 graduates to date, NYU Abu Dhabi has already produced six Rhodes scholars. I'm not a betting man, but I'm pretty sure that none of these 400 will be joining Daesh."" The ambassador also spoke about a future less reliant on fossil fuels.""We are building an economic engine for the entire region, a place where the free flow of goods, services, people, investment, and ideas lifts the entire Middle East and links it to Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. And in doing so, we are already planning for a future that is less dependent on oil. We will have a sustainable post-hydrocarbon economy \- driven by innovation, human capital, rule of law, and open trade."" At the COP21 These initiatives, he said, will produce the types of opportunities that people in the region dream of: sapping the energy from extremist groups and encouraging children to pick up books instead of guns. ""We hope that a similar vision for the future is shared by our Iranian neighbours. Unlike Daesh, Iran has a choice. In the words of [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger, Iran can be either a state or a revolution."" Al Otaiba went on to applaud President Obama and Secretary John Kerry for their leadership to address the threat of Iran's nuclear weapons programme. ""We are hopeful that Iran will seize this historic opening with a new commitment to regional stability and respect for the sovereignty of other nations. In the UAE, this feeling is very real because no country has more to gain from more peaceful and productive ties with Iran than we do. Our coasts are less than 21 miles apart, we have significant trade ties, and we see enormous opportunities for greater economic, energy, and cultural links."" The ambassador then paraphrased President Obama's first inaugural address, saying, ""We are ready to extend a hand if Iran is willing to unclench its fist,"" But, he continued, ""Unfortunately, that hand is still very much clenched. Since the signing of the nuclear deal, we have seen nothing but more Iranian aggression in the region. In late December, Iran fired unguided rockets dangerously close to a US aircraft carrier. Last October and again in November, Iran performed ballistic missile tests in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1929."" Al Otaiba said that Iran's continued interference across the region can be seen from Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. ""Last August, Yemeni authorities intercepted a shipment from Iran destined for Marib that contained military-use communications equipment accompanied by pamphlets in Farsi. In September, coalition forces intercepted an Iranian freighter in the Arabian Sea carrying anti-tank missiles and launching units, and in late October, surveillance photographs tracked speed boats in the Red Sea smuggling weapons to the Houthis in Yemen."" These incidents, along with the destruction of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Tehran, demonstrate that in Iran, Al Otaiba said, old habits die hard. ""In 1971, just before the UAE declared its independence, Iran seized three strategic Emirati islands in the middle of the Arabian Gulf. The Iranian occupation continues to this day. Iran has consistently refused UAE offers to settle the issue through direct negotiations or at The International Court of Justice."" Over the past decades, the UAE and other GCC countries have built a constructive relationship with the United States, and the US continues to identify Iran as the leading international state sponsor of terror. ""In Palestine, in Iraq, and in almost every country in the region, Iran is funding, arming, and enabling radical, violent, and subversive cells. And closer to home here in Washington, it was just a few years ago that Iran plotted to assassinate my friend, Adel Al Jubeir."" Al-Jubeir was the Saudi Arabian envoy in Washington at that time, and is now Saudi Foreign minister. ""And let's not forget that Iran orchestrated countless terrorist attacks that killed Americans, at the marine barracks in Beirut, at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and in Iraq, where they supplied the IEDs that killed or maimed thousands of American soldiers."" These facts, the ambassador continued, are not lost on the global community and certainly not among Muslims. Last week, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OIC, voted to denounce Iran's interference in the internal affairs of other states. ""Just as we have much to gain from increased exchanges with Iran, we also have much to lose in the face of continued Iranian aggression. Daesh may be a more immediate threat and its barbaric methods are certainly more headline-grabbing, but if Tehran continues to ignore opportunities for reconciliation, Iran's influence will ultimately prove to be even more destabilising than Daesh."" Al Otaiba addressed the recent nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that in the aftermath of its signing, it is time to focus on the threats the deal didn't address. ""Two weeks ago, President Obama made clear that the US will remain steadfast in opposing Iran's destabilising behavior in the region, and noted specifically Tehran's support for violent proxies in Syria and Yemen. In May 2015 at Camp David, President Obama reiterated an 'ironclad' commitment to the security of the UAE and other Arabian Gulf states. He offered new support for defending against missile strikes, maritime threats, and cyber attacks, and he pledged to streamline the defence acquisitions process. We welcome these commitments."" ""With our allies, we continue to wait for more promising signs from Iran. But at the same time, we must remain watchful and prepared to take whatever action is necessary to defend the security of the UAE and our friends. With the nuclear deal, diplomacy worked. It can also work in addressing Iran's other provocative regional policies if together we apply the same level of urgency, determination, and leadership. It is important that the United States strictly enforce the terms of the nuclear deal and hold Iran accountable to its other international commitments. This is the best approach to convince Iran to accept a new peaceful order in the Arabian Gulf."" The UAE ambassador concluded by saying that an engaged and responsible Iran would be welcomed by all in the region. This and the defeat of Daesh, he said, are the two most critical steps toward an alternative, forward-looking path for the Middle East. ""I believe that a new narrative of openness, opportunity, and optimism is possible. When I look ahead in the region, I see more Rhodes scholars and fewer terrorist recruits, more Mars missions and fewer ballistic missiles, more women leaders, more online start-ups. I see an Islam of peace and inclusion, not of extremes. ""In the UAE, this is our way forward: A better way that the men and women in both of our militaries are risking their lives to protect and advance. Whether on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, the UAE is ready to lead with confidence, knowing that the US is our partner."" \"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE229","Industry players generate energy","March 13, 2016 Sunday","ArabianOilandGas.com","Falling oil prices are never far from the top of the agenda, especially at an event attended by Oil Ministers from around the GCC, company owners and senior energy executives. In total, the 7th Gulf Intelligence UAE Energy Forum brought together over 250 energy stakeholders to Abu Dhabi to deliberate on crucial issues and events impacting the oil and gas industry in the Middle East. Held under the patronage of HE Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy, the event was also attended by Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and OPEC President, to name two of the high-profile dignitaries who made some vital comments about the state of affairs in the energy industry. Making an inaugural address to the event on behalf of Mazrouei (who came in later in the day), Dr. Matar Al Neyadi, Undersecretary in the UAE Ministry of Energy said,  2016 will be in an interesting year for the UAE. The nation has strong economic fundamentals. In his speech, Neyadi reiterated the fact that the UAE became the first country in the GCC last year to do away with fuel subsidies, a major economic reform policy. The UAE in August last year decided to lift subsidies on fuel prices, by making them \' market-linked\' . Chaired by Neyadi, the Fuel Price Committee \- which includes members including the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance, CEO of ADNOC Distribution, and CEO of Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), has been announcing fuel prices on the 28th of each month (for the following month). [[banner]] As the forum proceeded, various other energy industry heavyweights took to the stage to address the gathering or to participate in panel discussions, which were moderated by senior partners from Gulf Intelligence, as well as celebrity CNN anchor John Defterios. Intermittently, to keep the audience engaged, multiple poll questions on various industry trends and events were posed, with voters given 10 seconds to choose their answers. Snap polls mirror public opinion The first major question, quite aptly, that was posed to the audience was the way ahead for global crude oil prices. A majority - 51% - of respondents voted that oil prices are unlikely to rise above an average of $40 per barrel this year, putting additional pressure on governments and energy companies to cut their capital costs further. While 28% voted saying prices would remain around $30 a barrel, another 13% said prices could settle at $50 a barrel. The remaining 3% turned out to be an optimistic lot as they felt oil prices could recover to above $60 a barrel. In retrospect, 41% of respondents expected oil prices to average $60/barrel in 2015 during the same GI Industry Survey in January last year. Contrastingly enough, oil prices continue to fall to new lows \- presently trading at below $30 a barrel, as OPEC\' s policy to maintain market share \- a move that has contributed to falling oil prices \- has not weakened output from non-OPEC producers, including US shale oil producers. The oversupply is set to continue in 2016, it is wide believed. Lower oil prices have taken a hefty toll on governments whose budgets are heavily supported by energy revenues, including OPEC members. Oil and gas companies are also slashing expenditure and increasing staff redundancies in the GCC and beyond. Nearly 45% of respondents to another poll question on the topic said that the restrained budgets in the Gulf will be the top macroeconomic factor affecting the oil and gas sector in 2016, followed closely by China\' s economic weakness (38%). The weakening economies in the majority of BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and the US\' decision to increase interest rates will not have as much of an impact, with only 10% and 8%, respectively. To another burning question on climate change and global warming, a strong majority (71%) said that oil producers and companies will revise down their reported recoverable reserves of fossil fuels following an agreement at the COP 21 climate change meeting in Paris last December to limit global warming to below 2\'b0C and strive to keep temperatures at 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. [[page-break]] OPEC emergency meeting Member states of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may decide to gather for an emergency meeting in March, if oil prices do not improve, the cartel\' s president has said.  The oil prices are moving lower faster than the oil barrels can come off the market, Kachikwu told Defterios during an interview at the forum.  We (OPEC) may hold an emergency meeting towards the end of the first quarter (end of February or March) if prices remain at current levels, Kachikwu added. He revealed that \' a couple\' of member states had requested for such a meeting, ahead of the group\' s scheduled meeting on June 2,  to discuss and reconsider strategy , without naming the two countries. Kachikwu told the audience that Saudi Arabia has never held the position that it does not want to talk.  In fact, it was very supportive of a meeting before June, at the time when we held the December meeting, if a consensus calls for it. OPEC decided to keep the output level unchanged at their meeting on December 4 in Vienna. Oil prices tumbled by more than 60% since 2014 due to overproduction and weak demand; from a peak of $115 per barrel in June 2014, prices have currently tumbled below $30 per barrel. [[banner]] Later during the forum when Defterios invited both the UAE and Nigerian oil ministers for a candid interview session, Mazrouei seemed hesitant to nod to such a proposal of an OPEC emergency meeting.  There is a mechanism to call for an Opec meeting. Anyone can ask the Secretary General putting the reasons to have the meeting. What are we going to agree is that we need to be convinced. I am not convinced that Opec solely, unilaterally can change the strategy just because we have seen the low in the market, he said. He reiterated that OPEC was not \' solely responsible\' for the global oversupply of oil, adding that the UAE has no plans to increase production this year. He said that the OPEC strategy to defend market share is working.  We have seen reduction in the yearly gradual increase in production from non-OPEC nations. It\' s working for the customers, with the customers allowing the market to balance itself. The strategy of OPEC is to allow the market share...fair market share. Let the people compete and price be the judge. Mazrouei said that there is going to be a correction before the end of 2016 in oil prices:  We are going to see a correction. The market fundamental tells us this. The increase in demand at the end of 2015 was higher. The market will solve it. That is the only fair assessment of the current situation. The first six months going to be tough. It will be gradual. We will get out of the mess. We tried in OPEC to help as much as we can. Mazrouei further said that no projects will be cancelled due to drop in oil prices, although there is a concerted effort to reduce costs.  This is the trend all producers are doing. We are seeing good results. We are reducing the costs but not cancelling projects, he said. [[page-break]] On Iranian oil entering the market, he said all OPEC members including Iran have the right to increase their production.  We are not going to restrict anyone from producing. There is no such mechanism. It took eight years for the UAE to increase the capacity and cost $75bn. It takes lot of time to conduct a project and come up with a mechanism. That\' s our experience. Good luck if anyone can do it in six months. The South Asian equation The ambitious India-Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline may not materialise due to differences between India and Pakistan, former Indian ambassador to the UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia, said at the forum.  We made tremendous progress. The problem was the state of our relations with Pakistan. The problem is not with Iran. We reached up to the price stage. But then the problems began due to the collapse of Musharraf regime (former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf). I do not believe the pipeline will happen, Talmiz Ahmad commented. [[banner]] He said India does not have potential oil reserves and 80% of import is from the Gulf region.  The import dependency will be 90% in the medium term to long term. There might be a shift towards renewables and nuclear energy, but it is uncertain as of now. India will continue to be a fossil fuel based economy. India is now negotiating with Iran to build $4.5bn under-sea gas pipeline bypassing Pakistan, according to media reports. The planned pipeline from the Iranian coast via the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean to India\' s Gujarat state is proposed to carry 31.5mn standard cubic metres of gas per day and is expected to be built in two years. Meanwhile, a top energy official from Pakistan seated at the same panel discussion said the country is building its own pipeline from Gwadar port to mid-country for LNG supply, which will have additional capacity for any import of gas coming from Iran.  Once we get the right signals from the international community and from the government to go ahead, we are all set to go and build the interconnectivity pipeline with Iran, Zahid Muzaffar, chairman of Oil & Gas Development Co Ltd (OGDCL), Pakistan\' s national oil and gas company, told the forum. [[page-break]] The American perspective The deal unveiled by US Congressional leaders to lift longstanding restrictions on US crude exports comes as a big surprise to world oil markets. It also poses important new questions for the rest of the world - where the US could, intriguingly, be jostling with Iran for market share.  The OPEC has a history of underestimating US shale oil production, Dave Ernsberger,oil expert at Platts, told journalists gathered at a special media roundtable post the forum.  The US is currently producing around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd). We might see that figure rising to 1mn bpd by the end of this year, he said. Ernsberger also revealed that US shale oil producers have taken a hit due to the low oil prices and the pressure exerted by the OPEC producers in the global crude oil market, as a result of which many rigs are going offline.  There are about 650 rigs operating in the US right now, one-third of what was at the peak, he told Oil & Gas Middle East. [[banner]] He further said that the US is likely to export a few thousand more barrels by the end of 2016.  It seems more likely that refiners in Europe and Asia will be weighing up offers to buy crude from Iran and Iraq long before they turn their attention to what it would cost to get their hands on big volumes of Eagle Ford Shale, or any other US crude or condensate, Ernsberger said.  This deal (lifting of the US export ban) is a once-in-a-generation shift in the world oil markets. The lifting of crude export will long be remembered as an exclamation mark, powerfully punctuating the end of the US\' remarkable mental journey from oil importer to oil exporter, and serving as a call to the rest of the world to be ready for a new US mindset, when prices do eventually recover.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE230","OPEC's World Oil Outlook 2015: oil will remain central to the global energy mix over the next 25 years","December 23, 2015 Wednesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","VIENNA, 23th December, 2015 (WAM) - The World Oil Outlook (WOO 2015) emphasizes that oil will remain central to the global energy mix over the next 25 years, helping to satisfy the world's growing energy needs. 'During this period, the most important source of oil demand increases will be in developing countries where populations continue to grow and many are expected to move out of poverty, says the WOO 2015, which was released by OPEC today. 'Short- and medium-term oil demand growth estimates are clearly impacted by the recent decline in oil prices. Oil demand is estimated to increase by 1.5 mb/d in 2015 and 1.3 mb/d in 2016. Nevertheless, several aspects are checking the impact of lower oil prices on demand,' it predicts. The World Oil Outlook (WOO), now in its ninth edition, aims to highlight possible future developments in the oil and energy scene, as well as identify the main challenges and opportunities facing the oil industry in the years to come. It presents a comprehensive outlook for oil demand, supply and the downstream for the medium- (2015\- 2020) and long-term (2020\- 2040). To support this demand growth, the report adds, there is a large resource base available. Supply will increasingly come from diversified sources as well. In the downstream sector, capacity rationalization, mainly in OECD countries, and capacity expansion in developing countries are expected. Furthermore, the ongoing eastward shift in oil trade will intensify. The outlook also emphasizes that the industry is clouded with uncertainty, such as from economic developments, policy measures, technology and non-OPEC supply. These uncertainties underline the genuine concern that exists over security of demand, which should be seen as the other side of the coin to security of supply. Executive summary of the WOO Since the publication of the 2014 edition of the WOO in November last year, the most obvious market development has been the oil price collapse. While the average price of the OPEC Reference Basket (ORB) during the first half of 2014 was over $100/barrel, it dropped to less than $60/b in December 2014 and has averaged close to $53/b in the first nine months of 2015. This new oil price environment has had an impact on both demand and supply prospects in the short- and medium term, and some lasting effects can be expected in the long-term. Furthermore, huge reductions in exploration and production (E&P) capital expenditures and job lay-offs have been reported in the industry. The low oil price has also had negative consequences for oil exporting countries. At the same time, economic factors have continued to weigh on the oil market. The economic picture in the non-OECD region is gloomier than last year. The Chinese economy seems to be maturing and growth is decelerating faster than previously expected. Economic pessimism in Eurasia has also been exacerbated due to geopolitical developments. Furthermore, from a policy point of view, additional climate change mitigation actions, as well as increasing support to renewable energy, the removal of subsidies, new upstream fiscal regimes and further energy efficiency targets have emerged as important factors. All in all, 2015 has been a challenging year for the industry. Economic growth assumed to improve but still remains below its potential: Global economic growth is assumed to improve in the next couple of years to reach 3.8% per annum (p.a.) in 2018 and 2019, so that the global average growth for the period 2014\- 2020 is 3.6% p.a. Growth in the OECD region improves initially before stabilizing at around 2.2\- 2.3% p.a. In developing countries, annual growth also stabilizes, but at around 5.1\- 5.2% p.a. In Eurasia, improving conditions are assumed in the medium-term, which translate into recovering GDP growth. Economic growth, however, remains below its potential as the legacies of the financial crisis and new emerging issues negatively impact the global growth momentum. These issues include the high debt level (both governmental and private households) in many key economies, the weak labour market in the Eurozone, the ongoing challenges of low core inflation, low growth in Japan, slowing growth in developing economies (amid decelerating foreign investments) and considerable structural issues in major emerging economies. These factors will continue to keep global growth below 4% in the medium-term. World population will increase from 7.2 billion in 2014 to 9 billion in 2040: Based on the UN World Population Prospects, world population will increase from 7.2 billion in 2014 to 9 billion in 2040. Population growth in the OECD region is expected to be rather low, while Eurasia is anticipated to see its population decline in the period to 2040 driven by developments in Russia. Most population growth will come from developing countries. Middle East & Africa and OPEC Member Countries are expected to exhibit the highest population growth rates in the next 25 years. China's population will peak in 2028, and India will surpass China as the country with the largest population sometime around 2026. Key features of changing demographics: ageing populations and expansion of urban areas: The world population is expected to age significantly in the next few decades. The population pyramid in 2040 is clearly less pronounced than in 2014. The share of people under 15 declines in every region, particularly in Other Asia and India. Furthermore, the share of people over 64 increases in every region, especially in China and OECD Asia Oceania. In the latter region, one out of every three individuals will be over 64 in 2040. Another important demographic trend that is anticipated to have a significant impact on energy demand is the continuous urbanization of the world. While in 1950 only one out of every three people lived in urban areas, in 2008, for the first time, more people were living in urban areas than in rural settlements. It is expected that by 2040 the urbanization rate will reach 63%. Growing by 3.5% p.a. on average, the global economy will more than double in the period to 2040: Driven by demographic and productivity trends, world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is estimated to average 3.5% p.a. for the period 2014\- 2040. As a result, the world economy in 2040 will be 244% of that in 2014. Developing countries will account for three-quarters of the growth averaging 4.6% p.a. for the forecast period. China and India alone will account for half of this growth. The average growth rate for the OECD is estimated at 2.1% p.a. Within the OECD, the region with the highest expected growth is OECD America, driven by healthy population expansion. For Eurasia, an average growth rate of 2.1% p.a. is projected over the forecast period. Big changes in terms of GDP not in terms of GDP per capita: The configuration of the world economy will change significantly in the next 25 years. In 2040, China's GDP will be 120% and 60% higher than that of OECD Europe and OECD America, respectively. India's GDP will exceed that of OECD Asia Oceania and OECD Europe, and approach the size of OECD America. Latin America and OPEC will overtake OECD Asia Oceania in terms of GDP, while other Asia's GDP will approach the size of OECD Europe. Contrary to a ranking of regions based on GDP size, the ranking on a per capita basis will not change dramatically. OECD America will continue to have the highest GDP per capita of all regions followed by OECD Asia Oceania and OECD Europe. As income per head in China and India will almost triple, these countries will move up in the rankings. However, the figures also underscore the unequal distribution of wealth in the world. While in 2014 the ratio between income per capita in the poorest region (Middle East & Africa) and the richest region (OECD America) was 9.8, in 2040 it is expected to increase to 11.5. Need to develop oil production in more expensive areas will drive long-term oil prices higher: In this Outlook, the price of the ORB is assumed to average $55/b during 2015 and to resume an upward trend in both the medium- and long-term. The medium-term foresees a $5/b increase each year so that a level of $80/b (nominal) for the ORB is reached by 2020, reflecting a gradual improvement in market conditions as growing demand and slower than previously expected non-OPEC supply growth eliminate the existing oversupply and lead to a more balanced market. This, in turn, will provide support to prices. Translated into real prices, the oil price is assumed to be $70.7/b by 2020 (in 2014 prices). The long-term price assumption is based on the estimated cost of supplying the marginal barrel which will gradually move to more expensive areas. This continues to be the major factor in the period through to 2040. The price of the ORB in real terms is assumed to rise from more than $70/b in 2020 (in 2014 prices) to $95/b in 2040 (in 2014 prices). Correspondingly, nominal prices reach $80/b in 2020, rising to almost $123/b by 2030 and more than $160/b by 2040. It should be noted that these are not price forecasts, but working assumptions to guide the development of the Reference Case scenario. Recent changes in energy policies primarily focus on emissions reduction: The Reference Case takes into account policies already in place, but also accepts that the policy process will evolve over time by allowing the introduction of new policies as a reasonable extension of past trends and as a reflection of current debate on policy issues. Recent changes in energy policies focus primarily on emissions reduction through the use of different sets of measures. One set of measures targets tighter fuel efficiency standards, such as Phase 2 of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for heavy-duty vehicles in the United States (US), the new Corporate Average Fuel Consumption standards (CAFC) in India and the introduction of EURO 6 standards in the European Union (EU). These are typically supplemented by better energy efficient standards for residential buildings (for example in China, the US, the EU). Another set of measures relates specifically to the power sector either through specific targets for emissions reduction (for example, the Clean Power Plan in the US) or through support to renewable energy in the sector (for example, EU efforts to increase the share of renewable energy). Finally, the removal of subsidies and price controls in several countries (such as India, Egypt, Malaysia and the UAE) also contributes to the overall focus. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) being submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) during 2015, in the run-up to COP21 , also provide an important indication about the direction of future energy policies in many countries. Global energy demand set to increase by almost 50% in the period to 2040 with the mix continuing to be dominated by oil and gas: 399 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) by 2040. Much of this growth will continue to be concentrated in the developing world as industrialization, population growth and the unprecedented expansion of the middle class will propel the need for energy. By 2040, the developing world is expected to make up 63% of the total global energy consumption, a marked increase from 50% in 2014. OECD energy consumption, on the other hand, will only increase 4% from 2014\- 2040 due to its continued focus on low energy-intensive industries, improved energy efficiency and slower economic growth. Moreover, changes in the energy mix are expected to continue, though fossil fuels will continue to dominate the mix with a 78% share by 2040. In the next 20 years, oil will remain the fuel with the largest share of global energy use. However, its relative weight will decline in the next decades. By the 2030s, oil is expected to drop below 28%. A similar trend is expected for coal. By 2040, natural gas is expected to have the largest share, making up close to 28% of global energy demand with both oil and coal having lower shares by then. However, combined, oil and gas are expected to supply around 53% of the global energy mix by 2040, similar to current levels. Fast growth of renewable energy set to continue: Non-fossil fuel energy will also face significant changes in the coming years. Between 2013 and 2040, nuclear energy will increase at 2.2% p.a., on average, making up 5.9% of the world's total energy consumption by 2040. The share of hydro and biomass, though growing, will remain relatively stable (hydro at around 2.5% and biomass within a narrow range of 9.5\- 9.8%). Other renewables, mainly wind and solar, are expected to grow at the fastest rates, multiplying their contribution to total primary energy supply by more than seven times. Their overall share will nevertheless remain low, reaching around 4% in 2040. Oil demand in the medium-term revised upward, reaching 97.4 mb/d by 2020 : Oil demand in the Reference Case increases by an average of 1 mb/d p.a. in the medium-term, from 91.3 mb/d in 2014 to 97.4 mb/d by 2020. Compared to the WOO 2014, global demand has been revised upwards by 0.5 mb/d in 2020. During this period, oil demand in the OECD region is projected to decline by 0.2 mb/d, totalling 45.6 mb/d in 2020. Oil demand in developing countries is anticipated to increase by 6.1 mb/d between 2014 and 2020, reaching 46.4 mb/d. Moreover, demand in developing countries will surpass that of the OECD by 2020. Demand in Eurasia is expected to increase by 0.3 mb/d, totalling 5.5 mb/d by the end of the medium-term. Medium-term oil demand outlook in the Reference Case Short- and medium-term oil demand growth estimates are clearly impacted by the recent decline in oil prices. Oil demand is estimated to increase by 1.5 mb/d in 2015 and 1.3 mb/d in 2016. Nevertheless, several aspects are checking the impact of lower oil prices on demand. The limited share of the crude price in the retail price of refined products in many countries, together with the recent depreciation of domestic currencies against the US dollar in some countries, means that declines in the oil price are not fully passed through to final consumers. While the ORB's value dropped by almost 60% in August 2015, compared to April 2014, gasoline prices only dropped be around 25% in the US and China, 20% in India and less than 10% in Europe. Moreover, gasoline prices in Brazil and Russia have actually increased since April 2014 and are now almost 10% higher. Additionally, the gloomier economic growth rates foreseen in some large oil consuming and oil exporting countries; efficiency improvements and energy conservation measures; oil substitution through gas, biofuels and renewables; development of extensive public transport networks; policies and regulations; and the recent removal of subsidies in several countries have limited \- and likely will further limit \- the responsiveness of demand to lower oil prices in the medium-term. Oil demand projected at 110 mb/d by 2040: For the long-term, the Reference Case sees oil demand increasing by more than 18 mb/d between 2014 and 2040, reaching 109.8 mb/d at the end of the forecast period. This figure is 1.3 mb/d lower than in the WOO 2014 as a result of further energy efficiency improvements and climate change mitigation policies, as well as slightly lower long-term economic growth estimates. Demand in the OECD region is expected to decrease by 8 mb/d, down to 37.8 mb/d in 2040. However, oil demand in developing countries is expected to increase significantly (by almost 26 mb/d) to reach 66.1 mb/d at the end of the forecast period. Finally, demand in Eurasia is estimated at 5.8 mb/d in 2040. This represents a minor increase of 0.6 mb/d between 2014 and 2040. Demand growth decelerates gradually in the long-term: over the forecast period. While global oil demand is expected to grow during the medium-term (2014\- 2020) by 6.1 mb/d, growth decelerates to 3.5 mb/d during the period 2020\- 2025 and 3.3 mb/d for 2025\- 2030. During the period 2030\- 2035, it further decreases to 3 mb/d and then to 2.5 mb/d during the last five years of the forecast period. On an annualized basis, global demand growth gradually declines from 1 mb/d on average during the medium-term to around 0.5 mb/d each year during the period 2035\- 2040. Decelerating economic growth, declining population growth rates and further energy efficiency improvements are behind this downward growth trend. At the sectoral level, growth in oil demand comes mainly from the road transportation, petrochemicals and aviation sectors: At a global level, oil demand is expected to increase in every sector except electricity generation. However, it is the road transportation sector, together with the petrochemicals and aviation sectors, which will contribute most to the additional demand. In fact, the road transportation sector accounts for one-third of global demand growth between 2014 and 2040. The petrochemicals and aviation sectors together account for another third. The remaining growth comes mainly from the marine bunkers, residential/commercial/agriculture and other industry sectors. While oil demand in the OECD region declines in every sector except aviation and petrochemicals, demand growth is expected in every sector except power generation in developing countries. In the case of Eurasia, a noteworthy demand increase is only expected in the road transportation sector and, to a lesser extent, in the aviation sector. Demand in the road transportation sector: two-way traffic: sector will increase by 12.6 mboe/d. In contrast, in the OECD region it will shrink by 6.7 mboe/d. While a downward trend in oil use per vehicle is expected in both regions, on the back of better efficiency, the penetration of alternative fuel vehicles and a decline in miles travelled per vehicle, the vehicle stock trend will be markedly different. Between 2014 and 2040, the total number of passenger cars will only increase by 125 million in the OECD, whereas almost 1 billion vehicles will be added in developing countries. Similarly, 47 million new commercial vehicles are expected in the OECD and 229 million in developing countries. more \"

I have seen growing political momentum among member states. They know that they have to take action.""Ahead of COP21, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, the UN entity organising the conference, has already received some 180 voluntary climate action plans from countries. Formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, these will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached.As more and more INDCs were submitted, Ban Ki-moon said that this shows that nations are prepared to take meaningful action to address climate change. Many countries have also indicated they would like to see a mechanism in the agreement that will allow them to ramp up their ambition to reach the goal of limiting a global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius.The UN News Centre asked the Secretary-General what makes him optimistic that, in a world full of disease, war and famine, world leaders can work together instead of in their own self-interest. ""[Climate change] doesn't care about national boundaries,"" he said. ""This is a global phenomenon and [leaders] understand that investing wisely in climate change will help their national economy boost. There are many countries who are investing in sustainable energy including solar energy. It's skyrocketing.""The UN climate conference will officially open today when the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, is elected President of COP21. Negotiations towards a final agreement are expected to conclude on 11th December.\l"

The world is now experiencing a strong El Nino event, which could place as many as 4.7 million people at risk from drought in the Pacific alone.Over the next five years, the Initiative is set to mobilize financing and knowledge; create and operationalise partnerships at scale, help coordinate activities to help reach tangible results, catalyze research, and develop new tools.The Secretary-General also joined the launch of the International Solar Alliance, set up by the Governments of India and France. In the presence of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the UN chief said the Alliance will ""enable solar-rich developing countries to make the best use of an abundant, free natural resource.""Other news at the opening of COP21 included a pledge by 11 donor countries of close to $250 million dollars in new money for adaptation support to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), a climate fund hosted by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).The Communique calls on the international community to increase efforts to phase out perverse subsidies to fossil fuels by promoting policy transparency, ambitious reform and targeted support for the poorest.In addition, the World Bank announced it has been working with four European countries \- Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland \- to set up a new $500 million initiative that will find new ways to create incentives aimed at large scale cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries to combat climate change.The initiative, called the Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, will reportedly help developing countries implement their plans to cut emissions by working with them to create new classes of carbon assets associated with reduced greenhouse gas emission reductions, including those achieved through policy actions.Twenty countries, all of them major economies, launched Mission Innovation, a landmark commitment to dramatically accelerate public and private global clean energy innovation, including doubling their current investments in the sector.According to UNFCCC, these national commitments ""are coupled with a major, independent private sector initiative spearheaded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in which entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses will deploy billions more dollars to drive innovation from the laboratory to the marketplace.""Finally, the opening of COP21 also included new partnerships forged between world leaders from major forest countries who today endorsed forests as a key climate solution.Additional initiatives and pledges are expected during the two-week conference, which is scheduled to end on 11 December.\l"

The Action Agenda was launched in December 2014 by the previous meeting of the UNFCCC parties in Lima, Peru.As highlighted in a press release issued by UNFCCC, the LPAA aims to strengthen climate action beyond COP21, by ""mobilizing robust global action towards low carbon and resilient societies and providing enhanced support to existing initiatives.""During the two-week conference, 12 thematic focus events are being organized to expose how climate issues affect various sectors and to suggest relevant solutions to tackle them. On Tuesday, with forests and agriculture taking center stage, leaders from governments, the private and public sectors, civil society and indigenous peoples voiced their environmental concerns.This included how agriculture, forestry and other land uses are responsible for nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions \- about half of that from deforestation and forest degradation, mostly driven by demand for food and wood products and inequities and inefficiencies in the use of land for their production.""Forest countries in partnership with other governments, the private sector and civil society are set for an increased international effort to eliminate natural deforestation and forest degradation in a few decades,"" said Peru's Minister of the Environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal speaking at a press conference.""The success of the LPAA and its action area on Forests relies on effective synergies between state and non-state actors, between investment and forest management \- all together rallied behind sustainably managed forests as a common goal,"" he added.According to UN estimates, approximately one billion people depend directly on forests for their livelihoods and each year, approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed. This loss of forest cover is said to be responsible for roughly 11 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.Meanwhile, governments and organizations, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), announced six new cooperative initiatives that aim to protect the long-term livelihoods of millions of farmer and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The entities highlighted how agriculture is one of the sectors most seriously affected by extreme climate but it also accounts for 24 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change. The initiatives focus on four key areas: soils in agriculture, the livestock sector, food losses and waste, and sustainable production methods and resilience of farmers. The new partnerships are expected to deploy money and know-how across both developed and developing nations to help hard-pressed farmers become key actors in the global drive to achieve a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.UNFCCC said today's events reveal the ""effective and concrete progress"" that can be made when a wide, international set of stakeholders work together to build resilience and low-carbon systems of production in agricultural and food systems.\l"

In his opening speech, EESC President Georges Dassis reminded national leaders who will attend the COP21 conference that Europeans and citizens around the world expect ""a binding, ambitious and universal agreement and also a structured way of involving civil society, which is indispensable for its success."" He called on the negotiators not to lose the contact with ordinary people: ""State leaders must not forget that it is the citizens who will drive the change"".Karl-Heinz Lambertz, Vice-President of the CoR, said: ""We, regions and cities, are often more ambitious than states on climate policy. We know the development opportunities and the weaknesses in our cities and regions. We are now ready to go further on climate action. But we need adequate support. We need a climate governance system that works and that brings into accord all levels of government and an agreement that explicitly refers to local governments.""The two EU bodies have closely aligned their positions on many of the major issues that will be decided by national leaders at the summit, which should culminate in a long-term global agreement on how to prevent runaway climate change.Transition towards a low-carbon economy and society is already happening at grassroots' level with many communities leading the way, in particular thanks to partnerships between sub-national governments and civil society organisations. National governments sometimes fail to recognise and empower bottom-up initiatives, but the success of international climate action will depend on harnessing the ideas, knowledge and energy of businesspeople, consumers, trade unions, NGOs, communities and local and regional authorities.Both the CoR and the EESC are intensifying their efforts to ensure that an agreement in Paris explicitly recognises the role of citizens and of local and regional authorities in tackling climate change, empowering them and giving them more possibilities to translate global climate policy-making into further concrete, meaningful, transformative actions.\l"

The unofficial consultations also focused on a set of important issues with the aim of bringing closer viewpoints of member states and making progress in the four pillars of raising ambitions to achieve the goals of climate change agreement, the responsibilities of developing countries and advanced countries, funding for the post-2020 period, and issues related to efforts and required support for the pre-2020 period.

According to the latest figures, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 percent of emissions, have already submitted national climate plans with targets, known as the INDCs.UN experts say that if successfully implemented, these national plans could bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.Although that would mean significant progress, there is still a long way to go. As per UNISDR data, flooding accounted for 47 percent of all weather disasters over the last 20 years, affecting more than 2.3 billion people, the vast majority of whom live in Asia.A full 75 percent of the 4.1 billion people affected were in either China or India, underscoring the extent to which densely populated areas in those countries were disproportionately vulnerable. In Copenhagen in 2009, the last time countries sought to craft a climate deal, but failed, it was agreed that poorer nations vulnerable to global warming impact would receive US$100 billion per year from 2020.The money is meant to help them give up fossil fuels and to shore up defence against climate-driven food scarcity, heat waves and storm damage. The developing nations are seeking assurances that the flow of money will be recession-proof and come from public sources. There is less clarity as yet on this aspect.Though world leaders have expressed their support for the COP, mere rhetoric will not help. Now the world has a chance to steer towards a low-carbon, climate resilient future. Words should be followed by action on the ground.""Nations participating in the conference should strike a landmark deal on climate change.

Kamal, managing director of Green Infra Facilities Management, recently spoke with fmME on the recent success of COP21 and its expected impact for the Middle East.COP21 is a United Nations framework on climate change that is aimed at promoting further growth of the global sustainability industry.Commenting on the development, Kamal shared:  COP21 is a further extension of what has already been happening in the economy and globally for quite some time we are approaching what is termed the carbon bubble. Elaborating, Kamal explains:  The carbon bubble is the idea that perhaps we have already seen the peak demand for oil and if we've seen the peak demand for oil, that's one challenge to the evaluation of all those investments. The other challenge is that we've seen the peak price, and those are related but necessarily identical items. In either case there is a significant risk to investors who have predicated their primary portfolios around fossil fuels. With a set cap on global warming, nations and business practices will be challenged to implement better regulations and technologies towards reducing fossil fuel consumption, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions.While the GCC market has already made significant advances in launching sustainability initiatives and practices, Kamal stresses there is a still a need to change market behaviour.[[banner]]He states that the regional market needs to shift from a consumption and disposal market, to a resource efficient market. One entity that he applauded for making headway in this arena is Etihad ESCO. I think it\' s very interesting that now in Dubai there is a government-related organisation [Etihad ESCO] that is as of January, going up to the public domain and rating buildings, based on their energy efficiency, commented Kamal. Consequences of the rating presupposes that someday there will be either consequence due to community acceptance or due to government policy change. And those government changes are how you connect back to that concept of COP21, he concluded.

He said he believes the meetings will help reach a better understanding of the varied and common responsibilities of all countries, where the participation of all involved parties should take into account the circumstances of each involved country.He further noted that for the UAE and its regional partners, any new convention should be in l"

The Dubai-based AESG specialises in services that help reduce the ecological footprint of the built environment.Given the UAE\' s efforts to position itself as a global leader in green economy and sustainable development, Alabbar expects to see the energy conservation market strengthen in 2016 as more and more companies look at the benefits it offers. I think it\' ll continue to grow. Globally, every country has to be on board now, he told MEConstructionNews.com.  The leadership in the UAE has been remarkable in that sense. All the initiatives that are being pushed forward are sustainability focused, and I think that in 2016, we\' ll continue to see that take hold. Alabbar added that almost every building that AESG is working on currently, especially the government projects, have very high sustainability aspirations. They\' re not just looking to comply, they\' re looking to see how far they can push the boundaries. I think that will continue in 2016, and I think for all companies that have sustainability ingrained in what they do, I think it\' ll be beneficial for them and for the region. As a result of this changing mindset, a number of energy service companies (ESCO) are looking to tap into the energy conservation market, Alabbar said. With AESG having expanded its operations in 2015, the sustainability expert predicted that a number of firms would be following its lead and look to participate in a rapidly growing market. The ESCO framework only really came into play within the last two years or so. In that sense, it\' s only a two year old established industry, so it\' s still in its early stages, but it\' s developing very quickly. There\' s a lot of ESCO companies setting up shop, and I\' ve personally been in touch with a few to provide some guidance in terms of how they work in the market here, he explained. There\' s also a lot of international ESCO companies that are setting up operations in Dubai to get involved in the market, so it\' s definitely growing and we\' re starting to see the first projects implemented, and clients and ESCOs are starting to see the financial savings from these projects, and that really does accelerate the market. \l"

Al Tayer emphasised that the UAE is a pioneer in the transition towards a green economy, implementing green initiatives, adopting economic diversification and its commitment to achieving sustainable development, based on knowledge, innovation, and sustainable green growth, to achieve economic prosperity. This is achieved by launching ambitious initiatives in renewable energy, solar energy, smart grids and developing a strategy to reduce carbon emissions.Al Tayer noted that the UAE was one of the first countries to support the international society to meet the challenge of climate change and one of the first nations to endorse the extension of the Kyoto protocol in 2005 to limit greenhouse gases in industrial countries. It was the first nation from the region to sign the Copenhagen Accord at COP15 to limit emissions.Al Tayer called on all nations to work more closely and enhance cooperation to reach an agreement at COP21, noting that the great Arab historian Ibn Khuldoun said that the greater the social cohesion, the greater its economic growth. Al Tayer said he was confident that all nations will work together towards the greater good, as does the UAE.""As mandated by President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and to support the vision of Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, we are moving forward with solar power projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park will generate 1,000MW of solar power by 2020. The UAE has made considerable progress in bringing renewable and clean energy to the region, despite having one of the largest oil reserves in the world. Our capital, Abu Dhabi, is the first outside Europe and New York to house the headquarters of a United Nations Agency, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA),"" said Al Tayer.Just a few days ago, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, launched the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to make Dubai a global centre of clean energy and green economy. The strategy sets the ambitious target of solar power generating 5,000MW by 2030, which will be 25% of Dubai's total power output, to save approximately up to 4 million tonnes per annum in emissions, the equivalent of planting about 100 million trees per annum. Dubai also aims to have solar panels on the rooftops of all buildings in the Emirate by 2030. By then, 80% of the waste will be converted into energy as well.""We will not rest in 2030, as His Highness has decreed that the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 target is that 75% of Dubai's total power output will come from clean energy by 2050, so our city will have the lowest carbon footprint in the world by then. Our nation is fully within the sunbelt's higher levels of radiation and so our commitment to combatting climate change comes primarily in the form of harnessing that power to manage rising surface temperatures. We will continue our efforts through the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence, formed in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme, to develop Clean Development Mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to pre-industrial levels to support this goal.""He said Sheikh Mohammed has committed a US$136 million (AED 500 million) fund that will be invested directly in research and development for next-generation clean energy sources. And Dubai will host the Solar Decathlon Middle East in 2018 and 2020 to bring solar power and sustainability even closer together through innovation.""Financing a transition to a low-carbon world requires determined and timely deployment of smart public policies. The Dubai Green Fund proposed by Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 will contribute over USD 27 billion (AED 100 billion) towards clean energy projects in the Emirate and will establish a Free Trade Zone specifically for green investments. Dubai is already making best use of Public-Private Partnerships to make these projects a reality, as proven by Dubai getting the world's lowest tariff for utility scale solar power.""""The UAE has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), together with 145 other countries, to tackle climate change, especially in terms of environmental stewardship of energy by conserving our natural resources, such as the increase of renewable targets I have mentioned, and the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy's Carbon Abatement Strategy to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021.""He added that collectively, the INDCs can slow the rise in temperature. Although they are not sufficient to limit global temperature rising to the recommended level of 2 degrees Celsius this century, the INDCs assessed in the Emissions Gap report represent a historic step in the de-carbonising of our economies. To close the gap and limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, it is essential that a new universal climate agreement is adopted by governments at COP21.""We are here to work together with you to achieve these goals. We are increasing our momentum, driven by the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the UAE Vision 2021 and the Dubai Plan 2021, to grow sustainably and to reinforce Dubai's position as a global hub of clean energy and its transition towards a green economy.""""Climate change is a reality, and something our nation is not just talking something about, but is actively doing something about. Our nation takes its commitments and the vision of its leaders very seriously. We will make that brighter future for your children, our children, and their children. I trust that we are all united in this goal,"" concluded Al Tayer.\l"

This time it is human action that is leading to calamitous climate change. An Intergov- ernmental Panel on Climate Change report has warned that the world is on a path that could, if left unchecked, deliver a global average temperature rise of 4\'b0C or more by the end of the century.A temperature increase of 4 or 5\'b0C or more has not been seen for tens of millions of years (homo sapiens have been around for 250,000 years) and is likely to be enor- mously destructive. Too much or too little water has the potential to cause severe and\~sustained conflict and the migration of hundreds of millions. Not to mention, the decimation of animal and plant \- life and habitat. Managing climate change is today the central challenge facing humanity. But will we take action now or procrastinate?Some 200 global leaders are sched- uled to meet for the Paris Conference of the Parties 21, in an attempt to finalise an inter- national agreement to limit global warming and adapt to its impacts. The proposed deal calls on countries to transparently report on greenhouse gas emissions and commit to ramp up climate action over the next few decades. Any agreement is unlikely to be legally binding. However, the 'intended nationally determined contributions' are what sets the Paris talks apart from past attempts at a global climate agreement in Kyoto in 1997 and the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009The World Resources Institute states that the clean energy plans of Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Indo- nesia, Japan, Mexico and the United States \- which together account for more than 65 per cent of the world's primary energy demand \- would more than double their annual clean energy supply by 2030. Yet commitments should include not just tar- gets but also policies and measures, and local institutions, to implement them. Paris COP21 is a chance to build understand- ing not only of threats and risks but of the opportunities that lie in the transition to the low-carbon economy.Where do the Gulf Cooperation Council nations stand on these issues?GCC pollution levels and commitment to INDCThe GCC has some of the world's highest per capita consumption rates of fossil fuel energy and electricity. As a result, it has some of the highest CO2 emissions in per capita terms. Vehicular emissions are one of the main sources of air pollution in the GCC. It may not be well known but the United Arab Emirates tops the world for exposure to tiny air pollutants, accord- ing to the World Bank. The UAE's PM 2.5 level (which measures tiny airborne pollut- ants smaller than 2.5 microns) stood at 80 micrograms per cubic metre in a report this year. Much higher even than countries such as China (73 micrograms) and India (32\~micrograms). Qatar stands second among the GCC nations, with its level at 69 micro- grams and Saudi Arabia quite close at 62.Earlier in November, Saudi Arabia sub- mitted its intended nationally determined contribution, revealing its aim to slash its emissions by up to 130 million tonnes by 2030. Shy on details, the document does not mention the current levels of green house gas emissions. It underscores the fact that its plan is dependent on 'robust' oil export revenues over the coming dec- ades and the country 'reserves the right' to update its plan.The UAE, in October, announced its target to increase low-carbon energy con- tribution to the overall energy mix from 0.2 per cent in 2014 to 24 per cent in 2021. To achieve this target, the UAE will imple- ment energy efficiency measures, feed-in tariff reforms and demand-side manage- ment initiatives. Such measures would include dissemination of information to consumers about their power consumption patterns, implementation of electric appli- ance entry efficiency standards and setting water and energy consumption standards for buildings.It is the economics that matterThe New Climate Economy report by The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate identifies 10 key areas of opportu- nity for stronger climate action. These could bring significant economic benefits. There is the potential to achieve at least 59 per cent and as much as 96 per cent of the emissions reductions needed by 2030, to keep global warming under 2\'b0C. The report has four main points. One, moving to a low carbon infrastructure is not a 'climate cost' but a 'climate investment'. Two, emissions need to stabilise at a lower level than previously thought. Three, clean energy is keeping a lid on the cost of a low carbon transition. We should invest at least $1 trillion a year in clean energy, compared to current levels of $260bn. Four, any Paris agreement needs to include a 'ratchet mechanism' \- a facility for a regular review and revision of targets, given the falling costs and rising awareness of countries.There is no trade-off between invest- ments required for a low-carbon economy and economic growth. 'Climate' must be integrated into economic decision-making\~processes at the levels of government, soci- ety and businesses. This requires a major shift by policymakers and business leaders in their strategic outlook. It is also urgently required in the Middle East and North Africa region where oil producers are at the crux of energy market developments.Moving the GCC to decarboniseEnergy consumption patterns in the GCC region are unsustainable. Due to high and\~growing air pollution levels and carbon footprints, the region faces high risks from climate change. What should they do to decarbonise?(a) Phase out fuel subsidies\~In addition to imposing large fiscal costs, energy subsidies distort consumption and production patterns, and encourage energy intensive activities. A recent Inter- national Monetary Fund report found that post-tax subsidies, accounting for environ- mental and other damages resulting from subsidies, are projected to reach $5.3 tril- lion in 2015. This is equivalent to 6.5 per cent of global gross domestic product and a staggering 13 to 18 per cent of regional GDP in the Middle East and North Africa plus Pakistan region. Eliminating energy subsidies by raising energy prices to inter- national levels would improve energy efficiency in all sectors and generate sub- stantial environmental and health benefits.(b) Impose a carbon taxA carbon tax is usually defined as a tax based on emissions generated from burning fuels. This will transform energy investment, reduce fuel consumption, increase fuel efficiency and sharply reduce the carbon emissions that are driving global warming. A carbon tax creates incentives for energy consumers to use cleaner fuels and adopt new clean technologies, thereby reducing the amount they pay in carbon tax. For the GCC nations, a carbon tax would also be a way of diversifying revenue.(c) Invest in intelligent, clean infrastructure(e) Develop renewable energy financingGreen financing, including green bonds and Sukuk, is attracting new investors as part of sustainable finance. The UAE, which is hosting the International Renew- able Energy Agency, has an open and developed international financial sector proficient at financing hydrocarbons. It can become the first global hub for renewable energy finance, tapping the Gulf region's enormous financial resources.Dr Nasser Saidi is founder and president of Nasser Saidi Associates and former chief economist at Dubai International Financial Centre\l"

The two-day summit, themed 'The Age of Plenty, the Age of Competition,' saw over 2000 executives and thought leaders discuss the opportunities and challenges in the energy industry and the current trends that are reshaping the energy-mix across all four corners of the world.The conference comes on the back of a record year for the renewable energy industry, which saw over USD 330bn invested globally.This year's summit included a keynote speech delivered by US Secretary of State John Kerry. In his remarks, Kerry highlighted how the UAE is committed to diversifying its energy use and ""in particular increasing renewable energy in fuel mix at unprecedented rates."" As part of Masdar's participation at the summit, Al Lamki spoke on the plenary session ""After Paris: How will things be different?"" to discuss the momentum after Paris climate negotiations in December 2015. The event touched on many of the themes that were debated during Global Action Day, the first global event post-COP 21 held during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in January.Al Lamki said, ""In 2015 we took a big step forward, not least with the way that both the public and private sphere came together for the Paris climate change meetings. The economic and business case for renewables is there, which was in part led by organisations such as Masdar pushing smart collaboration and partnership models."" Al Lamki pointed to the Zayed Future Energy Prize for evidence of how businesses and other organisations can help governments reach the targets set at COP21 and in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by providing clean, affordable energy. The prize has been empowering innovators in Africa to develop solutions in clean energy that transform the lives of hard to reach, off-grid communities \- improving health, creating jobs and boosting economic growth in the process.Joining Al Lamki on the COP 21 panel were Delphine Eyraud, Senior Policy Advisor, Climate Negotiations COP 21 Presidency, French Ministry of Environment; Zia Khan, VP for Initiatives and Strategy, the Rockefeller Foundation; and Jeff McDermott, Managing Partner, Greentech Capital Advisors. Moderating the panel was Michael Liebreich, Founder and Advisory Board member of BNEF and Chair of the Advisory Board of WiSER (Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy), a UAE-founded initiative between Masdar and the Zayed Future Energy Prize.Al Lamki further reinforced the potential for growth in the renewables industry across MENA during a Masdar-convened event ""Wind and Solar in the Middle East and North Africa.""

Based on the most recent Synthesis Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it is clear that climate change has widespread impacts on human and natural systems in every region already today and that drastic mitigation efforts have to be launched now to limit the temperature increase to below 2C. The most severe observed global impact from climate change is the increased average temperature by 0.85C compared to pre industrial levels. This is resulting in a) heat waves, like this summer in Europe, b) further water scarcity, e.g. in California, US this year, or c) reduced crop yields in African regions and Australasia.However, more and more people clearly understand the urgency of fighting climate change, reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and switching to renewable energies.What reforms are currently gaining momentum?40% of global energy related CO2 emissions are coming from the power sector.

It also serves as a platform for decision makers, scientists, young researchers, and private sector representatives, who interacted and discussed the research agenda for the future.In her address on the occasion, Sheikha Lubna said, ""The rapid rate of population growth, had triggered an ever-increasing demand on industrial activities which, among many other anthropogenic activities, result in an excessive release of greenhouse gases, and in particular carbon dioxide. The level of CO2 emissions had increased from 280 part per million (ppm), prior to the industrial revolution, to 379 ppm in 2005, reaching a current level of 400 ppm. These emissions are causing the world's climate to change, leaving serious impact on our planet's environment and the way we live. Several studies reported an increase of the average global air temperatures by 1.5 C since the early 20th century, and an increase by about 1 degree over just the last 30 years.""She added that the COP meeting concludes repeatedly that business, as a usual scenario, is not the way to go when dealing with climate change. ""This is mainly due to the fact that climate change knows no boundaries. No country can address climate change on its own. This is a challenge that needs to be dealt with globally. However, there are several standing challenges which will be addressed by the experts of this timely gathering,"" she said.Sheikha Lubna said, ""COP21, for the first time, brings all nations into a common cause based on their historic, current and future responsibilities. The universal agreement's main aim with regard to climate change is to keep a global temperature rise, this century, well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The proportion of these Electrified Vehicles (EVs) are set to increase in the next few months and it is highly recommended that we take the cue from countries that have adopted these new transport modes to learn more about these vehicle solutions.As such, TRL has identified this emerging market's key drivers, which includes vehicle availability; government incentives to purchase and charge vehicles; network of charging stations; public awareness and the desire to 'go green.'Dubai has actually been witnessing the initial presence of a few EVs and have already established an initial network of around 100 charging stations. In addition, select manufacturers have already expressed their move to introduce hybrid or fully electric models in the UAE. TRL has long been pursuing an electric vehicle (EV) program of research and we have initially implemented a technology agnostic approach to all of our work-- forming objective views based on the evidence and facts we uncover through our research, said Akin Adamson, director, Middle East region, TRL. Our goals in our EV research program is to identify the technologies that are likely to provide the biggest benefits under different conditions and develop an understanding of how the real-world use of these technologies may be affected by user and consumer behaviour, he added.Recent reports have clearly shown that transport infrastructure, particularly the internal combustion engine, are significant contributors to poor air quality, especially in urban environments. EVs offer an ideal solution for tackling current air quality problems as they provide zero tailpipe emissions, as well as grid-to-wheel CO2 emissions already below most internal combustion engine vehicles.However, current EVs are far more suited to short, urban journeys rather than inter-urban and rural use. Range and utilization are constrained by battery limitations and charging times, so for longer journeys on strategic roads or outside of cities, EVs are often not yet practical.This issue will be one of the topics to be discussed at Solar Middle East, the most comprehensive gathering of solar technology suppliers in the region, which will be held from March 1 to March 3, 2016 at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC).During the event, Adamson will be part of a panel discussion entitled, \' Are we there yet? Electric transportation commercial and regulatory outlooks.\' The event runs in strategic partnership with the Government of Dubai and supported by a network of key regional associations, Solar ME provides direct, established access to MENA\' s emerging solar markets. Regardless of the method chosen to achieve electrification, the concept of recharging vehicles on the move, combined with other initiatives, could play an important role in helping many regions to achieve their vision of becoming smart, connected and sustainable.

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE110","Mr Efficient: Veolia s Antoine Frerot","May 6, 2016 Friday","ArabianBusiness.com","Efficiency is the epitome of French-based energy giant Veolia.The $13bn firm has made a considerable amount of its wealth from adhering to the principle of being efficient and generating new methods of resourcefulness.It is no surprise, therefore, that global chairman and CEO Antoine Fr\'e9rot is bullish about growing Veolia's business in the GCC, a region where energy savings are as prevalent now more than ever amid current economic challenges.""We could save 20 percent of the energy which is used in this country, and that's the case in all other parts of the world,"" Fr\'e9rot says.Veolia, listed in Paris with a market cap of $13.84bn, provides environmental management services, including drinking water treatment and distribution, wastewater and sanitation services, and waste management and energy services.A world leader in its water services business, the 160-year-old company posted $28bn in revenue last year, with 174,000 employees across five continents. It has been in the Middle East for 25 years, employing about 3,100 people. Last year the firm reported $233m in revenue.Almost half of the company's revenue in the GCC comes from a joint venture with Majid Al Futtaim Ventures called Enova, an energy and multi-technical services company. Fr\'e9rot believes the time is right to accelerate its growth.""We think that in the field of energy efficiency, which today is about half of our actual activity in the region, we could double [current revenue of] \€ 100m [$114m] in the next five years,"" he says.He also forecasts ""a lot"" of expansion in wastewater reuse in the region, as well as modernisation of waste treatment equipment, including waste to energy services. ""I think we could add 50 percent on what we have today, meaning the \€ 100m we have today could be \€ 150m ($172m).""Through Enova, Veolia is planning to develop its energy services and introduce efficiencies in the UAE's mega malls, hospitals and universities. ""In big buildings you use a lot of energy,"" Fr\'e9rot says.Veolia's UAE joint venture with Majid Al Futtaim Ventures, Enova, employs more than 2,000 people.The GCC's huge population growth also makes it a top candidate for energy efficiency programmes. ""The GCC is probably the one part of the world where the growth in population is the highest for the last ten years, and probably for the next ten years,"" Fr\'e9rot says.""The condition of life [in the GCC] is not so easy compared to others, you don't have a lot of fresh water, it's very hot and you use energy to live. So it's typically a region where energy efficiency is useful to continue to have this sustainable development; to continue to grow by using less energy resources would be key in the future.""Ironically, Fr\'e9rot predicts that water  a scarce resource in the region  savings could be made in the future by moving away from the very desalination plants that Veolia is currently building in the GCC. ""We could continue to make desalination plants but I will propose to the authorities to perhaps spend more energy on water reuse instead, because it is, in my mind, more efficient, and more useful. It is cheaper,"" he says.Reusing water also reduces transport costs and pollution, Fr\'e9rot says. In Ajman, Veolia is using recycled wastewater for irrigation, but he insists that it could also be treated to become potable water if needed.Fr\'e9rot says he has the figures to prove it.Veolia also has developed a counter-terrorism system for public water supplies, where any traces of pollution can be detected in real time, allowing the water management authority to shut down an entire system before the pollutant reaches households. The technology has not generated significant interest in the GCC, but Fr\'e9rot says he is hopeful some governments will eventually be keen to install the system that has been used at major events in recent years, including the London Olympics.Veolia is also keeping an eye on Iran, a country that could offer significant business, but Fr\'e9rot remains cautious.""There are some needs with the municipalities and the industrials,"" he says, ""and now we will be able to begin discussions, given the new geopolitical situation.""Veolia is a global leader in optimised water resource management.Still at the early stages of those talks, Fr\'e9rot says the size of the market is potentially eight times that of the UAE, based on the size of the population alone.""The needs should be proportional to the population, but the final means to pay is not the same,"" he says. ""They need some expertise for labs, especially for water and energy, [before energy efficiency systems can be implemented].""Iran's re-entry into the oil market has been partially blamed for keeping oil prices low, both because of the additional supply and Saudi Arabia's refusal to freeze its own supply unless Iran does too. Fr\'e9rot says the lower prices have positive short-term benefits, including saving on energy costs ""on a short-term basis"".""On the longer term, we are involved with the oil industry to help them develop their businesses and for sure the small level of oil [price] today affects all the investment of building new wells, so we didn't have a lot of new projects during the last month. Despite that, we signed during the last three months two or three big projects because even if they don't build new wells, [they need] to keep operating the previous ones.""Older wells require five times as much water to pump oil. Fr\'e9rot says such wells require water recycling facilities.The biggest impact of the low oil price for Veolia is on its municipal clients, compared to industrial clients. In 2015, municipal clients represented 56 percent of Veolia's activity and Fr\'e9rot says the lower price has forced clients to alter their funding model.""Municipal clients for the oil-dependent countries [will] not completely cut the projects but transform them from public finance projects to PPPs [public-private partnerships] or concession contracts, asking also for an offer of financing on long-term,"" he says.\~""We had that ten years ago. A lot of desalination, wastewater, or water treatment plants were financed through PPPs. It stopped five years ago to come back to a more classical way. But there is so much money around the world looking for good projects  [there is] more money than good projects.""When asked how the global economy is affecting Veolia's business, Fr\'e9rot describes it as ""not very exciting for the past two years"". However, the economy is not the most important driver for Veolia's activities.Fr\'e9rot says Veolia has demonstrated the relevance of its strategy despite a difficult economic environment.Further down the l"

It says such shocks could wipe out hard-won gains, leading to irreversible losses, driving people back into poverty, particularly in Africa and South Asia.""This report sends a clear message that ending poverty will not be possible unless we take strong action to reduce the threat of climate change on poor people and dramatically reduce harmful emissions,"" World Bank Group President, Jim Yong Kim, has said.""Climate change hits the poorest the hardest, and our challenge now is to protect tens of millions of people from falling into extreme poverty because of a changing climate,"" the World Bank chief explained. Efforts to end poverty, the linchpin of the 17 new Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in September, could be derailed if the impacts of climate change on poor and vulnerable people and communities not effectively addressed.According to the report, the poorest people are more exposed than the average population to climate-related shocks such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves, and they lose much more of their wealth when they are hit. In the 52 countries where data was available, 85 per cent of the population lives in countries where poor people are more exposed to drought than the average. Poor people are also more exposed to higher temperatures and live in countries where food production is expected to decrease because of climate change.Released less than a month before negotiators gather in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP 21, the report shows how ending poverty and fighting climate change can be more effectively achieved if addressed together.\l"

The Paris Agreement unites the world in action to meet the challenge of climate change and can be the spark that ignites a new model of global growth.More than 150 Heads of State and Government opened COP 21 and expressed inspiring support for an ambitious agreement. The conference featured countless examples of business and investors, cities and regions already acting on climate change. After the final gavel fell, hundreds of these stakeholders worldwide pledged to make the Paris Agreement a success. This is a truly a turning point.""The engines of our economy now must remain firmly pointed towards a future that ensures every country can meet or exceed their contribution to the Paris Agreement. Investment, industry and innovation all have a role to play in establishing a new model of development that is both sustainable and within the exigencies of science.

ADSW 2016 is anchored on four key pillars: policy, business, leadership and awareness/research. Use of renewable energy must be increasedSilvia RadanThe need to double the investment in renewable energy globally by 2030 to limit the rise in temperature by a maximum of two degrees Celsius and thus avoid catastrophic climate change consequences was at the forefront of COP 21, the UN climate change conference in Paris last December.And it will continue to be at the upcoming assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency and Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week.""The assembly will be the first inter-governmental meeting after COP 21 and there will be follow-ups on the decisions taken in Paris,"" said Timothy Hurst, chief communications officer at the Irena.Some 800 ministers and government officials are expected to attend the Irena's annual assembly on January 16 and 17. Among them will be officials of countries accounting for more than 90 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.""Over 190 countries have put down on paper their plans to cut emissions, which mostly involves increasing renewable energy usage,"" pointed out Hurst.Worldwide, conventional energy (fossil fuels) accounts for two-thirds of global emissions, the main reason for climate change.Based on current policies and those under consideration by the 190 nations at COP 21, the share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption will only increase to 21 per cent by 2030, still causing an increase in global emissions.At this rate, if all emission cut plans are implemented, global temperature rise would reach 2.7 degrees celsius, leading to melting of glaciers, sea level rise and coastal floodings, loss of food crops and general social and economic turmoil.According to the Irena, to remain under a safe two-degree-Celsius temperature rise, governments need to reach a 36 per cent share of renewable energy in their total energy mix by 2030. This, though, would require the rate of renewable energy uptake to rise by one per cent every year until 2030, a six times increase from the present levels, meaning doubling the investments in renewables to over $500 billion by 2020 and further up to an annual average of $900 billion between 2021 and 2030. The figures may seem ambitious, but Irena believes they are achievable.Furthermore, renewables have created an entirely new employment sector with 7.7 million people working in this field in 2015, an 18 per cent increase from 2014.- HYPERLINK mailto:silvia@khaleejtimes.comsilvia@khaleejtimes.com{\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cellThe week officially begins today with the sixth general assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, a key event in the policy pillar.

Renewable energy has played a crucial role here,"" he said.What is equally encouraging is the fact that the emerging economies are taking bigger steps in this direction, driven in China's case by need to cut down on local pollutions.Birol pointed out that the cost of renewable energy was also falling in part due to China's push for solar energy, which has helped cut costs by two-thirds in the past five years. Apart from solar energy, the costs of onshore wind energy have also fallen by one-third, but prices of offshore wind energy were still going up.An improving picture for renewables can have positive ramifications for global climate change negotiations. At the same time, a clear, supportive outcome from the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris in December could create a virtuous cycle for renewable deployment by increasing long-term policy vision and predictability..\l"

IoT creates a unified view of facilities management as well as advanced service operations through the collection of data and insights from a multitude of sensors. ""Especially in large sites, such as industrial zones, office parks, shopping malls, airports or seaports, IoT can help reduce the cost of energy, spatial management and building maintenance by up to 30 percent,"" added Ms. Tratz-Ryan.The business applications that are fuelling the growth of IoT in commercial buildings are handled through building information management systems that drive operations management, especially around energy efficiency and user-centric service environments. In 2016, commercial security cameras and webcams as well as indoor LEDs will drive total growth, representing 24 percent of the IoT market for smart cities.IoT deployment in commercial buildings will continue to grow at a rapid pace over the next few years, and is on pace to reach just over 1 billion in 2018. ""Incentives into the deployment of IoT in commercial real estate will fuel its development,"" said Ms. Tratz-Ryan. ""The U.K.'s building information modelling (BIM) mandate, for example, requires that all public sector construction commencing in 2016 complies with BIM (level 2)."" BIM utilizes data models coming from various information sources including IoT, which will be used by commercial real estate in the future.Continues on next page[[page-break]]In smart homes, the consumer IoT applications that are fuelling growth are smart TVs, smart set-top boxes, smart bulbs and various home automation tools such as smart thermostats, home security systems and kitchen appliances.

Dr. Belhoul also highlights the importance of the upcoming Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week as a platform to catalyse continued innovation in the new year.""The world is witnessing rapid change and continuous development. This is as true in the world of renewable energy and sustainable development, as it is elsewhere. The UAE leadership has long recognised that innovation, be it through new ideas or ground-breaking technology, is fundamental to the preservation of resources, diversification of the energy mix and the mitigation of climate change.When the UAE government announced 2015 would be the 'Year of Innovation', Masdar committed to re-doubling its efforts to grow its innovation ecosystem, not just for the benefit of the UAE but the wider global community.At Masdar, innovation is not just about invention, it is also about taking something that already exists and improving it, by challenging conventional thinking. One such example is water desalination. In November, Masdar launched a ground breaking pilot seawater desalination programme, aimed at dramatically reducing the energy intensity of desalination. The project offers four viable solutions for renewable-powered energy efficient desalination, transforming the desalination industry into a more sustainable model that can be used across the globe."" Dr. Belhoul went on to give examples of the practical application of innovative thinking, citing Masdar's partnership with ADNOC to create the joint venture Al Reyadah, the Middle East's first specialised company focusing on exploring commercial-scale Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage projects. The long-term goals of the programme include building a national network that captures carbon from power generation and industry, and using it for enhanced oil recovery. The benefits of reinjecting carbon dioxide rather than natural gas include securing the long-term storage of CO2 that contributes to climate change and preserving cleaner-burning natural gas so it can be used for power generation, or for transport.Another first, The Solar Hub, adds to the nation's innovation agenda by expediting the development of new solar technologies suitable for harsh desert environments. Located in Masdar City, this facility is the first independent, high quality solar testing and R&D facility in the region. By capitalising on the UAE's strengths as a renewable energy hub, the facility gives the global solar industry a foundation for research, new product development and collaboration with local and international companies.Another pioneering initiative, The Catalyst is the region's first technology startup accelerator focused on sustainability and clean tech. A partnership between Masdar, BP and Masdar Institute, The Catalyst, backed by US$ 5 million in funding from BP, supports fledgling innovators in the fields of energy, water and clean tech with seed funding, training, mentoring, and work space.Highlighting the unique positioning of The Catalyst, Dr. Belhoul said, ""In the nine years since our inception, Masdar has transformed from a bold idea into a commercially-viable renewable energy company. We want to leverage our own experience, as well as our unique infrastructure and assets at Masdar City, to create a platform for start-ups with similarly bold visions for sustainable technologies and turn their ideas into commercial realities.""A further example of innovation in action is the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, the UAE's most sustainable office building that was inaugurated in June. Located in Masdar City, the building will use 42 percent less energy than global energy-efficiency standards. It is also expected to use 50 percent less water and 64 percent less energy than similar commercial buildings in Abu Dhabi.Dr. Belhoul explained that the 2016 edition of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, ADSW, assumes added importance, as it will be the first opportunity for thought leaders, policy markers and investors to address the challenges of renewable energy and sustainable development, following the COP 21 climate change agreement.""Just because the Year of Innovation has come to an end, it does not mean the end of innovation. Innovation takes place all year round, every year at Masdar. In light of the global consensus formed around the COP 21 climate agreement, the global community must commit to re-doubling our efforts to innovate and address the energy and sustainability challenges we all face,"" Dr. Belhoul said.""As the region's largest gathering on sustainability, ADSW plays a significant role in stimulating international dialogue and action on renewable energy and sustainability. The knowledge exchange that will take place will inform solutions to the challenges the world faces for years to come.""That is why Dr, Belhoul believes that the UAE government's declaration that 2016 will be the Year of Reading is critically important and will contribute to innovative thinking in the future. ""Without reading, there can be no knowledge. And without knowledge there can be no innovation. And without innovation there can be no development,"" he said. ""As we enter the Year of Reading, Masdar will continue to be a platform for everyone who wants to learn more about sustainability.""\l"

All the projects are scheduled to be commissioned in the next two years, Google said in a blog post.Some of the deals were reportedly signed several weeks ago, but Google chose to announce them at a time when over 180 countries are deliberating at the UN climate change summit COP21, being held in Paris, to forge a consensus agreement on ways to cut down on carbon emissions widely believed to be changing the Earth's climate.""We've signed six large-scale Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which are long-term financial commitments to buy renewable energy from specific facilities,"" Google said in the blog post.Together with the new deal, the Alphabet Inc. unit now has contracts for 2 gigawatts of renewable energy worldwide, according to Google.The power-purchase agreements run from 10 to 20 years.""It's the largest, most diverse purchase of renewable energy by a non-utility,"" Michael Terrell, Google's principal of energy and global infrastructure told Bloomberg in an interview.""We wanted to send the message that corporate America is really committed to driving the transition to a clean-energy economy,"" Terrell said.Of the deals announced Thursday, Google will buy 200 MW power from Renewable Energy Systems Americas Inc.'s Bluestem wind project, and 200 MW from Electricite de France SA's Great Western wind project. Both the projects are being set up in Oklahoma.Another contract for 225 MW of wind power has been signed with independent US power producer Invenergy LLC.In Chile, Google will source 80 MW solar power from Acciona Energia SA's El Romero farm, based in the Atacama region. The company has also agreed to buy 76 MW of wind power from Eolus Vind AB's Jenasen wind project in Sweden's Vasternorrland County.In July, Google had committed to tripling its purchases of renewable energy by 2025 from levels of 1.1 gigawatts of such power it had already contracted till then in a span of five years.""Google has already committed to purchase more renewable energy than any other company. Now, through a series of new wind and solar projects around the world, we're one step closer to our commitment to triple our purchases of renewable energy by 2025 and our goal of powering 100% of our operations with clean energy,"" the US tech giant stated.Google signed its first large-scale PPA with a wind farm in Iowa in 2010. Last week, Google had finalized a deal to source 61 MW from a solar farm in North Carolina under a new state program that lets companies buy renewable energy directly from local utilities.""Today's agreements will add an additional 842 MW of renewable energy capacity to power our data centers. Across three countries, we're nearly doubling the amount of renewable energy we've purchased to date. We're now up to 2 gigawattsthe equivalent to taking nearly 1 million cars off the road,"" Google stated.Earlier this year, Google had announced plans to locate its newest data center on the site of a retiring coal plant and fully power it with renewable energy from day one.Beyond powering its own operations with renewables, Google has made separate agreements to fund $2.5 billion into 22 large-scale renewable energy projects over the last five years, from Germany to Kansas to Kenya.These investments have been in some of the largest and most transformative renewable energy projects in the world with a goal to help drive renewable energy development not only as a customer but also as an investor..\l"

He said the Dubai WoodShow has drawn participations from many countries reflecting their confidence in the market.Al Zeyoudi made the statement while inaugurating 'Dubai WoodShow 2016' on Monday. He noted that more than 250 companies from 42 countries are taking part in the show which targets traders, architects, decision makers from the contracting, environment and other relevant sectors, said the organisers.He said that the UAE has been financing over 30 renewable energy projects worth $840 million in 28 emerging countries under an ambitious funding programme launched six years ago.Legal trade of timber and the significance of dealing with licensed exporters of timber will also take a huge deal of discussions at the show which runs until April 6.According to the minister, the wood trade is very significant to the UAE where 70 per cent of wood goes to construction sector and 30 per cent to other various sectors which demonstrates the vital role of wood in the country's development.On the woodshow, Al Zeyoudi said, ""Based on my observation during the tour, this exhibition is up to the environmental standards where exhibiting companies are deploying stringent measures in wood production.""Wood is used as a major material for building in the GCC and it is also highly used in interior designs. The show encourages the use of wood with adherence to green and sustainable buildings in the region as well as in the UAE.\l"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE171","Does OPEC have a future?","April 30, 2016","Gulf Business","Dr Nasser Saidi examinesthe survival chances of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries amid low oil prices and the growth of renewable energyWith oil prices down by almost 70 per cent from mid-2014, and touching multi- year lows recently, economies across the globe are gradually adjusting to the 'new oil normal' and the massive transfer of real income from producers to consumers.The market has changed radically from the days when the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was formed in the 1960s.Set up with the objective of coordi- nating and unifying petroleum policies among its member countries to ""secure fair and stable prices"" and ""maintain ef cient, economic and regular supply of petro- leum"", OPEC is a cartel. The cartel survived (unlike private sector cartels) because it was formed by governments that could acquire and maintain a monopolistic situation. But does it have a future?For the last 40 years, the Gulf Coop- eration Council countries, with the biggest producer Saudi Arabia in the lead, acted as\~swing producers, able to control prices. With relatively cheap production costs and a high level of proven reserves, Saudi Arabia could single-handedly send prices up (by pump- ing less) or down (by pumping more). But market forces responded to OPEC actions.Cuts in OPEC production to raise prices led to higher market shares for non- OPEC producers. When Saudi reduced its output by three-quarters from 10m barrels per day in 1980 to under 2.5m in 1985- 86, the result was higher prices but also a boom in exploration, investment and then production in places such as Britain and Norway, and then farther a eld in Africa and Latin America.The 'new oil normal'This time round, OPEC led by Saudi has opted for a predatory pricing strategy to drive new, higher-cost, tight oil producers out of business. In 2015, the world pro- duced 96.3m bpd of oil while it consumed only 94.5m bpd \- meaning that each day about 1.8m barrels went into storage tanks. Global oil and gas investments fell 22 per cent in 2015, down to $522bn, and are expected to fall further in 2016.Indeed, Arctic oil exploration has been frozen and globally oil firms have sus- pended investment of around $380bn. In an attempt to prevent further oil price falls, an agreement was reached in February 2016 to freeze output at January levels. But with Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq pump- ing at close to record levels, the freeze is unlikely to do much to curb the oversupply. Indeed, the structure and dynamics of the oil market has radically changed over the past decade; we are in the era of the new oil normal. What is different this time around?New energy supplies: Shale and renewables\~In its heyday, the market share of OPEC producers was around 50 per cent when\~there were few alternatives to fossil fuels. Now, it supplies around 30 per cent of the world's oil.New sources of oil have emerged. The shale industry has grown and over the past ve years around 4.2m bpd have been added from North America's shale produc- ers. Although accounting for only 5 per cent of global production, shale has had a determining impact on the market. Shale oil producers are using new technologies (hydraulic fracking) to access resources formerly considered too hard and costly to extract. The cost of extraction (rig and drill- ing costs) has fallen sharply \- so much so that that some wells can make money with prices around $40-45 a barrel, according to Rystad Energy. With declining produc- tion costs, shale producers are here to stay. The return of Iran, Libya and Iraq to the oil market adds to the supply overhang. The lifting of sanctions on Iran promises to bring an additional 600,000 bpd and to send oil prices down to their lowest levels since 2003.The other major source of new energy has been the revolution in renewables \- solar, wind, water, geothermal and bio-mass.Renewable energy has made enormous strides. A record $329bn was invested in clean energy in 2015, despite persistently low oil prices. The forecasts are striking. By 2040, the world's power-generating capac- ity mix will have transformed from today's system composed of two-thirds fossil fuels to one, with 56 per cent from zero emission energy sources.Renewables will command just under 60 per cent of the 9,786GW of new gen- erating capacity installed over the next 25 years and two thirds of the $12.2 tril- lion of investment. The cost of solar power has decl"

The need for secure access to clean drinking water is a major issue around the world. A United Nations report published in March showed that demand for water will keep increasing to the point where, if we fail to tackle this problem, the planet may only be able to supply 60 percent of its needs by 2030.""The UAE is well-positioned to take on this task, being host to both the global headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency, Irena, and the World Future Energy Summit, which provides a platform to discuss ideas and issues related to sustainability. Last month, four Masdar City-based energy companies, Abengoa, Suez Environment, Sidem/Veolia and Trevi Systems, started operating experimental, small-scale, environmentally-friendly desalination plants at Masdar's Al Ghantoot facility.And this month, Masdar launched a groundbreaking pilot seawater desalination programme that promises to significantly reduce the amount of energy used in the process.""Building on these initiatives in partnership with other advanced countries will help establish the UAE as a leading centre for know-how in this area. Masdar will work closely with its global collaborators on a range of issues relating to sustainability and clean water. This will enable an exchange of ideas and technologies that will boost local research and development, and help find innovative solutions to the global problem of water security.""New technologies such as solar desalination and geothermal desalination will cost large sums to develop, but the need is critical.

If the watchword in our industry leading up to COP21 in Paris was 'commitment', with the historic climate accord now reached, the next phase will be all about £ction'. This project is a concrete example of action - providing energy security while offsetting carbon emissions and diesel use,"" said Dr Ahmad Belhoul, CEO of Masdar.""One of the most important issues for our region is securing a sustainable energy future. Finding solutions is critical to our continued economic and social development. This is a historic day for the Middle East as the Tafila Wind farm shows the region is committed to expanding access to new forms of clean energy. Masdar is proud to have been a key partner in the Tafila project,"" he added.Jordan has long relied on fuel imports, especially diesel, to electrify the country's homes and businesses as the nation lacks sufficient domestic energy supplies. The Tafila Wind Farm puts Jordan firmly on the renewable energy map and will help diversify the country's energy portfolio. It will account for almost ten per cent of Jordan's renewable energy target for 2020. The 117 megawatt installation, which will provide three per cent of the Kingdom's total energy needs, will create enough electricity to power 83,000 homes while reducing the country's emissions by 235,000 tonnes annually.With Jordan's domestic electricity demands estimated to grow five per cent annually through 2020, the Tafila Wind Farm is critical to the production of new sources of energy to prevent future shortfalls while doing displacing future greenhouse gas emissions. Located 183 kilometres south of Jordan's capital, Amman, the farm is the first wind power project to be developed under Jordan's 2010 Renewable and Energy Efficiency Law. Its 38 turbines have been fully commissioned and are projected to generate 400 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually.""Jordan's commitment to renewable energy proves that the Middle East is poised for a new era in investment and economic development,"" added Belhoul. ""Masdar's investments in new infrastructure projects like Tafila, as well as our global portfolio of wind projects including the London Array and Dudgeon, will benefit both companies and citizens throughout the region and around the world. Masdar is always evaluating new projects of this scope and scale to help the economies of the Middle East become more diversified and resilient.""With the World Energy Council projecting energy consumption in the Middle East and North Africa region to soar by as much as 114 per cent by 2050, it is incumbent upon countries to deploy new sources of energy in order to meet future demand. Renewables can complement current and future hydrocarbon supplies while also reducing nations' exposure to energy price volatility.In striving to reach its renewable energy target, Jordan implemented a feed-in tariff to provide investors market stability, price certainty and attract businesses that are considering projects in the Middle East region. A feed-in tariff guarantees a universal tariff for renewable power producers and encourages investors and contractors to commit to long-term power generation contracts. Often viewed by energy analysts as the quickest path towards accelerating renewable energy deployment, the feed-in tariff in Jordan is the first such scheme within the Middle East and North Africa region. The Jordanian government continues to highlight the importance of these projects not only in terms of providing jobs, but also for accelerating progress on its national development plan, Jordan Vision 2025, which was announced last May.Masdar is Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company which works to advance the development, commercialisation and deployment of clean energy technologies and solutions. The company serves as a link between today's fossil fuel economy and the energy economy of the future. Wholly owned by the Mubadala Development Company PJSC, the strategic investment company of the Government of Abu Dhabi, Masdar is dedicated to the United Arab Emirates' long-term vision for the future of energy and water.\l"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE182","Top four survival tips in times of low oil prices","January 25, 2016 Monday","ArabianOilandGas.com","With oil prices plummeting to below $30 dollars a barrel for the second time this week, here are fourmain areas business leaders in the oil and gas sector need to master if they want to survive the storm.Growth ManagementIdentify and post-pone projects with a high degree of uncertainty. Be especially ruthless with any at the early stages of development which can be killed without much fuss.Seek partners to share in the risk \- and of course, reward, of projects. For example, through part-sale of operating interest in new discoveries.If you can, explore opportunistic growth via acquisition in areas with room for consolidation, for example oilfield services. There is no reason that the current environment should lead toe a growth paralysis mindset. There could be valuable growth opportunities right now, for example via M&A or by continuing investment in nationally important, high-profile projects with longer-term value.Cost ManagementDo not throw out the baby with the bath-water. Concentrate your asset sales on those not central to long-term strategy as much as possible. Organisations with a strong core focus are always better prepared in times of extreme stress or volatility.Where redundancies are inevitable, manage them carefully to account for skills-gap impact, and ensure readiness for future growth when the oil price rebounds.Re-negotiate discounts with contractors to manage service costs and on-going expenditure. There could be room here as many suppliers may prefer lower margins to idle machinery in the challenging times we are currently experiencing.Funding Management.In the near term it can often all be about survival but do not lose sight of a credible growth story for the longer-term. To give your organisation the best chance of attracting funding, ensure the security of your current income stream, even if it is reduced. That stability is key to ensuring there is a consistent stream if income.It is important to model the impact of rising interest rates on sourcing bank and debt funding. Seek a realistic picture as oil prices cannot be modelled on a safe, upward trajectory to pay for higher rates with future income as they have been in the past.As minimising risk and exposure becomes critical, explore non-debt options for funding. For example, with specialist equity investors who play exclusively in the oil and gas sector. In short, private equity funds are going to be your friends.Managing externalitiesYour organisation should aspire to a clear and respected voice on key sector issues such as the advocating role of government, whether via regulations and global transparency frameworks, or tax incentives to support reduced revenues.On a similar note, the inevitable short-term fire-fighting should not come at the expense of the long view. You should also be looking at on-going evaluation of strategic issues such as climate change policy (COP 21), and its implications in the near and longer term.The above findings have been extracted from a recent report by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).\l"

The CFS is an intergovernmental body that serves as a forum for the review of food security and nutrition policies.Both Mr. Da Silva and Mr. Le Foll urged countries to reach an agreement on how to combat climate change ahead of the upcoming UN conference in Paris, known informally as COP 21, where global leaders and international organizations will meet to reach consensus on a historic climate change accord.The FAO Director-General hailed the international community's recent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes the eradication of hunger and extreme poverty. He emphasized that, in order to achieve these goals, agriculture and food systems that are more productive and adapted to climate change are needed.""We can end extreme poverty and hunger by 2030,"" said Mr. Da Silva. ""We know what works and we have the tools for it, but we know climate change threatens to derail our efforts.

The conference is being held in Paris between November 30 and December 11 of this year.""Hydrogen is the energy of the future,"" says Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, eyeing a market of no less than one trillion yen (7.5 billion euros) annually from the hydrogen economy by 2030. Japan sees a great opportunity to promote this innovative technology during the Olympic Games in Tokyo coming in 2020.The project has gained importance after the disaster at Fukushima, which deprived the country of all nuclear power on the archipelago for two years.Since the program inception in 2009, Japan has equipped more than 100,000 homes with fuel cells powered by hydrogen. Utilizing a device the size a refrigerator at each house to generate electricity. An energy farm (as the Japanese say an ene-farm unit) pumps natural gas from a local utility into a fuel cell, which uses a processor to extract the hydrogen and mix it with oxygen from the ambient air. The reaction produces enough power to cover about half the energy demand for an average family. The byproduct is excess heat that supplies a home with hot water. Japan's objective is to equip 1.4 million households by 2020 and 5.3 million in 2030 with these fuel cells.Costs may prove dissuasive to the achievement of Japan's goals. Despite government subsidies and the support from companies like Panasonic and Toshiba, these systems remain expensive - costing two million yen (Pound 15,000 euros) each. However, it should be noted that most new energy sources such as wind power and solar were subsidized at their early stages.In the automotive sector, Japan is leading Germany and the United States, thanks to the launch, in late 2014, of the ""Mirai"" vehicle (meaning future in Japanese), by Toyota which is the first production car in the world powered by hydrogen. The Mirai's fuel cell stack combines outside oxygen with hydrogen taken from its two on-board tanks to produce electricity, which in turn is stored in a battery to power a single, 152bhp (brake horsepower) electric motor. This in turn drives the front wheels through a fixed-ratio transmission. The only waste product at the tailpipe is water.Despite the hefty price tag (more than 60,000 euros), there is demand. Production is starting with 700 vehicles this year. The advantages are zero CO2 emissions and driving autonomy (a range of 502 kilometers) similar to that of a car with a gasol"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE198","News anytime, anywhere","March 14, 2016","Broadcast Pro Middle East","Using a new generation of mobile IP transmitters, Sky News Arabia's\~field reporters now capture and stream live, broadcast-quality video from any location on earth. Dave Mace, Head of Projects and Future Technology for Sky News Arabia, shares more details with BroadcastPro MEAn IP video revolution is sweeping the world of remote electronic newsgathering (ENG) and satellite newsgathering (SNG). With competition heating up among news organisations around the world, the ability to deliver live, broadcast-quality video of a breaking story \- when and where it happens \- has become paramount to the success of any 24-hour news operation.Abu Dhabi-based broadcaster Sky News Arabia, which has a forward-thinking technology team and extensive reach across Europe, Africa and the Middle East with an ever-increasing network of OTT and IPTV distributors across the globe, says that adopting IP video transmission solutions right from its launch in 2012 has helped empower its journalists to break stories as they happen, even from the most remote locations in the world.""Long ago, ENG/SNG technicians had limited choices for getting a video feed out of a remote site: satellite or microwave,"" explains Dave Mace, Head of Projects and Future Technology for Sky News Arabia.""While satellite and microwave technologies may give an operator control over the connection and can offer signal capacity required for high-bit-rate video, they are usually expensive to acquire, staff and maintain, and it's not always practical to deploy an ENG or SNG truck \- especially if the news is breaking in a highly remote and rugged location lacking in accessibility and satellite or network coverage.""More recently, professional IP video acquisition tools have changed the rules for ENG and SNG. Using the latest generation of highly portable and rugged mobile IP transmitters, field reporters are now able to capture and stream live, broadcast-quality video from virtually any location on the planet. Another ENG breakthrough is the emergence of Ka-band and BGAN IP-over-satellite systems that can acquire live HD video at significantly lower cost, with greater portability, than Ku-band SNG terminals.""With the launch of SNA in 2012, we had a prime opportunity to put these new technologies into practice. At the time, we adopted what was then considered the state-of-the-art transmitter, a product that enabled us to drastically extend our newsgathering reach to areas that couldn't be reached by the vehicles,"" explains Mace.""As time went on and technology progressed, however, the video quality from these systems were not able to meet our standards. Any degradation in bandwidth or satellite coverage and we were unable to sustain a consistent picture,"" he explains.After evaluating a number of vendors late last year, SNA chose Dejero to expand its IP transmission capabilities. ""The Dejero technology met our requirements in several key ways, the most significant being its outstanding picture quality and reliability,"" explains Mace.""Dejero transmitters offer intelligent bonding capabilities that enable them to manage and bond a range of wireless connections, including 3G/4G/LTE, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and even microwave and satellite. This means we're able to deliver optimal picture quality with low latency over multiple IP networks, even in areas with extremely limited bandwidth.""To begin, SNA deployed two LIVE+ mobile transmitters into the field to see how they performed and how engineers and reporters took to them.""The teams instantly loved them, so we began rolling out more units to fixed bureaus in Jeddah and Kuwait City. After the initial success with these previous-generation units, we've now added several new-generation LIVE+ GoBox transmitters by Dejero. Specifically designed for newsgathering teams and video content contributors on the move, the rugged and portable LIVE+ GoBox enables our mobile journalists to broadcast live from virtually anywhere or record HD video for later broadcast.""Reporters can grab a LIVE+ GoBox and head to the scene to capture and transmit live reports, or record up to 40 hours of HD video, and field camera operators can also use the system for DTL positioning and for sending rushes from the field. The LIVE+ GoBox is extremely easy to set up and use, with one-button start-up, automatic input and format detection, and a simple, intuitive interface with confidence monitoring. The built-in intelligence continuously adapts the systems to network conditions for top video quality.""To further extend its field newsgathering capabilities, SNA has also deployed several camera kits outfitted with a Mac laptop and an iPhone running Dejero's mobile contribution software LIVE+ NewsBook and LIVE+ Mobile App.""In concert with a BGAN terminal or one of our SNG flyaway kits, LIVE+ NewsBook turns the Mac into a highly versatile go-anywhere video uplink solution for transmitting live HD or SD video feeds, as well as recorded and edited files, back to the broadcast facility in Abu Dhabi. Also, we've issued iPhones running the LIVE+ Mobile App to every SNA reporter and field engineer, as well as many other employees \- giving about 40 personnel the ability to use their iPhones' built-in cameras and cellular and Wi-Fi connections to instantly transmit live video,"" explains Mace.He adds that the NewsBook and Mobile App software applications perfectly illustrate the reach of IP video transmission technology.""In effect, we've created a news force of at least 100 people who can cover stories as they break, at any time and from anywhere the staff members happen to be. For big stories, they can use their phones to go live until the SNG vehicles and additional reporters arrive.""Although there are still other solutions in the SNA environment, Mace explains that more than 40% of the network's field newsgathering is now accomplished with Dejero transmitters. Two recent high-profile stories covered with the GoBox transmitters were the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference (Cop21) and the November terrorist attacks in Paris.""The terrorist attack, in particular, was a rapidly evolving story that required our reporters to be extremely nimble and reach areas that even our smaller trucks equipped with flyaways couldn't access. With the GoBox transmitters, we were able to broadcast critical information live, as it happened,"" he explains.Mace calls SNA's IP newsgathering capabilities ""a point of pride"".

Under the five-year contracts (with Gasco), we will provide essential maintenance and shutdown services for a plant at Abu Dhabi\' s Habshan and Bab complex, one of the world\' s largest gas processing complexes, Chris Behan, general manager UAE of Doosan Babcock, tells Gulf Construction.This contract is currently in the mobilisation stage prior to the site services commencing in the first quarter of 2016.In addition, Doosan Babcock has an eight-year maintenance contract with Tapco for technical support, parts, equipment, repair and maintenance, including outages on static equipment. The agreement will ensure the optimum performance of six thermal boiler units, five heat recovery steam generators (HRSG), 13 multi-stage flashing (MSF) water desalination units and 12 potable water tanks.The project team is currently executing the work scope related to the Winter Outages 2015/16.Behan says 2015 was an excellent year for the company in the Middle East. Besides winning major contracts, Doosan Babcock also opened a new office in the region. We celebrated the official opening of our Mena Engineering Consultancy Hub in Abu Dhabi in November, with a full-day technical seminar for customers and potential customers. We\' ve also expanded our presence in the Middle East from 10 to over 100 employees, he says.  As operators in industries such as oil and gas continue to face pressure to maximise operational cost and efficiency, we\' re confident that 2016 will be a strong year for us in the Middle East. Behan ... excellent year.Doosan BabcockPart of Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction of South Korea, Doosan Babcock traces its origins back to 1891 when it was first established as Babcock and Wilcox in Glasgow, UK.The company set up its Middle East and North Africa (Mena) operations in 2013 and the opening of its Mena Engineering Consultancy Hub in Abu Dhabi last November was another milestone in its history in the region. The new facility is designed to provide a range of specialist engineering services to help customers in the power, water, oil and gas, petrochemical and industrial sectors maintain and extend the life of their plant.Doosan Babcock\' s technologies and services today serve a range of sectors, including oil, gas and petrochemical, pharmaceutical, nuclear and thermal power, renewable energy and maritime.Originally, the company was established as a boiler OEM (original equipment manufacturer), however, with the arrival of nuclear power, from the 1950s onwards, services and technologies for the nuclear power industry began to play an increasingly important role in Doosan Babcock\' s commercial operations \- and continue to do so today.Many of the specialist engineering skills and technologies developed by Doosan Babcock over this period were applicable to a range of industries other than power generation, hence the company\' s move into the North Sea oil and gas sector in the 1980s.More recently, customers in all sectors have increasingly turned their focus to deriving the best operational efficiency and performance out of plant, as well as extending the operating lifetime of existing plant, rather than invest in new infrastructure.For example, many oil and gas assets developed during the boom years of the 1970s and 1980s are still actively producing today, well beyond their intended lifespan, thanks to advances in oil recovery methods. At the same time, pressure to maintain the rate of production is mounting. This means that many oil and gas operators are increasingly looking to extend the life of their plant and increasing the rate of hydrocarbon recovery, according to Behan. This focus on asset integrity management and life extension is prevalent across all the industry sectors served by Doosan Babcock and our technological expertise has meant that we\' ve been able to successfully respond to this with condition assessment and interpretation services, tailored asset lifetime strategies and risk-based programme for safe and compliant plant \- all backed up by our specialist engineering capabilities, he says.He continues:  In the power generation sector, we\' ve also seen the move away from the combustion of fossil fuels, which has continued to gather pace in recent years, as most recently witnessed in the outcome of (the United National conference on climate change held in Paris, France). This is resulting in a greater reliance on other sources of energy, such as nuclear power, renewables and decentralised energy sources, which continues to shape the way Doosan Babcock\' s business is evolving. Doosan Babcock\' s scope of activities is essentially building, maintaining and extending the life of industrial plant for customers around the world, using specialist technologies and engineering expertise. We are also able to draw on the backing of the global Doosan Group, which allows us to deliver a true \' one-stop shop\' package. A recent example of this in action is our LTMA with Tapco to provide essential maintenance and technical support services to the Taweelah B Power and Water Desalination Plant. This allows us to combine our OEM engineering, integrity management and mechanical maintenance expertise. Although the scope of works will be led by Doosan Babcock, technical expertise will also be provided by other members of the multi-disciplinary Doosan Group, including Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction\' s Water Business Group and HRSG specialist Doosan Engineering and Construction, Behan says.Doosan Babcock has significant experience in supporting its clients as their assets age and their condition needs to be carefully managed to improve plant reliability and efficiency. Recently, the company executed the refurbishment of fired heater units whereby its engineers conducted detailed condition assessment of the plant materials, developed complex repair methodologies, and successfully executed the repair and refurbishment on site. This is a fine example of Doosan Babcock\' s unique \' one-stop shop\' service offering, Behan remarks.  Being part of the global Doosan Group gives us a unique competitive edge, as it allows us to offer customers combined OEM engineering, integrity management and mechanical maintenance expertise. We will be looking to leverage this capability further during 2016 and beyond. He also points out that as a global business, Doosan Babcock takes great care of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Our UAE team participates in community days on a regular basis. For example, we recently took part in the \' Water for Workers Programme\' . The team visited several construction sites in Dubai providing some light refreshments to the workers, giving them the chance to take a deserved break in the heat of the day, and emphasising that their efforts are greatly valued by the community, he says.Growth strategyDoosan Babcock has an established business in Qatar and has plans to penetrate the markets in the other GCC and Mena countries between 2016 and 2020. Our growth plans for 2016 onwards are focused on service, sector and geographical expansion in the Mena region, Behan says.  We are focused on growing our offshore oil and gas and nuclear business in the UAE, further growing our engineering capabilities within our Mena hub, and expanding the business further in high-potential Mena countries such as Kuwait. Its customers in the region include Gasco, Tapco, Emirates Steel, petrochemical giants such as BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and INEOS, pharmaceutical clients such as GSK, and power generation/utilities names such as EDF Energy and E.ON. Employing around 4,000 staff, the group\' s turnover in 2014 was \£3534 million ($762 million).\l"

A 500 KW solar PV and water protection plant on the Tarawa atoll of the Republic of Kiribati, will also be officially inaugurated this week. The inaugurations mark the completion of the two solar PV projects co-designed and managed by Masdar in cooperation with the governments of the Pacific island countries of Tuvalu and Kiribati.The projects form part of the UAE's support for economic and social development of Pacific island nations, while also showcasing the viability of sustainable clean energy development models. The projects aim to reduce the Pacific island nations' dependency on imported diesel, freeing up essential financial resources for other developmental projects.The plant located on Funafuti \- the most populated atoll that hosts the capital of the Tuvalu island nation \- was funded by the US$50 million UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund through the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development.The majority of the system is built on a 4 metre-high structure creating 1,840 m2 of shaded public space that is limited on the atoll. In addition, it includes a new workshop-storage facility with 540 m? floor space, as well as further space for office and recreational use. The Funafuti solar and space creation project will not only supply electricity to over 800 homes by yearly generating 783,000 kWh, but will also save 206,000 litres of diesel each year \- bringing about a saving of US$280,000 and a reduction in CO? emissions of 570 tons annuallyThe inauguration in Tuvalu was attended by Dr Mohammed Al Qubaisi, Director of the Energy Affairs Division in the Directorate of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) at the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), and Tuvalu Prime Minister the Honourable Enele Sosene Spoaga, as well as the Governor General the Honourable Otinielu Tauteleimalae Tausi.Dr Ahmad Belhoul, CEO of Masdar, speaking from Abu Dhabi, said: ""These two projects not only demonstrate the UAE and Masdar's commitment to helping Pacific island nations deploy sustainable renewable energy solutions, which play a vital role in driving forward the social and economic development for the people of Tuvalu and Kiribati, but clearly, and equally important, also highlight the ongoing work we are doing to combat climate change through our renewable energy projects.""According to Dr Belhoul, the acceleration of the adoption of renewable energy and reduction of pollution are imperatives to promote climate change mitigation \- and therefore the diversification of the energy mix through deployment of renewable energy is considered vital to this goal.""As a strong supporter of COP 21 as well as the energy-related sustainable development goal adopted by the United Nations, Masdar's efforts to limit the impact of climate change, including our commitment to broaden access to clean energy for a greater number of people, are clearly demonstrated through the delivery of the solar plants of Tuvalu and Kiribati,"" he added.The Honourable Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, said: ""The Solar Space Creation Project could not have come at a better time as the price of fuel has soared in recent years. This project would contribute approximately 40% towards the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation peak demand which could save more than 200,000 litres of diesel fuel per annum, about 8% of the annual fuel consumption of the Fogafale Power Station. The existing total generation capacity equals 1.8 megawatts of which 22% is by the Solar Space Creation Project"".Development of the 500 KW solar and water protection project on Tarawa, Kiribati, was started in December 2014, and completed in August this year. It will officially be inaugurated later this week. The republic, comprising 33 coral atolls, lies in the Central Pacific, and has a population of more than 100,000 \- half of whom live on Tarawa atoll where the capital, South Tarawa, is situated.The plant protects the only aquifer located on the island that has been under threat of contamination due to high levels of human migration to the area as a result of limited living space. The plant features advanced technologies to control output and will annually deliver 855,000 kWh to 860 homes. It will cut back on more than 227,000 litres of diesel, resulting in an approximate saving of US$265,000 which may be repurposed for other developmental areas. The plant will also reduce CO? emissions by 627 tons each year.The Honourable Waysang Kumkee, Minister for Public Works and Utilities of Kiribati, said, ""Sustainable energy is a prerequisite for developmental and economic growth for any society. The renewable energy to be delivered through the solar and water protection plant in Tarawa helps the country overcome not only the constraints of natural fuel resources, but also eases access to large numbers of individuals and families to sustainable electricity provision.""Of the projects being delivered under the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund, several have already been delivered or are currently under construction. The first completed project was the 512 KW solar PV installation in Tonga, while others include the first ever 550 KW wind farm for Samoa, and three micro grid solar plants in Fiji that supply clean energy to some of the nation's outer islands, as well as the solar plants for Tuvalu, Kiribati and Vanuatu. Further projects in the Marshal and Solomon islands, Palau and Nauru are under construction as planned, with yet another project for the Federated States of Micronesia to be signed shortly.\l"

"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE228","UAE takes responsibility to stand with allies very seriously: Yousef Al Otaiba","January 31, 2016 Sunday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","ABU DHABI, 1st February, 2016 (WAM) -- UAE Ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, has made a speech at the Washington DC based Center for Strategic and International Studies, during which he said that the UAE takes responsibility to stand with its allies in the fight against terrorism, laying out a positive agenda for the Middle East and referencing the annual Joint Military Dialogue between the UAE and the US. when officials from both nation's armed forces engaged in discussions around shared challenges and threats.The ambassador described how the UAE is the promise of a new Middle East, a safe haven of stability, opportunity, and tolerance in the most difficult of neighbourhoods, saying, ""The character of our people and of our leadership is deeply rooted in unity at home, compassion for others, and openness in minds, markets, and faith. We are 1 million Emiratis and 8 million foreign nationals representing virtually every country on earth, living and working together peacefully in the region's strongest economy. We in the UAE entirely reject the notion that we are doomed to perpetual conflict in the Middle East. We believe there is enough room, in geography, theology, and economy, for everyone.""But in the fight against extremism, Al Otaiba highlighted how like-minded people and countries, such as the UAE and the US, must meet the immediate challenge of extremism and aggression in the region. ""Daesh is today's most pressing danger and it must be destroyed, but there is also the continuing concern of the Islamic Republic of Iran.""""In our view, Daesh is a creeping cancer that weakens states, increases sectarian tensions, and has been directly responsible for the death, casualties, and displacement of millions of people, most of them Muslims. We are experiencing a wave of Daesh-directed and inspired violent extremism that is rocking the Middle East and reaching deep into Europe, America, and Asia. We have seen the murderous spread of Daesh, from a concert hall in Paris to a social service centre in San Bernardino, in Mali and Egypt, Beirut and Baghdad, and, most recently, in Jakarta and Istanbul. The UAE's men and women in uniform have been in this fight for years. We are in it today, and we are prepared to do more.""The UAE has taken a lead in setting up the Hedayah Centre in Abu Dhabi. Hedayah equips communities and governments with the tools to counter violent extremism and terrorist recruitment. Their experts have trained imams, worked in schools, and assisted officials in many countries to develop community-based counter-radicalisation programmes.Another new initiative is the Sawab Centre, established by the UAE and the US in July 2015. Experts from Sawab, which means ""doing the right thing"" or being on the ""right path,"" work side by side to counter extremist propaganda on social media, in both Arabic and English. One recent Sawab campaign highlighted the brutal stories of what happens to Daesh defectors, while another provided first-hand stories of women and girls who had escaped from the self-described Caliphate.""Let's be clear,"" the ambassador continued, ""The war against Daesh is not a war against Islam. On the contrary, it is a battle to save Islam from a death cult that is hijacking an entire religion to sell an ideology of hate and murder, and in this struggle of ideas, it must be Muslims who lead. That's why we, as proud Muslims, are committed to charting an alternative way forward. Muslim countries, led by Saudi Arabia, have formed a new coalition to coordinate across all areas of counter-extremism. The overwhelming opposition to Daesh in the Muslim world leaves no doubt as to who is hijacking our religion, and defeating their ideology will take more than force alone. This brings us to the third, and most enduring, front in the fight. To win, it is not enough to only describe what we are against, we must also define what we are for.""The UAE, he said, is taking the lead to offer a new vision for young Muslims and the region, an alternative ideology, unafraid of modernity, and looking to the future. It's a path guided by a phrase oft-repeated by Muslims all around the world: ""In the name of God, the most merciful and most compassionate."" Respect, inclusion, peace; these are the true tenets of Islam. Ours is an Islam that empowers women, embraces others, encourages innovation, and welcomes global engagement.""The ambassador drew attention to the UAE's commitment to openness and tolerance, referring to the appointment of Dr. Amal Al Qubaisi as president of the UAE's Federal National Council, the first woman in the region to lead a national assembly, or the November meeting of the Muslim Council of Elders. Established and supported by Emirati leaders, the council is an international body of Islam's most prominent, forward-thinking scholars that is giving greater voice to moderate Islam. It is modernising the way Islam is taught in schools, developing new training programs for imams, and updating Quranic commentaries.The UAE, he said, is building a knowledge economy anchored by world-class academic institutions. ""New York University Abu Dhabi is bringing together the brightest students from around the world. From 400 graduates to date, NYU Abu Dhabi has already produced six Rhodes scholars. I'm not a betting man, but I'm pretty sure that none of these 400 will be joining Daesh.""The ambassador also spoke about a future less reliant on fossil fuels.""We are building an economic engine for the entire region, a place where the free flow of goods, services, people, investment, and ideas lifts the entire Middle East and links it to Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. And in doing so, we are already planning for a future that is less dependent on oil. We will have a sustainable post-hydrocarbon economy \- driven by innovation, human capital, rule of law, and open trade."" At the COP21These initiatives, he said, will produce the types of opportunities that people in the region dream of: sapping the energy from extremist groups and encouraging children to pick up books instead of guns.""We hope that a similar vision for the future is shared by our Iranian neighbours. Unlike Daesh, Iran has a choice. In the words of [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger, Iran can be either a state or a revolution."" Al Otaiba went on to applaud President Obama and Secretary John Kerry for their leadership to address the threat of Iran's nuclear weapons programme. ""We are hopeful that Iran will seize this historic opening with a new commitment to regional stability and respect for the sovereignty of other nations. In the UAE, this feeling is very real because no country has more to gain from more peaceful and productive ties with Iran than we do. Our coasts are less than 21 miles apart, we have significant trade ties, and we see enormous opportunities for greater economic, energy, and cultural links."" The ambassador then paraphrased President Obama's first inaugural address, saying, ""We are ready to extend a hand if Iran is willing to unclench its fist,""But, he continued, ""Unfortunately, that hand is still very much clenched. Since the signing of the nuclear deal, we have seen nothing but more Iranian aggression in the region. In late December, Iran fired unguided rockets dangerously close to a US aircraft carrier. Last October and again in November, Iran performed ballistic missile tests in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1929."" Al Otaiba said that Iran's continued interference across the region can be seen from Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. ""Last August, Yemeni authorities intercepted a shipment from Iran destined for Marib that contained military-use communications equipment accompanied by pamphlets in Farsi. In September, coalition forces intercepted an Iranian freighter in the Arabian Sea carrying anti-tank missiles and launching units, and in late October, surveillance photographs tracked speed boats in the Red Sea smuggling weapons to the Houthis in Yemen.""These incidents, along with the destruction of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Tehran, demonstrate that in Iran, Al Otaiba said, old habits die hard. ""In 1971, just before the UAE declared its independence, Iran seized three strategic Emirati islands in the middle of the Arabian Gulf. The Iranian occupation continues to this day. Iran has consistently refused UAE offers to settle the issue through direct negotiations or at The International Court of Justice."" Over the past decades, the UAE and other GCC countries have built a constructive relationship with the United States, and the US continues to identify Iran as the leading international state sponsor of terror. ""In Palestine, in Iraq, and in almost every country in the region, Iran is funding, arming, and enabling radical, violent, and subversive cells. And closer to home here in Washington, it was just a few years ago that Iran plotted to assassinate my friend, Adel Al Jubeir."" Al-Jubeir was the Saudi Arabian envoy in Washington at that time, and is now Saudi Foreign minister.""And let's not forget that Iran orchestrated countless terrorist attacks that killed Americans, at the marine barracks in Beirut, at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and in Iraq, where they supplied the IEDs that killed or maimed thousands of American soldiers.""These facts, the ambassador continued, are not lost on the global community and certainly not among Muslims. Last week, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OIC, voted to denounce Iran's interference in the internal affairs of other states.""Just as we have much to gain from increased exchanges with Iran, we also have much to lose in the face of continued Iranian aggression. Daesh may be a more immediate threat and its barbaric methods are certainly more headl"
"COP21","UAE","COP21_UAE229","Industry players generate energy","March 13, 2016 Sunday","ArabianOilandGas.com","Falling oil prices are never far from the top of the agenda, especially at an event attended by Oil Ministers from around the GCC, company owners and senior energy executives. In total, the 7th Gulf Intelligence UAE Energy Forum brought together over 250 energy stakeholders to Abu Dhabi to deliberate on crucial issues and events impacting the oil and gas industry in the Middle East.Held under the patronage of HE Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy, the event was also attended by Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and OPEC President, to name two of the high-profile dignitaries who made some vital comments about the state of affairs in the energy industry. Making an inaugural address to the event on behalf of Mazrouei (who came in later in the day), Dr. Matar Al Neyadi, Undersecretary in the UAE Ministry of Energy said,  2016 will be in an interesting year for the UAE. The nation has strong economic fundamentals. In his speech, Neyadi reiterated the fact that the UAE became the first country in the GCC last year to do away with fuel subsidies, a major economic reform policy. The UAE in August last year decided to lift subsidies on fuel prices, by making them \' market-linked\' . Chaired by Neyadi, the Fuel Price Committee \- which includes members including the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance, CEO of ADNOC Distribution, and CEO of Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), has been announcing fuel prices on the 28th of each month (for the following month).[[banner]]As the forum proceeded, various other energy industry heavyweights took to the stage to address the gathering or to participate in panel discussions, which were moderated by senior partners from Gulf Intelligence, as well as celebrity CNN anchor John Defterios. Intermittently, to keep the audience engaged, multiple poll questions on various industry trends and events were posed, with voters given 10 seconds to choose their answers.Snap polls mirror public opinionThe first major question, quite aptly, that was posed to the audience was the way ahead for global crude oil prices. A majority - 51% - of respondents voted that oil prices are unlikely to rise above an average of $40 per barrel this year, putting additional pressure on governments and energy companies to cut their capital costs further. While 28% voted saying prices would remain around $30 a barrel, another 13% said prices could settle at $50 a barrel. The remaining 3% turned out to be an optimistic lot as they felt oil prices could recover to above $60 a barrel.In retrospect, 41% of respondents expected oil prices to average $60/barrel in 2015 during the same GI Industry Survey in January last year. Contrastingly enough, oil prices continue to fall to new lows \- presently trading at below $30 a barrel, as OPEC\' s policy to maintain market share \- a move that has contributed to falling oil prices \- has not weakened output from non-OPEC producers, including US shale oil producers. The oversupply is set to continue in 2016, it is wide believed.Lower oil prices have taken a hefty toll on governments whose budgets are heavily supported by energy revenues, including OPEC members. Oil and gas companies are also slashing expenditure and increasing staff redundancies in the GCC and beyond. Nearly 45% of respondents to another poll question on the topic said that the restrained budgets in the Gulf will be the top macroeconomic factor affecting the oil and gas sector in 2016, followed closely by China\' s economic weakness (38%). The weakening economies in the majority of BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and the US\' decision to increase interest rates will not have as much of an impact, with only 10% and 8%, respectively.To another burning question on climate change and global warming, a strong majority (71%) said that oil producers and companies will revise down their reported recoverable reserves of fossil fuels following an agreement at the COP 21 climate change meeting in Paris last December to limit global warming to below 2\'b0C and strive to keep temperatures at 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels.[[page-break]]OPEC emergency meetingMember states of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) may decide to gather for an emergency meeting in March, if oil prices do not improve, the cartel\' s president has said.  The oil prices are moving lower faster than the oil barrels can come off the market, Kachikwu told Defterios during an interview at the forum. We (OPEC) may hold an emergency meeting towards the end of the first quarter (end of February or March) if prices remain at current levels, Kachikwu added. He revealed that \' a couple\' of member states had requested for such a meeting, ahead of the group\' s scheduled meeting on June 2,  to discuss and reconsider strategy , without naming the two countries.Kachikwu told the audience that Saudi Arabia has never held the position that it does not want to talk.  In fact, it was very supportive of a meeting before June, at the time when we held the December meeting, if a consensus calls for it. OPEC decided to keep the output level unchanged at their meeting on December 4 in Vienna. Oil prices tumbled by more than 60% since 2014 due to overproduction and weak demand; from a peak of $115 per barrel in June 2014, prices have currently tumbled below $30 per barrel.[[banner]]Later during the forum when Defterios invited both the UAE and Nigerian oil ministers for a candid interview session, Mazrouei seemed hesitant to nod to such a proposal of an OPEC emergency meeting.  There is a mechanism to call for an Opec meeting. Anyone can ask the Secretary General putting the reasons to have the meeting. What are we going to agree is that we need to be convinced. I am not convinced that Opec solely, unilaterally can change the strategy just because we have seen the low in the market, he said.He reiterated that OPEC was not \' solely responsible\' for the global oversupply of oil, adding that the UAE has no plans to increase production this year. He said that the OPEC strategy to defend market share is working.  We have seen reduction in the yearly gradual increase in production from non-OPEC nations. It\' s working for the customers, with the customers allowing the market to balance itself. The strategy of OPEC is to allow the market share...fair market share. Let the people compete and price be the judge. Mazrouei said that there is going to be a correction before the end of 2016 in oil prices:  We are going to see a correction. The market fundamental tells us this. The increase in demand at the end of 2015 was higher. The market will solve it. That is the only fair assessment of the current situation. The first six months going to be tough. It will be gradual. We will get out of the mess. We tried in OPEC to help as much as we can. Mazrouei further said that no projects will be cancelled due to drop in oil prices, although there is a concerted effort to reduce costs.  This is the trend all producers are doing. We are seeing good results. We are reducing the costs but not cancelling projects, he said.[[page-break]]On Iranian oil entering the market, he said all OPEC members including Iran have the right to increase their production.  We are not going to restrict anyone from producing. There is no such mechanism. It took eight years for the UAE to increase the capacity and cost $75bn. It takes lot of time to conduct a project and come up with a mechanism. That\' s our experience. Good luck if anyone can do it in six months.

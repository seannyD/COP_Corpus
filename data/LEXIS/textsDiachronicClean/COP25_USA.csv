We have a track record of which all Australians can be proud: we have beaten our first Kyoto target and are on track to overachieve on our 2020 target by 411 Mt CO2-e. Australia's emissions have also fallen to the lowest level since 2015-16 and are lower than when the Coalition came into Government in 2013, despite huge growth in emissions-intensive exports like LNG. These exports are lowering global emissions by up to 159 Mt CO2-e a year by displacing more emissions-intensive fuels overseas. The Government's Climate Solutions Package also maps out, to the last tonne, how we will achieve our 2030 Paris target more than a decade ahead of time. By working with our international partners and taking strong domestic action, the Australian Government will continue to deliver reliable, affordable energy and address the challenges of climate change while ensuring a strong economy.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA4","ICC is Taking a Clear Message to COP25: We Need More Ambitious Climate Action Now","November 27, 2019 Wednesday 7:58 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news: The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) will join world leaders at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) to advocate for higher climate ambition. As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Focal Point for Business and Industry, ICC will be at COP25 in Madrid from 2-13 December as the official voice of business throughout the negotiations. Working with policymakers, business leaders and all stakeholders to ICC will advocate for policy frameworks that address the urgent need to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 C and transition to an inclusive and sustainable net-zero emissions future. Here's how ICC will mobilise business leaders at COP25 in Madrid: BINGO Briefings ICC will host daily business and industry briefings, known as BINGO Briefings, every day of the negotiations throughout COP25 . All business professionals attending COP25 are welcome to attend. Each briefing will be chaired by a business representative and delegates will have the opportunity to ask questions about the negotiation process, or exchange information from sessions that they were unable to attend in person. These daily briefings will occur every day from 9:00-10:00 (except Sundays). BINGO Day ICC will host the official annual COP25 Business and Industry Day (BINGO Day) on 6 December 2019 from 13:15-18:30. In collaboration with the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), with the support of the BNP Paribas Foundation and the World Bank Group, BINGO Day will feature a high-level opening session with three consecutive panel sessions discussing how the private and public sectors can move beyond business as usual and lead for a net zero future. Key stakeholders including climate change champions, government representatives, economists and scientists, as well as business leaders, will consider the main challenges and opportunities as we approach the critical 2020 climate milestone. Chambers Climate Coalition In June, ICC launched the Chambers Climate Coalition, an unprecedented mobilisation of local business leaders who have committed to take action aligned with the Paris Agreement and the latest climate science. At the UN Climate Action Summit in September, ICC Secretary General, John W.H. Denton AO announced that over 2,100 chambers of commerce and local business leaders had joined the coalition. ICC will highlight the success of the Chambers Climate Coalition at COP 25 to encourage as many local business leaders as possible to join this movement in the lead up to COP26 in Glasgow next year, and amplify the clear call to action from business to policymakers that governments must enhance climate ambition and action. NDC Partnership Roundtable As the only private sector member of the NDC Partnership, ICC will also be teaming up with the NDC Partnership to host a workshop to explore how business can work with government to develop, implement and review country NDCs. The event entitled How Can Business Support Governments on their Journey to Enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions? will be held on 12 December 2019 from 15:00-16:00 in the NDC Partnership Pavilion. At this year's United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), ICC launched a consultation series to discuss the alignment of trade and climate policies. The first consultation took place on the sidelines of UNGA with Jim Bacchus, author of The Willing World: Shaping and Sharing a Sustainable Global Prosperity and chairman of the ICC Commission on Trade and Investment Policy, who presented the case for a WTO climate waiver, as well as the necessary steps to put such a waiver in place. As part of the second consultation, Genevieve Pons, Brussels Director of the Jacques Delors Institute, led a discussion on the applicability of carbon clubs, as a mechanism for advancing climate and trade policies. This week, ICC will host Rodolfo Lacy, Director for the Environment Directorate at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for a discussion on whether border adjustment taxes (BAT) can promote trade and climate policies. ICC will host the fourth and final trade and climate consultation on carbon pricing at COP 25 . So far, these consultations have offered business leaders, policymakers and academics a forum for engagement and detailed discussions on breaking down existing barriers between the trade and climate policy frameworks. Business for Nature In 2020, world leaders have a unique opportunity to forge international agreements to reverse nature loss as they did for climate in the 2015 Paris Agreement. ICC is one of the partners of Business for Nature and we invite all business leaders to participate in a number of events to learn more about what your business can do to help contribute to nature protection, restoration and sustainability.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA5","Canada Advanced Climate Action and Remains Committed to Ambitious Global Action as United Nations Climate Change Conference Concludes","December 17, 2019 Tuesday 8:41 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Canadian Environment and Climate Change Canada issued the following news release: Climate change is the defining issue of our time, and the Government of Canada is taking leadership to tackle it. That means doing the important work at home to cut pollution and create good jobs for Canadians. It also means working with international partners to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation. Over the past two weeks, Canada's strong team of negotiators and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, showed leadership on climate action at COP25 and played an active role in negotiations, including on the international rules on carbon markets, under the Paris Agreement (also known as Article 6). While Canada is pleased to see increased ambition and the launch of a new dialogue on oceans and climate in the decision, the negotiations on international markets will continue next year, in the hopes of reaching an ambitious resolution at COP26 in Glasgow. Indigenous Peoples--particularly those in isolated or northern communities--are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Canada called for rules to promote and protect human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples in activities that would occur under Article 6. We also actively promoted rules for the long-term environmental integrity of carbon markets. While a consensus was not reached on Article 6 in Madrid, discussions will continue into next year's negotiations. Canada remains determined to push for ambitious climate action and will participate in further negotiations to define the rules that will mobilize private-sector investment toward the global transition to a low-carbon economy. While at COP25 The Minister met with international counterparts, Indigenous leaders, young people, environmental organizations, and industry leaders. At a meeting with European Union Commissioner Frans Timmermans, he discussed the strong environmental partnership between Canada and the EU and their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Minister Wilkinson met with fellow Canadian Mark Carney and congratulated him on his new position as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. He also met with German Minister Svenja Schulze, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and other international counterparts and climate leaders, including Small Island Developing States, to continue to strengthen Canada's relationships on climate action. Canadian-led initiatives grew at COP25 , as Minister Wilkinson welcomed new endorsees of the Ocean Plastics Charter and new members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The Minister also announced investments through the World Bank to help developing countries design and implement carbon pricing in ways that will work for them. In Canada and across the world, work to phase out coal-power generation goes hand in hand with work to ensure the transition is a fair one for affected communities and people. While at COP25 , Minister Wilkinson participated in a Just Transition event--including New Zealand, Germany, Spain, and Scotland--led by the International Trade Union Confederation and the Canadian Labour Congress. Global momentum toward climate action continues to accelerate as more citizens advocate for bold climate solutions. Canada is working to ensure that the implementation of the Paris Agreement will cut emissions and create a clean and prosperous future for everyone. Canada was proud to be among the leaders who were advocating for important climate commitments that will reduce pollution, implement nature-based solutions, and create more jobs by accelerating clean growth. Quotes ""Science tells us--and our citizens have told us--that we need to not only meet our Paris target but exceed it. Canada came to COP25 in the spirit of compromise and commitment to action. While there were some successes, we are disappointed that the world was not able to agree on the rules for the international carbon markets that would help us all raise our ambition in Madrid. Canada will keep working with our global partners to land on effective rules for international markets at next year's COP. I am proud of Canada's contribution to the work at COP25 , including our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada will continue to work towards meeting our Paris Agreement commitments at home and providing support to developing countries as they reduce emissions and adapt to the consequences of climate change."" - Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts  While at COP25 , the number of endorsees of the Ocean Plastics Charter reached 85, with the addition of Chile; Rwanda; Finland; and The Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra. Endorsees commit to moving toward a more resource-efficient and sustainable approach to the management of plastics.  Six new members joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, committing to accelerating the phase-out of traditional coal power. The Alliance has grown to 97 countries, regional governments, businesses, and other organizations, since Canada and the United Kingdom launched it at COP23, in 2017.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA6","NEW DATES AGREED FOR COP26 UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","May 28, 2020 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UK Government: The COP26 UN climate conference will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021 in Glasgow. From: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and The Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP The Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), with the UK and its Italian partners, agreed today new dates for the COP26 UN climate conference, which will now take place between 1 and 12 November 2021 in Glasgow. The agreement followed consultation with UNFCCC members, delivery partners and the international climate community. The conference was originally set to take place in November 2020, but had been postponed due to COVID-19. In the run up to November 2021, the UK as hosts will continue to work with all involved to increase climate action, build resilience and lower emissions. The new date will also allow the UK and our Italian partners to harness our incoming G7 and G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition. The decision on the new date comes as the UK Government announces that over 25 experts in multiple global sectors will be advising the COP26 Presidency. The Friends of COP bring expertise from countries across six continents, including France, Barbados, Chad, Australia, India and Peru. They will advise the UK Government and inspire action from their sectors ahead of the conference. The Friends of COP include Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General on Climate Action, Eric Garcetti, Mayor of Los Angeles and Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation. COP26 President and Secretary of State for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Alok Sharma, said: While we rightly focus on fighting the immediate crisis of the Coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the huge challenges of climate change. With the new dates for COP26 now agreed we are working with our international partners on an ambitious roadmap for global climate action between now and November 2021. The steps we take to rebuild our economies will have a profound impact on our societies' future sustainability, resilience and wellbeing and COP26 can be a moment where the world unites behind a clean resilient recovery. Everyone will need to raise their ambitions to tackle climate change and the expertise of the Friends of COP will be important in helping boost climate action across the globe. Italian Minister for the Environment, Land and Sea Protection, Sergio Costa, said: I am glad that consultations with Parties have made it possible to collectively and quickly agree new dates for COP26. The new dates mean the conference will be at a time when the Covid-19 tragedy will be behind us and we will be able to ensure inclusiveness, for us a fundamental prerequisite for an ambitious COP26 based on global commitment to action. Between now and November 2021 we will take advantage of every international opportunity to increase ambition and mobilization, also harnessing the G20 under the Italian Presidency and the G7 under the British Presidency. Carolina Schmidt Zaldvar, COP25 President and Minister of Environment of Chile said: It is very important that we continue to push for climate action, and having quickly agreed on new dates for COP26 is a sign of this commitment. While the subsidiary body sessions (SB52) were also postponed 4-12 October 2020, the work of the Parties and stakeholders will continue through virtual meetings such as the upcoming 'June Momentum'. The urgency with which governments and the way in which countries promote recovery from the post-COVID-19 crisis will directly affect the other serious global crisis we are experiencing: global warming and climate change crisis. That is why we will continue to strongly mobilize all actors. We need more ambition to reduce emissions, to build resilience and to cooperate with each other. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said: Our efforts to address climate change and COVID-19 are not mutually exclusive. If done right, the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis can steer us to a more inclusive and sustainable climate path. We honour those who we have lost by working with renewed commitment and continuing to demonstrate leadership and determination in addressing climate change, and building a safe, clean, just and resilient world. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA7","COP25: UNEP'S PERSPECTIVE","December 24, 2019 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): More than 190 nations, from the United States, China and European Union members to the smallest island states, were represented at the December 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as "" COP 25 "" to discuss, reach agreements and to advance climate action. A UN Environment Programme (UNEP) delegation was in Madrid as part of its ongoing work to help the world transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future. Here's a look at the key takeaways from COP 25 and what they mean for UNEP's work in 2020. What were the headlines from COP25 ? Governments gathered to respond to the growing urgency of the climate crisis with some progress, but in the end the negotiators were unable to agree on concrete plans to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Welcome news came from the European Union, singled out by Secretary-General Antnio Guterres. The European Union demonstrated political will and leadership by presenting a new plan whose goal is to reach net-zero carbon by 2050. Many countries with smaller emissions agreed to similar long-term targets, but other major emitters beyond the European Union held back. What had COP25 The conference focused on building momentum for countries to increase their ambition to act on the climate crisis in 2020. It also aimed to completing technical details of the Paris Agreement, such as the workings of the global carbon markets, which determines how countries can trade carbon credits and therefore enhance the cost-effectiveness of climate action investments. Did they do it? There was a recognition of the urgency of climate action but countries could not agree on some of the main areas. Discussion of most of the technical details were carried over to next year. There was a recognition of the urgency of climate action but countries could not agree on some of the main areas. What needs to happen now? Next year, countries are expected to submit their updated climate plans as per the Paris Agreement. Strong public and industry pressure will be needed to give policymakers reassurance that public opinion and industry appetite is backing them. UNEP will continue to support this effort by providing scientific and technical expertise. What as some reasons for optimism? Public support for strong climate policies is rising around the world: The difficulties the talks faced stood in stark contrast to an ever clearer and louder call from the public. Crowds of people marched in support of climate action through Madrid during the negotiations; these marches follow a year of climate protests which mobilized millions in support of climate action. The science is clear and reaches more people than ever: Research published during the two weeks of talks showed that greenhouse gas emissions have risen 4 per cent since the Paris accord was signed in 2015. In the days before COP 25 , UNEP released its 10th Emissions Gap Report which calls for a cut to carbon emissions by more than 7 per cent per year in the next decade if the world is to meet the Paris goals. The report was widely quoted during the negotiations and at a side event where scientists discussed the findings with delegates. Industry is mobilizing: Ministers of Finance attended the talks for the first time and many led conversations about green growth, green opportunity and green jobs. Climate action presents unprecedented economic and socioeconomic opportunities across multiple sectors. Should we be disappointed? Yes. While the conference was not expected to produce a major breakthrough on new emission targets, it was an important opportunity to unlock the full potential of the Paris Agreement. Instead, critical issues were put off until next year after consensus proved difficult to reach. These questions will need to be added to next year's agenda instead of being resolved now. This is not the pace of action members of UNEP's delegation had hoped for, but of course the action continues, along with climate change. What is UNEP doing next? One: UNEP continues to support the negotiations and Members States with facts, insights and conclusions of our scientists and technical experts. For all policymakers or stakeholders writing 2020 climate action plans, and for everyone who is interested, here are the latest reports UNEP launched and supported in the run-up to and across COP25 : The Production Gap Report is the first report to assess countries' plans and projections for fossil fuel production, delivered in partnership with the Stockholm Environment Institute. The Future of Wind Report predicts a 10-fold increase in global wind power by 2050, making the pace of development of offshore wind technologies and markets faster than people expected a few years ago. The International Resource Panel produced a new report for policymakers, Resource Efficiency and Climate Change: Material Efficiency Strategies for a Low-Carbon Future. It is the first comprehensive scientific analysis estimating total cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in homes and cars that can be achieved through material efficiency. The 2019 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction provides an update on drivers of CO2 emissions and energy demand globally since 2017, along with examples of policies, technologies and investments that support low-carbon building stocks. Two: UNEP supports, together with the wider UN system, countries to complete their enhanced nationally determined contribution as per the ratchet mechanism of increased ambition in the Paris Agreement. Three: UNEP is committed to accelerating the understanding of why it is critical to maximize nature-based solutions to combat climate change. The statistics are stark. For example, if deforestation was a country, it would be the third largest CO2 emitter after the United States and China, which is why the protection of standing forests70 per cent of which are threatened by deforestationand the restoration of degraded landscapes is so important. Four: UNEP is driving forward the mobilization of the financial sector's support for climate action: in less than three months since the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance launch at the UN Climate Summit in September, membership has more than doubled. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA8","SECRETARY-GENERAL STRESSES NEED FOR 'MAXIMUM PRESSURE' ON BIG EMITTERS, AT UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE","December 2, 2019 Monday 6:56 PM  EST","US Fed News","UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 2 -- The United Nations issued the following press release: Following are UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' remarks to the Climate Vulnerable Forum at the twenty-fifth Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Madrid today: I welcome this forum of climate vulnerable countries. The great injustice of the climate crisis is that its effects fall most on those least responsible for it. I have seen this first-hand. In Mozambique and in the Caribbean, I have seen the aftermath of terrible storms that have caused and continue to cause devastation that we count in the cost of lives lost, communities uprooted and economies crippled. In the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, I have witnessed the dreadful toll of drought, powered by climate change, that is destabilizing an entire subregion. And around the world, floods, drought and other extreme weather are being made worse by climate disruption. And it is the most vulnerable who hurt first and worst. It is commendable, then, that some of the most vulnerable nations are also in the forefront of climate action. For a decade or more you have been in the vanguard of the call to follow science by limiting temperature rise to 1.5 C. You know that any more will spell untold disasters for your people and for your development prospects. At the recent Climate Action Summit, small island developing States and least developed countries once again showed leadership. We saw commitments to come forward with strategies to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. And we heard from countries prepared to bring more ambitious national commitments in 2020. For this I thank you and I hope your example will be followed by the big emitters. It is essential that you follow through on these commitments to put maximum pressure on the big emitters next year. The United Nations is ready to support small island developing States and least developed countries in this, including through the ""Climate Promise"" made by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the Summit. We must also ensure that at least $100 billion a year is available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and to take into account their legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery. You have my personal commitment to continue to fight for more ambitious climate action and also for the particular cause of small island developing States and least developed countries. Visiting the most vulnerable regions of the world has only served to galvanize my efforts in this regard. I wish you a very productive forum. Thank you.

The summit is taking place in Madrid, Spain, from 2 to 13 December. ""Churches and faith communities as part of the civil society are making their presence felt at the COP25 ""It is our Christian duty to care for creation and not lose sight of those, who suffer from climate change, as the most vulnerable are not detachable from our understanding of the gospel. Therefore, addressing climate change needs to include dimension of global justice,"" added Rev. Pavlovic. The ecumenical delegation at COP25 is contributing to a number of events taking place in Madrid these days, including ecumenical prayer service prepared in a cooperation with the Spanish Evangelical Church, panel discussions and handing over of an interfaith declaration to the leadership of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as monitoring negotiations of official delegates related to the follow up of the Paris Agreement. COP25 is designed to take the next steps in the UN climate change process. Following agreement on the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement at COP 24 in Poland last year, a key objective is to complete several matters with respect to the full operationalisation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. COP25 is meant to prepare the format for official stock of the pledges that governments around the world have committed. These pledges are meant to reduce carbon emissions aiming to keep climate change well below 2 degrees of Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 C. Revision and hopeful upscaling of the pledges is planned for next year, 5 years after adopting the Paris Agreement. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6956657 MSTRUCK \"

The delegation is set to meet with UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee, delegates from several non-EU countries as well as civil society representatives. A press conference with delegation Chairman Bas Eickhout (Greens/EFA, NL)[4], and Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans is scheduled to take place on 12 December 14h30-15h (TBC). On Thursday 12 December at 12h30, Parliament is hosting aside event[5]in the EU Pavilion focusing on the need to make all countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) more ambitious and on the role that forests play in reaching the Paris target. 'I am glad that the European Parliament delegation has come to Madrid with a very clear mandate: The EU has to increase its National Determined Contribution to minus 55% greenhouse gas emission in 2030 compared to 1990, and become climate neutral by 2050 at the latest,' said Bas Eickhout (Greens/EFA, NL)[6]. 'While technical issues are very important, the most important thing is to continue to work for the common goal, in spite of Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. I very much support Ursula von der Leyen's initiative to have an international alliance to increase ambition in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Developments in China, India, South Africa and Canada show that if we act in the right way, we are not the only ones that can be more ambitious,' said Peter Liese (EPP, DE)[7], vice chairman of the delegation. Background On 28 November 2019, the European Parliamentdeclared a climate emergency[8]in Europe and globally. MEPs also asked for all relevant EU legislative and budgetary proposals to be fully aligned with the objective of limiting global warming to under 1.5 C. On the same day, Parliament also approved aresolution on the COP25 [9], urging the EU to commit to reaching climate neutrality as soon as possible (and no later than 2050) and to submit this goal to the UN Convention on Climate Change. MEPs also urged EU countries to at least double their contributions to the international Green Climate Fund.

On behalf of the European Commission, I want to assure the UK COP26 Presidency, the UNFCCC, Italy as the host of the pre-COP and all of our international partners and civil society, of our strong commitment to making a success of COP26 and to delivering the European Green Deal which we announced in December 2019 in the interest of the health of our economy and our people. We acknowledge that global diplomatic activity is currently slowed down by the coronavirus crisis. And we understand that this decision is taken to avoid that COP26 would fail to meet expectations as a result of insufficient participation. This makes sense. As for the European Commission, we will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious COP26, when it takes place. At home, we have put in place the key EU laws to meet our existing 2030 climate and energy targets. In the long-term, we have committed to climate neutrality by 2050 and proposed a climate law that will make this objective legally binding. The legislative work on this proposal has started, even in these challenging circumstances. The work that the Commission is doing to present by September 2020 an impact assessed plan to raise the EU's 2030 ambitions and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50-55% compared to 1990 levels is on track, and the Commission will stick to that. The same goes for the work necessary to submit an enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC in line with our commitment under the Paris Agreement. We will also continue to work intensively through all available channels with our partners around the world to share our plans and to encourage them to raise ambition too, and to work together on other key elements of the global climate agenda, like sustainable finance and adaptation and resilience to the impacts of climate change.

Despite the countless warnings by climate scientists, the response of rich developed countries to the climate emergency has failed to reduce emissions, or address the systemic inequalities and injustices at its core. With climate talks entering a critical phase before the Paris Agreement formally comes into force in 2020, COP25 talks will focus on strengthening the weak pledges that will lead to a warming of at least 3C, preventing governments and the private sector from trading their emissions, and delivering climate finance to address loss and damage caused by global heating. War on Want will highlight the work of our partner organisations in the Global South on the front lines of climate violence, and put forward the case for a justice-oriented approach to the climate crisis, as part of a Global Green Deal for People. War on Want's Executive Director, Asad Rehman, will participate in COP25 talks and the Social Summit for Climate in Madrid. War on Want's Senior International Programmes Officer for Latin America, Sebastian Ordoez Muoz, will participate in the People's Summit in Santiago. COP25 talks were moved to Madrid in early November after President Sebastian Piera's government announced Chile's withdrawal from hosting the summit in late October, after massive anti-austerity and anti-government protests across Chile. Campaigners condemned the decision as an attempt to evade scrutiny on policies that have led to widespread economic and climate injustice. Asad Rehman, Executive Director at War on Want, said: ""With the cost of climate damages racking up to a possible $4 trillion by 2030, the time for warm words about the climate emergency is over. We are in the last chance saloon. Governments such as the UK's can no longer claim they are acting on the climate crisis whilst trying to shift the burden to act onto poorer countries, and whilst UK companies continue to profit from environmental injustices. The UK must show real leadership by committing to its fair share of the global effort, by paying its climate debt and by holding UK companies to account for the damage they are causing. Despite countless UN reports warning of the need for urgent action, the climate crisis is already devastating the lives and livelihoods of millions, plunging the poorest into yet another crisis of hunger and poverty. An opportunity exists to tackle both the climate crisis and the crisis of inequality with a Global Green Deal for People that guarantees everyone the right to dignified life. Our political leaders will not be forgiven if they fail to grasp it."" Sebastian Ordoez Muoz, Senior International Programmes Officer Latin America at War on Want, said: ""The Chilean government's decision to withdraw Santiago as the host city of COP25 is a desperate attempt to divert attention away from the social inequalities and environmental injustices harming communities across the country, and the state's violent repression against the uprising. The crisis unfolding in Chile cannot be isolated from the country's water crisis a mega-drought caused by the overexploitation of resources by industrial agriculture and mega-mining industries. Meanwhile, the global mining industry is using the climate crisis as an opportunity to greenwash its image and carbon emissions, while increasing its destructive extraction of 'green' or 'critical' metals such as copper. To resist Green Colonialism, we need to embrace grassroots-led transformations towards post-extractivism.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA13","International Chamber of Commerce Consultation at COP 25 Considers Value of Carbon Pricing Schemes","December 7, 2019 Saturday 5:47 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news:    - On the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ), ICC discussions considered the effectiveness of climate pricing schemes.    The fourth edition in ICC's trade and climate consultation series took place on the sidelines of COP 25 What is carbon pricing? Stefano De Clara, Director of International Policy, International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) moderated the consultation, which featured stakeholders from business, government, and various international organisations. During his opening remarks, Mr De Clara provided a brief overview of existing carbon pricing schemes. Mr De Clara emphasised the importance of creating climate policies that allow for trading and encourage collaboration between national governments. Currently, 57 national governments have implemented or scheduled emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes around the world. One of the key drivers for the recent uptake in carbon pricing policies has been the Paris Agreement, which requests nationally determined contributions (NDCs) from each country, according to Mr De Clara. Following Mr De Clara's opening Susana Bokobo, President of ICC Spain's Tax Commission and Global Tax Leader for the Spanish energy company Repsol, outlined the consequences associated with the implementation of carbon taxes, including higher costs for both business and consumers. Ms Bokobo offered her support for carbon markets yet cautioned that a fractured system without global cooperation could lead to carbon leakage, or the off-shoring of carbon intensive operations to countries where there is no price on emissions. Addressing 'carbon leakage' As part of the consultation's roundtable discussion, other participants echoed similar concerns over carbon leakage. While several countries and companies have introduced carbon emissions trading systems many participants believe that linkages will be critical in reducing carbon leakage over time. Abyd Karmali, Managing Director, Climate Finance at Bank of America, explained that businesses are already creating linkages through the implementation of carbon offset purchase programmes. Typically, these measures are uniformly applied by businesses and financial institutions across markets around the world. Regardless of the existence of a national carbon pricing scheme, businesses are applying the same carbon standards wherever they operate. Likewise, Ms Bokobo, mentioned Repsol's recent net-zero CO2 emissions target for 2050 as an example of business connecting carbon policies across markets. In addition, Daniel Ramos, Legal Officer at the Trade and Environment Division of the World Trade Organization, raised the availability of data for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and developing economies as another area for potential carbon leakage. Before implementing carbon pricing regimes, it's critical for national governments to accurately determine the price of all economic activities. Business leadership for market-based solutions ICC endorsed a report published by CPLC's High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness at the United Nations General Assembly in September. ICC's backing of the report was recently mentioned in the Financial Times as part of a special report on climate change ahead of this year's COP. ICC at COP 25 Working with policymakers, business leaders and other stakeholders, ICC is advocating for policy frameworks that address the urgent need to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 C and transition to an inclusive and sustainable net-zero emissions future.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA14","COP25 begins in Madrid amid bleak assessments of climate change","December 2, 2019 Monday 7:18 AM EST","UPI","Dozens of world leaders gathered at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Spain Monday amid a sense of urgency sparked by a pair of alarming scientific reports issued last month. Ahead of the conference, known as COP25 , U.N. Secretary General Ant\'c3\'b3nio Guterres warned Sunday that the ""the point of no return"" in preventing the most disastrous effects of climate change is ""no longer over the horizon"" but rather is now in sight and ""hurtling towards us."" At the conference, which was hastily moved to Madrid last month due to civil unrest at its original venue in Chile, participants will discuss progress toward meeting three climate change goals established in the 2015 Paris Agreement, including stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. To begin the conference, heads of state at the event will present ""an action agenda delivering"" a vision for a climate-resilient world, organizers said in a schedule of Monday's events. The program said the opening day will also include a new ""financing mechanism to enhance South-South cooperation of the world's most climate threatened nations and special efforts to address the increasingly widespread and far-reaching impact of climate change on human rights."" It will be the final ""COP"" before next year's conference in Glasgow, Scotland, at which those goals are expected to be revised and updated. Looming over the proceedings will be the assessments contained in a pair of scientific reports released last week. The The U.N. Environment Program, which coordinates and manages environmental issues among U.N. agencies, said the world's nations must cut emissions 7.6 percent annually until 2030 to reach the Paris levels. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization reported combined concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide continued to surge last year, showing no signs of slowing. The deadly effects of climate change are already being felt in Africa, the British charity Save the Children said Monday, with 33 million people there at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA15","Unitarian Universalist Service Committee: A Minga for the Climate - Supporting Indigenous Climate Work at COP25","January 30, 2020 Thursday 8:30 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee issued the following news:    - Indigenous groups from around the world are at the forefront of climate action at events like the United Nations' COP25 . In Latin America, minga is a form of collective work that is not paid with money but is done with the conviction that it is possible to get faster and better outcomes for the common good when the community works collaboratively together. The word minga has its roots in the Quechua language, a living Indigenous language spoken by Andean communities in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Last year, a collective of Indigenous leaders from Latin America--concerned about the direction of current climate change negotiations--decided to make an international call to the Indigenous peoples of the world to come together in a Minga Indigena for the climate during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Santiago, Chile (later moved to Madrid, Spain). The goals of Minga Indigena for COP25 were to uphold the right of traditional Indigenous governments to represent themselves and have a say about decisions that are extremely likely to affect their sovereignty and territories, including 80 percent of the biodiversity of the planet. Although the right to free prior and informed consent (FPIC) is part of international agreements like ILO169, the number of countries that have ratified the agreement is limited, the agreement has not been adequately implemented, and it does not go far enough to effectively allow Indigenous communities to say no to specific plans or projects in their territories. Minga Indigena has gathered around the UN Climate Change Conference because they believe that COP has proved ineffective on multiple fronts. It has not come up with workable solutions to the climate crisis. At the same time, it has proposed mechanisms like carbon markets that pose a serious threat to Indigenous territories and cultural survival. UUSC's team met the Minga Indigena team through the United Nations Permanent Forum for Indigenous Issues (UNPFII). UUSC has engaged with the UNPFII since the early 2000s when the forum was created, a crucial space to support the work of our Indigenous partners and create new alliances. The concept of a large scale alternative Indigenous climate gathering--self-managed and grounded on the same organizing principles of autonomy and self-determination promoted by Indigenous peoples internationally--seemed like an ideal fit for a partnership with UUSC. Planning for COP25 During the United Nations Climate Action Summit last September, UUSC met with the executive team of 350.org Latin America, this organization had been conducting consultations among Brazilian Indigenous communities for more than a year and produced the documentary ""Indigenous Voices of Latin America"" as part of that process. Given the evident affinities and complementarities between Minga Indigena and the Indigenous consultation of 350.org, we connected them and widened the alliance for COP25 . COP25 from Santiago to Madrid. This relocation ruined all the plans and resources Minga Indigena had already invested for the event. Only a week before the opening of COP25 , Minga Indigena was hanging by a thread with all the logistical, political, and financial complications of moving the event from South America to Europe. The organizers of Minga Indigena decided to go ahead and with the support of local civil society organizations in Spain put together a plan for a smaller event in Madrid. UUSC and 350.org, among other organizations, offered emergency funds to support travel and accommodation as well as on the ground support during the event. The persistence and leadership of Minga Indigena organizers were ultimately rewarded with immense success at COP 25 . Their participation began with leading the March for the Climate with a delegation of hundreds of Indigenous leaders in the heart of Madrid. Minga Indigena also ran side events for six days, together with the Social Summit for Climate Action, discussing the diverse ways in which the climate crisis and climate solutions affect Indigenous peoples worldwide. Minga Indigena held full-house events inside the Green Zone of COP25 , presenting the testimonies of Indigenous women leaders at the frontline of conservation struggles. During the event, Minga Indigena worked collaboratively on a climate charter, using the findings of the consultation of 350.org in Brazil and the specific demands of the Indigenous leaders present at COP25 . This charter was brought to the official Blue Zone of COP25 , a restricted space only available for accredited delegates, and read to representatives of the COP25 Presidency at the IPCC scientific pavilion on December 10. In the charter, Minga Indigena delegates demanded a comprehensive consultation process for engaging Indigenous communities in governmental climate negotiations. This was a watershed moment for the participation of Indigenous peoples in the COP process, disrupting common assumptions regarding the political representation of Indigenous peoples at intergovernmental forums. It raised participants' ambitions for the possible futures we can realize for our climate-challenged Earth. Next Steps: Minga Indigena in 2020 More than a month after the closing of COP25 in Madrid, Minga Indigena delegates have returned to their territories. All the materials used during their stay in Madrid (e.g. mattresses) were recycled, shipped to Athens and donated to a refugee shelter in that city. Meanwhile the process leading to Minga Indigena COP26 has already started! This time the ambition is much larger, aiming to bring Indigenous representatives from all over the world to Glasgow in November 2020. UUSC has been invited once again to be a research and planning partner of Minga Indigena in 2020. This opportunity is an island of light in the ocean of despair that usually comes with climate politics. Minga Indigena is brilliantly aligned with UUSC's commitment to advance the cause of self-determination and ultimately the survival and thriving of Indigenous modes of existence as one of the most effective solutions to the contemporary climate crisis.    About UUSC: Guided by the belief that all people have inherent worth and dignity, UUSC advances human rights globally by partnering with affected communities who are confronting injustice, mobilizing to challenge oppressive systems, and inspiring and sustaining spiritually grounded activism for justice. We invite you to join us in this journey toward realizing a better future! [Category: Religion] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7000811 MSTRUCK \"

After all, it was Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat, and the daughter of Jos Figueres Ferrer, a former President of the country, who was the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC during the Paris conference (COP21) of December 2015.But Costa Rica soon gave it up, and opted to host a 'pre-COP' meeting instead, which it did recently.Chile picked up the thread and it was assumed that COP25 would be held in Santiago, but that is not to be.The UNFCCC is 'exploring alternative hosting options,' but it is difficult to see any country stepping in at such short notice.The only city that can is Bonn, the headquarters of UNFCCC.The rules provide that in the absence of a host, the conferences would be held there. The 2017 conference, the COP23, was Fiji's turn, but the Pacific island- nation held it in Bonn.Climate experts believe that COP25 can be held only in Bonn. If that happens, Europe would be hosting three conferences in a row. COP24 was held in Katowice, Poland, and next year's conference is scheduled to happen in London.Reacting to the goings-on, Jairam Ramesh, a former Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change and the current Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests, termed the conferences 'useless'.'Useless' conferencesRamesh, who was an Indian negotiator at the COP15 in Copenhangen in 2009, told BusinessLine : 'These COPs are useless, since they meet (only) to decide where and when to meet again... They are forums for posturing.'Some experts say that even if that is true, the COP meetings serve to highlight climate issues. Because of the COP meetings, climate action has gathered momentum elsewhere. 'Climate action has acquired a life beyond the COP meetings,' observed Damandeep Singh, Director, CDP India, which is part of CDP Worldwide, a non-profit that also works in the area of climate action.However, he told BusinessLine that the cancellation of COP25 is a setback inasmuch as 'people can't sit and talk'.According to Aarti Khosla, Director at Climate Trends, a Delhi-based strategic communications body that specialises in building narratives around climate change, Chile backing out strikes as an illustration of the complexities of climate change.Khosla told BusinessLine that for a country (Chile) that had committed to generating a fifth of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025, the domestic protests  which were triggered by the government raising tariffs because of the shift to renewables  'lays bare the tough road ahead for climate action.' \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA17","From University of Toronto to UN: Undergraduates Attend COP25 Climate Talks in Madrid","December 21, 2019 Saturday 8:30 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The University of Toronto issued the following news release: Along with the world leaders, reporters, activists, Greta Thunberg and academics, six University of Toronto undergraduates travelled to Madrid earlier this month to observe the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP25 . Rutu Patel, a student in the global health program and environment and health program, says she returned to Toronto with a better understanding of the patience needed for international negotiations. She received support from Victoria College's Dean's Experience Enhancement Fund and a small grant from the School of the Environment. ""What I have learned is that international decision-making can be very, very slow,"" she says. ""There's quite a disconnect between what the people want and how much decision-makers are willing to give,"" she added. ""It was interesting to see some of the feedback that people had brought up to the Canadian delegates, which the delegates later brought to the discussions,"" Patel says. The students were able to obtain accreditation for COP25 thanks to Matthew Hoffman, a professor of political science at U of T Scarborough whose research focuses on environmental governance. Hoffman is the co-author of a recent paper calling for an emphasis on decarbonization - cutting out fossil fuels and focusing on renewable energy - instead of simply reducing emissions. ""It is always valuable to be able to connect what students are learning in the classroom with lived experience,"" Hoffman says. ""You get a different perspective hearing activists make their case directly, seeing the separation between the country delegations and negotiations and the civil society activities. ""I hope they understand the enormity of the global process, why it's slow and why civil society is (rightly) frustrated with how slow it is."" While Thunberg has become an icon of the climate movement, Micaela Tam, an international relations and history major, says her attendance at briefings by Climate Action Network Canada introduced her to the many people - Indigenous groups, youth, civil society organizations - also agitating for change. The outcome of the climate talks was widely said to be disappointing, producing few new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After more than two weeks, negotiators weren't able to persuade the largest polluters to amp up their efforts to address climate change as of 2020. ""One major impression was the disconnect between the talk of urgency and the reality of delay,"" Hoffman told U of T News. ""The frustration felt by civil society and a number of states with the inability of the international community to commit to higher ambition was palpable. I think this disappointing result will actually make the youth movement push even harder for action."" But the U of T students say a march held the same week in Madrid, where Thunberg took the stage, gave them at least some hope about the planet's future. ""Attending the march and hearing Greta speak was more inspiring than attending COP25 ,"" says Emily Stutzman, a third-year student double majoring in environmental studies and political science. ""More change will come from the people, and especially young activists outside of COP25 than from the leaders and negotiators within."" Naomi Butterfield, who's majoring in international relations and forestry conservation science, says a hush fell over the audience when the 16-year-old Swedish activist took the mic. Butterfield says Thunberg's voice broke as she spoke, emphasizing the urgency of the climate crisis and criticizing the lack of progress at COP25 . ""The hope is not within the walls of the COP25 ,"" Thunberg told the crowd. ""The hope is out here with you."" Patel also has confidence in her generation. ""I think the role of youth is going to be very prominent because we're going to bring - and we are bringing - this energy and this push for change,"" she says.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA18","COP25 Falsely Claims Global Warming as Existential Threat","Western Free Press( Arizona)","Newstex Blogs","Dec 27, 2019( Western Free Press: http://www.westernfreepress.com/Delivered http://www.westernfreepress.com/Delivered by Newstex) In a UN Climate Statement[1] on November 1, 2019, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa announced: 'We are pleased to announce the COP Bureau has agreed that COP25 will take place from 2-13 December in IFEMA - Feria de Madrid in Madrid, Spain.'Not mentioned in her announcement was how COP 25 had to change locations from Chile to Spain at very short notice (after it had already changed locations from Brazil to Chile), after riots erupted around Chile in protest to energy price hikes to pay for her climate change programs, thus forcing Chilean President Sebastian Pinera to put troops on the streets and cancel his plans to host COP 25 . Stated goals of COP 25 On November 30, 2019, Alex Newman[2]wrote the following about the goals of the UN COP 25 'Climate' Summit[3] prior to its December 2nd, 2019 beginning in Madrid, Spain (Alex Newman is a foreign correspondent for The New American who has traveled the world reporting on the UN's climate agenda.): 'Organizers of the summit made clear that they have big plans to advance global governance and 'green' policies at the planetary level. ' COP25 is the first summit of a new cycle,' boasted Spanish 'Minister for the Ecological Transition' Teresa Ribera, who is playing a key role organizing and running the upcoming UN summit. As Robera said in an interview, 'In Madrid, global climate negotiations are entering a new phase, with a focus on reaching more ambitious climate action by everyone, because what we have on the table is nowhere near enough to prevent average temperatures from rising more than 1.5C, let alone 2C. Everyone, including governments, regions, cities, and social and economic agents' must be aligned with the embattled UN Paris Agreement. 'We cannot delay climate action any longer. This is what societies are demanding.' The UN and most of its member governments are seeking to finalize rules for an emerging global 'carbon market.' Under the controversial plan, humanity will pay for emissions of the gas people exhale, commonly known as carbon dioxide or CO2, as part of Western governments' plans to reduce their people's emissions of the essential-to-life gas. Another key item on the agenda is 'climate financing,' organizers said. After all, totally restructuring the economy of the world, as leading UN officials claim is required, will take a lot of money.' Hypocrisy of climate attendees As reported by Mark Morano of Climate Depot[4]: 'UN climate summit delegates and activists attending lined up daily for hamburgers[5] at the conferences' onsite Burger King despite the UN warnings that eating meat is not climate-friendly.' See: Flashback: UN admits Cutting CO2 'not enough' - 'We must change food production to save the world[6] There is also the issue of air travel[7] to and from COP 25 ? Of concern to environmentalists is that air travel produces greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel, which contributes to global warming when released into the atmosphere. According to the provisional list[8] (pdf) published by the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), a grand total of 26,706 participants registered for COP25 [9].This breaks down into 13,643 people representing specific parties, 9,987 from observer organizations - such as scientists, business groups and various non-governmental organizations - and 3,076 journalists. How many flew in privatejets to Madrid? Nancy Pelosi's boondoggle delegation to Madrid Speaker Nancy Pelosi[10] and a bicameral Congressional Delegation found it necessary to spend two days at COP 25 . There were 15 in all in her delegation who traveled by air on the taxpayer's dime. Despite President Trump's decision to remove this nation from the Paris Accords, Pelosi gave this message[11] of assurance on behalf of the U.S. Congress at the end of their stay in Madrid: 'Today, our delegation concluded a successful two-day visit to COP25 in Madrid with a message on behalf of the U.S. Congress of 'We're still in,'' Speaker Pelosi said. 'Combating the climate crisis is the existential threat of our time and it was essential that our delegation stand with international partners, who are continuing to build upon and solidify their commitments to meet the Paris Agreement's goals.' The Pelosi delegation trip was expensive, probably costing millions of dollars in travel, lodging, food, and security. Yet this was just the tip of the iceberg. Are we to feel better because Speaker Pelosi purchased carbon offsets to cover all air travel involved in this Congressional Delegation visit to COP25 ? Some sound science and climate realism at COP 25 Reported by H. Sterling Burnett[12], senior fellow on Energy Policy, in Climate Change Weekly #344, The Heartland Institute[13],one of the world's leading free-market think tanks based in Arlington Heights, Illinois, challenged COP 25 in Madrid by bringing a heavy dose of sound science and climate realism. Headlining Heartland's event were four distinguished men and nineteen-year-old German YouTube personality Naomi Seibt: Award-winning physicist Will Happer, Ph.D. and former top science advisor to President Donald Trump. Happer's presentation documented human greenhouse gas emissions are having much less impact on global temperatures than predicted by alarmist climate theory and are certainly not causing a climate crisis. Meteorologist Anthony Watts, a Heartland Institute senior fellow, showed the majority of official temperature stations are corrupted by artificial heat sources and other factors, giving the appearance of more warming than is measured by global satellites instruments and weather balloons. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane researcher Stanley Goldenberg explained there is no evidence indicating hurricanes are becoming more frequent or severe as the planet warms. Goldenberg pointed out how even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges this. Chilean civil engineer Douglas Pollack noted the Chilean government's climate policies have made the nation's electricity prices the highest in South America. The government's price increase for the country's Metro system the main mode of transportation for the urban poor in order to pay for its switch to being run on expensive renewable power was the last straw that resulted in protests and riots in Chile. Naomi Seibt presented an account of how she transformed from believing in a climate crisis to being a climate realist. After fact-checking the assertions of her teachers and the media, she realized propaganda was triumphing over science in the climate change debate View a full video[14] of Heartland's Climate Reality Forum presentations. The five individuals noted above are featured, along with other distinguished Heartland COP 25 speakers. Also reported was that CFACT[15]blanketed the delegations with their latest hard-hitting 36 page climate skeptical 'talking points[16]' which were well received. Reported was that on a one-on-basis delegate were surprising candid in admitting how much of their official narrative is nonsense designed for a few to make a buck. Outcome of UN COP 25 The marathon COP 25 talks went into over[17] time[18] extending more than 36 hours past theexpected conclusion on Friday, December14, makingCOP 25 the longest UN climate conference to date.There were riftsover how to tackle the climate crisis and who should pay for it. The Washington Post devoted[19] an entire article to highlighting poor countries and slamming the wealthy or developed nations for not helping smaller countries deal with the climate crises before negotiators managed to seal a vague agreement[20] in a last-ditch effort on Sunday, December 16. Activists were hoping for a bolder approach to curbing climate-changing greenhouse gases. This statement was made by UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres[21] on the outcome of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid (Guterres, is an admitted socialist. Before taking the reins at the UN, he led the Socialist International, the world's most powerful alliance of Socialist and Marxist political parties.): 'I am disappointed with the results of # COP25 . The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up. I am more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise.' Read here[22] a powerful, riveting, and damming account of what really happened at the two-week COP 25 summit as written by Alex Newman[23]on Monday, December 16, 2019: Following are highlights from Alex Newman's article: 'Throughout the United Nations COP25 'Climate' summit in Spain, America, the GOP, and President Donald Trump not carbon dioxide or even 'climate change' were public enemy number one. Indeed, the U.S. government, the American people, their elected officials, and what remains of the free-market system that ushered in unprecedented global prosperity were all viciously and relentlessly attacked.' 'Globalists, communists, Islamists, socialists, environmentalists, and crackpots of all varieties dropped the mask in a carefully orchestrated show. Incredibly, even the many prominent Americans who spoke at the summit demonized their own nation and the freedom that made it so successful. John Kerry spoke from one of the most prominent stages at the UN suit declaring that he was ashamed of being an American. Not a single conservative, pro-America speaker could be found among the 25,000 attendees.' If CO2 were the real enemy, the UN summit would have been praising America non-stop as our nation's emissions of the essential gas continues to plummet, and would have instead gone after Communist China which is by far the largest emitter of CO2. The hatred expressed against this nation at COP 25is because President Trump dared to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, meaning that the U.S. government will not be forking over billions of dollars of climate 'reparations' under the guise of ' loss and damage[24].'In short, poor and middle-class American taxpayers would end up paying Third World kleptocrats for supposedly causing bad weather, forest fires, and other natural disasters. Until China and India play by the same rules as the rest of the world, when we have some real science or breakthroughs that can actually produce carbonless energy (start with new nuclear powered power generating facilities), when there is solid proof that climate change is man induced, and or that we can do something about it, our nation should not play the UN's wealth confiscation game.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA19","COP25: Another Lost Opportunity \u8211  Analysis","January 19, 2020 Sunday","Eurasia Review","By Rajeesh Kumar The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP25 , held in Madrid from December 2-13, ended without any significant progress. Though the conference was the longest in the history of UN climate conferences, many denounced its outcome as one of the worst in a quarter-century of climate negotiations. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, expressed his disappointment and stated that the world ""lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis.""1Greta Thunberg, the new face of global climate protests, tweeted that ""it seems like COP25 in Madrid is falling apart right now. The science is clear, but the science is being ignored.""2Jennifer Morgan, the Executive Director of Greenpeace, responded that she has never seen the gap bigger between the inside and the outside during the last 25 years history of COP.3Similarly, the IPCC vice-chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele also tweeted that ""the final result is low, very low"" and it is ""better to have no deal than a bad deal.""4 Significance of COP25 COP25 was significant as well as different from the previous conferences owing to many reasons. First, it was the last conference before 2020, a pivotal year for the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement signed by 195 nations in December 2015 is aimed at capping the global warming below 2 degree Celsius. It demanded all Parties to do it through 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs) and revisit their climate pledges by 2020.5 COP25 was expected to finalise the rules for global carbon market, carry over of carbon credits, and compensate the loss and damage of climate emergency. Similarly, 2020 was also the deadline for providing $100 billion in finance to the developing countries, a promise made by the developed countries in Paris. Second, the Madrid Summit offered a central role to the contribution of the scientific community in climate negotiations. In previous talks, when it came to climate change, the science was resoundingly clear but the way people responded to it was not. Instead of taking the scientific community seriously, mockery and disbelief of science was a common feature. Very few leaders in Madrid questioned the argument put forth by the scientific community that the difference between 1.5 and 2 degree Celsius rise in temperature is a matter of life and death. Majority of the nations were committed to paying heed of the warning of science.6 This scientific evidence on climate emergency is critical against the backdrop of countries planning to produce 150 per cent more coal than would be consistent with a 2\'b0C pathway, and 280 per cent more than would be consistent with a 1.5\'b0C pathway by 2030.7 Third, COP25 COP25 decision text recognised the importance of ocean as an integral part of the Earth's climate system, as well as highlighted the need to ensure the integrity of ocean and coastal ecosystems.9 Amid the disappointment, progress on incorporating ocean solutions into global carbon reduction efforts was one of the few positive outcomes at the Madrid. Last, but most important, COP25 was the final conference before the official exit of the United States (US) from the Paris Agreement. The US is one of the biggest carbon polluters in history and the second largest carbon polluter today. It also uses more than twice as much energy per person as the European Union (EU). As per the latest\~Climate Change Performance Index, the US rated very low across almost all categories of climate protection.10 COP25 was the last opportunity for the international community to urge the US to implement the Paris pledges including Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts. Lost Opportunity COP25 was expected to give prominence to science, streamline ambitious targets and raise trust among parties. The central purpose of COP25 was to scale up ambitions and foster the decarbonisation targets set under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that addresses how countries can reduce their emissions using international carbon market. However, Article 6 had become one of the most significant casualties with parties failing to reach an agreement. Similarly, COP25 could not make any progress on Article 8, which focuses on loss and damage that the developing countries have suffered due to the climate crisis and how they will be compensated. Even after a marathon two-week talks, issues such as creating an international carbon market and climate financing were pushed to the next year. Similarly, Madrid Conference was also supposed to have bridged fissures in the developing and developed blocs on various issues. However, what manifested at Madrid was the increasing gap between smaller, developing countries and major powers, which ""resisted pressure to commit to emergency action and bolder emissions pledges"" before the Paris process is implemented next year.11 For instance, while countries like China and India demanded billions of dollars to finance climate goals, the developed groups, including the US and EU, opposed this move.12 Furthermore, the clashes about carrying over carbon credits certified under the Kyoto Protocol to future commitments were also manifested in the conference. Due to this conflict of interest, the conference postponed all the relevant issues that the scientists highlighted as climate emergency. India at Madrid India is the third largest carbon emitter globally. However, its CO2 output (seven per cent) is far lower than both China (29 per cent) and the US (16 per cent). India's commitment under its NDC is to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP (GHG emissions per unit GDP)\~by 33-35 per cent over 2005 levels by 2030.13 Besides, India also pledged to ensure that 40 per cent of its installed power capacity is from non-fossil sources (renewables, hydroelectric and nuclear) by 2030 and introduced carbon tax on coal production. As per the latest\~UNEP Emission Gap Report, India is the only major country which is on track to meeting greenhouse gas emissions target. The report, in the case of India, also projects a potential overachievement of the target by more than 15 per cent.14 Moreover, India, for the first time, ranked among the top 10 in this year's\~Climate Change Performance Index\~presented at COP25 . According to Climate Action Tracker, if all countries were to follow India's approach, warming could be held below 2\'b0C. This spectacular performance owes several ambitious measures that the country adopted for clean and renewable energy, achieving lower emission intensity in the automobile and transport sector, non-fossil based electricity generation and building sector based on energy conservation. At Madrid, India's approach was guided by principles and provisions of the Paris Agreement, particularly the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). During the debates, India raised staunch criticism over the developed world's continuing poor record on climate action. It also argued that the country would not raise its climate ambition due in 2020 if the developed world continues its indifference towards climate emergency. Moreover, India took the lead in calling for more finance for the developing countries for climate action. However, the failure of COP25 to finalise the rules for developing a market for trading in carbon credits is a significant setback for the Indian renewable energy industry. Carbon trading is a market-based system aimed at reducing GHG emissions. The concept is to enable developed countries to pay for the advancement of low carbon projects in developing countries. Indian companies have accumulated about 345 million such carbon credits. Nevertheless, since this happened under an earlier climate agreement - the Kyoto Protocol - COP25 was expected to frame rules for a new global carbon market before the commencement of the post-2020 framework. If the new framework does not allow to carry over the old carbon credits, it would be a serious blow not only for India but for the future of climate negotiations since it is an issue of trust. Taking all these together, COP26, next year in Glasgow, will be more difficult to negotiate for India and the rest.

If we tackle this problem, we will see a noticeable increase in the growth of the green bond market"", says Juan Antonio Ketterer, Division Chief of the Connectivity, Markets and Finance Division at the IDB. ""Green bonds have become an important tool for the region to attract private capital and add greater transparency will help further broaden the market,"" added Ketterer. The platform, currently in its beta stage and set for official launch in 2020, will provide a greater level of confidence to current market participants and removes an important deterrent for the entrance of new market actors requiring greater transparency and comparability. The GBTP, which is expected to become a model for green bond markets in other regions, is supported by more than 30 organizations present at the announcement. The demand for greater transparency in this growing financial market segment is evidenced by a Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) analysis that shows that only 53 percent of surveyed issuers in the region reported on both the use of proceeds from their deals and their environmental impacts. The analysis also showed that only 27 percent chose to certify their bonds under the Climate Bonds Standard and just 1 percent provided post-issuance assurance on their use of proceeds and impacts. During the event, the IDB, IDB Invest, and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of the Federal Republic of Germany also signed a Joint Declaration of Intent supporting further growth and development of the green bond market in LAC. In addition to supporting the development of the GBTP, the agreement aims to provide technical assistance to clients in the region to support and promote domestic issuances; establish and promote ambitious regional standards and criteria for green bonds; and promote mechanisms to scale up green bond issuances in the region through anchor investments, de-risking and co-financing. The Joint Declaration of Intent was signed by Juan Antonio Ketterer on behalf of the IDB, Gema Sacristan, on behalf of IDB Invest and Dr. Heike Henn on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). A representative from the European Commission's Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development served as honorary witness of the ceremony.    About us The Inter-American Development Bank is devoted to improving lives. Established in 1959, the IDB is a leading source of long-term financing for economic, social and institutional development in Latin America and the Caribbean. The IDB also conducts cutting-edge research and provides policy advice, technical assistance and training to public and private sector clients throughout the region.

By incorporating reused and recycled materials in this project, RE-EARTH hopes to encourage viewers to question the sustainability and suitability of artistic materials. ""Human beings dominate the world,"" commented Chou. ""We take every essence of what mother earth has to offer, and now the earth is suffering as a result. We are the world, and we ought to be responsible for a better world."" Co-organized by World Climate Summit Asia partner- Verdancy, several professionals from different fields have also connected with this concept and come on board to join this project, including notable tree bark professional Lee Yung-Moo, organic farming expert George Hu, textile artist Lai Yi-Ping, and sculptors Wang Jian and Lo Ya-Yun. As a result of research conducted by the collective, input from experts, and an exchange of ideas, project RE-EARTH now comprises 7 globes of various sizes, all of which have been made of different recycled and reused waste materials, including discarded energy bills, recycled clothes, sponges, canvas threads, and dehydrated herbs. The main object in the art project is a globe of planet earth made of discarded coconut shells and tree bark from fallen tree branches. Chou and her team collected branches from paper mulberry trees from different seasons and latitudes. Then, the branches were pounded from top to bottom, which separated the bark from its center core. After this, every piece of bark went through a prolonged process of soaking and pounding until the bark pieces expanded and thin fibrous sheets of cloth were produced. According to Chou, every bark sheet had to be expanded until it was about 6 times larger in size, so that the material would become flexible enough to use. The core of the globe itself consisted of reshaped coconut shells, and the processed bark sheets were then glued on to the globe's core, piece by piece, in order to create various terrains and surfaces. ""It's time-consuming and requires a lot of patience,"" Chou said. ""We were not sure what it would look like, but we really like how the object turned out."" She continued, ""The different colors and textures of the bark sheets add certain distinctive characteristics to the piece. Nature really can do wonders, and the resulting artwork is more amazing than we ever could have imagined."" To encourage viewer participation, the RE-EARTH project team also created a signature cloth made of bark sheets and reused fabric. ""Everyone is welcome to 'reuse, reduce, and recycle,' and be the reason for a better planet earth,"" said Chou. ""We hope to collect as many signatures as possible with this, and this piece will be incorporated into our next project."" RE-EARTH will debut at the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , and specifically at the World Climate Summit on Sunday, December 8, at the Madrid Marriott Auditorium Hotel and Conference Center in Madrid, Spain. This year, WCS and Investment COP will bring together over 40 international partners and a leading cohort of speakers for discussions on a variety of topics, including building smart and sustainable cities, mobilizing investment for climate resilience, and accelerating the global transition to renewable energy.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA23","Climate activist Greta Thunberg lands in Lisbon ahead of COP25 climate summit","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","Stillman Advance: Stillman College","TEENAGE activist Greta Thunberg is set to arrive at a United Nations climate change conference The Swedish teen sailed to the Portuguese capital before heading to neighboring Spain to attend the U.N. Climate Change Conference taking place in Madrid. In September, Thunberg addressed the U.N. General Assembly in NY to berate world leaders, accusing them of having ""stolen my dreams and my childhood"". Thunberg, her father, and the crew aboard La Vagabonde sailed for 20 days from NY on a yacht that saved on carbon emissions and reduced their carbon footprint. Despite the grim statistics, young delegates said they were inspired by Ms Thunberg's determination to minimise her own carbon footprint by twice braving the Atlantic instead of flying - which they saw as a symbol of resourcefulness and defiance. ""We need that tremendous force in order to increase climate action"", she said. Some 20 activists cut off traffic in central Madrid and staged a brief theatrical performance to protest climate change. R.I.P. Andrew 'Greedy' Smith of Mental As Anything (1956-2019) Greedy was on the road with the current line up of the Mental's when he past away. Smith is survived by his son Harvey, fianc\'e9e Fiona Docker and brother Stuart. Members of the worldwide group Extinction Rebellion held up a banner in Russian that read: ""Climate Crisis"". Some activists jumped into a nearby fountain while others threw them life jackets. Thunberg's arrival in Lisbon coincides with the release of a bleak report by the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization. Levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide hit record levels a year ago, the World Meteorological Organisation has said. ""Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than the last"", the agency added. In a stark reminder that burning fossil fuels has fundamentally changed the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, the report said the concentration of carbon dioxide hit a record 407.8 parts per million in 2018 and rose again in 2019, hovering at the highest levels seen in millions of years. \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA25","IRRI, IFA SPARK DISCUSSION ON SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AT COP25","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI): The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), together with the International Fertilizer Association (IFA), organized Earth, Air, Fire, and Water: Elements for Sustainability at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , held last December 3, 2019 in Madrid, Spain. The session presented interventions categorized into the 4 ""elements"" that could contribute to both climate change adaptation and mitigation, from enhancing nutrients in the soil to developing varieties of crops that emit less greenhouse gases (GHG). The panel was comprised of Dr. Nafees Meah, IRRI Regional Representative for South Asia; Dr. Markus Schmid, IFA Member and BASF Head of Business Management - Nitrogen Management; Dr. Theo de Jager, World Farmers' Organization Chairman; and was moderated by Mr. Martijn Pakker, IRRI Senior Manager for Advocacy, Engagement, and Communication. In her keynote speech, Ms. Le Hoang Anh, member of the Vietnamese Government delegation to COP25 , highlighted how national policies could apply interventions in agriculture to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Climate change is already evident in various phenomena such as historic flooding, unprecedented droughts, and sea level rise. This can have a long term impact on human health, agriculture and food security, water resources, and the environment. In the context of agriculture, every 1C temperature increase will result in a 1.3% loss in economic growth and a 10% yield reduction in crops. With the global staple rice as an example, IRRI has defined a coherent research portfolio climate change emphasizing on three areas: adaptation, mitigation, and policy. This set rice production into the broader context of food supply and food security alongside socio-economic issues, such as rural development and gender mainstreaming. Rice is the staple food for more than half of humanity and the primary staple for more than two-thirds of the world's poor. By 2040, an extra 112 million tons of milled rice per year will be needed worldwide. Transforming rice-based agri-food systems is of prime importance. 'Financing sustainable rice for a secure future' video produced by the Earth Security Group identifies opportunities to adapt sustainable finance innovation to accelerate the rice sector's sustainable transition. As shown in the session, it proposes three innovative finance solutions to support sustainable rice production in line with countries' Paris Agreement climate targets which include issuing 'rice bonds' and leveraging global climate finance as practical pathways to attract private sector investment for climate-smart rice production. Other initiatives of IRRI include the development of climate-smart rice varieties that can tolerate adverse climate conditions, such as drought, flood, salinity, extreme temperatures, and poor soils. There are also water-saving and resource-efficient technologies and crop management systems that help reduce resource-use and input, such as micro-irrigation, direct seeding, and ICT tools like AutoMon. ""Alternate Wetting and Drying technology, which was developed by IRRI and its partners, addresses the twin problems of adaptation and mitigation through efficient water management,"" said Dr. Meah. ""It enables farmers to save on irrigation water by up to 30% and reduces methane emissions by 30""70% without yield loss."" @CropLifeIntl quoted Dr. Jager in a tweet, ""When you ask farmers what climate change is all about, the first answer would probably be about disaster. You don't have to convince farmers that climate change exists, no one is as vulnerable to it as they are!"" Also in a live tweet by @worldfarmersorg, Dr. de Jager said, ""No other economic actor can do more in a short window of time to mitigate and adapt to climate change than the farmers."" Dr. Schmid represented the global fertilizer industry by explaining the value of the 4Rs - applying the Right nutrient source at the Right rate, at the Right time, and in the Right place - and combining these with innovative technologies such as nitrification inhibitors to reduce Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions while maintaining high yields. ""Collaborations among research institutions, the private sector, governments, and national research and extension systems plays a vital role in ensuring that climate-responsive innovations and technologies reach those who need them the most,"" Mr. Pakker said. \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA27","COP25: 'Listen To Indigenous People'","December 13, 2019 Friday","Eurasia Review","Indigenous communities of the Amazon say they are being excluded from decision-making as COP25 climate talks hone in on carbon markets. Establishing an effective and fair global carbon market is one of the key aims of the UN climate summit taking place in Madrid (2\- 13 December 2019). But spokespeople for indigenous groups of the Amazon say that placing such emphasis on carbon markets treats forests as commodities rather than areas of unique biodiversity and cultural heritage. Many representatives of these communities feel that despite the rhetoric of a ""just transition"" to low-carbon economies, the prevailing approach still protects business interests over native communities. The 25thsummit of the UN's conference of the parties ( COP 25 ) is the final one ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines set by the 2015 Paris agreement \- when many nations must submit new climate action plans. The Paris accord set the global goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. With the COP 25 conference in its final days, negotiations are focused on breaking the deadlock around rules for carbon markets under article 6 of the Paris agreement. Carbon markets allow high carbon-emitting countries to buy carbon credits from countries that haven't exceeded their emissions targets. The aim is to reduce the overall cost of meeting the targets, but critics say it allows richer countries to dodge responsibility for cutting their own emissions. COP 25 is taking place under the presidency of Chile, even though the location was switched to the Spanish capital due to civil unrest in Santiago. As such, Latin American issues have featured strongly in the programme and spokespeople for indigenous groups of the Amazon have voiced their concerns about the UN climate negotiation process. Many groups feel that despite the rhetoric, indigenous communities are still not being directly included in decisions that ultimately affect their territories. Ferm\'edn Chimatani, president of Anecap Per\'fa, an indigenous association representing the 10 communal reserves of Peru, said: ""It's important to recognise the contribution that we make together, all the indigenous communities of the Amazon basin. It's important to see us as keys to the government discussions about climate change."" Deforestation and forest degradation through fires are the biggest imminent threats to Amazonian communities. According to the World Wildlife Fund, around 17 per cent of the Amazon rainforest has been lost in the past 50 years, mainly due to clearance for cattle ranching but also because of mining and hydroelectric projects. To encourage the preservation of forests worldwide, the parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established the REDD+ programme in 2005. Rather than legally binding rules, REDD+ is a set of guidelines to protect these vital carbon sinks through a variety of forest management options. Critics, however, have pointed out shortcomings of REDD+ in its application. Indeed, the UN itself acknowledged some of the issues via the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Climate Change and Land, published in August 2019. Studies highlighted in that report conclude that at a local level, indigenous people have not been sufficiently involved in the planning and distribution of benefits of REDD+ projects. That is also the conclusion of Robinson Lop\'e9z, the coordinator for climate change and biodiversity of COICA, an organisation that represents indigenous groups from nine countries in the Amazon basin. ""The governments have to recognise the historical work of our communities in conserving our territories. People that cooperate with us should guarantee that we receive resources directly to strengthen the livelihoods of people in these communities."" COICA has developed a proposalfor a regional consultationprotocol for indigenous voices to be included in climate plans. It has also declared a climate emergency in the nine nations represented by the organisation. COP 25 . Former US vice-president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore spoke on Tuesday (10 December) about forest degradation due to intentional fires in the Amazon. In a packed media briefing on Monday (9 December), climate activist Greta Thunberg appeared alongside members of native communities from South America, North America and Africa. ""It is so important that we listen to indigenous people because they are suffering and their rights have been violated across the world and they are also among those who will be hit the most,"" she said. Away from the conference itself, Thunberg and the indigenous Brazilian activist S\'f4nia Guajajara were among the speakers at a climate demonstration in central Madrid on Friday (6 December) which organisers say attracted around 500 000 people. The post COP25 \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA28","QA: COP25: Where do we go from here?","Digital Journal","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 14, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex) With catastrophic climate change on the horizon, more than 60 countries have set goals[1] to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, but the world's largest emitters have remained relatively quiet. To change this, representatives from 200-plus countries met in Madrid for the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference [2] (also known as COP25 ) in hopes of reaching key agreements on international climate action. In order to limit the rising of the global temperature, worldwide emissions need to fall 50 percent by 2030. In order to reach this target, COP25 will need to focus on strengthening greenhouse gas reduction commitments from countries that are behind the target. Shuli Goodman[3], Executive Director of LF Energy[4] talks to Digital Journal about how while setting international climate targets is a necessary start, based on history these goals tend to be ineffective. Digital Journal: How realistic are the international climate change targets? Shuli Goodman: These international climate change targets are an obvious challenge, but I have faith that we will innovate and succeed. Previously, it was a funny thing to say that humans would put a man on the moon, yet they did it. How realistic was it that we would create the internet or a global telecommunications network? Think about the world you have on your phone. All of these things were stretch goals. But we did it and meeting these international climate targets is what we now have to do. DJ: Why are global climate change meetings rarely effective? Goodman: For climate action there needs to be a strong alignment between policy and markets. And, we have not been able collectively at a planetary level to develop the will to respond. In general, humans are not very good at responding to imminent danger. Change is the tiger in the bushes, And, until the tiger jumps out, we aren't very likely to respond as quickly as possible. In my PhD, I asked the question, 'why aren't we changing?' and 'why are we unwilling to jump into the unknown unless the house is on fire?' Uncertainty and the unknown is very challenging to us as a species. So in some ways, we are up against the way we are wired. Also, as long as it is possible for oil and gas companies to continue to make profits, they are going to do everything they possibly can to mitigate the actions of response, even if there is a collective will. Global climate change meetings are rarely effective because there's no cost for failing to act. If these companies fail to meet the goals set in climate change meetings, what's the consequence? Until they come up with a market-based plan around carbon, I think it is going to be very difficult. But I think we are on the cusp of it. There has to be a market solution and companies need to figure out how to hold others accountable. DJ: Will COP25 have a significant impact? Goodman: I believe that COP25 is the beginning of a transition that is starting to happen between arguing 'do we need to do something' and now opening up a new decade where we have 10 years to essentially begin to decrease carbon emissions by 7.5% every single year. People are moving from 'Do we have to do something?' to 'What are we going to do?' That's how COP25 will be seen as in the future when we look back, that it was the watershed where we actually started thinking about what solutions we are actually putting in place. DJ: What are the main risks to the planet from climate change? What happens if countries fail to act? Goodman: The biggest challenge climate change poses is the threat of extinction. We've reached the limits of being able to ignore the threats to our society and the size of the planet is going to shrink if we fail to act. Physically, the circumference isn't going to change. But habitable places will shrink - the world will get much smaller, if you will. It will lead to tremendous instability of governments and economies as well as mass starvation. That will put hundreds of millions of people in the path of a massive migration which is impossible. It will lead to utter chaos for billions of people. That's what we have to consider. DJ: What do governments need to change? Goodman: Governments need to set policy so that citizens and companies respond. Ideally, there should be a financial mechanism such as carbon taxes. I think that should affect businesses and individuals so they can see the impact that their consumption patterns are making on the environment. Depending on where you live, that's more or less problematic. If you live in the U.S., it's incredibly problematic. If you live in sub-Saharan Africa, your carbon impact is probably not high. If you live in Denmark, you are probably moving in the right direction but it's still painful. DJ: How about businesses, what should they be doing? Goodman: This market mechanism can really drive what people will do. Electricity is typically a monopoly, but I do think it is possible to reach 100% decarbonization of electricity and 100% decarbonization of transportation. But, part of what makes that probable is the degree to which businesses and individuals respond. The most painful position that individuals have is the lack of feeling that what we do actually makes an impact. But, I do believe that individual actions do become and contribute to global solutions. I've seen this in my lifetime, when groups of people have been able to effectively change something that have fundamentally changed people's lives, like gay marriage which was far out of reach 30 years ago. Individuals can make a difference. DJ: What should system operators be doing? Goodman: Stop trying to go it alone! We have to solve these problems together. Because system operators represent a natural monopoly, they have been regulated and dominated by the incumbent hardware vendors like GE, Siemens, Schneider Electric, and ABB. The vendors have a vested interest in blocking interoperability, and keeping software proprietary. They like their 50 year contracts! Of course they do, but it is suffocating innovation, slowing scaling, and there is not a single example of an industry transformation where proprietary has been left standing. If you speak to nearly any system operator, they will all share how they feel held hostage by their vendors. The only way to shift this is if end-users - utilities and commercial and industrial customers finally say 'no'. Join LF Energy. There is a place at the table for all of you. We can do this, together. DJ: And what, if anything, can individuals do? Goodman: Individuals need to vote with their dollars. Every dollar we spend is for that future. So, if you fundamentally shift where you are voting with your dollars every day, then you are positively affecting climate change. Do you buy meat? Dairy? Do you buy organic? Do you buy local? Or do you own a gas guzzling car? Do you insulate your house or use renewable energy from your utility? All those choices and dollars are critical. The most powerful leverage points individuals have is what they do with their dollars. That power gets translated to businesses who believe they can do whatever they want to do. The more active individuals are in communicating, the more effective change is. It's kind of a no-brainer. You have to vote with your dollars. That's why I started LF Energy. Part of making climate harming companies irrelevant is making renewable energy and resources so cheap that no one wants to spend money fracking and mining for coal. It all comes down to economics. If we can provide renewable energy for net-zero cost, then it's an obvious choice, individuals and businesses will make the transition.

Bringing together governments, NGOs, UN organizations, experts and the private sector, COP 25 is an opportunity to agree on a decisive, ambitious way forward. The conference is designed to take the next crucial steps towards the full operationalization of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The conference furthermore serves to build ambition ahead of 2020, the year in which countries have committed to submit new and updated national climate action plans. Crucial climate action work will be taken forward in areas including finance, the transparency of climate action, forests and agriculture, technology, capacity building, loss and damage, indigenous peoples, cities, the ocean and gender. Currently, not enough is being done to meet the three climate goals: reducing emissions 45 per cent by 2030; achieving climate neutrality by 2050 (which means a net zero carbon footprint), and stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5 C by the end of the century. Because the clock is ticking on climate change, UNESCO is putting its expertise at the service of Member States and working in close synergy with the overall UN system to enable bold, effective climate action.

Unfortunately, the results of the just-concluded negotiations do no such thing, coming nowhere close to the speed and scale the Paris Agreement demands. Investors, companies, cities and states in the U.S. and beyond are stepping up to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and aiming for net-zero emissions before 2050. National governments must do the same, both at home and through shared implementation of the Paris Agreement. History will judge harshly the failure of global governments to take action at the pace and scale required, particularly the federal government of the United States -- the country that has produced more climate change-causing pollution than any other.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA32","COP 25: HIGH HOPES BUT DISAPPOINTING CONCLUSIONS IN MADRID","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Elders: On Sunday 15 December, the UN's longest-ever climate summit drew to a close after an additional 44 hours of tough negotiations. While a final compromise agreement was achieved, the weeks of negotiations, side events and grassroots actions failed to solidify the commitments to ambitious action that needs to be taken if we are to avert the worst of the impacts of the climate emergency. The Elders' engagement at the 25th Climate COP in Madrid focused on three key areas: gender equality in climate decision-making, the importance of intergenerational dialogue, and the urgent need for countries to stop investing in, and financing, fossil fuels. Throughout the summit, The Elders also continued to push for the ratification of the Escaz Agreement, a treaty between Latin American and Caribbean nations to promote justice for environmental defenders, create access to information on climate and environmental issues and to advance the sharing of information and resources between nations. The Elders call for a shift in investment Ministers and diplomats in Madrid were under pressure to boost climate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow, UK, in November 2020. But a failure to reach consensus on some of the key issues weakened the final decisions on ambition. The Elders continued to speak out on the importance of countries delivering the ""fundamental shift in our economic and financial model that is needed to deliver the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals"" (Mary Robinson, COP25 ). ""We need action to deliver a truly just transition, so that regions and communities previously reliant on fossil fuel production for jobs and broader economic and social structures are not abandoned, that workers' rights and dignity are respected, and that new opportunities are provided through investment and education for current and future generations."" Mary Robinson spoke at the F20 event at COP25 about the role of sustainable finance and impact investment for the implementation of the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement: ""The role of the financial and investment community is critical... Its insights, innovation and influence can play a decisive role in pushing political actors to show real climate leadership."" Ricardo Lagos spoke at a special Panel Event on 'The Role of Public Finance for Climate Action in Context of a New Climate Finance Goal' about the need for finance ministers to be urgently engaged with the issue of climate financing: ""#TimeForAction means asking, where is the money? Because it is very difficult to have action without financing it."" Throughout proceedings, including at two UN High Level events, The Elders also stressed the importance of not only investing in low carbon technologies for a more sustainable future, but also in promoting a just transition that ensures no one is left behind. While COP25 There was some good news offered by the business community at COP25 , with more than 170 major companies committing to set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets through the 'Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees' campaign. Alongside the UN Secretary-General, Mary Robinson issued the charge for business leaders to continue to mobilise and put pressure on governments for more collective action: ""Business must work with industry peers, governments, labour unions and civil society to unlock opportunities and address technological and market challenges as we all move to the goal of a net zero world by 2050."" In climate talks that could boast few other successes, one significant accomplishment was the approval of a new Gender Action Plan that strengthens gender considerations and women's participation in climate action. The Elders contributed in a number of events during the Madrid summit including the Gender and Climate Change event hosted by the Spanish Government and the High Level Panel Event on Gender, highlighting the important role of women as decision-makers and as agents of change. Speaking on Gender Day at COP25 in Madrid, Mary Robinson called for inclusivity to be lived out in the actions we all take when tackling the climate emergency. The Elders also published a special Gender Day blog by Dr Katharine Wilkinson on the need for climate leadership that is ""more faithfully feminine and more faithfully feminist."" The Escaz Agreement gains momentum at COP 25 At a COP25 event entitled, 'Advancing Climate Action through Escaz Agreement Standards in Latin America and the Caribbean', Mary Robinson spoke about the unique and historic achievement of the Escaz Agreement, and the need for its early ratification. This followed a number of interventions by The Elders in the weeks leading up to the COP on the Agreement including a robust call to action by Elder Zeid Raad Al Hussein published in O Globo and El Pais. Fellow Elder, Juan Manuel Santos commented after Columbia decided to sign the agreement during the Summit: In the coming months The Elders will continue to call on Latin American and Caribbean leaders to sign and ratify the Agreement. As the first legally binding regional environmental and human rights agreement designed to ensure rights to environmental information, public participation in environmental decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, The Elders believe it offers an important model to the rest of the world. Environmental defenders who expose ecological destruction and human rights abuses are at particular risk, the Agreement uniquely provides special protection for them. The intergenerational injustice of climate change COP25 , youth activists and campaigners spoke with a clear voice both inside High Level talks, and outside on the streets, on the need for consensus and decisive action. Mary Robinson spent time in dialogue with young activists Xiye Bastida and Sophie Anderson learning about their perspectives on the climate crisis. She was struck by way Xiye, a leader of the Fridays for Future youth climate strike in New York, spoke of the urgency of changing the narrative on the crisis so that people would understand climate change is affecting people now it is not a distant threat. Mary Robinson moderated a special climate summit panel that encouraged intergenerational dialogue between ministers and young climate activists organised by UNICEF and OHCHR. The event marked the launch of an Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action, urging Member States to commit to accelerating inclusive child-responsive climate action as part of their nationally determined contributions, including measures to enhance youth participation in decision-making. At COP25 ""The children have called out the adult world, called us out very effectively, as this is a grave injustice. When I was growing up I did not have that shadow [of climate breakdown]. It's not fair that we have made children have that fear."" The Elders also held a number of meetings during COP25 with climate negotiators, UNFCCC representatives, the Environmental Minister of Japan Shinjiro Koizumi, and civil society groups and activists. In all these engagements The Elders stressed that the urgency of a collective response to the climate emergency. In just 11 months' time, COP26 will be held in Glasgow. This COP marks the 5-year point when countries must submit new and increased ""Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)"" which state their intended ratcheting up of domestic contributions to global efforts. Unless there is substantial improvement in climate action and ambition the gap forming between political reality and the demands of people protesting around the world will only widen. The Elders reaffirm their call for urgent climate action to limit global warming to 1.5C. \"

The disappointing news for common people hoping to tour the palace reinforced what many of already know. The United Nations bureaucracy has a pretty good gig set up for all their globe-trotting climate conferences and other UN perks. Several times each year, the UN climate class arranges conferences all over the world in desirable tourist destinations. UN participants enjoy wonderful vacations and exclusive access to special events. Taxpayers throughout the world, meanwhile, are stuck with the bill. Ultimately, the United Nations and its bureaucracy has a tremendous self-interest in perpetuating the idea of a climate crisis.

Today marks the beginning of the COP 25 , a pivotal international summit on the climate crisis, being held in Madrid, Spain. This meeting almost didn't happen - there were many challenges and obstacles to face. But organizers and world leaders made an important choice: We can't wait for tomorrow to make decisions about a climate crisis that threatens the health, well-being, and survival of people and communities in every nation on Earth right now. Sea levels are rising. Wildfires and severe storms are becoming increasingly intense and frequent. Climate change is real, it is happening now, and ASLA supports the United Nations' dedication to addressing the climate crisis before us. ASLA is a proud signatory of the We Are Still In Declaration, calling on U.S. leaders to fulfill the nation's commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement. We were disappointed that this Administration filed official paperwork to withdraw the U.S. from that agreement, and sincerely hope they reverse this decision. Landscape architects understand that ""climate change"" isn't just a term on a page it's a constant reality in their work. They use nature-based solutions to plan and design projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make communities more resilient to climate impacts. They design green roofs, green complete streets, living shorelines, and other forms of green infrastructure projects that both sequester greenhouse gases and manage water and air quality. Landscape architects, working with nature, design smart climate solutions for all communities - and those are exactly the kind of solutions we need right now. ASLA is proud to support the goals and principles of the COP 25 and urge all leaders in the United States and around the world to act with a profound sense of urgency merited by the crisis we face.

Its policies have prompted resistance by Amazon indigenous and traditional rural populations.Environment Minister Ricardo Salles represented one face of Brazil at COP25 , speaking publicly twice at the summit, and focusing mostly on agribusiness and economic development opportunities in Amazonia.Indigenous peoples and other activists showed a very different face at COP25 , emphasizing government failures to protect the environment as well as indigenous and traditional peoples living in the Amazon. Half a million climate protesters take to the streets of Madrid while national delegations negotiate inside COP25 . Image by Camila Nobrega.MADRID, Spain  Originally scheduled to host the 2019 UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP25 ), Brazil entered the global media spotlight in November 2018 when newly elected president Jair Bolsonaro backed out[1] of the event, even before taking office. Then came the stunning images in August of extensive Amazon fires[2], reported along with a 30% increase in deforestation under Bolsonaro  tree loss that some attribute[3] to the president's inflammatory rhetoric. COP25 , after first being shifted from Brazil to Chile, finally landed In Madrid, where over the last two weeks Brazilian attendees seemed display at least two different  diametrically opposed  faces. On the one hand, there's the Bolsonaro administration which will sign any new UN agreements coming out of this COP, and on the other, are the peoples living in the rainforest raising their voices in an attempt to influence policy. Press conferences, debates and conversations at COP pavilions, along with protest signs raised during street demonstrations, denounced the nation's Amazon degradation, while praising the leading role of indigenous peoples in promoting forest preservation and diverse sustainable livelihoods. Meanwhile, Government representatives seemed to be talking about a different country. Brazil's delegation, led by Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, advocated Amazon development and rapid agribusiness expansion.Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles speaks at COP25 . Image by Camila Nobrega. Silence over fires and murders In the COP25 plenary on Tuesday, December 10, Minister Salles presented himself as a representative of over 20 million people living in the Amazon region, highlightingit as the land with the 'biggest biodiversity in the world, with 60% of native forest preserved.' He did not address denunciations by activists concerning the increase in deforestation or escalating violence toward traditional populations. In his first public appearance at COP25 on Monday, December 9, Salles focused on Brazil's agribusiness sector: 'When I hear about [farmers and ranchers] making the areas already opened more efficient, this is the right vision. Better technologies, better conditions, this is one of the factors that discourages the opening of new areas [to deforestation]. Besides that, something directly connected to our position here at COP25 , the monetization of environmental services.' Salles did not respond to questions about the murder[4] of two indigenous representatives, Raimundo and Firmino Guajajara, on Saturday December 7, on the BR-226 highway, between the municipalities of Boa Vista and El Betel, in Maranho state. But a minute of silence was held in honor of the two at the event. Nor did the minister comment on data[5] showing surging deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The minister's Monday speech didn't take place at the Brazilian government booth, a major presence at past COPs. That's because the Bolsonaro administration decided against having one. Instead, Salles spoke from a space organized by Brazilian civil society. The Brazilian delegation at COP25 works out of a small, inconspicuous office, a blue cube whose door always seems closed and locked. For the first time since 1992, the government denied accreditation to civil society to take part in the official delegation. Brazil's divided personality was especially on display at the Monday speechmaking event: Salles, with his Amazon pro-development views, talked just after Caetanno Scannavino, coordinator of the Sa\'fade e Alegria project, one of the socioenvironmental NGOs recently targeted by a government investigation, with the seizure of its computers by the Military Police of Par. As part of that same law enforcement operation, four volunteer forest firefighters in Alter do Cho municipality were arrested[6] for allegedly starting Amazon fires in September. The four, members of a local socioenvironmental NGO, have since been released with the legitimacy of the charges questioned due to lack of evidence, raising concerns about the criminalization of social movements in Brazil. 'Obviously, we did not set fire to the forest. We had a nightmare!' Scavinno joked. Jonia Wapichana, an indigenous federal deputy, criticized the Bolsonaro government's silence on indigenous rights: 'I would like to talk about Brazil as a country of life protection. But we are living with omission, and fear of listening to the indigenous population.' Energized by the support they've been getting from the government, Brazilian agribusiness representatives hyped 'Rural Producers: The Great Environmental Partner,' and participated in COP debates promoting the use of agribusiness technologies to expand croplands.Resistance by climate activists is growing stronger as developed and developing nations, including Brazil, look likely to fall short of meeting their carbon reduction pledges set under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Image by Camila Nobrega. Opposing viewpoints on land regularizationCOP25 is especially focused on finalizing mechanisms for an international carbon market. In response, the Brazilian government talked solely about efficiency and technology, especially relating to agribusiness. The subject of land regularization was covered too, though mostly as it benefits rural producers, with no mention of the land rights of traditional populations. Bolsonaro, absent at COP25 , continues to assert that there will be no new demarcation[7] of indigenous lands, and that he wants to pass laws allowing mining[8] and agribusiness[9] within indigenous reserves, currently outlawed. After the first Salles event, the President of the Brazilian Senate, Davi Alcolumbre, told the press in Madrid: 'Self-declaration is the way to simplification.' He was referring to a just announced Bolsonaro presidential provisional measure greatly easing regulations for registering Amazon land claims, with little proof required by potential land grabbers wishing to occupy and clear forestlands held in common by the government. So called 'self-declaration' of land ownership is very controversial, especially in a country with 18 different land registries, and millions of hectares where conflicting and overlapping land claims occur often between indigenous and traditional communities (with sustainable forest livelihoods), and elite outsiders (who wish to profit from forest conversion to croplands and pasture). Experts warn that self-declaration has the potential for extensive fraud, land grabs, and increased rural conflict and violence.Sonia Guajajara, representative of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), participates in a COP25 panel. Image by Camila Nobrega. 500,000 march in Madrid, land rights a priorityAnother face of Brazil was presented in the Climate March, which brought half a million people into the streets of Madrid last Friday under the banner of climate justice, with the additional theme of rural land rights. The protest was organized in partnership with the Social Climate Summit, taking place in parallel with COP25 at the Complutense University of Madrid. Youth activist Greta Thunberg and actor Javier Bardem were prominent during the march, but so were indigenous protestors. Among them, Sonia Guajajara, representative of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), who, on stage at march's end, declared: 'Bolsonaro is not just a problem for Brazil. The Amazon is burning and its defenders and our livelihoods are being murdered!' The indigenous leader also commented on Salles' Monday speech in a later COP25 interview: 'We are obliged to hear from the minister that we have to take care of people, while the murder of indigenous people and invasions of our lands are increasing, and Brazil stands against the inclusion of human rights[10] in Article 6,' she said, referring to the mechanism for regulating carbon markets under the Paris Agreement, the main focus of rulemaking at this COP. Preliminary data from 2019 from the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI) indicate that in the first nine months of Bolsonaro's administration, 160 cases of invasion of indigenous lands were registered  twice the number as last year. CIMI President Antonio Eduardo de Oliveira commented to Mongabay: 'We regret the position of the Brazilian government  a backlash contrary to the protection of our future and the planet, and [falsely] placing indigenous peoples as an obstacle to progress. The government's policy goes against the federal constitution [of 1988] and the [international] treaties[11] to which Brazil is a signatory.' A representative of the Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB), Tabea Casique Coronado, said Brazil has an enormous responsibility to protect the Amazon, both at home and also at the COP negotiations, 'But the government does not dialogue with traditional Latin American populations.'

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA38","University of Saskatchewan: World is 'Losing Its Cool' With Loss of Snowpacks and Glaciers, Posing Threats to Water Security","December 11, 2019 Wednesday 1:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The University of Saskatchewan issued the following news release: At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain ( COP25 ), University of Saskatchewan (USask) scientists are focusing attention on the world's changing mountain snowpacks, glaciers, vegetation, and long-term effects that the thaw of snow and ice are having on the world's freshwater and ocean water. ""The substantial change that loss of snowpacks and glaciers is having on the planet is something the international scientific and policy community needs to address quite urgently,"" said John Pomeroy, Canada Research Chair in Climate Change and Water Resources at USask. ""These changes have led and will continue to cause serious unsustainability of freshwater as a result of the impact of climate change on the planet,"" Pomeroy, who is attending the meeting as a United Nations Observer and as a delegate for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ""The global warming that has already occurred has caused massive changes in our freshwater supply. It is disturbing to see world leaders struggling to find ways to hold warming to 1.5 Celsius, when 1.5 Celsius of further warming is too much for our snow and ice."" John Pomeroy, who is director of the USask-led Global Water Futures program, is joined at COP25 by a Canadian delegation that includes Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change Jonathan Wilkinson. Pomeroy is presenting invited talks on the Hydrological Impacts of Climate Change: Mountains, Glaciers, Snow and The Impact of a Melting Cryosphere on Our Water Futures. He noted that snow and ice support rivers that supply water for over half of humanity, including over two billion people in Asia. ""As we lose our snow and ice, floods can happen anytime of the year, droughts can be more severe, and our hydrological stability is lost. Our rivers become much more dangerous, more variable and less predictable without snow and ice,"" he said. The special sessions on snow and ice are hosted by the WMO at the Cryosphere Pavilion and UNESCO at the Sustainable Development Goals Pavilion at COP25 . COP25 represents a key juncture as countries focus on initiatives to promote more ambitious climate action, both mitigation and adaptation. He said these changes to the cryosphere (the frozen water part of the Earth system) have led to unsustainability of freshwater, even where it is abundant. ""We are failing to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals relating to water and climate in mountains and cold regions,"" said Pomeroy in his concluding remarks at COP25 . ""This threatens our ecosystems and our civilization."" About Global Water Futures: Global Water Futures is a seven-year, University of Saskatchewan-led research program established within the Global Institute for Water Security in 2016 and funded in part by a $77.8-million grant from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund. The research goal is to transform the way communities, governments and industries in Canada and other cold regions of the world prepare for and manage increasing water-related threats. GWF is the world's largest and most cited university-led freshwater research program. The program is developed and funded in part by three key partners--the University of Waterloo, McMaster University, and Wilfrid Laurier University--and includes hundreds of faculty, researchers and support staff, hundreds of partners, and 15 Canadian universities.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA39","Chile protests make ASU UN delegation change plans","November 13, 2019 Wednesday","The State Press: Arizona State University","By Wyatt Myskow | 1 hour ago Nine ASU students were planning to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Chile this December, but after the relocation of the conference due to protests in the country, students had to scramble to rebook flights and housing. The students were selected to be delegates representing the university at the conference, also known as COP-25 . ""There isn't a compromise in Chile right now,"" Connor Murphy, an ASU delegate and second year J.D candidate, said. ""People were kind of betting it would work itself out and it just didn't. Everyone was hedging their bets on the idea that it will work out, and that it will blow over."" Murphy acknowledged the location change was to keep the conference attendees safe. Spain quickly offered to host the conference in Madrid, and the event will be hosted there during the same time that was scheduled in Chile, December 2-13. Our new official # COP25 logo has been released today. CHILE :flag-cl: keeps the presidency of the Climate Conference by the @UNFCCC and Spain :es: is the new host country. The Conference will take place from the 2nd to the 13th of December at the Feria de Madrid, IFEMA. #TimeForAction pic.twitter.com/XcsnsyYay6 - COP25 (@COP25CL) November 8, 2019 The ASU delegates themselves have found new ways to get to Spain after having already booked flights and an Airbnb in Chile. Each of the student delegates has had different experiences getting their money back, which has all largely come out of pocket for them. The Airbnb was easily refunded, Murphy said, but the flight tickets refund policy varied for each student based on who they booked with and how long ago they had purchased them. ""Very luckily I had booked my flight the day before, and so I was able to get my full refund,"" said Tammy Nguyen, a senior sustainability major and delegate. Other delegates were not as lucky. Senior sustainability major Hailey Campbell's plane ticket was unable to be refunded, costing her even more money than anticipated, she said. ""At least one person I know can no longer attend due to the situation,"" Campbell said. ""That was also me up until about a day ago when my mom and my grandparents offered to pay the fees so that I could still go."" READ MORE: ASU students represent Urban Climate Research Center at UN convention Some are less excited about it being in Madrid. ""I thought that it was amazing it was in Chile because it's often thought of a less industrialized place, so therefore the perspective changes in a county more likely to be affected by climate change,"" Campbell said. ""... I was more excited to attend in Chile just for the perspective alone, but I still think it will be amazing in Spain."" The delegation all around is still excited for the opportunity. ""As crazy as this whole process has been, I think it's inspiring,"" Murphy said. ""Globally everyone is still committed to Climate Change that moving it, and finding a way to make it happen, happened.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA40","Spain Steps In To Host COP25 Climate Summit As Greta Asks For A Lift","International Business Times News","Newstex Blogs ","Nov 01, 2019( International Business Times News: HYPERLINK http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex) Spain will host the COP25 climate summit in December, the UN said on Friday, after Chile abandoned plans to hold it due to deadly anti-government protests.Some 25,000 delegates had been expected in Chile for COP 25 , including teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.""We are pleased to announce the COP Bureau has agreed that COP25 will take place from 2-13 December in Madrid,"" United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa said on Twitter.Thunberg, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved and had already made it halfway from Sweden to Chile for the summit by boat, train and electric car when the new venue was announced, turned to social media to ask for a lift to Madrid. ""It turns out I've travelled half around the world, the wrong way:)...If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,"" she tweeted from Los Angeles. After street protests, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said his country was not in a position to host the COP25 climate summit in December Photo: AFP / Martin BERNETTI Following more than 10 days of street protests, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said Thursday his country was not in a position to host either the December 2-13 climate convention or the November 16-17 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.""This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that has been deeply painful because we know exactly how important APEC and COP are for Chile and the world,"" said Pinera.He added that Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had offered to host the COP 25 climate summit in Madrid on the original scheduled dates.In a tweet Sanchez, who is gearing up for a repeat general election on November 10, called Espinosa's announcement that Madrid would host the event ""excellent news"", adding Spain was already working to prepare the gathering. 'Real barriers' Harjeet Singh of environmental group ActionAid International said moving the summit from Chile to Spain ""with only four weeks' notice presents real barriers to participation"" for delegates from the southern hemisphere.

Photo: AFP / Dario INGIUSTO ""Hotels in Madrid are already full. Last minute flights are expensive. Visas can be difficult to obtain at short notice. This sudden decision is likely to shift the balance of power towards the wealthier countries of the global North,"" he added in a statement.It is the second time that UN authorities have had to scramble to find a new meeting place. Brazil originally welcomed the gathering then backed out after right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January.APEC said it supported Chile's decision but gave no indication there would be a replacement summit this year, saying only that Malaysia would host the 2020 event.Chile is grappling with its worst social crisis in decades, one that shows little sign of abating despite Pinera announcing a raft of measures aimed at placating protesters.Demonstrators have demanded that the 69-year-old right-wing leader -- whose personal fortune is estimated by Forbes at $2.8 billion -- step down.They have been angered by low salaries and pensions, poor public health care and education, and a yawning gap between rich and poor. Arson and looting Pinera announced last week an increase in the minimum wage and pensions as well as measures to alleviate sky-high health care costs and a streamlining of public offices.Protests began on October 18 and during the first few days there was widespread destruction, arson and looting.Demonstrations have been largely calm over the past week but there were violent clashes between demonstrators and security services on Monday, when shops were looted and a building set on fire.Twenty people have been confirmed killed in the unrest. Chilean prosecutors said Wednesday they were investigating a total of 23 deaths thought to be linked to the crisis.A mission led by the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights Michelle Bachelet -- Chile's former president -- is expected to open a probe later this week into allegations of police brutality. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA41","Heartland Institute Challenges COP25","The Heartlander","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 13, 2019( The Heartlander: HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news Delivered by Newstex) Once again showing the speed with which The Heartland Institute can adapt to changing climate policy conditions, Heartland brought a heavy dose of sound science and climate realism to the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). COP 25 had to change locations from Chile to Spain at very short notice (after it had already changed locations from Brazil to Chile), after riots erupted around the country in protest to energy price hikes to pay for Chile's climate change programs, forcing Chilean President Sebastian Pinera to put troops on the streets and cancel his plans to host COP 25 .With less than a month to shift Heartland's planned conference from Chile to Spain, the team got it done in spectacular fashion, hosting a Climate Reality Forum event in Madrid on December 3 with an impressive lineup of speakers from Canada, Chile, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Headlining the event was award-winning physicist Will Happer, Ph.D., the former top science advisor to President Donald Trump. Happer's presentation documented human greenhouse gas emissions are having much less impact on global temperatures than predicted by alarmist climate theory and are certainly not causing a climate crisis. Happer described the many beneficial effects of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, including a dramatic greening of the Earth as more carbon dioxide serves as aerial fertilizer for crops and vegetation.Discussing his time working for Trump, Happer said the president firmly agrees with climate realists that humans are not causing a climate crisis. Trump's political advisors, however, particularly those in charge of his reelection campaign, have encouraged him to deemphasize climate change. Nevertheless, Happer expressed confidence Trump will continue to advance a sound-science agenda if he wins a second term.Meteorologist Anthony Watts, a Heartland Institute senior fellow, showed the majority of official temperature stations are corrupted by artificial heat sources and other factors, giving the appearance of more warming than is measured by global satellites instruments and weather balloons.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane researcher Stanley Goldenberg explained there is no evidence indicating hurricanes are becoming more frequent or severe as the planet warms. Goldenberg pointed out even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges this. The IPCC's 2018 Interim Report states, 'There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration).'Chilean civil engineer Douglas Pollack noted the Chilean government's climate policies have made the nation's electricity prices the highest in South America. The government's price increase for the country's Metro system, the main mode of transportation for the urban poor, to pay for its switch to being run on expensive renewable power was the last straw, resulting in the protests and riots that ultimately forced Pinera, in consultation with the UNFCCC, to cancel Chile's hosting of COP 25 , Pollack said. Neither Pinera nor the UNFCCC could afford the public black eye of climate-policy-induced civil unrest outside of COP 25 's meeting halls and the hotels where the envoys were staying.Nineteen-year-old German YouTube personality Naomi Seibt closed out the forum, chronicling how she transformed from believing in a climate crisis to being a climate realist. After fact-checking the assertions of her teachers and the media, she realized propaganda was triumphing over science in the climate change debate.'I was an innocent young girl, and I thought that by hugging trees I could save the planet,' said Seibt. 'It is important we keep questioning the narrative that is out there instead of promoting it.'These days, climate change science really isn't science at all. They draw their conclusions before even testing their hypotheses, and they base their assumptions on completely incoherent models, which is just an insult to science itself,' Seibt said.By almost any measure, Heartland's Climate Reality Forum was a rousing success. In just 10 days, videos from the event generated more than 280,000 views on YouTube, more than 4,000 comments, and 14,000 'likes' (resulting in a positive rating of 97 percent). The event was covered by dozens of news outlets both internationally and in the United States, such as France TV, De Telegraph and the JAS Newsletter in the Netherlands, Spain's Diary Now, and Breitbart News, the Daily Kos, and the Washington Times.Full video of the 2019 Climate Reality Forum presentations can be seen at HYPERLINK https://climaterealityforum.com https://climaterealityforum.com HYPERLINK https://climaterealityforum.com https://climaterealityforum.com HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int https://unfccc.int / [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK https://climaterealityforum.com https://climaterealityforum.com HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/chile-riots-offer-more-proof-public-rejects-costly-climate-policies https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/chile-riots-offer-more-proof-public-rejects-costly-climate-policies [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges-cop25#Urbanization%20is%20Reducing%20theim%20pact%20of%20Carbon%20Dioxide%20Induced%20Global%20Greening https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges- HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges-cop25#Urbanization%20is%20Reducing%20theim%20pact%20of%20Carbon%20Dioxide%20Induced%20Global%20Greening cop25 #Urbanization%20is%20Reducing%20theim%20pact%20of%20Carbon%20Dioxide%20Induced%20Global%20Greening [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges-cop25#Court%20Tosses%20New%20Yorks%20Climate%20Lawsuit https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges- HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges-cop25#Court%20Tosses%20New%20Yorks%20Climate%20Lawsuit cop25 #Court%20Tosses%20New%20Yorks%20Climate%20Lawsuit [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges-cop25#Climate%20Center%20Bilks%20Taxpayers https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges- HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/heartland-institute-challenges-cop25#Climate%20Center%20Bilks%20Taxpayers cop25 #Climate%20Center%20Bilks%20Taxpayers [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13462-1 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13462-1 [ 9]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-10/exxon-wins-climate-change-lawsuit https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-10/exxon-wins-climate-change-lawsuit [ 10]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.npr.org/2019/12/10/780317799/exxon-wins-new-york-climate-change-case https://www.npr.org/2019/12/10/780317799/exxon-wins-new-york-climate-change-case [ 11]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/press-release-heartland-experts-react-to-exxon-climate-case-victory-in-new-york https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/press-release-heartland-experts-react-to-exxon-climate-case-victory-in-new-york HYPERLINK https://dailycaller.com/2019/12/05/climate-investigations-center-misrepresented-nonprofit-taxpayers-bill/ https://dailycaller.com/2019/12/05/climate-investigations-center-misrepresented-nonprofit-taxpayers-bill/ \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA42","Climate Change: US Denounced as 'Threat to Humanity' as COP25 Ends Without Deal on Big Polluters' Responsibility to Frontline Nations","Naked Capitalism","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 16, 2019( Naked Capitalism: HYPERLINK http://www.nakedcapitalism.com http://www.nakedcapitalism.com COP 25 climate summit emerged from the conference Sunday stunned and angry over its conclusion, which was deemed a 'lost opportunity' by the United Nations secretary-general. Because of the refusal of some of the world's wealthiest countries to commit to more ambitious targets to reduce their climate-warming carbon emissions, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, 'The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation, and finance to tackle the climate crisis.' As Common Dreams reported[2] Saturday, the summit was intended to wrap up Friday but negotiations lasted two extra days as delegations debated provisions for carbon markets. The final deal acknowledged there was a 'significant gap' between countries' pledges to reduce their carbon emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and government's ability to achieve that reduction. Countries were urged in the final text to honor their emissions-reduction commitments, but high-polluting countries including China, India, and the U.S. argued[3]they saw no need to set more ambitious reduction plans for themselves. In the final hours of negotiations, Papua New Guinea's climate envoy, Kevin Conrad, told[4] Euronews, '90% of the participants have not been involved in this process.' Developing countries especially took issue with a language that the U.S. successfully stonewalled, which would have addressed how the U.S. should be held liable to island nations for the damage the climate crisis has already caused to them, thanks in part to the activities of the world's biggest carbon emitter historically. The Tuvalu delegation reportedly said Sunday that the United States' refusal to compensate other countries for loss and damage 'could be considered a crime against humanity.'Tuvalu just made comments (though off the official record) saying the United States' blocking of compensation for loss and damage from climate impacts (despite their leaving the Paris Agreement!) 'could be considered a crime against humanity.' # COP25 [5]  Bronwen Tucker (@bronwentucker) 15 December 2019[6]'Unfortunately, the new text we adopted this morning does not reflect anything near what we would have wanted. It is the bare minimum and we regret that countries could not agree on a more ambitious text,' said[7]Tina Eonemto Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. 'With 11 months remaining, only some of the most vulnerable countries are showing the leadership and responsibility required to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C. This contrasts with the countries and actors most responsible for the climate crisis that have shown they have no intention of solving it,' said[8] Sbastien Duyck, Senior Attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). On social media, observers denounced the U.S. and other wealthy countries which had demonstrated, one critic said, that 'the first civilization casualty of the climate crisis is government.'In Madrid, at # COP25 [9], the U.S. continued its long tradition of sacrificing survival chances of billions of people for its own ability to continue making incredible amounts of money and shirking its historical climate responsibility. The U.S. is a threat to humanity. Full stop. HYPERLINK https://t.co/J0hWrvg2Dx https://t.co/J0hWrvg2Dx COP25 , we now know the first civilization casualty of the climate crisis is government.

Several larger countries wanted language allowingcarbon markets to 'offset' instead of cut emissions, but the debate was pushed to next year's COP 26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland. The decision to put the provision off was made 'despite a last minute attempt by developed countries and a few big developing countries to push through a destructive deal that would have flooded the system with old carbon credits and opened the door to huge new trading mechanisms,' said Sara Shaw, climate justice and energy coordinator for FOE. 'This is a small victory, with an even bigger fight ahead into COP 26 next year.' 'The bad news is virtually everything else there is no new finance for loss and damage for developing countries hit hard by climate change, nor is there any agreed provision of long term climate finance,' she added. In the coming year and at Glasgow next year, as the Paris climate accord officially goes into effect, countries must decide whether they want to stand on the side of millions of climate campaigners who have demonstrated on a weekly basis for over a year and of countries which are bearing the brunt of the climate emergency's effects or of big polluters. 'World leaders have a clear choice: stand by the blockers of progress such as the United States and Brazil that prioritize the profits of the fossil fuel polluters and big agribusiness over the well-being of their citizens, or listen to the voices of their people; the scientific community; andyouth, indigenous, labor, business, environmental, social justice, faith and other leaders working hard to create a better world for current and future generations,' said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. 'It's time to choose.' \~ HYPERLINK https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/us-denounced-as-threat-to-humanity-as-cop25-ends-without-deal-on-big-polluters-responsibility-to-frontline-nations.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29# https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/us-denounced-as-threat-to-humanity-as- HYPERLINK https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/us-denounced-as-threat-to-humanity-as-cop25-ends-without-deal-on-big-polluters-responsibility-to-frontline-nations.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29# cop25 -ends-without-deal-on-big-polluters-responsibility-to-frontline-nations.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29# ;This entry was posted in Doomsday scenarios[16], Environment[17], Global warming[18], Guest Post[19], Politics[20] on December 16, 2019[21] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[22].

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA44","HOLA, MADRID! AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TAKES THE CONTINENT'S CLIMATE AGENDA TO COP25 IN SPAIN","November 30, 2019 Saturday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The African Development Bank will on Monday kick off a campaign to plead the continent's case at the world's leading climate change conference. The 25th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) comes at a crucial time for the globe and Africa in particular. In recent years, rising temperatures have wreaked havoc with weather patterns, leading to suffocating heat and devastating storms. In Africa, the climate has exacerbated food shortages and destroyed infrastructure. African countries know all too well the risks posed by climate change, said Wale Shonibare, the Bank's Acting Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth. He cited the devastating impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and the Comoros earlier this year. ""However, Africa also offers climate smart investment opportunities - from country-led innovation centers, to transformative renewable energy initiatives. For example, this year, the Bank approved financing for the first on-grid solar power public-private partnership in Chad, under the Desert to Power initiative,"" Shonibare said. Projects like Desert to Power will be highlighted at COP 25 , which will from 2 to 13 December bring together leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the heart of the matter are the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which form part of the landmark Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 during COP21 in the French capital. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 51 out of 54 African countries. It binds countries to cutting carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'c2\'b0C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5\'c2\'b0C. Climate finance is another issue that will top the agenda at COP25 in Madrid. ""2020 is a critical year in securing adequate resources for African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, clarity and transparency on global climate finance access is essential to deliver climate action faster and at scale,"" said Anthony Nyong, Director Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank. The African Development Bank is joining the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in a pavilion to showcase the joint commitment to combatting climate change. The Bank will participate in several panel discussions at COP25 , and will support the advocacy efforts of its regional member countries. The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. Some of its achievements are: - 85% of investments are screened for climate risk and for greenhouse gas emissions. The Bank's ambition is to screen all projects by 2020. - By next year, 40% of the Bank's own investments will be dedicated to climate finance. - The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025, with more than half of it going to adaptation.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA47","COP 25: KENYA EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS GENDER EQUALITY IS BEST PATH TO ACHIEVE SDGS","December 12, 2019 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group: By LEOPOLD OBI, Climate Tracker Stakeholders at COP25 climate talks, citing Kenya's example, called on developing countries to boost women's involvement in the fight against climate change. Without gender equality, evidence suggests, African countries are unlikely to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or transformative economic growth. The issue emerged during panel discussion on gender and climate change at COP25 , held in Madrid December 2-13. Experts pointed to data indicating that the struggle to earn a livelihood pushes many farmers to migrate to cities in search of casual work. As a result, the women left behind in the villages must care for the family while producing food and also fetching water and firewood. Climate change is accelerating these socioeconomic shifts and magnifying their effects on many communities, particularly smallholder farmers, pastoralists and fishermen. As their livelihoods depends on climatic conditions, they are hardest hit by extreme weather. Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, explained that responses to climate change must be specific because of the complex interaction between gender and climate change, citing that ""it was impossible to address climate change when 50% of the population was ignored"". ""You cannot achieve sustainable development without ensuring gender equality. They are two sides to the same coin,"" Nyong said. ""Progress made so far is commendable but not enough."" The African Development Bank has demonstrated its commitment to promoting gender parity by providing $20 billion over five years to promote women's participation in agricultural enterprises in West Africa. Mafalda Duarte, Head of the Climate Investment Fund, noted that ""many of the most effective measures to address climate change and economic underdevelopment involved redistributing economic power to women"". According to Duarte, if women smallholder farmers, who represent 43% of agricultural labour in the developing world, enjoyed equal access to land, livestock, and financial credits, total agricultural output in these countries would rise by more than 14% and hunger rates fall 17%. Kenya is one of the few large African economies that have developed a gender-sensitive climate and energy strategy. At COP25 , Stephen Kioko, Kenya's Deputy Director of Energy, explained that the country's current strategy aims to mainstream women within the energy sector, and also ""to increase awareness on gender in the energy sector across the continent."" One element of Kenya's strategy is to improve women's access to affordable clean cooking solutions, an urgent need. A push toward clean cooking in turn generates economic, profit making activity. According to Kioko, ""Kenya's utilization of electricity is 9%, while 60% use biomass-firewood in rural areas and charcoal in towns and 22% uses kerosene."" ""We need to go beyond the persuaded and convinced, and we need to reach them with good examples of results to build alliances so we can do a lot more. This is an urgent agenda,"" Duarte said. \"

At # COP25 \'f0 ""[deg] Read it online here: HYPERLINK https://t.co/m6XFSZfYZN pic.twitter.com/ggxegSXqgC World Tourism Organization (@UNWTO) December 4, 2019 On the sidelines of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, the agency on Wednesday released on Wednesday the Transport Related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector report, which estimates that by 2030, transport-related emissions from tourism will comprise 5.3 per cent of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions. ""This comprehensive study analyses the environmental impact of the different modes of transport within the tourism sector"", UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler said at the launch. UNWTO said transport-related emissions remain a major challenge: ""While tourism is mentioned in many Nationally Determined Contributions as a big concern, not enough has yet been done"", said Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Against the backdrop of a growing number of sightseers both at home and abroad, the data factors in the predicted growth in global emissions to 2030 and is set against the ""current ambition"" for the decarbonization of transport. ""Industry must do more, but Governments must align their policies, so that at the international level we can collectively work to increase ambition"", Mr. Sarmad added. ""The One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme is a vital ongoing mechanism to promote sustainable tourism around the world."" Research revealed Transport-related CO2 emissions from tourism are predicted to increase from 1,597 million tonnes to 1,998 million tonnes between 2016 and 2030. International and domestic arrivals are expected to rise from 20 to 37 billion, mainly driven by domestic tourism followed by international arrivals. Tourism-related transport emissions represented 22 per cent of all transport emissions in 2016, a trend that will continue through 2030. High ambition scenario Transport-related CO2 emissions remain a major challenge and require tourism sectors to work closely with transport sectors worldwide in order to support its commitment to accelerate decarbonization. In addition, the tourism industry must determine its own high ambition scenario, complementing the efforts of the transport sector, such as by significantly decoupling growth from emissions, allowing expansion within the international climate targets. ""It is now for the tourism sector, especially tourism policy makers, to use data effectively and ensure the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate emergency"", concluded the UNWTO chief. \"

Our two nations' enduring ties are based on shared democratic values and a steadfast commitment to the rule of law. The United States appreciates Chile's continued commitment to good governance, democracy, and security throughout the Western Hemisphere. Chile's leadership in supporting Interim President Juan Guaido and the legitimate National Assembly of Venezuela, and in hosting approximately 400,000 displaced Venezuelans, promotes these values across the hemisphere. President Trump's meeting with President Pinera last September and my visit to Santiago mark the strength of our cooperation. Chile will once again display its global leadership as host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Week and the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) later this year.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA52","STATEMENT BY OECD SECRETARY-GENERAL ANGEL GURRA ON THE OUTCOME OF COP 25","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): I am very disappointed that COP25 in Madrid did not achieve the decisive, collective and ambitious outcomes that the climate emergency demands from world leaders. Despite the commendable efforts by Chile as Chair and the impressive work by Spain as host, this unsatisfactory result reflects the current geo-political context, the predominant focus on short-term national interests and a lack of trust among countries, but this is still no excuse for inaction. Urgent action is needed to rebuild the foundations for strong collective action if we are to avoid the rapidly increasing dangers of climate change. One of the key goals of COP25 was to agree a solid and effective framework for carbon markets under the Paris Agreement. The failure to do so means that it will make it more difficult and more expensive for countries to reduce GHG emissions. Another area where progress was lacking was transparency the fundamental element of the Paris Agreement needed to provide countries with the reassurance that others are living up to their promises. Ambitious climate action by governments would deliver huge well-being benefits for their citizens, far outweighing the short-term costs. These benefits include improved air quality and health, more liveable cities, better jobs in cleaner industries, and more robust global value chains and food security. Most importantly: there is no other way forward. The clock is ticking and we are not rising up to what is needed in order to preserve the planet. Climate finance remains critical for the success of our collective efforts. The commitment to provide USD 100 billion a year by 2020 made by developed country governments has both symbolic and substantive importance. Our most recent estimates show that the goal of USD 100 billion a year by 2020 is still attainable. But only if developed countries urgently step up their efforts to scale up public finance and improve the effectiveness with which this finance is used, and to mobilise private finance sufficiently in order to enhance resilience and capacity in the poorest and most vulnerable economies. It is time to move from negotiation to ambitious action. I therefore welcome the agreement of the San Jos Principles for High Ambition and Integrity in International Carbon Markets, adopted by a group of leading countries in the margins of COP25 . These principles will ensure that the use of carbon markets guarantees environmental integrity and strengthens overall mitigation efforts by participating countries. I also welcome the launch of the Santiago Action Plan that sets out the actions needed to mainstream climate change in economic and financial policy. The OECD is proud to contribute to the work of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action that is driving this agenda forward. The OECD stands ready to support the current and incoming COP Presidencies to achieve the outcomes we need at COP26 in Glasgow to drive forward implementation in the crucial decade to come. It is time to conclude the negotiations and move on to action. Glasgow or bust!

""Science is unequivocal on the urgency to act, both at global and national levels"", he told the conference to address the climate crisis - officially known as the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The official opening ceremony of the high-level segment of the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP 25 . (10 December 2019), by UN Climate Change/James Dowson Mr. Muhammad-Bande recalled the consensus reached through the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in temperature to 2C above pre-industrial levels and efforts to hold it to 1.5C. And yet, if current trends in global emissions continue, they will cause further warming; and humans will face increasingly severe and extreme weather events. ""Lands are being degraded. Forests, ecosystems and biodiversity are being lost. Our oceans are facing pollution, acidification and loss of coastal habitats"", he spelled out. Recurrent climate disasters are becoming global and borderless; causing unprecedented human and socioeconomic costs; and threatening progress in reducing global poverty and improving people's lives. Let's not 'go down with the ship' Risk reduction measures have the potential to ""safeguard up to 280 million people at risk of displacement due to sea level rise"". ""It is our decision: to go down with this ship or to change course immediately"", he underscored. ""This is the time to act"". ""We are defined by our actions, and every day we have a moral obligation to take action in favour of the next generation and beyond"", Mr. Muhammad-Bande concluded.

""Variable renewables, such as solar and wind, are vital to the clean energy transition, but they alone cannot meet countries' growing energy needs"", he maintained, adding that nuclear energy can ""provide the continuous, low-carbon power to back up increasing use of renewables"". Moreover, nuclear power can be ""the key that unlocks their full potential by providing flexible support day or night, rain or shine"", upheld the IAEA chief. And many States believe that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve sustainable development and meet global climate goals without significant use of nuclear energy. He pointed out that ""nuclear power provides around one-third of the world's low-carbon electricity and already plays a significant role in mitigating climate change"". Out of time ""Each year at COP we are told that the window of opportunity could close soon"", UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said on the urgency of climate action. ""The window of opportunity is closing now,"" she warned. ""My message is this. We need your decisions. We need your leadership. We are out of time.""

""The Alliance is the vehicle to collectively scale-up our support to the most vulnerable"", he concluded. For her part, World Bank Vice President for Sustainable Development Laura Tuck underlined the important role of the Alliance. ""It's good to see everyone formally coming together through this Alliance and committing to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries in the provision of hydromet and early warning services,"" she said.

This study was co-authored by Daniel Kammen, a professor in the Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley as well as a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy. Kammen will be presenting the findings at the California side event of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP25 , on Dec. 7 and 8, according to a Berkeley News press release. To meet climate goals, Kammen suggested considering including carbon pricing, decoupling electricity profits from total sales, removing fossil fuel subsidies, valuing nature and protecting low-income populations, minorities and endangered tribal areas, according to an email from Kammen. Kammen also expressed in the email the value of accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, both in California and internationally, along with transitioning from cars to mass transit. The study found that although traditional climate change models often understate potential warming, the models that guide policymakers also understate realistic mitigation options.\~ The study has caused some controversy, according to Kammen. ""The paper I published Monday with Amory Lovins on clean energy and efficiency has been generating a lot of discussion, largely because it shows that there are reasons to be 'hopeful' (ie if we cared, we could do a lot to get on track for climate solutions), and hence is in contrast to the UN report issues just before the conference began,"" Kammen said in the email.\~ The researchers found that global decarbonization has trended on course with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels before the end of the century. The real rate of decarbonization is significantly higher than the rate that is typically used in baseline assessments. The study also suggests a reassessment of using pre-2011 energy data in future modeling.\~ ""Though trend is not destiny, the future is largely choice not fate, so despair is indeed as unwarranted as complacency,"" the study said.\~ Contact Taylor Rudman at [email protected] and follow her on Twitter at @TaylorRudman.

At the same time, Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon has threatened to have Chile's President Pinera detained if he attempts to enter the country. Protesters are rising up against Chile's neoliberal model, imposed under the Pinochet dictatorship. More than two dozen people have been killed in the protests and hundreds have lost eyes as Carabineros de Chile (national police) intentionally shoot metal-filled rubber bullets shotgun-style at people's heads. Chilean and Indigenous Mapuche protesters explain that they are not seeking simple reforms. ""We are not marching for social reforms,"" said Mapuche elder Ana Llao, ""we are marching for a total change of the system!"" Mapuche communities have long resisted this land theft, with Mapuches being attacked, murdered or jailed as recently as 2018. In November 2018, an unarmed Camilo Catrillanca was shot in the back of the head and killed by Carabineros. In April 2018, Mapuche Lonko (leader) Alberto Curamil was arrested on trumped up charges after years of fighting deforestation and successfully stopping two hydro-electric dams. In 2019 he was awarded the coveted Goldman Environmental Prize. As the COP begins, Lonko Curamil's trial continues in Temuco, Chile. ""There is a political problem of permanent violence executed by the state regarding Mapuche people here in Wallmapu. The Chilean state has repressed, shot people in the back, and imprisoned them permanently. We live under a model of dispossession and exploitation-of misery-that has not only attacked Mapuche people but all Chileans,"" said Rodrigo Roman, attorney for Lonko Curamil. With the momentum of the national uprising, two weeks ago, two Mapuche communities near Curacautin, Liempi Colipi and Quilape Lopez began an occupation of 1500 hectares of ancestral lands. They have been attacked by the police twice, with some members injured and others hospitalized. Referring to a series of hydroelectric projects planned for rivers throughout Mapuche territory, including the sacred Rio Cautin, Juan Ramon said, ""Chile has now moved on from stealing our land to stealing our water."" Alejandra Parra of Environmental Rights Action Network (RADA) points out, ""Chile provides a warning to the world. Our environment and people are already being devastated by these neoliberal 'climate solutions' being lifted up by the Chilean Presidency at COP25 . From hydroelectricity that steals our rivers, to electric cars, solar panels and industrial wind farms that ravage our mountains and deserts for lithium and copper, to the expansion of tree plantations onto Indigenous lands for the 'bioeconomy'-Chile shows why 'climate action' cannot be motivated by profits."" The neoliberal model has long been a feature of the climate COPs in the form of REDD, carbon offsets and other carbon market schemes, but this year under Chile's leadership, it is rising to new prominence in the form of ""Natural Climate Solutions."" These so-called solutions have been condemned as the commodification of the Earth for the purpose of creating vast quantities of carbon and biodiversity offsets designed to enable climate-destroying business as usual under the pretense of climate action.

CDB provided USD100, 000 in funding to the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC) to finance regional visibility and participation at the 25th Meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Conference of Parties, known as COP 25 . As part of its advocacy and visibility work at COP, CCCCC organises the Caribbean pavilion, which provides a dedicated space for showcasing Caribbean climate action issues and work; for hosting events; and for meetings, consultations and caucuses, as required. Several regional bodies, including CDB, the Caribbean Community and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) as well as extra-regional bodies, such as the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) are sharing the Caribbean pavilion. The pavilion has hosted a range of events and programming throughout the conference. These include a presentation by the OECS on climate-induced mobility in the Eastern Caribbean; a panel discussion by the CCCCC to mark its 15th anniversary; and a panel discussion hosted by the Haitian delegation on climate change and the marine environment in that country. Cheryl Dixon, Coordinator of CDB's Environmental Sustainability Unit, noted that visibility and negotiations at COP were critical to ensuring awareness of, and action on the Caribbean's climate change issues. The issue of loss and damage is a focus at COP 25 ; and in light of recent catastrophic damage caused by Category 5 Hurricanes, Irma and Maria in 2017, and Dorian in 2019, the Region needs to have a strong presence. The Caribbean pavilion provides an area for debate and information sharing and a platform to actively participate at this Conference, where the outcomes are critical to the Region's future,"" noted Dixon. She pointed to the Region's previous successful advocacy at COP21, stating: ""At COP21, the Region played a significant role in pushing for the inclusion of the priorities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and the Least Developed Countries in the Paris Agreement. Our successful advocacy, then, benefitted from the availability of a Caribbean Pavilion, which allowed us to showcase our work and issues and meet and caucus as required.""

If you want to share this newsletter it will be posted on the CHN website later eachmorning. Now, on with the news. It's the start of the second and final week of Cop25 and we thought it was a good moment to take stock of progress. A new text on global carbon markets, or Article 6, initially expected on Friday morning, finally landed on Saturday evening. The options were whittled down but all major sticking points[5] remain. Ministers, who take over the talks after Monday, will have to leverage political power to hope for a breakthrough. The latest text[6] on addressing loss and damage (explainer here[7]) summarises the range of views on how to provide finance to vulnerable countries recovering from extreme weather events or slow-onset impacts such as sea level rise. The creation of a bespoke funding facility makes the list but doesn't have the support of developed countries like the US and Australia. Meanwhile a group of developing countries and China, known as the G77, is calling for an expert group to be set up to explore further financing options. An outline draft text[8] on a Cop25 decision reflects efforts to keep ambition at the top of the agenda. The draft text, which could change significantly by the end of the week, stresses the need for science to underpin climate action and calls for more ambitious climate pledges in 2020. The final text will provide a key signal on ambition ahead of next year's Cop26. One to watch. Meanwhile, discussions about who deserves 'special circumstances' and additional support to respond to climate change rumble on. Last week an informal consultation was set-up to consider the special needs of African but not Latin American countries, causing some unhappiness. Ambassador Mohamed Nasr, of Egypt and chair of the African Group, insisted the continent's 'competing needs' of economic development and commitments to curb emissions should be taken into account. 'Africa is just demanding what it deserves,' said Augustine Bnatar Njamnshi, from the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance. 'Rest assured it wouldn't take anything away from anybody else.' There is a developing country push for Cop25 to ban the use of 'carry-over credits' from the Kyoto Protocol to meet Paris Agreement targets. The idea here is that overshoot achieved under the precursor deal should still count. But most countries have said this is not within the 'spirit of Paris'. There is only one country explicitly planning to do this: Australia. Read more here[9]. Commenting on the state of the talks, Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, a senior negotiator from the Democratic Republic of Congo, told Climate Home News some meetings had become 'talk shops'. 'We haven't really walked the walk,' he said. 'It is important that we do not give a spaghetti plate to our ministers where they don't know where to start because everything is completely intertwined and they don't know how to handle it.' At worst, Mpanu Mpanu said ministers should leave Madrid with £ general agreement that could set in motion some type of a work plan that allows us to finalise the nitty gritty'. Away from the negotiations, Sue Biniaz, a former state department lead climate lawyer who played a key role in designing the Paris Agreement, reflected on the US withdrawal from the accord. 'I really thought we had constructed an agreement that would meet the needs of any US administration,' she said. 'At worst, they could have stayed in with a changed target.' What to watch out for on Monday The closing plenary of the talks' different work streams is planned for Monday afternoon. Tensions have been building over the slow progress of the last few days and this could be the time it spills over into the open. The livestream can be found here[10]. The second of four ministerial high-level events is a meeting of finance ministers. A coalition of finance ministers for climate action was launched by Finland and Chile in April with the aim to bring climate considerations into the mainstream of economic policy. The three-hour afternoon event has a packed schedule[11] of high-level speakers. A number of ministers are due to attend.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA61","CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL STATEMENT ON COP25 OUTCOMES","December 15, 2019 Sunday","States News Service","The following information was released by Conservation International (CI): Today James Roth, Senior Vice President, Global Policy and Government Affairs at Conservation International, issued the following statement on the outcome of the negotiations at COP 25 which sought to catalyze greater climate action, including through the use of nature as a climate solution. ""Conservation International appreciates governments around the world for the advances made over the past weeks in Madrid. As of early this morning, negotiators were largely agreed on decision text that would have established a path forward on how countries can work together in achieving the critical objectives of the Paris Agreement. There was consensus on several fundamental elements for operationalizing bilateral carbon trading under the Agreement. Built on a foundation of rigid and transparent accounting rules, the resulting carbon market would have been open to all sectors, including nature, creating financial incentives to preserve standing tropical forests, mangroves, peat swamps, coastal wetlands and other valuable natural carbon stocks. Unfortunately, at the eleventh-hour Parties failed to reach agreement on rules for how countries can cooperate on simultaneously achieving climate mitigation and sustainable development. Talks broke down at the political level because a very small number of countries insisted on allowing the use of old carbon credits that were designed under flawed accounting rules. The vast majority of countries rightfully pushed back on this request, pointing out that the environment would experience little benefit if ""double counting"" of carbon credits and other inaccuracies were permitted. ""This development is disappointing. There are already discussions outside of the negotiations about how groups of countries may commit to even higher standards than what is required. Conservation International urges that those discussions to continue. ""Over the past few years, Conservation International has played an important role in the negotiations process, from our deep bench of policy experts and scientists providing policy recommendations and the latest research, to serving as an invaluable resource for many countries.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA64","International Chamber of Commerce: Private Sector Driving Climate Action at COP 25 Business and Industry Day","December 10, 2019 Tuesday 9:02 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news: Private sector climate action and innovation was on full display at the International Chamber of Commerce's Business and Industry Day (BINGO) at COP25 in Madrid. As the business and industry 'Focal Point' at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), ICC is the central voice for business at COP 25 . In this capacity, ICC hosts the official COP 25 Business and Industry Day (BINGO Day), offering a forum for constructive public-private dialogue on how to lead for a net zero emissions future. Here are eight takeaways from the discussions at this year's event: High Level support for business ambition In his opening remarks, Ambassador Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Action Summit recognised the unprecedented mobilisation of the private sector in support of bold climate ambition. Mr de Alba identified several business-led initiatives, such as the Our Only Future Pledge and the Chambers Climate Coalition, as examples of concrete action. Calling upon business to keep up the momentum ahead of COP26, Mr de Alba said: ""Without business, ... we will never achieve the goals of keeping temperature increases below 1.5 degrees. This is only the beginning - we are just getting on track."" For her part, Clare O'Neill, COP26 President-designate, emphasised the need for an immediate and unified commitment from business, government and civil society to collectively raise climate ambition. In response to the critical findings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 C of Global Warming, Ms O'Neill cited advances in carbon neutral legislation, digital technology, and alternative energy sources, as encouraging signs of ambitious climate policies. Ahead of COP 26, Ms O'Neill is encouraging business and government to build from this existing progress and to continue to advance climate ambition. ""The world is expecting us to deliver progress [and] to move from rhetoric to reality,"" said Ms O'Neill. The high-level opening concluded with inspiring remarks by Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of Solar Impulse Foundation, who stressed the need for practical solutions from business, as well as the need for leading businesses to motivate other members of the private sector to raise their climate ambition. ""We need to address those who are not in the room [and] how we do that is [through] profitability and job creation. We need to speak their language and motivate them,"" said Mr Piccard. We need to go further and faster While more businesses than ever before are taking bold climate action, panellists acknowledged that more is needed and the pace of change must accelerate. Kay Harrison, New Zealand's Climate Ambassador, speaking of the leadership behind New Zealand's Zero Carbon Act, underscored the need for the public and private sector to work together, stating: ""Engagement is absolutely critical, not especially with the private sector, but absolutely with the private sector."" Jahan Chowdury, Country Engagement Director, NDC Partnership Support, agreed with the need to engage all stakeholders, saying that national climate plans should not be developed in isolated silos, but through integrated conversations between business and government. ""A synchronised dance between government and the private sector is needed,"" said Mr Chowdury. Shari Friedman, Senior Strategy Officer, Climate Business Department, International Finance Corporation (IFC) shared how the IFC was working to be a bridge between governments and business to help accelerate the pace of change. As an example, Ms Friedman highlighted the work of the IFC on the Scaling Solar initiative , as a one-stop-shop to help governments mobilise privately funded grid-connected solar projects at competitive tariffs that can be operational within two years. Article 6 - a pathway for reduced emissions Since the opening of COP25 , Parties have been working tirelessly toward the effective implementation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The second panel of the day on the Value of Article 6: Lessons from research and practice gathered representatives from academia, business and law to discuss the design and implementation of Article 6. The session, organised by the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), presented new research on international emission reduction cooperation. During his analysis on the economic implications of Article 6, Leon Clarke, Research Director, Center of Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, argued for the necessity of dynamic incentive systems to inspire greater climate ambition. For Mr Clarke, the implementation of Article 6 would increase efficiency for business and governments through the creation of measurement and reporting frameworks. Similarly, Steven Rose, Senior Research Economist, Electric Power Research Institute, explained that that the implementation of Article 6 would open new doors for international cooperation and reduce global emissions over time. International cooperation can reduce societal costs and bring real value to citizens, said Mr Rose. With the implementation of Article 6, governments and business can work together to create standards, according to several participating panellists. Most notably, Alex Hanafi, Director, Multilateral Climate Strategy and Lead Counsel, Environmental Defense Fund, asserted that the Article 6 negotation process can establish rigorous standards for carbon emissions that he said, would give confidence to markets, investors and the public, that everyone is [abiding] by the Paris Agreement."" Carbon pricing: a market-based solution Business called on government to implement robust carbon pricing mechanisms, aligned with the Paris Agreement, to redirect investments into low-carbon solutions. In response to a question on the future of carbon pricing systems, Dirk Forrister, President and CEO, IETA said: ""There is a real concern about these tools being used for purposes that don't help."" Mr Forrister said markets have to bolster and amplify efforts to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and that to do this new, more robust rules should be agreed by nations. ""Let's learn from past lessons, or it will just be copy and paste from the old rules that don't work,"" he added. Earlier in the week on the sidelines of COP 25 , ICC hosted a trade and climate consultation on carbon pricing. Business must be resilient in the face of climate change As part of the day's final panel on Business climate resilience: navigating the risks and opportunities, Pierre Rousseau, Strategic Advisor, Sustainable Business, BNP Paribas, highlighted the important role of finance and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to help companies prepare not only for the physical risks of climate change but also for the transitional risks, such as policy and regulation shifts. The session also highlighted the urgency of the climate emergency with a clear call to action to all stakeholders to collaborate and deliver climate resilience at scale. Maria Mendulice, Managing Director, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, said: ""The biggest risk for business in this face of the climate crisis is the risk of inaction on climate change."" We must ensure a just transition In the pursuit of transforming industry, panellists underscored the importance of ensuring a just transition that has people, community and jobs at its heart and leaves no one behind. Strong examples came from Chile and France, where speakers demonstrated the impacts of societal action when there is no clear and transparent communication between governments and business to society. Monica Araya, Founder and Executive Director of Costa Rica Limpia, underscored the importance of having empathy for excluded members of society, and the need for governments, business and all other stakeholders to work collaboratively to deliver solutions to society's biggest problems. Helen Mountford, Vice President for Climate and Economics, World Resources Institute, who served as the panel moderator, reiterated this call for a just transition. Business and government need to ensure better access to key goods and services, so that no one is left behind as part of this transition to a low carbon economy, according to Ms Mountford. Read ICC's recommendations for achieving a just transition. Finance remains critical Ensuring that business and government contribute to the funding of a net zero emissions future was another key takeaway from the day. Most notably, Mr Rousseau described the existence of a financing gap for businesses shifting their operations toward a renewable direction. ""Moving away from what you are doing today and moving to a new business [model] creates the need [for] financing mechanisms,"" explained Mr Rousseau. From green bonds to investment traceability, business and governments need to ensure that finance tools are in place to guide this transition to a net zero future. Before COP25 Read Mr Denton's open letter to finance ministers. Business must always be problem solvers During a powerful closing statement, Gonzalo Munoz, Chile's High-level Climate Champion, implored business to look beyond profit and to work together to advance global climate ambition. At the core of his address, Mr Munroz, stated: ""We are in a crisis of empathy"". He called on business to be problem-solvers in the face of two of the most pressing problems - climate change and inequality: ""If business is not focused on solving inequality and climate change - they are the problem."" ICC at COP 25 Working with policymakers, business leaders and other stakeholders, ICC is advocating for policy frameworks that address the urgent need to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 C and transition to an inclusive and sustainable net-zero emissions future.

""As shipping's global regulator, the UN International Maritime Organization has successfully enhanced the sector's impressive environmental performance through a comprehensive framework of regulations which enjoy robust enforcement worldwide and this includes greenhouse gas reduction,"" said Simon Bennett, ICS Deputy Secretary General. ""There are already mandatory CO2 reduction regulations in force globally that will require all new ships to be at least 30% more carbon-efficient by 2025, with a 50% improvement by large containerships by 2022. In line with the ambitious CO2 reduction targets which IMO Member States agreed last year, the IMO will adopt a new package of regulations in 2020 with a focus on operational fuel efficiency and speed optimisation. This should ensure further CO2 reductions by 2023 and that the sector is on track to exceed the IMO target of a 40% efficiency improvement across the entire world fleet by 2030. ""The industry's greatest priority is to help the IMO make rapid progress with implementing its very ambitious 2050 target, cutting the sector's total CO2 emissions, regardless of trade growth, by at least 50%, with full decarbonisation soon after. Accelerating R&D of zero-carbon technologies and propulsion systems that can be applied on trans-oceanic ships must therefore be at the heart of the IMO strategy."" Following the ICS's presentation, ECSA commented on the European front following the announcement of the European Green Deal on Wednesday. ""The industry fully supports the ambition by the new European Commission to be the first climate-neutral continent. Moreover the climate emergency is a global crisis, it needs a global strategy. We really need the EU to play a proactive and positive role in the IMO discussions supporting the development and adoption of ambitious international regulations to be applied globally as soon as possible,"" commented Martin Dorsman, ECSA Secretary-General. ""We urgently need new technologies and alternative fuels. The EU can support R&D by making EU funds suitable for use by the shipping industry and the broader maritime cluster. Europe must support pilot projects and the deployment of bunkering infrastructure in EU ports for new fuels."" ANAVE Director-General Manuel Carlier followed up with examples of success stories. ""Shipping is the transport mode with lower CO2 emissions per t x km. By promoting the shift of cargo and passengers from road and air to the sea, we will effectively lower CO2 emissions,"" he said. ""For example, 50% of trucks have been shifted to the Motorways of the Sea between Italy and Spain in the western Mediterranean. That is a lot of CO2 reductions obtained. The same is done in passenger transport between the Canary Islands, where moving one passenger from plane to ship means reducing CO2 emissions by more than 80%.""

Their participation at COP25 helps ensure that the voices of women from developing countries are represented around the climate change negotiation table. In October 2019, Canada supported a second workshop for francophone women climate negotiators, under the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership, in Kigali, Rwanda. A total of 24 francophone women climate negotiators from 16 countries of sub-Saharan Africa gathered in Kigali to learn skills for participating in international climate negotiations, which they are putting into action at COP25 . \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA71","Southeast Asian Environmental Activists Say Region Must do More","December 15, 2019 Sunday","ASEAN Tribune","15 December 2019 (VOA) Southeast Asian environmental activists - including young counterparts to teenage activist and Time magazine person of the year Greta Thunberg - are concerned they are not getting the attention that the climate emergency deserves, complaining that the region's authorities are leaving this month's climate negotiations in Madrid, also known as COP25 , without committing to new climate action plans for 2020, as other nations have done. The negotiations are meant to find a way to carry out the plans, agreed to in Paris in 2015, to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. However they have broken down as negotiators cannot agree on how much rich nations should spend to support poor nations to enact the plans. Many Southeast Asian governments want such supporting funds but their constituents also say the governments need to promise more dramatic emissions decreases. 'The situation is critical: our youth are mobilizing and striking because they know that there are only 10 years left for governments to act for them to have a decent future,' Sarah Elago, a member of the Philippine House of Representatives, said. 'Why is it that children are doing more than the governing adults?' Like the Philippines, almost every nation in Southeast Asia has islands or long coastlines, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Consequently, the region's activists are particularly concerned that their governments did not offer forceful action plans at COP25 , formally known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which was supposed to conclude on December 13 but continues as of press time. Activists have exerted pressure on regional governments to offer a climate action plan but those governments say they are doing their best, as developing countries that did not create the problem. Some say there is little point in offering action when there is none from the United States, the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions until being recently overtaken by China. Developing nations around the Asia Pacific and elsewhere are paying the price because of polluting industrialized nations, according to Basav Sen, climate policy director at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies. 'Our country, as a matter of policy, prioritizes enriching its oil and gas industry over preserving the ecosystems upon which billions of people rely for their food, water and homes,' he wrote in an op-ed for the newspaper USA Today. He recommended 'responsible world governments could publicly shame the U.S. government for its climate policies.' Southeast Asia must do more, however, Abel Da Silva, a member East Timor's National Parliament, said. 'We cannot stay on the sidelines of this catastrophe,' said Da Silva. 'Southeast Asia is contributing to climate change through its reliance on coal, its deforestation and haze crisis, and its lack of ambition in its climate action plans.' The region has to 'reverse this shameful historical trend and right our past wrongs on the climate,' he said. Nations generally submit action plans on how they will decrease greenhouse gas emissions at the annual U.N. climate conference. Although nations do other things to deal with climate change, such as constructing walls against rising water levels, emissions are the main issue. Laos, which is trying to develop hydropower dams as a main industry, is the only Southeast Asian nation to set a goal of zero net carbon emissions by 2050 - it is also the only nation in the region that is landlocked. \"

The South American country was set to host the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November as well as the COP25 climate summit in early December. The protests that began October 18 over a 4% increase in subway fares in Santiago have spread across the nation, inflamed by the frustration of ordinary Chileans who feel they have been left out of the prosperity of Latin America's wealthiest country. Clashes broke out between protesters and security forces on Monday - the same day President Pinera replaced eight cabinet members in an attempt to tame the country's political crisis. While most of the protests have been peaceful, some have turned violent, leaving at least 20 people dead. The protesters are seeking improved economic equality in the country, as well as reforms in the pension and medical systems. Pinera, a center-right billionaire, last week offered a host of proposals to try to calm the protesters, including a raise in the minimum wage and pensions as well as lower prices for medicines and public transportation. \"

A final agreement was postponed until 2020. At the heart of the debate was implementing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and clearingthe path for raising ambition before next year's COP26 conference - to be held in Glasgow. The 25th climate conference in Madrid gathered world leaders, activists, representatives, non-party stakeholders and other crucial allies in implementing the Paris Agreement, who failed, though, to win against the blocking countries, such as the US, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, on international carbon trading rules. Sir David King, British government representative commented on the matter that'If the United States is not backing an agreement that is meaningful, it is extraordinarily difficult for the rest of the world to come to an agreement. And I'm afraid as long as we have President Donald Trump in the United States with President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil it is extraordinarily difficult to get all of those countries to agree.' The announcement of the European Green Deal and EU's commitment to carbon-neutrality by 2050 was among the few signals of hope in the COP25 talks. 'Mother Nature has a message for us: she can't take it anymore. The time for complacency is over,' warnedFrans Timmermans, EU Commission's new Vice President for the European Green Deal. Another sign of progress was the adoption of the new Gender Action Plan to strengthen gender considerations and women's participation in climate action, as well as the announcement by 73 nations that they will submit an enhanced climate action plan or Nationally Determined Contribution. The EU delegation for the 28-country bloc wrote on its statement for the conclusion of the COP25 climate change talks that 'By COP26 in Glasgow we need to update our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and submit our Long-Term Strategies, in line with the Paris objectives.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA76","UNDER PRESSURE. CAN COP25 DELIVER?","December 2, 2019 Monday","IPS - Inter Press Service","Mass public pressure backed by the weight of scientific reports is starting to bring governments to their senses as the annual UN climate summit kicks off in Madrid today. But despite warnings that the planet is reaching critical tipping points, the two weeks of talks with nearly 30,000 participants and dozens of heads of government attending may still end in that familiar sense of disappointment and an opportunity missed. The annual Conference of the Parties, this year being COP25 , was to have been a highly arcane if crucial process of finding agreement on carbon markets, known in the jargon as Article 6 of the 'rulebook' to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on stopping the planet from overheating. Highly contentious, and in part pitting developing countries like Brazil, China and India against others, the Article 6 debate could not be resolved at last year's summit - COP24 in Katowice, Poland - nor at meetings in Bonn in June and hence was left for COP25 to try and fix. The other big elephant in the room - setting more ambitious national targets to reduce carbon emissions - was conveniently going to be left to be settled at next year's COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. But action is needed now, and senior officials representing nearly 200 countries have been put on notice that the climate emergency in all its forms is dominating the public sphere across the world. Just last week we saw student-led demonstrations and strikes in many places that appropriately fell on Black Friday, delivering a broadside against rampant consumerism as well as government inaction. ""Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options,"" youth leaders Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Luisa Neubauer of Germany and Angela Valenzuela of Chile declared in a joint statement. ""We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold. Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world's governments-the same governments that allow fossil fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has told COP25 that ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon"". ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions,"" Guterres said. Just last month the UN Environment Programme's annual Emissions Gap Report warned that the Paris Agreement ambition of keeping average temperatures within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times was ""on the brink of becoming impossible"". Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be under 25 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach that target but, at current rates of growth, emissions are projected to reach more than double that level. Clearly drastic action is needed. Reinforcing the sense of emergency, the World Meteorological Organization reported that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases reached new record highs in 2018. China is the world's largest emitter. Spain stepped in to offer Madrid as a venue for COP25 after Chile withdrew as host because of mass anti-government unrest. However Chile is still leading the conference and together with Spain will be pushing countries to act quickly to raise the ambition of their carbon emission reduction targets. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the goal is for ""the largest number of countries"" to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. From 2020 to 2030, emissions must be cut 7.6% a year to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, the UNEP says. However the main negotiation process in Madrid is expected to focus on the unfinished business of the market-based mechanisms to create and manage new carbon markets under the Paris Agreement. This would allow countries and industries to earn credits for above-target emission reductions that can then be traded. Big developing countries have already accumulated huge amounts of carbon credits under the previous but now largely discredited carbon credit scheme. It is a highly complex tangle of interests. Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate website, says the Article 6 debate has the potential to ""make or break"" implementation of the Paris Agreement which comes into force next year. ""To its proponents, Article 6 offers a path to significantly raising climate ambition or lowering costs, while engaging the private sector and spreading finance, technology and expertise into new areas. To its critics, it risks fatally undermining the ambition of the Paris Agreement at a time when there is clear evidence of the need to go further and faster to avoid the worst effects of climate change,"" Carbon Brief explains. While Article 6 is a highly technical area, the underlying issues are political, with some countries forming unofficial alliances to defend their own interests rather than the common good of the planet. But politicians have been put on notice that this time the world's public is watching closely. Horse-trading cannot be allowed to put our futures at risk. \"

Not mentioned in her announcement was how COP 25 had to change locations from Chile to Spain at very short notice (after it had already changed locations from Brazil to Chile), after riots erupted around Chile in protest to energy price hikes to pay for her climate change programs, thus forcing Chilean President Sebastian Pinera to put troops on the streets and cancel his plans to host COP 25 . Stated goals of COP 25 On November 30, 2019, Alex Newman[2]wrote the following about the goals of the UN COP 25 ""Climate"" Summit[3] prior to its December 2nd, 2019 beginning in Madrid, Spain (Alex Newman is a foreign correspondent for The New American who has traveled the world reporting on the UN's climate agenda.): 'Organizers of the summit made clear that they have big plans to advance global governance and 'green' policies at the planetary level. ' COP25 is the first summit of a new cycle,' boasted Spanish 'Minister for the Ecological Transition' Teresa Ribera, who is playing a key role organizing and running the upcoming UN summit. As Robera said in an interview, 'In Madrid, global climate negotiations are entering a new phase, with a focus on reaching more ambitious climate action by everyone, because what we have on the table is nowhere near enough to prevent average temperatures from rising more than 1.5C, let alone 2C. Everyone, including governments, regions, cities, and social and economic agents' must be aligned with the embattled UN Paris Agreement. 'We cannot delay climate action any longer.... This is what societies are demanding."" The UN and most of its member governments are seeking to finalize rules for an emerging global 'carbon market.' Under the controversial plan, humanity will pay for emissions of the gas people exhale, commonly known as carbon dioxide or CO2, as part of Western governments' plans to reduce their people's emissions of the essential-to-life gas. Another key item on the agenda is 'climate financing,' organizers said. After all, totally restructuring the economy of the world, as leading UN officials claim is required, will take a lot of money.' Hypocrisy of climate attendees As reported by Mark Morano of Climate Depot[4]: ""UN climate summit delegates and activists attending lined up daily for hamburgers[5] at the conferences' onsite Burger King despite the UN warnings that eating meat is not climate-friendly."" See: Flashback: UN admits Cutting CO2 'not enough' - 'We must change food production to save the world[6] There is also the issue of air travel[7] to and from COP 25 ? Of concern to environmentalists is that air travel produces greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel, which contributes to global warming when released into the atmosphere. According to the provisional list[8] (pdf) published by the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), a grand total of 26,706 participants registered for COP25 [9].This breaks down into 13,643 people representing specific parties, 9,987 from observer organizations - such as scientists, business groups and various non-governmental organizations - and 3,076 journalists. How many flew in privatejets to Madrid? Nancy Pelosi's boondoggle delegation to Madrid Speaker Nancy Pelosi[10] and a bicameral Congressional Delegation found it necessary to spent two days at COP 25 . There were 15 in all in her delegation who traveled by air on the taxpayer's dime. Despite President Trump's decision to remove this nation from the Paris Accords, Pelosi gave this message[11] of assurance on behalf of the U.S. Congress at the end of their stay in Madrid: 'Today, our delegation concluded a successful two-day visit to COP25 in Madrid with a message on behalf of the U.S. Congress of 'We're still in,'' Speaker Pelosi said. 'Combating the climate crisis is the existential threat of our time and it was essential that our delegation stand with international partners, who are continuing to build upon and solidify their commitments to meet the Paris Agreement's goals."" The Pelosi delegation trip was expensive, probably costing millions of dollars in travel, lodging, food, and security. Yet this was just the tip of the iceberg. Are we to feel better because Speaker Pelosi purchased carbon offsets to cover all air travel involved in this Congressional Delegation visit to COP25 ? Some sound science and climate realism at COP 25 Reported by H. Sterling Burnett[12], senior fellow on Energy Policy, in Climate Change Weekly #344, The Heartland Institute[13],one of the world's leading free-market think tanks based in Arlington Heights, Illinois, challenged COP 25 in Madrid by bringing a heavy dose of sound science and climate realism. Headlining Heartland's event were four distinguished men and nineteen-year-old German YouTube personality Naomi Seibt: Award-winning physicist Will Happer, Ph.D. and former top science advisor to President Donald Trump. Happer's presentation documented human greenhouse gas emissions are having much less impact on global temperatures than predicted by alarmist climate theory and are certainly not causing a climate crisis. Meteorologist Anthony Watts, a Heartland Institute senior fellow, showed the majority of official temperature stations are corrupted by artificial heat sources and other factors, giving the appearance of more warming than is measured by global satellites instruments and weather balloons. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane researcher Stanley Goldenberg explained there is no evidence indicating hurricanes are becoming more frequent or severe as the planet warms. Goldenberg pointed out how even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges this. Chilean civil engineer Douglas Pollack noted the Chilean government's climate policies have made the nation's electricity prices the highest in South America. The government's price increase for the country's Metro system -- the main mode of transportation for the urban poor in order to pay for its switch to being run on expensive renewable power -- was the last straw that resulted in protests and riots in Chile. Naomi Seibt presented an account of how she transformed from believing in a climate crisis to being a climate realist. After fact-checking the assertions of her teachers and the media, she realized propaganda was triumphing over science in the climate change debateView a full video[14] of Heartland's Climate Reality Forum presentations. The five individuals noted above are featured, along with other distinguished Heartland COP 25 speakers. Outcome of UN COP 25 The marathon COP 25 talks went into over[15] time[16] extending more than 36 hours past theexpected conclusion on Friday, December14, makingCOP 25 the longest UN climate conference to date.There were riftsover how to tackle the climate crisis and who should pay for it.The Washington Post devoted[17] an entire article to highlighting poor countries and slamming the wealthy or developed nations for not helping smaller countries deal with the climate crises before negotiators managed to seal a vague agreement[18] in a last-ditch effort on Sunday, December 16. Activists were hoping for a bolder approach to curbing climate-changing greenhouse gases.This statement was made by UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres[19] on the outcome of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid (Guterres, is an admitted socialist. Before taking the reins at the UN, he led the Socialist International, the world's most powerful alliance of Socialist and Marxist political parties.): 'I am disappointed with the results of # COP25 . The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up.I am more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise."" Read here[20] a powerful, riveting, and damming account of what really happened at the two-week COP 25 summit as written by Alex Newman[21]on Monday, December 16, 2019: Following are highlights from Alex Newman's article: 'Throughout the United Nations COP25 'Climate' summit in Spain, America, the GOP, and President Donald Trump not carbon dioxide or even 'climate change' were public enemy number one. Indeed, the U.S. government, the American people, their elected officials, and what remains of the free-market system that ushered in unprecedented global prosperity were all viciously and relentlessly attacked.' 'Globalists, communists, Islamists, socialists, environmentalists, and crackpots of all varieties dropped the mask in a carefully orchestrated show. Incredibly, even the many prominent Americans who spoke at the summit demonized their own nation and the freedom that made it so successful. John Kerry spoke from one of the most prominent stages at the UN suit declaring that he was ashamed of being an American. Not a single conservative, pro-America speaker could be found among the 25,000 attendees.' If CO2 were the real enemy, the UN summit would have been praising America non-stop as our nation's emissions of the essential gas continues to plummet, and would have instead gone after Communist China which is by far the largest emitter of CO2.The hatred expressed against this nation at COP 25is because President Trump dared to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, meaning that the U.S. government will not be forking over billions of dollars of climate 'reparations' under the guise of ' loss and damage[22].'In short, poor and middle-class American taxpayers would end up paying Third World kleptocrats for supposedly causing bad weather, forest fires, and other natural disasters. Until China and India play by the same rules as the rest of the world, when we have some real science or breakthroughs that can actually produce carbonless energy (start with new nuclear powered power generating facilities), when there is solid proof that climate change is man induced, and or that we can do something about it, our nation should not play the UN's wealth confiscation game.

Thunberg arrived in Lisbon after nearly three weeks at sea, before giving a press conference at the port alongside youth activists and crew members. ""We need to work together to make sure that we secure future living conditions for humankind and that we fight for not only ourselves but for our children and for our grandchildren and for every single living being on earth,"" the teenage activist told reporters. ""We will go to COP25 in Madrid and we will continue the fight there to make sure that within those walls, the voices of the people are being heard,"" she added. Around 25,000 people from 200 countries are expected to attend the COP25 climate change conference in Madrid this week. They include dozens of heads of state and government, business leaders, scientists and activists like Thunberg. The Madrid meeting is the last gathering of the COP group before 2020 -- the year when the Paris agreement comes into effect. When nations signed the deal back in 2015, they agreed that global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak in 2020 at the latest, and then start coming down -- or the world will face disastrous and irreversible damage. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA79","COP25: CITIES AND REGIONS SHOW UNITY TO BOOST CLIMATE ACTION","December 19, 2019 Thursday 4:54 PM  EST","US Fed News","BRUSSELS, Belgium, Dec. 19 -- The European Union's Committee of the Regions issued the following news release: COP25 did not reach an agreement on the rules for the full implementation of the Paris agreement. Regional indicators within the Paris rulebook and the call for multilevel collaboration did not make it to the final decision either. Nevertheless, Madrid demonstrated that cities and regions worldwide are firmly committed to higher climate ambition and action. The delegation of the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) strongly defended the pivotal role cities and regions play in tackling global warming and the need to formalise their role in global climate governance. Glasgow is to host COP26 in December 2020 with expectations focusing on higher climate commitments and multilevel action. Click here to access the CoR's COP25 photo album. The 25th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) failed to reach an agreement on the pending aspects of the Paris rulebook - the set of procedures, rules and reporting mechanisms to put the Paris agreement into practice as of 2020. Global carbon markets and emissions trading mechanisms, finance support for climate adaptation in developing countries and higher climate commitments prevented COP25 negotiators to reach an agreement in Madrid. The European Committee of the Regions attended COP25 with a delegation led by First Vice-President Markku Markkula and the following members: Jean-Noel Verfaillie (RE/FR), CoR's ENVE 2nd Vice-Chair and Member of the Nord Departmental Council, Benedetta Brighenti (PES/IT), Member of Castelnuovo Rangone Municipal Council, Andries Gryffroy (EA/BE), Member of the Flemish Parliament and First Vice-President of the Senate and Tjisse Stelpstra (ECR/NL), Member of the Executive Council of the Province of Drenthe. In addition, several CoR members attended COP25 on behalf of their constituencies. These include Ximo Puig (PES/ES), President of the Valencia Region and President of the Spanish delegation at the CoR, Raffaele Cattaneo (EPP/IT), Minister for Environment and Climate Change of Lombardy, Francisco Igea Arisqueta (RE/ES), Vice-President of the Government of Castile and Leon, Manuel Cardenete Flores (RE/ES), Deputy Minister for Tourism, Regeneration, Justice and Local Administration of the Government of Andalusia, Virginia Marco Carcel (ES/PES), Director-General for European Affairs of the Government of Castile-La Mancha, Mikel Irujo Amezaga (EA/ES), Director-General for External Action of the Government of Navarre, Sirpa Hertell (EPP/FI), City councillor of Espoo and Witold Stepien (EPP/PL), Member of the Lodzkie Regional Assembly. Two participants of the CoR's programme 'Young Elected Politicians United 4 Climate' were present at COP25 : Henrick Wickstrom (RE/FI), Councillor and Chairman of the Municipal board of the City of Inkoo and Maximilian Reinhardt (RE/DE), Councillor at the City of Sindelfingen in charge of European Affairs. CoR members delivered keynote speeches in over 20 events and took part in more than 15 bilateral meetings. Members attended high-level briefings on the state of the negotiations with the European Commission, Finland's EU Presidency and MEPs. The CoR's key political messages at COP25 are summarised here. This is a summary of activities of CoR members at COP25 . SATURDAY 7 DECEMBER The activities of the CoR delegation at COP25 The Under2 Coalition is a global community of state and regional governments committed to ambitious climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. The coalition brings together more than 220 governments who represent over 1.3 billion people and 43% of the global economy. A recent report confirms regional climate action exceeds that of national governments. The CoR committed to strengthen cooperation with this decisive climate leadership global network of regional governments and its secretariat, The Climate Group. The Navarra region took the floor as an active member of the Under2 Coalition, represented by Regional Minister for Environment and Rural Affairs, Itziar Gomez and the CoR member Mikel Irujo (ES/EA). First VP Markku Markkula participated in the EU pavilion at the events 'Accelerating transition: How cities and regions make a difference', in cooperation with ICLEI, and 'From data to policy: unlocking the power of indexes for Sustainable Development and Climate Action', event co-organised by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). SUNDAY 8 DECEMBER First VP Markku Markkula and Raffaele Cattaneo (IT/EPP) took part in the session 'Regional leadership in the Climate Emergency. Nature-based solutions for adaptation and the water challenge'. Raffaele Cattaneo (IT/EPP) also took the floor at the General Assembly of Regions4.

Benedetta Brighenti (PES/IT) provided the concluding remarks with the presence of new EU Commissioner for energy, Kadri Simson. ""2020 will be a turning point for the Covenant as it has to drive cities and regions towards the EU's 2030 targets. The Covenant must be able to respond to upcoming challenges and is pivotal to achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal"", said Benedetta Brighenti, rapporteur of the CoR opinion on the Covenant of Mayors post 2020. First Vice-President of the Belgian Senate and CoR member Andries Gryffroy (EA/BE) took the floor at the session 'Global trends in climate legislation and litigation: Enhancing resilience and adaptation'. CoR Member Tjisse Stelpstra (ECR/NL) was a panellist at the German Pavilion on 'Smart urban transitions: innovative and efficient mobility solutions.' The Regional Minister and Vice Governor for the province of Drenthe said: ""We must transform our modes of transport as it accounts for 23% of total EU emissions and creates high external costs such as pollution, accidents, noise and congestion. We need to develop Mobility-as-a-Service approaches from a user-centric perspective and modernise power grids, electricity storage and the management of public infrastructure in order to deploy innovative fuel cell and battery technologies. We will not succeed in decarbonising transport without efficient cooperation between all levels of government."" TUESDAY 10 DECEMBER The EU pavilion gathered a wide range of representatives of local and regional governments, industry associations, NGOs, private companies and officials from the EU and UNFCCC for the 'EU Energy Day @ COP25 '. Topics included: the transformation of the energy system towards 100% renewables, accelerating innovation to achieve the European Green Deal, ensuring a just transition for all regions and citizens, creating local conditions to improve the energy performance of buildings, and the role of the EU's Copernicus programme in Europe's decarbonisation. First VP Markku Markkula delivered a keynote speech stressing that ""Capacity-building for public and private decision makers is essential. Urban planning, renovation of old buildings and intelligent energy grids must all be priority areas for knowledge-based collaboration."" The Chile Pavilion hosted the event: 'Roadmap towards COP26: From Chile to UK' where VP Markkula declared: ""How can we move on to achieve the climate goals? It is a learning process. It is about bench learning, bench marking and bench acting."" The focus was on 'consolidating city and subnational contributions to raising climate ambition.' A delegation of nine CoR members attended Executive Vice-President (EVP) Frans Timmermans' briefing on the state of the negotiations at COP25 together with the European Parliament's delegation, led by MEP Bas Eickhout (NL/Greens&EFA), members of several national parliaments and of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). EVP Timmermans said, ""a no deal is better than a bad deal"", referring to negotiation outcomes on global carbon markets and emissions trading mechanisms that could undermine decarbonisation efforts. Tjisse Stelpstra (NL/ECR) had a bilateral meeting with MEP Bas Eickhout (NL/Greens&EFA) on multilevel governance and a hydrogen project in the province of Drenthe. Raffaele Cattaneo (IT/EPP) was one of the panellists in the Italian Pavilions' side event 'We are Action - Young People Leading the Way.'

The communication on the European Green Deal was also on the table. Members shared their will to engage the European Committee of the Regions on the numerous legislative works ahead, recalled cities and regions are already more ambitious than national governments and reiterated their commitment to deploy all efforts to deliver the climate neutral transition locally. Read here the press release. A press point with VP Markkula and President Puig took place at the EU Pavilion after the meeting. Markku Markkula said: ""The European Union needs to keep leading the fight against global warming. The communication on the Green Deal comes very timely as we are entering the final phase of the negotiations for the full implementation of the Paris agreement. The CoR reiterates its commitments to fully contribute to the objectives of the Green Deal yet ensuring cities and regions are fully on board, leaving no one behind."" Demonstrating CoR' members commitment to foster climate action on the ground, President Ximo Puig said: ""The energy consumed by the regional administration, including office buildings, public schools and hospitals will come from 100% green and renewable energy sources at the end of my mandate."" Raffaele Cattaneo (IT/EPP) spoke at the Italian Pavilion during the high-level event 'CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) Italy report: a dive into the cases of climate leadership and trends by Italian business and local governments.' Andries Gryffroy (BE/EA) was a guest speaker at The Netherlands' Inter-parliamentary event: 'Spice up the European Green Deal with Benelux Parliament' at the Benelux Pavilion. THURSDAY 12 DECEMBER Andries Gryffroy (BE/EA) took part in a debate on climate adaptation legislation and policy making at the UNFCCC Resilience Lab. ""Global warming is hitting our territories already and we have no choice but to develop effective policies to adapt to climate change. National governments must empower local and regional governments as to green our cities and develop nature-based solutions in order to minimise climate risks and related losses and damage"", said Gryffroy. The VP of the Flemish Senate also took part in the 'Electricity Security in Support of Mitigation and Adaptation Efforts' at the French pavilion. Sirpa Hertell (FI/EPP) delivered a keynote speech at the UK Pavilion at an event orgnaised by The Grantham Institute - an initiative of The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment. FRIDAY 13 DECEMBER COP25 latest day started with prospects of talks being delayed over the weekend. In line with the call of the Local Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) constituency to the United Nations, the non-state actor gathering local and regional governments worldwide, the European Committee of the Regions requested the European Commission and Finland's EU Presidency to give support to the inclusion of 'multilevel collaboration' in the final COP25 decision. As negotiations were stocked on carbon markets and final assistance for climate adaptation to developing economies, texts were brought to a minimum common denominator. That prevailed any reference to multilevel collaboration, an even less, regional indicators within the Paris rulebook, to be integrated in the final decisions. Madrid has nevertheless demonstrated that cities and regions worldwide are firmly committed to higher ambition and to keep delivering climate action locally. On the road to COP26 in Glasgow, the Local Governments and Municipal Authorities (LGMA) Constituency calls for increased climate ambition and action by national governments, including the full engagement of local and regional governments in the preparation of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

How dare you!'She later met with former President Barack Obama (who called her one of the 'planet's greatest advocates[12]'), the actor Leonardo DiCaprio[13] and had a brief run-in[14] with President Donald Trump, who has spent years rolling back America's environmental laws.Thunberg had initially intended to stay on this side of the Atlantic for much longer, eventually making her way to Chile, where this year's U.N. climate summit was meant to be held. But the event was moved to Spain after protests broke out in Santiago, leaving Thunberg in a tough spot with limited time to arrange other eco-friendly travel.The Times noted that the journey to Spain should take about three weeks, ideally getting her to Madrid when the COP kicks off on Dec. 2[15].

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA85","With COP 25, Year 2019 Ended In Climate Of Inaction: Will India Save Future Of Paris Agreement? \u8211  Analysis","December 30, 2019 Monday","Eurasia Review","By Aparna Roy The disappointing outcome of the 25thConference of Parties ( COP25 ) should not surprise the world. In fact, year 2019 saw several economies faltering on climate action. The United States (US) had indicated that it will be moving out of the Paris Agreement after November 2020. Brazil, a major oil economy and home to the world's largest carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbing Amazonian rain forests has decided to continue to deforest. The position of the world's fourth-largest coal-producer, Australia, on climate action, has remained uncertain. On the other hand, progress on phasing out fossil fuels- a major source of greenhouse gases, has been extremely slow. Climate action by three major fossil fuel producers, the US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, is estimated to be critically insufficient to meet the world's climate objectives. As per theUN's Production Gap report2019 the world's coal and oil productions is projected to increase by 150% and 16% respectively in 2030 than the absolute 2oC compliance limit. Surprisingly, China, once a frontrunner in global climate action, has built 43,000 MW of coal-fired power projects between January 2018 and June 2019, when the rest of the world brought down coal power capacity by 8,100 MW. The UN in its recently releasedEmission Gap Report 2019estimated that global emissions will be 30% and 120% higher than the 2oC and 1.5oC limit respectively by 2030, and warned that even in case all nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are met, the world will be hotter by 3.2oC by 2100. The world is already 1.1oC warmer today than pre-industrial levels. Even this level of warming leading to climate change, is manifesting in the form of extreme weather events with devastating impacts. As the world has just 12 years of emissions window left to exhaust the carbon budget for 1.5oC warming, a climate change catastrophe is looming. However, despite scientific evidence, the negotiations at CoP25 were faced with widening differences between parties on key issues such as rules for carbon markets to offset emissions, climate finance and support to vulnerable countries for the loss and damage suffered due to climate change impacts. Under these circumstances, the world now demands a stronger voice to fill the leadership vacuum in climate governance and push for collective efforts to combat climate change.Analystsfeel that the US exit from the Paris Agreement has paved the way to global climate leadership for economies that have sustained record of strong and committed climate action, such as the European Union (EU) and India. In recent times, the EU and India have both displayed immense credentials, commitment and leadership potential by taking affirmative action in significantly reducing carbon emissions. The EU has embarked on ambitious emission reduction programmes for successfully transitioning towards a low emissions economy, aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. It is the first major economy to put in place a unique legally-binding legislative framework to deliver on its pledges under the Paris Agreement. The European Green Deal introduced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during CoP25 , is a rare, comprehensive and an ambitious programme being viewed as a ""game-changer"" by experts. Requiring a massive mobilization of resources and fundamental changes to policies for a fair transition to a low-carbon economy, the Green Deal could have a galvanising effect for other countries to step up their efforts to tackle climate change. Moreover, the EU has already over-achieved its 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and is currently the world's leading donor of development assistance, providing over 40% of the world's public climate finance. Though EU's climate action is commendable, however, the country is not in a position yet to independently assume the leadership that climate governance requires.First, despite its aggressive efforts in climate action, a report by European Environment Agency released at Madrid during CoP25 highlights that the current rate of progress as per the twenty-eight draft national energy and climate plans submitted by EU member states is insufficient to reach net-zero emission trajectory by 2030 and 2050. Slow action in phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies, insufficient investments in clean technologies and over-reliance on unsustainable energy means constraints EU's achievements in climate and energy targets. Second, conflicting interests and rising oppositions from most coal-reliant member states such as Poland, and industrial lobbies that are sceptical about difficult economic changes, international competitiveness and jobs complicate the EU's ambitions and efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Insufficient monitoring and compliance mechanism further restrain the implementation of these policies. Third, the ongoing political fragmentation between Eastern and Western Europe and Northern and Southern Europe and populist parties mobilizing resistance to the necessary policies have effected efficient decision-making. Therefore, EU's historical method of depoliticizing development issues and raising them for technocratic debates is unlikely to deliver results. Between the US's withdrawal and EU's dubious climate credentials, immense opportunities exist for India to counterbalance the existing climate leadership equilibrium. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to go ""above and beyond"" the Paris Agreement on climate change. This is indicative of India's decisive leadership on Climate Change on a global scale. India is already on the path of a clean energy revolution and is making significant accomplishments in achieving its pledge to the Paris Agreement. According to recent statement by India's Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate ChangePrakash Javadekar at CoP25 , India is ""walking the talk"" in its climate change commitments. India has reduced emission intensity by 21 per cent of its GDP and is projected to achieve the goal of 35 per cent emission reduction by 2030. It is leading the set few countries that are on track to meeting their Paris commitments. According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), India will over-achieve its national climate target by about 15 per cent. As a strategy to reduce its emission, India has embarked on a massive renewable energy programme. India has already achieved 83 gigawatt (GW) of 175 GW renewable energy generation capacity target by 2030 and has subsequently increased the target to 450 GW. Globally, India stands fourth in wind power, fifth in solar power and fifth in overall renewable power installed capacity. India has started to levy a carbon tax on coal production at a rate of 6 USD per tonne. India realises the priority of placing resilience and adaptation as an integral part of climate action. Its' recently launched international Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure aims to aid knowledge exchange and provide technical support on developing disaster and climate resilient infrastructure. Moreover, India has one of the largest programmes in the world to ensure carbon sink in land resources and aims to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. Even under India's new tax regime, 5% of GST is now levied on electric cars, vis-a-vis 28% tax on conventional cars. India has operated a commercial flight on 100 per cent biofuel and targeting blending of 20 per cent ethanol in petrol by 2030. The green power revolution is envisaged to attract millions in investment and create job opportunities, while providing a substantial boost to export of new commodities. In the aftermath of creating the largest market of solar power for itself, India has now proposed a pioneering commitment to sell only electric cars by 2030. Besides ambitious actions, climate change leadership requires an approach that goes hand in hand with the needs and interests of the poor and most vulnerable. Being the largest democracy, India is a shining example of how stronger climate actions could be successfully aligned with development imperatives. India has played a crucial role in climate negotiations during the Paris Agreement. It has strongly defended the concept of ""differentiated responsibilities"" and have argued for less stringent climate restrictions for developing countries as they need more room to grow in the limited carbon space. Given the present leadership impasse, the world would be keenly following India's role on climate action in the future forums in year 2020. As EU has a long way to go to leverage its influence at the international stage, India is poised to utilize this potential opportunity and fill the leadership void that global climate change governance urgently needs.

Countries are being urged to significantly raise renewable energy ambition and adopt targets to transform the global energy system in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), according to a new report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) that will be released at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid. The report will show that renewable energy ambition within NDCs would have to more than double by 2030 to put the world in line with the Paris Agreement goals, cost-effectively reaching 7.7 terawatts (TW) of globally installed capacity by then. Todays renewable energy pledges under the NDCs are falling short of this, targeting only 3.2 TW. The report NDCs in 2020: Advancing Renewables in the Power Sector and Beyond will be released at IRENAs official side event on enhancing NDCs and raising ambition on 11 December 2019. It will state that with over 2.3 TW installed renewable capacity today, almost half of the additional renewable energy capacity foreseen by current NDCs has already been installed. The analysis will also highlight that delivering on increased renewable energy ambition can be achieved in a cost-effective way and with considerable socio-economic benefits across the world. Increasing renewable energy targets is absolutely necessary, said IRENAs Director-General Francesco La Camera. Much more is possible. There is a decisive opportunity for policy makers to step up climate action by raising ambition on renewables, which are the only immediate solution to meet rising energy demand whilst decarbonising the economy and building resilience. IRENAs analysis shows that a pathway to a decarbonised economy is technologically possible and socially and economically beneficial, continued Mr. La Camera. Renewables are good for growth, good for job creation and deliver significant welfare benefits. With renewables, we can also expand energy access and help eradicate energy poverty in line with the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. IRENA will promote knowledge exchange, strengthen partnerships and work with all stakeholders to catalyse action on the ground. We are engaging with countries and regions worldwide to facilitate renewable energy projects and raise their ambitions. NDCs must become a driving force for an accelerated global energy transformation. The current pledges reflect neither the past decades rapid growth nor the ongoing market trends for renewables. Through a higher renewable energy ambition, NDCs could serve to advance multiple climate and development objectives. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA87","Nearly 40% of Plant Species are Very Rare and Vulnerable to Climate Change: University of Connecticut","November 28, 2019 Thursday 7:36 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","[TNSbiologyresearch-Science Advances journal] -- The University of Connecticut issued the following news: Almost 40% of global land plant species are categorized as very rare, and these species are most at risk for extinction as the climate continues to change, according to new research published today in Science Advances. The findings are published in a special issue of Science Advances that coincides with the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , in Madrid. The COP25 is convening nations to act on climate change. The international meeting runs from Dec. 2 through Dec. 13. ""When talking about global biodiversity, we had a good approximation of the total number of land plant species, but we didn't have a real handle on how many there really are,"" says lead author Brian Enquist, of the University of Arizona. Thirty-five researchers from institutions around the world, including University of Connecticut researcher Cory Merow, worked for 10 years to compile nearly 35 million observational records of the world's land plants. The researchers hope this information can help reduce loss of global biodiversity by informing strategic conservation action that includes consideration of the effects of climate change. They found that there are about 435,000 unique land plant species on Earth. ""So that's an important number to have, but it's also just bookkeeping. What we really wanted to understand is the nature of that diversity and what will happen to this diversity in the future,"" Enquist says. ""Some species are found everywhere - they're like the Starbucks of plant species. But others are very rare - think a small standalone cafe."" The team revealed that 36.5% of all land plant species are ""exceedingly rare,"" meaning they have only been observed and recorded less than five times ever. ""According to ecological and evolutionary theory, we'd expect many species to be rare, but the actual observed number we found was actually pretty startling,"" he says. ""There are many more rare species than we expected."" Moreover, the researchers found that rare species tend to cluster in a handful of hotspots, such as the Northern Andes in South America, Costa Rica, South Africa, Madagascar and Southeast Asia. These regions, they found, remained climatologically stable as the world emerged from the last ice age, allowing such rare species to persist. But just because these species enjoyed a relatively stable climate in the past doesn't mean they'll enjoy a stable future. The research also revealed that these very rare-species hotspots are projected to experience a disproportionally high rate of future climatic changes and human disruption, Enquist says. And it's these rare species that science knows very little about. By focusing on identifying rare species, ""this work is better able to highlight the dual threats of climate change and human impact on the regions that harbor much of the world's rare plant species and emphasizes the need for strategic conservation to protect these cradles of biodiversity,"" says Patrick Roehrdanz, a co-author on the paper and managing scientist at Conservation International. This work was done in collaboration with the SPARC project (Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change), which was funded by the Global Environment Facility and made possible by Conservation International and a National Science Foundation grant to the University of Arizona.

In their letter, the Senators sound the alarm on the crisis of climate change and the damage that will be inflicted on Americans for future generations unless immediate action is taken. The Senators warned the President against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue, and admonished him for failing to honor his commitment to work with Democrats to renegotiate the Paris Climate Accord or to craft a new deal. The letter comes as the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference takes place in Madrid this week. The Senators wrote , ""As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs."" The letter also emphasized the national security implications related to the President's withdrawal, underscoring the damage done to the United States' reputation by reneging on an international commitment. The Senators' letter further illustrates the outcry from Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Google. The Senators conclude their letter by reminding the President of the overwhelming number of Americans who believe the United States should participate in the Paris Climate Agreement three out of every four registered voters or 77 percent. The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Tom Udall (D-NM), Angus King (I-ME), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV). The letter can be read in full here . Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation the International Climate Change Accountability Act - that would prevent the President from using funds to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has historically helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the President's anti-environment agenda, and has fought his continued efforts to invalidate scientific evidence of climate change. This week, Shaheen also led a bipartisan group of Senators in a letter to Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in support of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) and their commitment to global efforts to thwart climate change.

""Despite the President's dangerous and shortsighted decision, we want the world to know that we are still in and are committed to combating climate change with bold and aggressive action. The bottom line is the countries that are out front on climate action will benefit the most in terms of innovation, job creation and economic growth.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA93","New Research: The Big Polluters Bankrolling COP25","December 6, 2019 Friday 8:21 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Corporate Accountability issued the following news release: New research reveals that the corporations bankrolling this year's UN climate talks in Madrid, COP25 , are some of Spain's biggest polluters and tied to human rights abuses, shady lobbying and greenwashing around the globe. The infographic and fact-file, released on ""Business and Industry NGO (BINGO) Day"" a day dedicated to corporations and their trade associations, was released by Corporate Europe Observatory, Corporate Accountability, Ecologistas En Accion and Observatory of Multinationals in Latin America. Corporate sponsorship has become an unfortunate norm in the UN climate talks. At both COP24 in Poland and COP21 in France, where the Paris Agreement was agreed, Europe's biggest polluters were featured prominently inside and outside of the talks. Through their sponsorship, corporations are not only able to wrap themselves in the green branding associated with the talks, they are also afforded increased access that perfectly positions them to have greater influence over the negotiations. Key findings include: Endesa: Spain's biggest utility and a subsidiary of Italian Enel, it produces electricity from coal, oil and gas and is Spain's biggest single polluting company. Its operations are responsible for 9.3 percent of emissions in Spain. In Latin America, its parent company Enel has been involved in numerous controversial hydroelectric dam projects, leading to widespread human rights and environmental abuses. Iberdrola: Despite claiming to be a green energy company, two-thirds of the new capacity the gas giant commissioned in 2017 were gas-based. In Latin America it has violated indigenous rights as well as being behind one of the continent's most destructive mega-dams, Belo Monte. Banco Santander: Spain's largest bank is heavily involved in financing coal in Poland. It has provided financing for companies involved in deforestation and the building of mega-dams in Latin America. Suez: Suez is one of the largest water privatization corporations in Chile and around the globe; its operations feature rate hikes, lay-offs, water quality issues, and shut-offs to low-income communities. Suez and its largest shareholder, Engie, are deeply involved in lobbying and obstruction on climate policy at the national and international levels. Sponsorship is a symptom of a larger problem of corporate interference at the UNFCCC. Inside the talks, trade associations and industry groups representing the interests of the fossil fuel industry and other Big Polluters stalk the halls and push their members' agenda. The result of this corporate omnipresence is clear--year after the year the talks have failed to deliver on their objectives, except where corporations have interests. One such area are the guidelines on Article 6, which Big Polluters have ensured includes carbon markets as one of the means of collaborating between countries when implementing the Paris Agreement. Corporations, led by the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), have lobbied heavily to use this Article to make carbon trading schemes that are devoid of limits or protections central to Paris Agreement implementation, IETA's members include Endesa's parent company Enel, Iberdrola which are both sponsors of COP25 . ""For just a fraction of yearly profits, Big Polluters are able to wrap themselves in the branding of the COP and use this access to influence the negotiations,"" said Sriram Madhusoodanan of Corporate Accountability, ""With the rules on the industry-backed carbon trading schemes high on the agenda this year, it's no surprise that some of Spain's biggest polluters have lined up with bags of cash. If Big Polluters and their industry groups like IETA get what they want, the Paris Agreement won't curb business as usual, or drastically reduce emissions in line with the Paris commitments leading to further climate catastrophe."" ""Every time the COP is in Europe it's bankrolled by the continents biggest polluters, and COP25 is no different. Endesa is Spain's most polluting company, and with two million euros it's managed to buy an obscene amount of space to promote its pro-climate propaganda,"" said Pascoe Sabido, Corporate Europe Observatory. ""Such blatant greenwashing is a slap in the face for most of us, yet welcomed by our governments, who actively seek their investment, thanks to their cosy relationship to the dirtiest industries. We need to keep these companies as far away from our decision makers as possible - both in the UN and in our national capitals."" ""The stock market reflects the economic and financial power of the Ibex35 at COP25 . For the largest sponsoring companies such as Iberdrola, Endesa, Santander and BBVA, it is a magnificent opportunity for greenwashing, letting them hide the impact of their greenhouse gas emissions as well as the numerous socio-environmental conflicts they've caused. What's more, they have been given tax breaks for their contributions thanks to their privileged relationship to the Spanish government while ensuring that the COP25 negotiations respond to their interests. A win-win for corporations."" ""In addition to fossil fuel companies, we need to pay close attention to the role of companies in the agricultural and forestry sectors within the UNFCCC. As this report and our own work at the Global Forest Coalition (GFC) shows, big agribusiness has captured international and national-level agricultural and trade policy-making, which continue to push this unsustainable agro-industrial model by incentivizing and subsidizing it. Companies such as Santander fund transnational agribusiness corporations and the impacts of these investments on indigenous peoples, the rights of women's, forests and biodiversity, is terrible. In addition, this situation is leading to increased criminalization and murders of environmental rights defenders. These corporations' time for greenwashing is over -- it's time to kick them out."" - Ruth Nyambura, Global Forest Coalition ""Time and again, corporations ignore communities and the lands that they feed from. They extract resources and use their profits to oil their way into negotiations like COP and use their greenwashing to try and position themselves as acceptable,"" said Vidya Dikar with Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development. Corporations must stop financing governments, their lobbyists, our elections and instead pay for their pollution and human rights abuses."" ""As a US youth delegate to the climate talks for several years now, I have seen firsthand the ludicrousness of corporations using the UN as a marketing scheme. In Morocco at COP22, companies like OCP and Managem have actively harmed local communities. Safi, a fishing village had their livelihoods destroyed by phosphorus pollution by OCP. Managem's silver mining have contaminated the local water supply of the Amazigh people, native to Morocco. These are stories that mirror the fact that at COP25 , Endesa is both one of the largest sponsors and largest greenhouse gas emitters in Spain. Enough is enough -- we cannot let corporations use the climate talks as a marketing campaign to greenwash without accountability. We need to make them pay to honor the people most impacted by their environmental crimes."" Orion Camero, SustainUS Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6952112 MSTRUCK \"

COP25 is one of many experiential learning opportunities that Tuck students have access to as they explore energy, climate change, and sustainability. by Betsy Vereckey Jan 16, 2020 As world leaders and activists continue to urge immediate action on climate change, Tuck students recently got the chance to show their commitment to helping solve one of the central issues of our time. Last month, 10 Tuckies attended the COP25 conference in Madrid, an annual conference hosted by the United Nations designed to reach a global agreement to address climate change. Corporations have both a role and an opportunity to lead in the areas of corporate sustainability, ESG, and lowering their carbon emissions, says April Salas, executive director of Tucks Revers Center for Energy, endowed in 2016 to inspire and shape tomorrows leaders in energy. COP provides a unique lens on where policy, market formation, and corporations intersect, and Im thrilled our students had the opportunity to witness this intersection firsthand. As in many previous years, Tuck was the only business school to send a student delegation to COP25 , also known as the Conference of Parties, which gives Tuck students an up-close look at climate change negotiations. It was very energizing to see all these young people committed to finding solutions to climate change and an amazing experience to see the negotiators working live on behalf of their countries and hearing whats important to them, said Melina Sanchez Montanes T20, a director of the Tuck Social Venture Fund, who worked in impact investing in Israel last summer with Impact First Investments. Montanes, who is pursuing a dual MBA/MPA with Tuck and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said she came away from the conference with the realization that more investment is sorely needed. There needs to be more blended finance and more contribution from the private sector, she said. No one has committed enough to move the needle. Part of the Tuck student delegation in Madrid. COP25 with professor Tracy Bach, a law professor and subject matter expert on climate change negotiations. Bach held workshops for Tuckies before the conference to prepare them and, while there, introduced students to delegates from Myanmar, whom Bach was advising directly at the conference. Students who attended COP took what they learned from world delegates and returned to Hanover eager to share their observations. Thanks to Tucks Revers Center for Energy and the Center for Business, Government and Society, COP25 In addition, students regularly participate in immersive learning experiences off campus. The environmental and social governance (ESG) investing deep dive, for example, brings students to New York City where they visit BlackRock and the first architect of the green bond. During the energy GIX in Moroccohost to COP22 and home to the worlds largest concentrated solar farmstudents have the opportunity to see the direct impact of climate and clean energy investment decisions firsthand. Students also lead and participate in campus speaker series and events around timely issues, and have the opportunity to design their own independent studies around social issues. The climate crisis can seem like this huge problem, where we dont even know where to start, and it can feel defeating and deafening. But if you find your sliver of the pie and give it everything you can give, the world will be in a better place. It is important for us to provide unique, hands-on learning opportunities for students to experience the full value chain of sustainability and clean energy investment decisions, says Salas. Many of the challenges our students will face as business leaders involve policy and regulatory decisions made at the nation state level. In turn when Tuck alumni graduate and head out into the world, they are equipped with the knowledge and experience to work in sustainability and tackle some of climate changes biggest challenges, whether by working for an energy startup or consulting in the field. Kevin Yuan T20, who also attended COP25 , plans to work at Nike as the companys global manager of sustainability when he graduates this year. In doing so, he will take on plenty of climate-related projects, such as looking for ways to offset the companys carbon footprint. The West Coast native got his foot in the door with Nike when the sportswear company presented on a panel at a previous COP conference held in Poland. The opportunity to attend COP was always high on my radar, said Yuan, a Revers Center for Energy student fellow who believes that the COP conferences are a great chance to meet the whos who in sustainability. Prior to arriving at Tuck, Yuan worked at Chevron in California and Texas as a senior project engineer, focusing on upstream exploration and production, but now with Nike he has the chance to achieve his career goals and pivot directly into sustainability. As the worlds largest apparel company, Nike is a bellwether, and I feel uniquely empowered to impact climate change because of Nikes global presence, Yuan said.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA97","REFLECTION AND PERSPECTIVES FROM INSIDE COP25","January 16, 2020 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by Michigan Technological University: By Jessica Daignault The third in a series of student blogs by Michigan Tech's representatives at COP25 in Madrid. The United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP) met to negotiate global climate policy for its 25th year in Madrid, Spain from Dec. 2-13, 2019. I arrived in Madrid without expectation and full of gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the event. I left Madrid with an understanding that so much more than policy negotiations happen at such conventions. They're a space in which people from around the world can come together to share their initiatives, learn about different cultures and unite around a common goal: acting to ensure a healthy social, environmental and economic future. United States Representation One of the big questions I had was how the U.S. would be represented with the earlier announcement of the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The U.S. delegation was led by Marcia Bernicat, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary with the U.S. Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. In addition, the We Are Still In (#wearestillin) organization sent a subnational delegation comprised of state and local government leaders, businesses, universities and others to run the U.S. Climate Action Center pavilion. The pavilion was a great place to learn about action being taken in our home country. At one panel discussion, a member of our research team on the INFEWS Food-Energy-Water Conscious project, Tim Smith from University of Minnesota, was one of the speakers. It was such a unique experience to network with other Americans at COP25 . Other U.S. initiatives were discussed with members of industry such as Mars, Inc. and Impossible Foods, Inc., as well as public figures including Michael Bloomberg and actor Harrison Ford. The Power of Young People It was nearly impossible to get a glimpse of Greta Thunberg through the crowds, especially as she had just been declared TIME Magazine Person of the Year.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA98","COP 25: CARBON MARKETS IN THE SPOTLIGHT","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF): By Alex Hanafi International cooperation on carbon markets, covered in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, is at the top of the agenda for the COP 25 climate talks in Madrid this week. Since leaving the Article 6 section of the Paris Agreement without agreement at COP 24, negotiators have continued to work over the past year to garner support for a deal, before countries shift focus to preparing their critical next round of NDC pledges, due next year. They will do this against a backdrop of political disruption, but continued determination to finalize the Paris Agreement's operating instructions, known in the UN as the ""rulebook"". Civil unrest in Chile led that country's president to take the unprecedented step of canceling the climate conference only five weeks before its scheduled start. Spain quickly stepped in the next day to offer to organize the negotiations, known as COP 25 , in Madrid. The United States earlier this month officially began the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. All this is happening while the increasing impacts of climate change are being felt around the world; fires have ravaged Australia and California, while historic flooding is drowning Venice and dangerous pollution is choking Indian cities. And a new World Meteorological Organization report confirms that the atmospheric concentration of three key greenhouse gases methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide continues to rise. Although the ultimate success of the Paris Agreement will be judged many years from now, how the rules on international carbon markets are decided in Madrid could make or break the ambition of the Paris Agreement. However, weak rules for carbon trading between countries could fundamentally undermine the Paris Agreement. By allowing countries and the private sector to ""count"" carbon credits that don't represent real emissions reductions, a bad set of rules on Article 6 could negate the climate ambition of current climate pledges. What is a good Article 6 agreement? Here's what to look out for in the Article 6 negotiations the issues that can determine whether the rules governing carbon markets will be strong or weak. Sunset of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): The CDM was established to meet commitments under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, and those commitments do not extend beyond 2020. Article 6 rules should ensure that Kyoto Protocol units, many of which are of questionable environmental integrity, should not be used in a post-2020 context, since their existing surpluses could water down the ambition of countries' Paris Agreement targets; Supporting more ambitious NDCs over time: Article 6 rules should be designed to incentivize ambition and progression of national climate targets, by supporting all countries moving to economy-wide emission reduction targets over time; Regular, public reporting of progress: Transparency is vital to strengthening ambition and is a hallmark of effective existing carbon markets at the national and subnational level. Transparency rules must ensure that countries cooperating under Article 6 publicly and quantitatively track their progress no less than every two years towards implementation and achievement of their climate pledges, measuring their transferred emission reductions in the common, well-established carbon-market metric of tonnes CO2 equivalent. Transparent and predictable funding for adaptation, generated through a levy on international units sold under Article 6.4's centralized, UN-governed carbon market mechanism. Agreeing strong rules on the items above would set the foundation for high-integrity international carbon market cooperation. The additional nuts and bolts of practical carbon market cooperation would need to be worked out by participating countries themselves, consistent with the ""bottom up"" approach of the Paris Agreement. Although the Paris Agreement provides a framework for international cooperation on carbon markets, it is ultimately up to countries to work together to agree the detailed rules necessary for international carbon markets to drive emissions down and investment up. Article 6 agreement or bust? Not so fast. The good news is that agreeing these three fundamental rules in Madrid could catalyze substantial, early progress in Article 6 cooperation among countries. COP25 , countries can work in small groups, or ""clubs,"" to set the bar for high-integrity cooperation. A ""minilateral"" club of carbon markets could complement efforts under the UNFCCC by fostering agreement on robust standards for the accounting, transparency and environmental integrity of internationally transferred emissions units. The Paris Agreement began a new, more ambitious chapter in the history of climate action, but much of the chapter related to carbon market cooperation is yet to be written. We're in the race of our lives to finish the work of protecting future generations and building prosperous, 100% clean economies. Agreement on carbon market standards in Madrid, or among a coalition of carbon markets if necessary, can help deliver on the promise of the Paris Agreement and catalyze the deep global emissions reductions that climate science demands. \"

We are concerned that what we are seeing now is regressing on implementing all the commitments we have under the Paris Agreement,"" announced Ambassador Mohamed Nasr, Head of Environmental Affairs at Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who led the African Group of Negotiators (AGN). Throughout the negotiations, the Egyptian Ambassador has voiced his concern that adaptation to climate change is not adequately addressed in climate talks. ""We need to ensure that those targets provide the continent adaptation through a multilateral fund that is extremely important. What we are witnessing now is the final part of the negotiations related to Article 6, market of loss and damage and elements related to adaptation and finance. For the African Group those elements have been priority,"" he maintained Ambassador Nasr on December 13, the last official day of the COP25 that had been apparently extended. A great part of COP25 negotiations focused on the need to agree the rules for a market-based mechanism established underArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement centres on carbon trading. Throughout the two-week talks, countries gathered in Madrid tried but apparently failed to agree on the rulebook governing this mechanism. ""Action will never materialize without having more ambition on finance and technology transfer. The developed countries should provide for the maximum mitigation targets and action. We know that for Africa finance for adaptation is lagging behind,"" leader of the African Group of Negotiators told journalists. As South African Environment Minister Barbara Creecy pointed out, the continent is the most vulnerable to climate change impacts and is the continent least responsible for the world's greenhouse gas emissions. TheIPCC(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) indicated that the continent is one of the most vulnerable to climate variability, ""a situation aggravated by the interaction of 'multiple stresses', occurring at various levels, and low adaptive capacity"". The continent has suffered from the impacts of climate change. Africa contributes to only 4% of the global emissions and receives only 3% of the global carbon finance. The latestUNEP(United Nations Environment Programme) report indicated that African governments are already paying 2 to 9% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on climate impacts.UNDP(the United Nations Development Programme) estimates that the annual costs of building climate resilience could range from USD 140 to 300 billion by 2030. Moreover, African governments are deeply indebted. They made USD 12.8 billion of debt payments to other governments in 2016 and another USD 13.2 billions of debts with private creditors totaling an amount of USD 33,3 billion external debt. ""If we are to deal with climate action, the entire ecosystem at national and subnational level has to me mobilized,"" stressed Anthony Nyong the representative of theAfrican Development Bankindicating that the bank has created the African Finance Alliance on Climate Change to get financial regulators to facilitate financing. For Estherine Fatabon, the representative of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) now called the African Union Development Agency stresses that the Paris Agreement and the countries' NDCs present a ""unique"" opportunity to Africa to galvanize the innovative capacity of its people. ""We cannot wait for decisions from the COP. The challenges are already felt by our communities. Africans have historically shown a natural resilience. This has to be complemented by a strong institutional and human capacity as well as innovations and appropriate technologies that can turn climate change into an opportunity for growth and sustainable development in our continent.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA107","Sigma Lithium Provides Update on Pre-Construction, Project Financing and Participation at UN Climate Change Conference COP25","Financial Buzz","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 10, 2019( Financial Buzz: HYPERLINK http://www.financialbuzz.com http://www.financialbuzz.com COP25 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid about 'Leadership in Responsible Mining'. Sigma Lithium is pleased to announce today that Ana Cabral-Gardner, Chief Strategy Officer presented at the World Climate Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 on the panel covering the theme of 'Leadership in responsible mining - mitigating the impacts of resource extraction' on November 8, in Madrid. She discussed the case study of Sigma as an ESG 'green lithium' company and the role played by Sigma's investors in providing the capital and the leadership to drive implementation of environmental and social best practices. Ms Cabral-Gardner highlighted how these key issues are part of a broader movement spearheaded by ethical and ESG-focused investors driving sweeping changes in practices across the mining industry as a whole.Excerpts from Ms Cabral-Gardner's speech include: 'In battery materials, we start with a consumer who is very knowledgeable about carbon emissions and this is why he is buying an electric car to begin with. That consumer is demanding carbon neutrality, carbon consciousness and sustainability, throughout the value chainwhen one thinks about the cathodes it will be counterintuitive to buy a car to decarbonize the environment if upstream you are burning coal to produce lithium, nickel or using child labor to produce cobalt.' 'In this [EV] industry a paradigm is being broken [from the ICE days], whereby now 'upstream matters' and therefore, upstream practices matter too. So ultimately, in the very last step of the value chainthe OEM hears this [message from the consumer], because they are tuned into what their customer wants. So there is a 'push for provenance' in battery materials, and at Sigma we sense that in the contracts [for lithium offtakes]. Sigma is in binding offtake discussions with some of the EV industry leading participants in great part because of the [differentiation] of the 'green lithium' Sigma is 100% hydro, it is 100% environmentally conformed to dry stacking and other best practices. So even though the green price differentiation hasn't yet happened in metals and it isn't expected, it has been translated into displacement value: you get the best contracts, you get to sell the big volumes' 'Sigma produces environmentally sustainable high-quality high-grade lithium concentrate from its pilot plant on site in Brazil and the Company has some of the world's largest and richest deposits of spodumene ore and we set out to develop it since the very beginning six years ago as an ESG green mining case study, pioneering amongst lithium companies and we did that by focusing 15% of the capex towards always keeping up with best environmental practices [management and rehabilitation] and obviously focusing on the way [electric] power was sourced to beneficiate the material [lithium].' 'Four examples of actions include dry-stacking tailings management from inception at the pilot plant to investing in water recirculation equipment that would lead the company to recycle 90% of the waterso there is an enormous focus on water efficiency. And then there is energy efficiency, 100% of the energy is green, power is sourced from hydro.' 'More importantly there is the 'S' in ESG, the Company works in a region with the second-lowest IDH [index of human development] in Brazil and one of the lowest in the world So [Sigma] is transformational as we become the largest investor by a factor of 20x in the region with massive social impact. This has been our mission and just demonstrates that with the right purpose and the right will we can become a great example even though we are a relatively small mining company on a small budget. But why? Because being in battery materials the purpose of that value chain is to decarbonize at the 'mobility-end' of the value chain. So if we do not behave accordingly by being 100% green and by powering the energy with 100% green energy and enforcing those practices all along, we would not be a sustainable member of that [EV] value chain. Signs a CAD6.6 million Revolving Credit Facility with A10 Investimentos to Meet ESG Goals and Further Advance Second Deposit into Pre-Feasibility. A10 Investimentos and its affiliates ('A10 Group') continues to support Sigma in meeting its development and construction timetable as well as strategic environmental and social ESG goals. On November 29, A10 Group provided Sigma with a CAD6.6 million (USD5 million) senior unsecured revolving credit facility to complete the pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit, to meet the current social-economic obligations under the environmental licensing as well as for general corporate purposes. The facility bears interest at 11% per annum (calculated in US Dollars from the day funds are drawn) and it has a one-year term, which is the maturity day for all funds drawn, if any. Each disbursement under the facility is subject to A10 Group's approval. This credit facility is a related party transaction for Sigma for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 ('MI 61-101') and Policy 5.9 of the TSX Venture Exchange (which incorporates by reference MI 61-101) because Ana Cabral-Gardner, Marcelo Paiva and Anna Hartley are officers and/or directors of Sigma as well as principals of the A10 Group. In accordance with applicable law, the credit facility agreement was reviewed and unanimously approved by the directors of Sigma other than those related to the A10 Group. The credit facility, which is not convertible into securities of Sigma, is exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the fair market value of the transaction is below 25% of Sigma's market capitalization. It is also exempt from the minority approval requirements under MI 61-101 because the facility is on reasonable commercial terms and is not convertible into securities of Sigma Selection of Global Engineering Contractor for Construction of Plant on a 'Lump Sum Turnkey Basis' Capped by a Gross Maximum Price Sigma invited global engineering firms to conduct due diligence and submit proposals for engineering and procurement services for the construction of the commercial production plant (the 'Plant') and the production complex. The Plant will be based on the design prepared by Primero Group Ltd for the FS Technical Report (as defined below) for the Xuxa Deposit, supporting a 1.5 Mtpa lithium concentrate processing operation with an output capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes per year. Sigma requested that the construction costs described in the proposals be fixed price lump sum turnkey not exceeding a gross maximum price to be determined following due diligence. By securing the EPC contacts as gross maximum price, Sigma is seeking to manage the capex budget during construction, and thus, avoid the risk of cost overruns. Due to Primero Group's previous experience in building similar lithium processing plants in Western Australia, as well as the depth of analysis conducted to prepare the Plant design in the FS Technical Report, Sigma believes the gross maximum price proposals will be in line with the capital expenditures outlined in the FS Technical Report. Barreiro Pre-Feasibility Study, Project Financing and Capital Structure Pre-Feasibility Barreiro: Sigma continues its pre-feasibility study for the Barreiro deposit. Subject to completion of all related feasibility studies and assessments, Sigma aims to increase Project production capacity of high-quality battery-grade 6% lithium concentrate to 440,000 tonnes per year from an initial 220,000 tonnes. Project Financing and Capital Structure: Sigma expanded the group of financial institutions involved in the discussions of project financing to five commercial banks, one Brazilian development bank and one international development bank. The Company is actively engaged in structuring the debt and equity financing package for the construction of the Plant targeting a cost-effective and optimized capital structure that matches the risk and ESG profile of the Project. Feasibility Study of Xuxa Deposit and Plant: On November 7th, 2019 Sigma filed its National Instrument 43-101 technical report on the feasibility study on the Xuxa deposit (the 'FS Technical Report'), which is dated October 18 2019 and has an effective date of September 16 2019, on SEDAR.The FS Technical Report (titled 'Grota do Cirilo Lithium Project, Araua and Itinga Regions, Minas Gerais, Brazil, National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on Feasibility Study Final Report') supports an average annual production for 9.2 years of 220,000 tonnes of coarse green and high-quality battery grade 6% lithium concentrate ('Lithium Concentrate') at the Xuxa deposit and Plant with projected cash operating costs of US$ 238 per tonne of Lithium Concentrate (cash cost CIF China of US$ 342 per tonne of Lithium Concentrate), among the lowest costs globally. The FS Technical Report positive results projected for the Xuxa deposit an after tax NPV of US$ 249 million, an IRR of 43%, payback period of 3.1 years and a Capex of US$ 98.4 million. The positive economics of the FS Technical Report provides a strong platform for Sigma to continue to develop its extensive mineral properties, which include nine past-producing lithium mines.THIRD-QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS This section should be read in conjunction with the Q3 Statements and the Q3 MD...which are available on the Company's website and SEDAR. Selected consolidated financial information is presented as follows:Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was a loss of CAD1.99 million, which declined from a loss of CAD3.16 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The improvement was mainly due to a 57% year-on-year fall in general and administrative expenses driven by a reduction in corporate support costs and personnel in Brazil following the FS completion. The Company continues to assess these costs to ensure that cost-effective choices are being made. Exploration and evaluation assets were up by 124% on a year-on-year basis to CAD 17.44 million as of September 30 2019. The increase reflects mostly the completion of a substantial drilling programme undertaken at Sigma's Grota do Cirilo property, which more than tripled the amount of measured and indicated mineral resources to 45.7 million tonnes as discussed in the Company's press release dated January 10th, 2019. The Company does not generate cash from mining operations. During the nine months ended September 30th, 2019, the Company received a Pre-Payment from Mitsui .... Ltd. ('Mitsui') in the amount of CAD 4,007,100 (US$3,000,000). In addition, broker warrants were exercised providing cash proceeds of CAD 137,695. The Company's aggregate operating, investing and financing activities during the nine months ended September 30th, 2019 resulted in a net cash and cash equivalents position of CAD 1,503,303 and a negative working capital of CAD 4,214,713. The rise in total liabilities from CAD6.41 million as of September 30th, 2018 to CAD 11.55 million as of September 30th, 2019 was mostly due to the addition of CAD4.01 million (USD 3.00 million) in deferred revenue, which corresponds to an initial tranche of a Pre-Payment made by Mitsui .... Ltd. of Japan, which is part of a USD 30 million Pre-Payment facility agreed in exchange for production offtake rights, as outlined in Sigma's press release dated April 5 2019. ABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM Sigma is a Canadian company and produces environmentally sustainable battery-grade lithium concentrate on a pilot scale since 2018, shipping high-quality above 6% Li2O coarse lithium concentrate samples to potential customers in Asia.

The crucial goal at this year's summit is to conclude more than three years of talks over the details of Article 6 of the Agreement, according to IETA's CEO Dirk Forrister. ""Article 6 is vital to the success of the Paris Agreement,"" Forrister said. ""The ambition set out in the agreement absolutely requires the participation of the private sector, and Article 6 is the key to that participation."" Recently published research found that cooperation through Article 6 has the potential to reduce the total cost of implementing NDCs significantly, in the order of $320 billion/year in 2030, or alternatively facilitate removal of more emissions, in the order of 9 GtCO2/year in 2030, at no additional cost if the cost savings are reinvested into additional mitigation. Article 6 deals with the international trade and exchange of emissions reductions among member states, allowing countries to achieve abatement at lowest cost. Within the Article are two main market tools: Article 6.2, which sets down definitions of internationally transferable emissions reductions, the rules for accounting and reporting; and Article 6.4 which sets out a crediting mechanism for emissions reduction and sustainable development. IETA has laid out its detailed priorities for Article 6 in a document which can be found here ( HYPERLINK https://www.ieta.org/resources/COP25/IETA%20Views%20and%20Priorities%20for%20Article%206.pdf https://www.ieta.org/resources/ HYPERLINK COP25 /IETA%20Views%20and%20Priorities%20for%20Article%206.pdf ).

Expressing disappointment with the lack of concrete progress at COP25 , U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in a statement, ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" Experts tracking the climate talks heading into the event indicated that properly designed carbon market mechanisms would be critical to ensuring that countries collectively reduce total global greenhouse gas emissions and avoid double-counting reductions. Parties to the Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels, have collectively listed carbon markets as one means of achieving 51% of their combined pledges, according to the World Resources Institute. Andres Landerretche, COP25 coordinator for the presidency overseeing the negotiations, indicated at a Dec. 13 news briefing that the talks were falling apart. ""These negotiations have always been very, very difficult. ... At the end of the day, there are some groups that are asking for more financing, which is fair in order for them to move forward with their adaptation plans."" The formal name of COP25 is the 25th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The next session, COP26, is scheduled for November 2020 in the U.K. In addition to once again attempting to resolve carbon market issues, a number of countries have a deadline under their pledge in the Paris accord to release plans by the end of 2020 for raising their carbon-cutting ambitions. Scientists have indicated that the world will need to act quickly to curb annual emissions levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 to achieve the goals of the accord, but global emissions thus far have continued to climb and reports have indicated that current ambitions of countries fall far short of the goal. The EU separately fell short of getting get all EU members, Poland specifically, to agree to be carbon neutral by 2050. Poland gets the vast majority of its power from coal-fired generation. But the EU leaders expressed hope of convincing Poland to agree to the target. President Donald Trump recently started the process of pulling the U.S. from the Paris accord. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA114","CARE: Governments Ignore Global Outcry for Climate Justice at COP25","December 17, 2019 Tuesday 8:41 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","CARE issued the following news release: At the conclusion of the 25th Climate Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ), CARE expresses its deep concern over the large disconnect between the reality of the climate emergency and people's demands for climate justice, and the bare minimum that governments pieced together at the negotiations. Delivering enhanced national climate plans that close the gap in emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement's 1.5 C limit by Spring 2020 is now the challenging task faced by countries, as they return home to a public that is increasingly outraged by the climate emergency. CARE believes that the outcomes of COP25 are completely disconnected from the demands of people across the world to address the climate emergency. ""Governments from big polluting countries, like the USA, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia, continue down a path of dangerous inaction and are undermining international efforts to prevent the increasingly eminent climate breakdown,"" says Inge Vianen, Global Leader of CARE's Climate Change and Resilience Platform. ""Nations like the EU, China, and India must now seize the opportunity to take leadership to ensure all countries cooperate and deliver improved national climate plans. Lack thereof would risk global surrender to the climate crisis and failure to achieve the Paris Agreement goals,"" adds Vianen. During two weeks of negotiations, developed countries, especially the United States of America, have largely refused to heed the most vulnerable countries' reasonable demands for support when they are hit by climate disasters. ""It is not the house of the rich countries that is burning, it is the land of the poor - but it is the rich countries' emissions that have set the fire,"" says Sven Harmeling, CARE's Global Advocacy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience. ""With the disappointing loss and damage outcome from COP25 , including a vague mandate for the Green Climate Fund, the fight for new and additional resources and climate justice will continue."" As an organization that places additional focus on the impact of emergencies on women and girls, as they are often the worst impacted in times of crisis, CARE particularly welcomes the adoption of the gender action plan at COP25 . ""The adoption of the gender action plan will increase women's participation in international climate talks and national climate action, and help grassroots women's organizations access climate finance,"" says Vitumbiko Chinoko, CARE's Partnerships and Advocacy Coordinator in the Southern Africa region. ""However, the resistance from some countries over the past two weeks in the gender plan negotiations clearly demonstrates that hard-won gains of human rights and gender justice continue to be threatened."" Climate change's effects on women and girls: Women often bare the brunt of poverty around the world, and climate change affects them especially. When access to necessary resources, such as water, food or cooking fuel, is limited, women are forced to work harder and longer to provide for their families. We see this time and again in hard-hit areas. In developing countries, more than two-thirds of women in the labor force work in agriculture. When resources are scarce due to retreating glaciers, changes in rainfall or a weather-related disaster, women's livelihoods and the survival of their families is threatened. When resources are scarce, girls suffer, too. Some girls may not be able to go to school because they're spending time walking longer distances to gather wood or water; their families have less money to pay for their school fees; or they're simply too hungry to attend. CARE's work in the face of climate change: CARE is dedicated to empowering women and girls around the world. Whether it is by ensuring girls get an education, helping families access safe water or teaching women how to earn an income to purchase food and cover their family's basic needs. CARE is helping women and girls around the world cope with the effects of rising temperatures and a changing climate. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6962783 MSTRUCK \"

Whilst agriculture contributes to the climate crisis, small-scale farmers are guardians of our natural resources and have the potential to revolutionize food production to increase production and limit environmental degradation. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) recognises that these farmers are a critical part of the solution to climate change. IFAD has shown that small-scale farmers can be effective agents of change - they can use climate finance to deliver multiple benefits in terms of food security, poverty reduction, ecosystem resilience and emission reductions. IFAD's spokespeople will be participating in a wide range of events throughout UNFCCC COP25 in Madrid (2 to 13 December), encouraging investment in farmers. IFAD will be launching a new report focused on its work in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the IFAD Climate Action Report 2019. Key Issues: Small-scale farmers are often located on marginal lands where environmental and climate impacts are most strongly felt, reducing crop yields and incomes. Small-scale farmers need to urgently adapt to environmental and climate impacts to ensure continued food production and sustainable incomes. IFAD's Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) is the largest global financing source of its kind, and channels more than US$300 million of climate finance to farmers in developing countries so they can access the information, tools and technologies that will help build their resilience to climate change. Small farms provide more than 70 per cent of the food calories to people living in south and east Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Where to find us: A member of the IFAD team will be on the UN's Reducing Inequalities Stand throughout COP25 . They will be happy to arrange interviews/meetings with any of our team. \"

COP25 ), the climate crisis is causing immense suffering across southern and eastern Africa where late rains, the aftermath of two major cyclones, droughts and flooding are putting 60 million lives at risk. Ahead of the UN climate talks in Spain beginning tomorrow (2 December), ActionAid is calling on negotiators to break the deadlock around climate finance for survivors of climate disasters in the Global South. Harjeet Singh, global climate lead at ActionAid, says: ""The climate and food emergencies devastating southern and eastern Africa must awaken the conscience of the rich countries and polluting industries that have caused the crises. They must stop blocking proposals on creating a new fund, including debt relief, to support countries to recover from climate disasters, such as flooding, droughts and rising sea levels. ""Concrete financing solutions are urgently needed to repair the devastation already being caused by climate change and to prepare for an uncertain future."" It is estimated that by 2030 the global, annual cost of repairing the loss and damage caused by climate change will total $300 billion, increasing to $1.2 trillion a year by 2060. ActionAid's analysis shows that ending state subsidies for fossil fuels and a progressive tax on the oil and gas industry would raise the billions needed to adapt to and repair the harmful impacts of global warming. These solutions put the onus on those responsible for the climate crisis and protect the rights of those most at risk. More than nine million people in Southern Africa are facing severe food shortages after the worst drought the region has seen in 35 years. Shockingly this number is expected to increase to a staggering 45 million over the next six months.

The report will show that renewable energy ambition within NDCs would have to more than double by 2030 to put the world in line with the Paris Agreement goals, cost-effectively reaching 7.7 terawatts (TW) of globally installed capacity by then. Today's renewable energy pledges under the NDCs are falling short of this, targeting only 3.2 TW. The report NDCs in 2020: Advancing Renewables in the Power Sector and Beyond will be released at IRENA's official side event on enhancing NDCs and raising ambition on 11 December 2019. It will state that with over 2.3 TW installed renewable capacity today, almost half of the additional renewable energy capacity foreseen by current NDCs has already been installed. The analysis will also highlight that delivering on increased renewable energy ambition can be achieved in a cost-effective way and with considerable socio-economic benefits across the world. ""Increasing renewable energy targets is absolutely necessary,"" said IRENA's Director-General Francesco La Camera. ""Much more is possible. There is a decisive opportunity for policy makers to step up climate action by raising ambition on renewables, which are the only immediate solution to meet rising energy demand whilst decarbonising the economy and building resilience"". ""IRENA's analysis shows that a pathway to a decarbonised economy is technologically possible and socially and economically beneficial,"" continued Mr. La Camera. ""Renewables are good for growth, good for job creation and deliver significant welfare benefits. With renewables, we can also expand energy access and help eradicate energy poverty in line with the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. IRENA will promote knowledge exchange, strengthen partnerships and work with all stakeholders to catalyse action on the ground. We are engaging with countries and regions worldwide to facilitate renewable energy projects and raise their ambitions"". NDCs must become a driving force for an accelerated global energy transformation. The current pledges reflect neither the past decade's rapid growth nor the ongoing market trends for renewables.

Just this past week three stark reports on the rising carbon emissions and impacts on global temperatures have been released. These reports lay bare the horrific state of climate breakdown and its impacts across the globe and the urgent need to move away from fossil fuels.

It is impossible for governments to continue to ignore how people from all walks of life are demanding a just transition to 100 per cent renewable energy be accelerated. 350.org will be at COP25 to remind governments that people's lives, livelihoods, homes, and futures are on the line, and to amplify the voices of communities from Latin America and around the world striving for climate justice. May Boeve, 350.org Executive Director, issued the following statement: ""This is a pivotal moment for global efforts to combat climate change. Big coal, oil, and gas companies will either win with their version of climate denial - which is to call for slow action - or we will move ahead to a clean energy future that works for all. We expect governments to come to these climate talks to live up to the moral urgency at hand with clear plans to: cut all public and private funding to fossil fuels, ban new fossil fuel exploration, and enable a just transition for communities currently dependent on fossil fuels for work or energy. The only way for this process to succeed is to acknowledge, as science dictates, that it is time to put a discussion of fossil fuels front and centre. It is time for governments to be on the right side of history."" ""This is the COP for countries to get serious about ending the production of fossil fuels. Wealthy countries should take the lead in banning new fossil fuel projects, phasing out existing production, ending subsidies and other financial support for the industry, and providing financial support for developing countries to deal with the impacts of the climate emergency and transition to 100% renewable energy. All of these efforts would be aided by kicking fossil fuel industry lobbyists out of COP: they're only there to block progress and the world desperately needs to move forward.""

President Sebastian Pinera announced the suspension of the increase in the price of metro tickets, which triggered violent protests. $300 million in damageVandals set fire to metro trains and stops, sowing $300 million in damage and hobbling public transportation. Chile's military has since taken over security in Santiago, a city of 6 million now under a 'state of emergency,' imposing curfews for five consecutive nights.'I'm certain that under no circumstances will this come to impact the conferences,' Ribera told reporters.Ribera said Chile's foreign ministry had contacted each of the 20 participants in the Asia-Pacific gathering of nations, known by its initials APEC.'They have expressed no doubt with respect to their attendance,' he said.The protests over inequality made APEC and the promotion of free and inclusive trade 'more relevant,' Ribera said. 'If we want a more inclusive country, APEC is part of the solution.'U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in October said he would likely sign a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the summit, though U.S. officials more recently said the pact could be delayed.A diplomatic source in Santiago told Reuters the vice minister of trade had held a meeting with ambassadors from all the APEC nations to assure them that both conferences would proceed as planned.'From what I'm hearing in the corridors there may be some changes afoot to the APEC leaders week to make it more austere and cost less,' the source said. \~ HYPERLINK https://www.voanews.com/s3/files/styles/sourced/s3/afp-image/2019/10/4dca51e986002ff6ee3fa90249d1ff8ae881e975.jpg?itok=xgXRBegiChilean https://www.voanews.com/s3/files/styles/sourced/s3/afp-image/2019/10/4dca51e986002ff6ee3fa90249d1ff8ae881e975.jpg?itok=xgXRBegiChilean President Sebastian Pinera speaks to the nation in Santiago, Oct. 22, 2019, on a fifth straight day of protests against a now suspended hike in metro ticket prices. A month ago, Chilean President Sebastin Pinera was praised in domestic media for his work at the G7 summit in France for acting as a go-between in a diplomatic spat involving French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over the Amazon forest fires.Today, walls and bridges around Santiago are scrawled with graffiti calling for Pinera's resignation after he became the first Chilean leader to bring troops onto the streets since the end of Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship.Jorge Heine, a former Chilean cabinet minister and ambassador to China, India and South Africa, said Pinera's stature in both conferences would be 'undoubtedly' diminished.Chile's strength had been its stable model of free trade around the Pacific, he said. 'Now Chile is not quite such the 'oasis in a troubled region' that Pinera claimed it was just a few weeks ago.''Working against the clock'Chile took over the hosting of the COP25 conference in December after Brazil withdrew following the election of Bolsonaro, a climate skeptic.In Cerrillos, at a former air force base just southwest of central Santiago, workers continued to lay cement and pound nails at the conference site, unaffected by the nearby rioting.Reuters spoke with several workers, neighbors, contractors and security guards at Cerrillos who said rioters had been thwarted by security forces amid the most heated weekend riots.'I'd say 99% of construction workers have showed up to work,' said Daniel Cruz, a Peruvian worker. But snarled public transportation had forced some to finish early, slowing progress six weeks before the Dec. 3-13 conference. 'We're working against the clock.'Claudio Moreno, of Chile's Carabineros police force, said the Cerrillos metro stop, which is expected to see heavy use during the event, had been unscathed.'No one got into the station, or into the COP installations,' Moreno told Reuters.The metro line that reaches the COP25 site was heavily damaged elsewhere, raising questions about connecting to downtown hotels, where many attendees will likely stay.A spokesman for the U.N. body mandated to organize the summit, the UNFCCC, said it had received £ssurances' from the Chilean government. The governments of countries set to attend the two summits, including France, China, Brazil, Canada and Japan, told Reuters there would be no change to arrangements.Major summits have previously been held in the wake of significant unrest - including the 2015 COP21 environmental summit in Paris. Weeks earlier 130 people were killed in a series of coordinated attacks claimed by Islamic State.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian dismissed a suggestion by far-left opposition lawmakers that the government suspend its participation in COP25 until the violence ends.And Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing expected 'Chile's government will appropriately deal with the relevant problems' and ensure the APEC summit passes in £ safe and successful manner.' \"

Ambitious climate action has the potential to both safeguard our health and future, and to reduce the yearly seven million premature deaths from air pollution. This immersive art installation at the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid encourages negotiators, observers and world leaders attending the summit to walk through the pods, letting visitors experience the daily reality of air pollution lived through by millions. The installation aims to help drive ambitious action for health and climate, and was brought to COP25 by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Ministry for the Ecological Transition Spain, the Clean Air Fund and key partners of the BreatheLife Campaign. One or two minutes inside artist Michael Pinskys Pollution Pods and visitors at COP25 might begin experiencing shortness of breath, but theres nothing dangerous in the air in the pods. Safe innovative perfume blends and fog machines imitate the air quality of some of the worlds most polluted cities London, Beijing, So Paulo, New Delhi as well as one of the most pristine environments on earth, Tautra in Norway. Outside the pods, however, air pollution has been declared a public health priority by WHO: largely caused by the same burning of fossil fuels that is driving climate change, polluted air is poisoning nine out of ten of us and killing over seven million of us prematurely every year. Children are especially vulnerable: 600,000 children die prematurely every year from air pollution related diseases. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO said: We need to agree unequivocally on the need for a world free of air pollution. We need all countries and cities to commit to meeting WHO air quality guidelines. The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself, said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost. Teresa Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition of Spain, said: Air pollution and climate change are the two sides of the same coin. The symbolic installation of the Pollution Pods at COP25 should remind everybody that we are negotiating for cleaner environments, cutting emissions and gaining better health for all. WHO invites you to visit the Air Pollution Pods at the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid, between December 2nd and 13th. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA124","WOMEN'S GROUPS APPLAUD GENDER ACTION PLAN FOLLOWING COP 25","January 8, 2020 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","After nearly two weeks of negotiations at COP 25 climate negotiations in Madrid last month (2-13 December), governments will be adopting a new 5-year Gender Action Plan (GAP) that progressively builds upon the first GAP, and works to address many of the concerns raised by women and gender groups at the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including calls for greater focus on implementation and scaling up gender-just climate solutions. The GAP has been unanimously agreed to by governments who are called to lead or contribute to actions to promote gender-equality in the UNFCCC process as well as support all activities. Crucially, this GAP takes into account human rights, ensuring a just transition, and the challenges Indigenous Peoples face while fighting for climate justice and protecting their communities. ""In comparison to the initial GAP, new activities provide the opportunity to meaningfully shift towards capacity building and enhanced implementation of gender-responsive climate action at all levels, including for example, the promotion of gender-responsive technology solutions and preserving local, indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices in different sectors"" said Ndivile Mokoena, GenderCC - Women for Climate Justice Southern Africa. The negotiations were not easy, with Parties failing to deliver a text for the closing of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) as expected, and the COP25 Presidency having to host high-level consultations in the final week to come to a consensus. ""While it was frustrating to witness delays in the negotiations, particularly challenges to agreed language on rights, the fact that we have achieved and adopted a 5 year gender action plan that includes many of the key demands of Parties as well as views of women and gender groups goes to show the critical importance to which countries have started to understand and value gender equality in climate action."" ""I think the political will shown by negotiators under this agenda to negotiate towards consensus and achieve a robust outcome could and should be modeled under all other items in this process. In particular, I want to highlight the incredibly strong leadership of the Government of Mexico in facilitating Parties to come to this agreement. It was inspiring to witness!"" said Bridget Burns, WEDO, United States. Political will was also built through the effective mobilization efforts of both the Women and Gender Constituency and other civil society allies who refused to see this COP stall progress on gender equality. However, there are concerns that the Gender Action Plan lacks clearly defined indicators and targets for measuring its progress, such as a progressive target on advancing women's leadership in the process. ""While the GAP acknowledges intersectional identities that women hold, including indigenous women and women with disabilities, more work needs to be done to understand the multidimensional and non-binary social intersections that impact the ways in which people mitigate to and build resilience to climate impacts."" ""The adoption of the enhanced GAP does not mean our work is done. We will need to focus our work now at the national level to ensure the implementation of the GAP, as well as monitoring its implementation,"" Nanna Birk, LIFE Education Sustainability Equality, Germany. While Women and Gender Constituency applauds this outcome, it fully recognizes and maintains that no real action on gender equality can be achieved without progress from Parties to fully implement the Paris Agreement, including to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. ""We know we are far from that reality. The GAP is a tool to advance progress on both gender equality and effective climate solutions, but gender equality does not live in the GAP. It is realized through just and bold climate action. We remain appalled by the lack of progress overall in these negotiations and move forward boldly to lift up women's rights and the voices of women and gender advocates everywhere as we know that real climate action can only be achieved when these voices and leadership are centered and heeded."" added Burns. Read the agreed outcome of the gender agenda item here. The Women and Gender Constituency (WGC) is one of the nine stakeholder groups of the UNFCCC. Established in 2009, the WGC now consists of 29 women's and environmental civil society organizations, who are working to ensure that women's voices and their rights are embedded in all processes and results of the UNFCCC framework, for a sustainable and just future, so that gender equality and women's human rights are central to the ongoing discussions.

""We have been striking for over a year, and basically nothing has happened,"" she told activists at the talks. ""The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power, and we cannot go on like this."" The sort of global children's protests Thunberg has inspired and led in recent months are ""not sustainable,"" the 16-year-old continued. ""We cannot go on like that,"" Thunberg said. ""We would love some action from the people in power. ... People are suffering and dying from the climate ecological emergency, and we cannot wait any longer."" She warned that ""it is impossible for anyone to know how the world will look in 10 years"" and said she hopes the summit will lead to ""concrete"" change. ""The COP25 Around 25,000 people from 200 countries are expected to attend COP25 , the last gathering of the group before 2020, the year the Paris climate accord goes into effect. Attendees include dozens of heads of state and government, business leaders, scientists and activists. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said this week that the summit marks the ""point of no return"" in humanity's fight against climate change. Delegates are expected to try to ink a deal on emissions trading, which experts say could reduce greenhouse gases in line with critical targets set to avert disastrous and irreversible damage. Thunberg earlier had been mobbed by activists and reporters as she arrived in Madrid by train from Lisbon. Thunberg arrived in Lisbon after nearly three weeks at sea, after two Australian vloggers offered her a ride from the United States on their catamaran, La Vagabonde. She had already traveled halfway to Chile when the United Nations changed the location of COP25 to Madrid. The South American nation withdrew as host because after weeks of protests paralyzed the country. Thunberg refuses to fly because of the high levels of emissions emitted in air travel and instead uses boats, trains and electric cars. \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA127","Climate Change Accounting: The Failure Of COP25 \u8211  OpEd","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","Eurasia Review","Prior to the UN Convention on Climate Change talks held in Madrid, the sense that tradition would assert itself was hard to buck. Weariness and frustration came in the wake of initial high minded optimism. Delegates spent an extra two days and nights attempting to reach a deal covering carbon reduction measures before the Glasgow conference in 2020. The gathering became the longest set of climate talks in history, exceeding the time spent at the 2011 Durban meeting by 44 hours. As Climate Home News noted, Durban still stood out as being worthier for having ""produced a deal between countries that laid the foundations for the Paris Agreement."" In stark contrast, ""Madrid produced a weak gesture toward raising climate targets and failed to agree for the second year in a row on rules to govern carbon markets."" The UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres was all lament. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaption and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" He hoped that the next year would see ""all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise."" The wisdom of COP25 remains similar to that of previous gatherings on climate: politics and environment do not mix well. Big powers and heavy polluters stuck to their stubborn positions, stressing the merits of loose, open markets to solve the problem, notably in terms of reducing carbon emissions; smaller states more concerned by their actual disappearance lobbied European, Latin American and African allies for firmer commitments and pledges. Australia was also confirmed as one of the chief spoilers, if not outright saboteurs, at the show, noted for its insistence that it be allowed to claim a reduction of its abatement for the 2021-30 Paris Accord. This, went the argument, was due to its own excelling in meeting the 2012-20 Kyoto Protocol period. Previous good conduct could justify current bad and future behaviour. What Canberra offered the globe was an accounting model of deception, exploiting a regulatory loophole in place of lowering emissions. It lacked legal plausibility, given that both Kyoto and Paris are separate treaties. Former French environment minister Luciana Tubiana was clear about the implications of this idea. ""If you want this carryover,"" she told the Financial Times, ""it is just cheating. Australia was willing in a way to destroy the whole system, because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement."" Other states were also noted in performing roles of obstruction, including Saudi Arabia, Brazil and the United States. These parties were particular keen to push their differences with other states over Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, a provision dealing with mechanisms and models of trading in emission reductions. Such trade can have a habit of losing validity when put into practice; the issue of transparency remains a considerable problem in such markets. The US statement at the conference emphasised realism and pragmatism ""backed by a record of real world results."" (Real world results tend to exclude environmental ruination for unrepentant polluters.) Market results were primary; environmental matters were subordinate to such dictates. Usual mantras were proffered: innovation and open markets produced wealth, but also ""fewer emissions, and mores secure sources of energy."" Despite leaving as a party to the Paris Agreement, ""We remain fully committed to working with you, our global partners, to enhance resilience, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and prepare for and respond to natural disasters."" Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro reconfirmed his climate change scepticism, claiming that the entire issue of COP25 could be put down to commerce. ""I don't know why people don't understand that it's just a commercial game."" The Europeans, he suggested, were merely being irksome about cash and meddling. ""I'd like to know,"" he posed rhetorically to journalists, ""has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?"" Brazil's environment minister Ricardo Salles, known to some as Minister for Deforestation, was similarly keen to place the blame elsewhere. He had demanded, bowl in hand, some $10 billion under the Paris Climate deal to combat deforestation in 2020. All in all, he was not optimistic. ""Rich countries did not want to pay up."" Like Australia, Brazil's environmental ploy is driven by creative accounting, an attempt to leverage previous supposed good conduct in the climate change stakes, playing accumulated carbon credits from Kyoto to meet those under the Paris arrangements. Using open market rationales, Salles condemned the ""protectionist vision"" that had taken hold: ""Brazil and other countries that could provide carbon credits because of their forests and good environmental practices came out losers."" In an act of some spite, the minister would subsequently post a tweet featuring a photo of a platter heavy with meats. ""To compensate for our emissions at COP, a vegetarian lunch!"" Madrid will be remembered for its stalemate on carbon credits and the botched rule book on carbon trading. An effort spearheaded by Costa Rica, including Germany, Britain and New Zealand, to convince states to adopt the San Jose principles, with a prohibition on the use of carbon credit carryover along with other Kyoto gains, was rejected. COP25 again exposed that degree of prevalent anarchy, if not gangsterism, in global climate change policy. The emphasis, then, is on attempts and arrangements made within regional areas: EU policy on de-carbonised economies (albeit resisted within by such states as Poland), and bilateral arrangements (the EU and China). As these take place, the apocalyptic message led by activists such as Greta Thunberg will become more desperate.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA128","COP25: UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE, 5 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW","November 29, 2019 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the United Nations: Climate change is happeningthe world is already 1.1C warmer than it was at the onset of the industrial revolution, and it is already having a significant impact on the world, and on people's lives. And if current trends persist, then global temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.4 to 3.9C this century, which would bring wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts. That's the stark warning from the international community ahead of the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP25 , which gets underway in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on 2 December. So, just two months after the Secretary-General convened a major Climate Action Summit at UN Headquarters in New York, what can be expected from COP25 ? COP25 different? The Climate Action Summit in September was the initiative of the UN Secretary-General to focus the attention of the international community on the climate emergency and to accelerate actions to reverse climate change. The Climate Conference (held in Madrid after the meeting was moved from Chile due to unrest there), COP25 , is the actual Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which is tasked with making sure that the Convention, (and now the 2015 Paris Agreement, which strengthens the Convention), are being implemented. 2. But why all the UN attention on the climate? According to the 2019 WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high. This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned, in its 2019 Emissions Gap Report, that greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 are needed to meet the internationally agreed goal of a 1.5C increase in temperatures over pre-industrial levels. Scientists agree that's a tall order, and that the window of opportunity is growing smaller. 3. So what did the September Climate Action Summit achieve? The summit served as a springboard ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the Paris Agreement, focusing global attention on the climate emergency and the urgent need to significantly scale up action. And leaders, from many countries and sectors, stepped up. More than seventy countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so. More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world's largest. Small island states together committed to achieve carbon neutrality and to move to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030. And countries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees. More than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating the green economy. A group of the world's largest asset-owners, controlling $2 trillion, pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050. This is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world's invested capital, some $34 trillion, for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide. 4. Hang on: UNEP, WMO, IPCC, UNFCCC, COP...why all the acronyms? It's true that the UN is a very acronym-heavy place. These ones all represent international tools and agencies that, under the leadership of the UN, were created to help advance climate action globally. Here's how they fit together. UNEP is the UN Environment Programme, the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment. WMO stands for World Meteorological Office, the UN agency for international cooperation in areas such as weather forecasting, observing changes in the climate, and studying water resources. In 1988 the UN General Assembly asked UNEP and the WMO to establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is made of hundreds of experts, in order to assess data, and providing reliable scientific evidence for climate action negotiations. All three UN bodies publish reports that, in recent years, have frequently made international headlines, as concerns about the climate crisis have grown. As for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), this document was signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the treaty, nations agreed to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere"" to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, 197 countries are parties to the treaty. Every year since the treaty entered into force in 1994, a ""conference of the parties"", or COP, has been held to discuss how to move forward. Madrid will hold the 25th COP, therefore COP25 . Because the UNFCCC had non-binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries, and no enforcement mechanism, various extensions to this treaty were negotiated during recent COPs, including most recently the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, in which all countries agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing. COP25 is the final COP before we enter the defining year of 2020, when many nations must submit new climate action plans. Among the many elements that need to be ironed out is the financing of climate action worldwide. Currently, not enough is being done to meet the three climate goals: reducing emissions 45 per cent by 2030; achieving climate neutrality by 2050 (which means a net zero carbon footprint), and stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5C by the end of the century. Because the clock is ticking on climate change, the world cannot afford to waste more time, and a bold, decisive, ambitious way forward needs to be agreed. \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA134","Allianz finds climate-related rules to cost industries $2.5 trillion worldwide","December 6, 2019 Friday","SNL Financial Services Daily","The increasing intensity of climate-related regulations, including those now under discussion, could cost industries as much as $2.5 trillion worldwide over the next 10 years, according to insurance company Allianz SE and Euler Hermes Economic Research. Regulations are likely to hit the energy sector the hardest, with an estimated cost of $900 billion over that period, the companies said in a paper released Dec. 3. The steel sector follows, with an estimated cost of $300 billion, while the air and marine transport sector could face total costs of $55 billion. Other sectors at risk include automotive, chemicals, pulp and paper, retail and manufacturing. Investors are putting increasing pressure on companies' portfolios to assess and address their long-term risks and opportunities related to potential future regulations, such as carbon markets and industry-specific taxes or levies. The paper suggests that the number and intensity of climate-related regulations will increase significantly over the next 10 years as countries and local governments work to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The paper noted that the number of regulations has already skyrocketed from 72 climate change laws in place globally in 1997 to at least 1,500 such laws in 2018. ""We believe almost every sector will be impacted by the regulatory tightening ahead,"" the paper said. But ""in a vast number of cases, companies are insufficiently prepared for the regulatory wave that is coming towards them."" The paper recommends that businesses consider both potential direct and second-round effects and begin by taking a comprehensive audit of their emissions. Allianz and Euler Hermes examined the potential impact of carbon markets, such as a potential ratcheting up of prices in the European Union's emissions trading system, mandates on renewables and energy efficiency levels and transportation-related regulations. The paper also considered increased industry-specific taxes or fees such as environmental levies on airlines, fines on single-use plastic bags, and other windfall taxes for uncompliant or undesirable activities affecting climate change. The paper said increased regulations cut companies' gross margins related to the rising cost of emissions, which can be then transposed on to operating expenses or capital expenditures for such things as mandatory equipment installations. Even if a company mitigates the impact of the regulations on its gross margins, the costs could still translate into lower operating profits if the mitigation was ""achieved through raising other costs, for embarking onto higher cost processes,"" or for increased spending on research and development, the paper said. Representatives of countries around the world are meeting in Madrid for the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP25 , to hash out the rules on carbon markets under the Paris accord. Several countries will have the opportunity in 2020 to increase their pledges for emissions reductions under the accord. The paper said that although President Donald Trump is pulling the U.S. from the Paris accord, the move ""could actually accelerate and intensify state-level initiatives."" \"

Time to act is the slogan for this years global climate action summit, COP25 in Madrid, and for a majority of people action cannot come soon enough. According to a poll by the Pew Research Center, climate change is seen as the biggest international threat facing many nations: 13 out of 26 countries surveyed listed global warming as their top security concern. The EBRD participates in this years conference demonstrating its leading role among multilateral development banks (MDBs) as a pioneer in the delivery of climate finance. The Bank is working successfully towards achieving its ambitious Green Economic Transition (GET) target - to raise the proportion of its green finance to 40 per cent of annual new business by 2020 (from about 25 per cent in 2015). The 2019 result is expected to be well above that 40 per cent target, making this the Banks greenest year ever. To date, the EBRD has signed 30 billion in green investments, financed over 1600 green projects and reduced over 100 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year. But addressing climate change is a challenge that can only by tackled jointly, especially by development banks and institutions: The EBRD this year has the task of coordinating the MDBs that have worked together for more than a decade to scale up global climate finance and bring in the private sector in efforts to keep worldwide temperature rises to below 2C and if possible 1.5C. At COP25 , chaired by Chile, delegates this year hope to agree measures known as Article 6 including market mechanisms for carbon trading. These will help the private sector to become a more powerful force in climate action, playing to the EBRDs strengths as an institution that cooperates closely with the private sector. The final stage of the current five-year global cycle of climate planning will be at COP26 in Glasgow, where the agenda for still more radical action in the next five years will be set. In September, at an earlier climate summit in New York, the nine MDBs coordinated by the EBRD announced plans to increase the global climate action investments they support each year to US$ 175 billion by 2025. In 2018, MDB climate finance in developing countries and emerging economies already reached record annual levels, resulting in US$ 111 billion of combined MDB climate finance and co-finance. Announcing the increase in September, the MDBs pledged to focus on building and strengthening partnerships for greater impact. We are united in increasing our collective ambitions, as well as our clients, to ensure that the common goals of the Paris Agreement will be met. The EBRDs own GET investments range from renewable energy projects in Egypt to energy efficiency investments in Ukraines corporate sector, and have gone from strength to strength in 2019. Among highlights was Septembers successful launch of the first ever dedicated climate resilience bond, raising US$ 700 million with demand from 40 investors in 15 countries. The proceeds will be used to finance the Banks existing and new climate resilience projects. The EBRD currently has a portfolio of about 7 billion in climate resilience projects, from the Qairokkum hydropower upgrade in Tajikistan to the Saiss water conservation project in Morocco. October saw the completion of one of the largest solar parks in the world. Benban, in Egypts Aswan desert, covers 37 square km and will generate 1.5 GW, enough to provide renewable energy to more than 1,000,000 homes. The EBRD is its largest financier, having supported 16 of the 32 plots. EBRD Green Cities, a 1 billion urban sustainability programme set up in 2016 to improve infrastructure and policy in cities, which account for more than three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions, now has more than 30 participants. In October, it won an 87 million contribution from the Green Climate Fund, the largest fund in the world to support the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change, which will support the facility in Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Jordan, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia and Tunisia. The EBRD has more than two decades of experience in financing green investments, with an initial focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy. As well as its own dedicated programmes to promote green investment, the Bank works closely with donors such as Climate Investment Funds, the European Union, the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and other bilateral donors to mobilise climate finance for clients. \"

As president of the Coalition of Women Farmers (COWFA) in Malawi, a partner of ActionAid Malawi, Ellen is promoting more sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. This week Ellen has been at the UN climate change conference in Madrid, known as COP25 . She gave an important presentation during UNFCCC negotiations on agriculture, speaking out against government subsidies for chemical fertilisers and calling for investment in climate-resilient agroecology. She explained how life as a smallholder in Malawi is being blighted by climate change. A severe drought ravaged the region in 2016, while earlier this year, Cyclone Idai devasted large areas of agricultural land, leaving farmers like Ellen increasingly food insecure. Women farmers face specific challenges in Malawi, often they do not own their land and are poorly represented in decision making processes. Ellen has had training in adaptation techniques, including climate-resilient agroecology. She now trains other women farmers in these methods and advocates for their rights. By collectivising, COWFA has helped spread more sustainable and resilient agricultural practices such as seed banking and manure production as opposed to using pesticides and fertilisers that deplete soil of its nutrients and can lead to increased food insecurity. ""The common assumption that agroecological methods are less productive than high-inputs conventional systems is incorrect,"" she says. ""I myself have experienced this. In 2008, I planted my maize. I had no money to buy fertiliser. So my crop failed. There were no natural nutrients in the soil. When my friend came to visit, she said 'Ellen why are you wasting time to look for fertilisers when you are keeping pigs, cows and chickens?' She told me how to make this manure. I did it and used it and harvested. Today I am still using that!"" Ellen is now promoting sustainable and resilient agroecological practices at COP25 and advocates for women farmers to be more involved with the decision making process to enable them to establish improved agricultural practices. \"

The four key themes on the agenda were: ambition, market mechanisms, gender, and loss and damage. While these meetings usually involved a few hundred governmental representatives, Costa Rica made an extra effort to convene an inclusive conference that included higher-than-usual participation by civil society. With social inclusiveness and nature-based solutions featured prominently throughout the conference and ministerial statements, the preCOP echoed the growing recognition that human rights and ecosystems must be front and central for effective climate action. The preCOP included a workshop on the integration of human rights in future climate commitments. CIEL Senior Attorney Sebastien Duyck issued the following statement: ""Throughout the preCOP, the need to keep temperature increase below 1.5 degree c was stressed consistently as the only acceptable objective for all Parties to the Paris Agreement - demonstrating that Parties fully accept the findings of the IPCC. However, this recognition is in stark contrast to the reality that the major emitting countries are doing far too little to increase the ambition of their climate commitments. Parties must urgently deliver on the ambition needed to limit warming to 1.5 degree c if they are serious about protecting human rights in the face of climate change. Effective public participation in climate policy planning and a greater focus on nature-based solutions are critical to fill this ambition gap.""

(Courtesy: Brian Enquist)The data from Enquist's research was used to create a map of rare species hot spots around the globe. (Image: Patrick R. Roehrdanz)Almost 40% of global land plant species are categorized as very rare, and these species are most at risk for extinction as the climate continues to change, according to new University of Arizona-led research. The findings are published in a special issue of Science Advances that coincides with the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , in Madrid. The COP25 is convening nations to act on climate change. The international meeting runs Dec. 2-13. ""When talking about global biodiversity, we had a good approximation of the total number of land plant species, but we didn't have a real handle on how many there really are,"" said lead author Brian Enquist, University of Arizona professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. Thirty-five researchers from institutions around the world worked for 10 years to compile 20 million observational records of the world's land plants. The result is the largest dataset on botanical biodiversity ever created. The researchers hope this information can help reduce loss of global biodiversity by informing strategic conservation action that includes consideration of the effects of climate change. They found that there are about 435,000 unique land plant species on Earth. ""That's an important number to have, but it's also just bookkeeping. What we really wanted to understand is the nature of that diversity and what will happen to this diversity in the future,"" Enquist said. ""Some species are found everywhere they're like the Starbucks of plant species. But others are very rare think a small standalone cafe."" Enquist and his team revealed that 36.5% of all land plant species are ""exceedingly rare,"" meaning they have been observed and recorded less than five times ever. ""According to ecological and evolutionary theory, we'd expect many species to be rare, but the actual observed number we found was actually pretty startling,"" he said. ""There are many more rare species than we expected."" The researchers also found that rare species tend to cluster in a handful of hot spots, such as the Northern Andes in South America, Costa Rica, South Africa, Madagascar and Southeast Asia. These regions, they found, remained climatologically stable as the world emerged from the last ice age, allowing such rare species to persist. But just because these species enjoyed a relatively stable climate in the past doesn't mean they'll enjoy a stable future. The research also revealed that these hot spots of very rare species are projected to experience a disproportionally high rate of future climatic changes and human disruption, Enquist said. ""We learned that in many of these regions, there's increasing human activity such as agriculture, cities and towns, land use and clearing. So that's not exactly the best of news,"" he said. ""If nothing is done, this all indicates that there will be a significant reduction in diversity mainly in rare species because their low numbers make them more prone to extinction."" And it's these rare species that science knows very little about. By mapping where these rare species occur, ""this work is better able to highlight the dual threats of climate change and human impact on the regions that harbor much of the world's rare plant species and emphasizes the need for strategic conservation to protect these cradles of biodiversity,"" said Patrick Roehrdanz a co-author on the paper and managing scientist at Conservation International. The research was done in collaboration with the Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change project, which was funded by the Global Environment Facility and made possible by Conservation International and a National Science Foundation grant to the University of Arizona.

The Heartland Institute hosted a Climate Reality Forum in Madrid with an international cast of scientists and policy analysts to balance the discussion at the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The five-hour event featured presentations on climate science and policy by experts from Canada, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Speakers included physicist Guus Berkout, Ph.D.; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane researcher Stanley Goldenberg; award-winning physicist Will Happer, Ph.D., a former top science advisor to President Donald Trump; Tom Harris, executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition; and Lord Christopher Monckton. Wolfgang Muller, director of the European Institute on Klimate and Energy; Douglas Pollock, a civil engineer from Chile; youth climate activist Naomi Seibt; James Taylor, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute; and meteorologist Anthony Watts, a senior fellow with The Heartland Institute, also spoke at the conference. Trump Administration Perspective Happer was the headline speaker at the on December 3 event, making his first public comments since returning to Princeton University from the Trump administration in October 2019. Happer said human greenhouse gas emissions are not creating a climate crisis and are having much less effect on global temperatures than climate models have predicted. Happer also outlined many of the benefits of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, including a dramatic greening of the Earth as more carbon dioxide serves as aerial fertilizer for crops and vegetation. Happer joined Taylor and Heartland Institute Director of Communications Jim Lakely for a discussion of insights gained working for Trump. Happer said Trump firmly agrees with climate realists that humans are not causing a climate crisis, and he expressed some disappointment the people in charge of Trump's reelection campaign are deemphasizing climate change. Happer concluded by expressing confidence Trump will continue to advance a sound-science agenda if elected to a second term. Temperature Data Corruption Watts showed most official temperature stations are corrupted by artificial heat sources and other factors giving the appearance of greater warming in recent decades than has been measured by satellites and by instruments aboard atmospheric balloons. In addition, government gatekeepers ""homogenize"" the surface temperature readings to accentuate the corrupted, artificially warm readings while minimizing more accurate, cooler readings, Watts said. Also, government bureaucrats consistently readjust temperature readings from the early twentieth century downward, making current readings appear to show more warming than has actually occurred, Watts said. Hurricanes Not Getting Worse Goldenberg said there is no signal indicating hurricanes are becoming more frequent or severe as the planet warms, presenting data showing hurricanes long ago were just as frequent and powerful as the hurricanes today blamed on anthropogenic climate change. With no statistical trend of worsening hurricane activity, claims made by activists, international bureaucrats, and some scientists that global warming is making hurricanes worse conflict with the best available science, Goldenberg said. Taylor said even the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledges the lack of evidence the recent warming trend is intensifying hurricanes. Taylor quoted the IPCC's 2018 Interim Report, which states, ""There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration)."" Chile's Climate Riots Pollock recounted how the Chilean government brought about the civil unrest that ultimately forced Santiago, Chile, to abandon plans to host COP25 , which was moved at the last minute to Madrid, Spain to take place in the first two weeks of December. Recently imposed carbon dioxide taxes and renewable energy projects caused a dramatic spike in Chilean electricity costs, making the country's energy prices the highest in South America, Pollock said. When the Chilean government also switched the Santiago Metro rail system to renewable power, the resulting fare increase spurred citizens to take to the streets in protest. The steep energy price hikes and resulting civil unrest could have been avoided had the Chilean government prioritized energy affordability over currying favor with the U.N.'s climate establishment, said Pollock. Nineteen-year-old German YouTube personality Naomi Seibt closed out the forum by chronicling her loss of belief in a climate crisis and resulting conversion to climate realism. ""I was an innocent young girl, and I thought that by hugging trees I could save the planet,"" Seibt said. After factchecking the assertions of her teachers and the media, Seibt realized propaganda was trumping science in the climate change debate, she told the audience. ""It is important we keep questioning the narrative that is out there, instead of promoting it,"" Seibt said. ""These days, climate change science really isn't science at all. ""They draw their conclusions before even testing their hypotheses,"" Seibt said. ""And they base their assumptions on completely incoherent models, which is just an insult to science itself."" Media Success In just 10 days, videos from Heartland's Madrid Climate Reality Forum generated more than 280,000 views on YouTube, more than 4,000 comments, and 14,000 ""likes,"" resulting in a positive rating of 97 percent. The event was covered by dozens of news outlets, both internationally and in the United States, including France TV, De Telegraph in the Netherlands, Spain's Diary Now, and Breitbart News, the Daily Kos, and the Washington Times. Heartland announced plans to host another Climate Reality Forum in October 2020 in Glasgow, Scotland, site of the U.N.'s COP26 meeting. The institute hosted a similar event at the 2018 U.N.

Chile's ambassador to the OECD, Felipe Morande, outlined his government's agenda for the climate negotiations involving 196 countries (plus the European Union) in the first ITF Special Lecture on 5 September at the OECD, on invitation of ITF Secretary-General Young Tae Kim (photo). COP25 will be a pivotal moment for efforts to limit climate change and its impacts. The Santiago conference will be the last round of negotiations before countries have to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement in 2020. If these contributions do not become much more ambitious, global heating will not be stopped. Transport contributes around 23% of energy-related CO2, and its share is growing. But transport is hard to decarbonise because it is 92% dependent on oil. And although the majority of NDCs evoke transport decarbonisation, the measures often remain unspecific. On the other hand, many initiatives are being taken by the transport sector that are not echoed in the NDCs. ""There has to be some reordering to get more consistency"", Ambassador Morande noted. To strengthen the political role of the transport sector in shaping the NDCs, Chile is inviting transport ministers from around the world to be part of the core COP negotiation - a first since the COPs started in 1995. Ministers with responsibility for transport will meet on 6 December 2019, during the first week of the COP, following on the COP ""Transport Day"". A central aim, according to Ambassador Morande, is to ""generate a high-level relationship between the authorities that design transport polices worldwide, in order to make visible the commitment of governments."" Chile's initiative takes previous efforts by the ITF to a new level. At its Annual Summit, the ITF has been bringing together Transport Ministers from its member countries at a Roundtable on Transport and Climate Change for some years. Chile now envisages the dialogue ""to continue to take place at each ITF Annual Summit and COP going forward"", creating in effect a roughly six-month rhythm in which political decision makers for transport could co-ordinate on the most pressing issue the world is facing today.

Maegan Hayward, owner of East Village Vintage Collective and an active member of East Village Independent Merchants Association told WWD that the morale this past Saturday was ""a lot more relevant this year,"" due in part to social media and greater awareness from consumers. Hayward is reclaiming the holiday, calling it ""Shop Small Saturday,"" and instead partnering with a local organization ""FABnyc,"" which is a coalition of cultural and community nonprofits in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. One of the Saturday promotions was a tote bag that featured illustrations of immigrant-owned small businesses in the neighborhood. Hayward sensed the totes created community and brought more attention to local storefronts, even if a store couldn't afford to offer deals in line with ""big businesses."" ""How do you even know what you are or aren't supporting?,"" asked Hayward, who said she and her family members have ordered from Amazon because it's ""affordable and convenient."" But with shopping small one finds a ""direct [correlation]"" - for Hayward, it's in helping her to pay her rent. In regard to the clothing waste problem and climate responsibility, more broadly, ""turning a blind eye"" will not suffice. ""If they just stop producing clothing for one month, that would make such a difference,"" said Hayward, mentioning a fast-fashion retailer that her friend recently visited. If the surrounding protests are any indication, it's that this year's COP25 summit will need to address the global climate emergency with actions of scale before entering what the U.N. calls the ""defining year of 2020,"" and that ""big businesses"" are faced with surmounting pressure to act more ethically.

COP25 to demonstrate to the world our continued and strong commitment to the Paris Climate Accord,"" Pallone said. ""I oppose President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord and will continue to fight to ensure we remain a part of this landmark global agreement."" Pallone said the United States would not officially withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement until after the 2020 election. The next President could quickly rejoin the accord. In the meantime, Pallone is leading an effort in his Committee to draft legislation with the goal of achieving a 100 percent clean economy by 2050. This plan is consistent with the global scientific community's consensus that meeting this target is necessary to avoid the most catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. Pallone hopes to have his proposal ready by the end of this year. Pallone said COP25 "" COP25 will focus on the devastating impacts climate change is having on our oceans. A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed what many Americans are already experiencing - less productive oceans, rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events. I look forward to discussing ways that we can collectively work together to address ocean issues that are seriously undermining entire marine ecosystems, fresh water, fisheries and coastal economies,"" Pallone continued. ""Despite the President's dangerous and shortsighted decision, we want the world to know that we are still in and are committed to combating climate change with bold and aggressive action. The bottom line is the countries that are out front on climate action will benefit the most in terms of innovation, job creation and economic growth. It would be foolish for the United States not to take the lead,"" Pallone concluded.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA146","At COP25, nations aim to craft rules on carbon markets under Paris accord","December 4, 2019","SNL Power Policy Week","Delegates from more than 190 nations are slated to descend on Madrid in the first half of December with the primary aim of hashing out rules related to carbon markets under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Experts tracking the climate talks said properly designed carbon market mechanisms will be critical to ensuring that countries collectively reduce total global greenhouse gas emissions and avoid double-counting reductions. Countries gathering at COP25 from Dec. 2-13 have listed carbon markets as one means of achieving 51% of their combined pledges, according to the World Resources Institute. The formal name of COP25 is the 25th annual session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. ""Carbon markets cannot and should not be used to offset pollution but must result in overall emissions reductions,"" Center for International Environmental Law senior attorney Erika Lennon said in a Nov. 26 press call hosted by the Climate Action Network. ""Rules that are riddled with loopholes will only serve to negatively impact ambition and contribute to the climate crisis and threaten the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples."" Parties to the 2015 Paris accord agreed to create plans that ratchet up over time to curb emissions enough to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels. But over the last decade, the world collectively failed to curb production of greenhouse gas emissions, and rates have climbed an average of 1.5% annually over that period, the United Nations Environment Programme, or UNEP, reported Nov. 26. ""Our collective failure to act strongly and early means that we must now implement deep and urgent cuts,"" UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a statement attached to the report. Although President Donald Trump recently started the process of pulling the U.S. from the Paris accord, the U.S. State Department indicated it will send a delegation to COP25 . Carbon market topic leftover from COP24 At COP24 in Katowice, Poland, in 2018, delegates agreed to a number of key rules for implementing the Paris accord. However, they failed to reach a deal on the cooperation mechanisms contained in Article 6 of the Paris agreement for cutting emissions and ensuring that each tonne of carbon dioxide released into the air is accounted for and not double-counted. Double counting occurs when both the buyer and the seller of carbon credits claim the same emissions reduction in their national emissions records, which would paint an incorrect picture of overall carbon cuts, according to the World Resources Institute. Strong rules regarding carbon market accounting will also help existing and new markets grow and ensure their integrity, which would ultimately lower the cost of emissions reductions, enable countries to plan bigger emissions cuts, and generate sustainable investments in developing countries, Center for Climate and Energy Solutions Executive Vice President Elliot Diringer said in a Nov. 25 press briefing. What to do about reductions taken under Kyoto Protocol A related issue is whether any emissions reductions taken prior to 2020 under the Kyoto Protocol can be carried forward and count toward climate commitments after 2020 under Article 6. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated in March that 42% of national emissions reduction credits, known as Certified Emission Reductions, or CERs, issued under the Kyoto Protocol had been unused. Those unused credits are about 2.5 times higher than the expected demand for credits up to 2020. A full transition of existing CERs into the emissions market formed under the Paris agreement ""could substantially dilute"" that market ""from the outset, implying low credit prices, and less incentive for private sector investment in new ... activities,"" the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The intergovernmental organization recommended that Article 6 rule negotiators ""consider at least limiting the eligibility"" of what CERs can be carried forward into the Paris agreement mechanism. In addition to carbon markets, delegates are expected to discuss financing for developing countries and the need for countries to increase their emissions reductions targets in 2020. Parties are also expected to review the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, which is meant to help developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change that go beyond the ability of those countries to adapt or recover. In recent years under the Trump administration, the U.S. has held side events at the annual COP talks to tout the benefits of coal-fired generation, which is among the highest carbon-emitting fuels. The COP25 agenda lists the U.S. as hosting a side event Dec. 12 but does not indicate the expected topic. The location of COP25 talks changed only months before it was slated to begin after Chilean President Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era announced the country would not host the talks this year amid civil unrest. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA147","Oxfam International Issues Statement on Announcement of COP25 Climate Talks in Madrid","December 15, 2019 Sunday 6:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Oxfam International issued the following statement by Interim Executive Director Chema Vera in response to the announcement of the COP25 climate talks in Madrid: ""The world is screaming out for climate action but this summit had responded with a whisper. The poorest nations are in a sprint for survival yet many governments have barely moved from the starting blocks. Instead of committing to more ambitious cuts in emissions, countries have argued over technicalities. ""Poorer nations spoke with one voice to demand funds to help them recover from the loss and damage inflicted by the climate emergency. For the homes that have become uninhabitable, the land that has become un-farmable, and the lives that have become unbearable. Wealthy nations have used every trick in the book to stall progress and avoid paying their fair share. ""Now more then ever, it is vital that people across the world keep up the pressure on governments to deliver more ambitious climate action."" Emissions Cuts Instead of committing to more ambitious cuts in emissions, countries have argued over technicalities. Commitments made so far have come from countries that account for around only 10 percent of global emissions. They will not keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 C. If we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate impacts it is critical that all countries - led by the largest emitters - commit to much deeper emissions cuts in early 2020. Loss and Damage COP25 did not establish a new funding mechanism for Loss and Damage. Instead countries agreed to start a conversation about funding and create a new expert group to advise on the issue. They also asked the Green Climate Fund - the main multilateral fund through which rich countries channel climate finance - to take up the matter. Without new and additional funding, the world's most vulnerable people will struggle to recover and rebuild after climate shocks. For example, Oxfam's report, Forced from Home, shows that climate-related disasters are now the biggest driver of internal migration, forcing one person from their home every two seconds. It underlines the need for new and additional money to help communities that cannot adapt to the climate crisis. Gender Justice The Gender Action Plan approved at the summit sets out a plan for increasing the participation and leadership of women in international climate talks, and in the design and implementation of climate policies at the national and local level. While the plan still needs to be translated into concrete measures, actions and targets, it is encouraging to see this blueprint for change given that poor women are often the hardest hit by the climate crisis. Climate Finance Wealthy countries are not providing the funds that are needed to help poor nations adapt to the climate crisis. Rich polluting countries pledged almost $90 million in new funding for adaptation in Madrid and made additional pledges to the Green Climate Fund. However, Oxfam's analysis shows that the target of reaching $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020 remains a distant dream after adjusting for loans and creative accounting. Reasons to be positive As the big polluters dissemble and spin, the global movement for climate action is growing bigger and stronger. Young people are standing up for a safer future - showing the leadership that has been severely lacking from governments. Frontline communities from Fiji to Malawi and Peru are fighting back. The Spanish Government deserves credit for stepping in to ensure COP25 went ahead. The UNFCCC remains the only forum we have for governments, businesses and civil society to try to solve the most pressing issue of our times. Our hopes rest with the millions of people across the world who are taking to the streets to demand climate justice. Governments must listen and come back to the table in 2020 with the commitment and ambition needed to deliver on the Paris Climate Agreement.

Antnio Guterres issued the charge on Wednesday in a speech to the annual Caring for Climate Meeting, held during the on-going UN COP25 climate conference in Madrid. The magnitude of the climate emergency is jeopardizing our future and life as we know it. I have come back to # COP25 to appeal for a successful conclusion of the conference and increased #ClimateAction and ambition. Antnio Guterres (@antonioguterres) December 11, 2019 ""I'm meeting more and more business leaders that complain that they cannot do more because governments will not allow them to do so, because of the environment that is still created in the bureaucratic, administrative, tax regulatory and other frameworks that are under government control"", he said. Business sector fights climate change Caring for Climate mobilizes business leaders to implement and recommend solutions and policies to beat climate change. It was launched in 2007 and is convened by the UN Global Compact, the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). With the climate crisis increasingly jeopardizing life on the planet, the Secretary-General stressed that more collective action will be needed from governments, regions, cities, businesses and civil society. ""What we need is not an incremental approach, but a transformational approach. And we need businesses to unite behind the science by taking rapid and ambitious action across their operations and value chains."" The ""science"" refers to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. This will require reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, by 45 per cent by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Business and finance cannot act alone Business and financial leaders have been doing their part to beat climate change, as the Secretary-General acknowledged. He was encouraged that 170 major companies have committed to set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets through the 'Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees' campaign. However, he said the business and financial sectors cannot act alone. Next year, many governments will present plans to reduce their emissions, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Mr. Guterres forecast that these enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will include carbon neutral strategies and green initiatives in sectors such as energy, industry, construction and transport. "" ""In support of these efforts, I am calling on you, leaders from the private sector and civil society, to challenge your Governments to use this opportunity to make clear their economic development policies that will enable your companies to invest decisively in a net-zero future,"" he said. The UN chief added that millions worldwide, particularly young people, recognize that more must be done to limit the worst impacts of climate disruption. ""That's why they are calling on leaders from all sectors to do exponentially more to address the climate emergency,"" he said. ""We are quickly nearing our last opportunity to be on the right side of history."" UNFCCC Youth climate activisit, Greta Thunberg, addresses the high-level meeting on Caring for Climate at the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid. Greta Thunberg's visit The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg was at the UN conference on Wednesday, urging participants to focus on the science behind climate change. She explained it was important to keep to the 1.5-degree threshold ""because even at one degree, people are dying from the climate crisis."" ""Because that is what the united science calls for, to avoid destabilizing the climate so that we have the best possible chance to avoid setting off irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers, polar ice and thawing arctic permafrost. Every fraction of a degree matters."" Ms. Thunberg told world leaders at the UN's Climate Action Summit in September that they were ""failing"" her generation, by not taking action to ease the climate crisis fast enough, and on Wednesday, the 16-year-old Swede who founded the school strike movement, was named by TIME magazine as their 2019 Person of the Year. \"

This would guarantee the EU maintains its world leadership in the fight against climate change. They also highlighted the need for the EU to raise its ambition level for 2030 in order to reach the 2050 target. MEPs expect the European Green Deal announced by European Commission President-elect Ursula Von Der Leyen to include a target of 55% emissions reductions by 2030. Global ambition for aviation and shipping not enough MEPs say that current ambition for aviation and shipping fall short of the necessary emissions reductions and hence believe that all countries should be encouraged to include emissions from international shipping and aviation in their national contributions plans (NDCs). More financial support to fight climate change Finally, they urgently call on all EU countries to phase out all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies by 2020 and on the European Investment Bank to end lending to fossil fuel projects except for gas when used in combination with renewables. The global action made during the next 10 years will impact the future of humanity for the next 10 000 years, they say. Quote ""The Environment Committee is showing the way for Europe to be the first carbon-neutral continent in 2050"", said the Chair of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee Pascal Canfin (Renew Europe, FR). ""While the United States confirmed yesterday its exit from the Paris Agreement, we reaffirmed today in the European Parliament's Environment Committee that we want Europe to be serious about the fight against climate change"", he added. Background The European Commission has already proposed the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but the European Council has still not endorsed it as some countries are opposed. COP25 will take place in Madrid from 2-13 December 2019. A delegation from the European Parliament led by Bas Eickhout (Greens, NL) will participate.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA150","350.org Issues Statement on Conclusion of COP25","December 16, 2019 Monday 11:47 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The 350.org issued the following statement: As COP25 comes to an end, national delegates failed once more to step up to the existential challenge of the climate crisis. For two weeks, negotiators tinkered with the last bits of the so-called 'rulebook' of the Paris Agreement -- the set of detailed provisions that are supposed to guide the implementation of the 2015 climate accord. On virtually each item on the agenda, a few large and powerful countries with vested interests in coal, oil and gas, stubbornly blocked progress. This was in stark contrast to the demands for swift and radical action coming from the millions of people who have been marching in climate strikes in 2019, as well as to the increasingly concerned warnings of scientists and researchers./ May Boeve, 350.org executive director, issued the following statement: COP25 was a success for the fossil fuel industry -- their interests have won, effectively blocking the process and undermining the end result. As time ran out, the COP looked more and more like a hostage situation inside a burning building -- together with most negotiators, people and planet were held captive as the fossil fuel industry and a few loud governments who have been delivering on their agenda took over the process. In the end, after forcing negotiators to keep at it for three days straight, they got what they wanted -- a weakened text that kicks most of the big issues down the road to COP26. Let's be crystal clear -- after a year of climate strikes and the increasingly stark warnings of science, the only acceptable response to the climate breakdown was and still is for governments to commit to start phasing out fossil fuels immediately, including finance flows to this deadly industry. This was the only real benchmark for success, and on this important test, once again, politicians have failed us. The climate talks themselves turned into yet another stalemate, where big polluters and governments controlled by the fossil fuel industry got to block or slow down the process. Given the science, a stalemate means we're all losing. The gulf between what we know must be done and what politicians are willing to do has never been wider. There is no excuse for this appalling lack of courage and responsibility, and no rational explanation other than the fossil fuel industry's toxic grip on our politics. Youth activists and Indigenous leaders from all over the world brought into the climate negotiations the moral clarity that the process was lacking. Instead of being heard, these people were literally kicked out of the door, and lobbyists were left in to craft intricate rules to hide the fact that not enough is being done. The climate talks are over for this year but citizen activism is not. We are going to bring our activism home, to capitals, ministries, bank headquarters, and fossil fuel infrastructure all over the world. We are going to keep marching, and disrupting and pressuring our politicians. And we are going to vote, and campaign, and make our voices heard. Support is growing everywhere for the climate policies we need. People want a just transition that works for everyone, people and planet, especially for the most vulnerable and most impacted by the unfolding crisis. Some are calling 2019 the year of youth climate protest, but you haven't seen anything yet. Footnotes: / Over the past couple of months alone, a number of reports from UN agencies and research organizations confirmed that if we are to keep the planet from warming over 1.5 C we need to start reducing global emissions at the rate of 7.6% a year between now and 2030 (UNEP), yet current climate plans put us on a trajectory for 3.2 C and the world is on track to produce 120% more fossil fuels than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 C (UNEP and Stockholm Environment Institute). In the meantime, global emissions continue to rise and the tell-tale signs and impacts of climate change - such as sea level rise, ice loss and extreme weather - all increased over the past five years (WMO).

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA151","CLIMATE OVERSHOOT: THE IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WE'RE NOT HAVING","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by World Wildlife Fund (WWF): A newly released paper, Planning for Change: Conservation-Related Impacts of Climate Overshoot, published in Oxford University Press journal, BioScience, examines the potentially substantial impacts climate overshoot could have on our ecosystems and species around the globe, and how we must account for peak warming temperatures as we navigate the ongoing climate crisis. Climate overshoot, a period where global mean temperatures rise above warming targets before settling back down, is a likely occurrence in roughly 90 percent of climate change scenarios that target 1.5 Celsius of warming. Scenarios that hold global mean temperature to 1.5C could include an overshoot period that ranges from 1.56C to 1.85C for a 15 to 70 year duration, before falling back to 1.5C. A climate overshoot period is also possible for 2.0C scenarios, given the current lack of scope and ambition in existing mitigation commitments. ""Overshoot has been invisible in the world's climate discussions for far too long,"" says Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist of World Wildlife Fund. ""Unless we start addressing overshoot's potential impacts, what we must do to avoid them and how we also must plan for them, we risk missing the full narrative of climate change's impacts."" Climate overshoot involves both a warming and a cooling period. During the warming phase, species and humans may migrate to more suitable habitats. Humans may convert new land for agriculture and struggle with disease and food security. When the temperatures begin to cool back down to the end-of-century target, species and humans may need to migrate again. But these migration pathways and original habitats may have been permanently transformed or destroyed during the warming period. While it is possible to take the steps needed to avoid damaging impacts, we need to act now. As world leaders gather this week in Madrid for the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 to address national commitments to the climate crisis, we must think beyond just end-of-the-century stabilized outcomes and place additional focus on addressing climate overshoot and the role peak warming would play for our ecosystems, communities and the planet. ""There are many ongoing efforts that make us feel hopeful about climate solutions,"" says Shaw. ""We can remain motivated to ramp up these efforts and use the available science on climate overshoot as we plan towards a sustainable future."" \"

In the letter, Senator Murray sounded the alarm on the dangerous, growing impacts of the climate crisis and the damage that will be inflicted on current and future generations unless immediate action is taken. Senator Murray also warned the President against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue, and admonished him for failing to honor his commitment to work with Democrats to renegotiate the Paris Climate Accord or to craft a new deal to address the climate crisis. The letter comes as the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference takes place in Madrid this week. Senator Murray wrote, As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs. Additionally, the letter emphasized the national security implications related to the Presidents withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, underscoring the damage done to the United States reputation by going back on an international commitment. Senator Murrays letter further illustrates the outcry from Washingtonians and Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA160","STUDENTS HAVE FRONT-ROW SEAT FOR INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE NEGOTIATIONS","February 10, 2020 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by Vanderbilt University: As part of its continuing commitment to understanding and combating climate change issues through education and action, Vanderbilt University is now an accredited, official observer of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This designation allows students, faculty and staff to participate in negotiating conferences that bring together tens of thousands of lawmakers, scientists, activists and others to adopt international climate policy and discuss a diverse array of climate-related issues. These conferenceshotbeds of learning and discoveryare not open to the public. Vanderbilt obtained the official U.N. accreditation after nearly two years of work that required the support of university leadership and nearly 700 pages of application materials documenting the university's strong commitment to climate-related education and global engagement. Vanderbilt earned the status in time for more than a dozen students to attend the 25th annual Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain, in late December. The students were led by Leah Dundon as the culmination of a new interdisciplinary course on climate change titled ""Climate Change and the Global Response: A Multidisciplinary Perspective."" Dundon is director of the Vanderbilt Climate Change Initiative, a lecturer in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, and an environmental lawyer. ""COP is a perfect venue to attain that part of a global education that can only be had by experience."" Leah Dundon ""At COP, access to the world's leading thinkers on a range of subjects is unparalleled, and the COP is a perfect venue to attain that part of a global education that can only be had by experience,"" Dundon said. ""My students met personally with prior heads of state, lead climate negotiators from the U.S. State Department, industry leaders, leading economists, indigenous people, media, and many more."" In addition, Dundon and one of her students, Kelson Reiss, presented original research during a panel discussion about the role of higher education in increasing ambition to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Below, Reiss and some of his classmates give their reaction to the COP25 experience. For the first time, Vanderbilt students attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference as official observers. What's your biggest takeaway from this experience? My generation is vividly interested and engaged in climate change issues, but too many students graduate without having any academic exposure to the scientific, political and social issues tied to climate change. Especially after attending this conference, I realize that we need a young educated public to face the difficult decisions that lie ahead tied to the climate emergency, and that starts in the classroom. Kelson Reiss, Philosophy and Computer Science, graduated in December 2019 One of my biggest takeaways (one that I was not expecting to have) is a feeling of hope that we might be able to tackle this issue after all. From the influential people I met, to the immense presence of young people, to the welcoming and sharing of distinct voices and cultures, to the respect the delegates had for each other in the negotiating room, I left with the sense that there are people and policymakers who are dedicated to confronting this issue. The lack of action in the U.S. makes for such widespread pessimism and apathy, so we often forget to look at all the other parts of the world that are making great strides to combat the climate crisis. Being exposed to so many different people and countries gave me a greater sense of hope. Gabrielle Guarna, Earth and Environmental Sciences and Cinema and Media Arts, Class of 2022 Climate change is an immovable reality in my life because I am a Cuban American from Miami who feels closer to his city than anywhere else in the world. I have a moral, civic and cultural obligation to preserve my city by dedicating my life to a career in climate legislation, litigation or adaptation-related research. While Professor Dundon's class prepared me intellectually and academically to attend the UN COP25 , what I took from the conference was a set of immense personal realizations. Some of these understandings will serve as a basis of hope for me, while some will undoubtedly continue to serve as flares of desperation that will, as an unkind necessity, keep me motivated to push forward and fight back. Luis Martinez, History and Spanish and Portuguese, Class of 2022 What surprised you? The youth engagement at COP25 really surprised me. Climate change is a highly generational problem. In our class at Vanderbilt, we learned about Juliana v. United States, which is a climate justice case reaching the Supreme Court. A group of young plaintiffs are suing the United States federal government for prioritizing current adult citizens over future ones through climate ignorance. Younger people will feel the impacts of climate change disproportionately to current adults. It made me really proud to see youth from all around the world (not just Greta Thunberg) come together to hold adults accountable. The youth, however, were not really present in the actual negotiations. That should change in the future. Jacob Wilentz, Economics, Law, History and Society, and Anthropology triple major, Class of 2021 Foreign policy is incredibly complex, more so than I understood, and the process itself at COP25 was a lot more formal and intricate than I expected. Also, I was surprised by the large variety of priorities among global stakeholders. Coming in, I had an overly naive view that nearly all parties were on the same page about climate change being an issue. To an extent that is true, but countries were also largely driven by self-interest. This caused conflict between, for example, an under-developed island nation that will sooner experience the immediate consequences of climate change vs. a wealthier country that is more insulated and therefore more reluctant to contribute resources. Kelson Reiss What's something you learned that you didn't know before attending the conference? Something I heard consistently at the conference is that 2020 is the make-or-break year. If we don't make real, concrete changes this year, the hope of staying below 2C warming is a completely unattainable goal with very real consequences. This was something new for me because previously I had always been told that the turning point year was 2030 at the earliest. Hearing this made me fear even more for the future since I know it is very unlikely that 2020 will bring the drastic changes we need. Gabrielle Guarna I did not realize the personal impact of actually meeting people severely affected by climate change. It is one thing to read about climate refugees or watch videos on the internet, but I met 10 indigenous leaders from the Amazon who have lost their land because of deforestation, lost water because of severe drought, and even lost part of their culture because of their sacred connections to natural sites. I saw tears, frustration and anger. It reminded me how everyone on this planet is human and deserves compassion, respect and love. Jacob Wilentz I learned about NBS, or nature-based solutions, as a means of solvency that would incorporate coastal regimes and other natural structures inherent to different parts of the world in climate mitigation and resilience-increasing plans and policies. Luis Martinez Why should we take international institutions like COP25 seriously? In some ways, these institutions are the gatekeepers to systemic change. We have a multitude of innovative community-informed solutions that can work toward environmental justice. If we don't ensure these solutions are heard and implemented throughout international institutions, lasting sustainable change that works for everyone will be much more difficult to achieve and maintain. Oliver Sandreuter, Public Policy, Spanish, Human and Organizational Development, Class of 2020 What do you wish more people knew about climate issues? Taking climate issues seriously means that we also take national security, human rights, indigenous rights and the rights of our environment seriously. McKalee Steen, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Class of 2020 One person can make a huge difference. After COP25 , I decided to become a vegetarian because meat contributes so much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. At first, I was really nervous because I love meat and food so much. However, I powered through because we all have to make sacrifices. That one small change has decreased my carbon footprint by half. It motivates me every day to do better and remind my family, friends and community of the power of their actions. Jacob Wilentz Just because it might not be affecting you directly, doesn't mean it isn't an issue! The climate crisis is not something that is a future threatthe effects are happening to people all over the world, and mostly to populations that are already very vulnerable. Gabrielle Guarna \"

The representatives made the call at an official side-event held by the REN Alliance, a partnership of the International Hydropower Association, International Solar Energy Society, International Geothermal Association, World Bioenergy Association and World Wind Energy Association. Mathis Rogner, Senior Analyst at the International Hydropower Association (IHA), represented the hydropower sector and was joined by Jose Gonzalez, Senior Researcher at the International Solar Energy Society, Marit Brommer, Executive Director at International Geothermal Association and Remigijus Lapinskas, President of the World Bioenergy Association. The panelists urged policy-makers to:  increase renewable energy penetration in the electricity grid  develop markets that reward power system flexibility  stop financing and subsidising fossil fuels  increase investments in renewable energy technologies. Mr Rogner said that renewable technologies were prepared to meet global energy demand and decarbonisation goals, but the policy and regulatory frameworks need to catch up. ""I would like to call on governments, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations and companies to come together and work upon this aspect, so renewable energy can play a greater part,"" he said. It is clear that our power systems need a mix of services to ensure resilient systems, he added. He said the hydropower sector was going to continue to grow, but its role is evolving to offering further and additional grid flexibility services to support and enable the greater integration of variable renewables, while also offering freshwater management services. Dr Brommer agreed collaboration is key to ensure the necessary deployment of renewable energy technologies on the ground. ""The geothermal sector is keen to continue to push the need for energy system transformation and is grateful for the outreach opportunities through strong and strategic partnerships provided by the REN Alliance at high-level events such as the COPs where our joint messages are amplified,"" she said. David Renne, President of the International Solar Energy Society, said that while it is unfortunate that more was not accomplished at the national and global level at COP25 , the REN Alliance side-event confirms that much positive action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is taking place at local and regional levels. ""There is no question that the need for climate change mitigation is becoming more and more urgent, and that a major solution to this urgency is to increase the rate of deployment of clean renewable energy technologies that can meet all of our end use energy needs, including power, heat, and transport,"" he said.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA163","UNWTO: Tourism's carbon emissions measured in report launched at COP25","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","Eturbo News","U.S., Dec. 4 -- Transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to account for 5.3% of all man-made CO2 emissions by 2030, up from 5% in 2016, a landmark new report from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the International Transport Forum (ITF) shows. At the same time, as tourist numbers rise and the sector makes progress in achieving low-carbon travel, emissions per passenger kilometer are expected to decline over the coming decade. Against this backdrop, UNWTO calls for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to effectively transform tourism for climate action. Launched at an official side-event of the One Planet Sustainable Tourism Program during the UN Climate Summit, COP25 in Madrid, the ""Transport Related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector"" presents the emissions produced by the different modes of tourism transport. As the number of both international and domestic tourists continues to rise, this data is presented alongside the predicted growth in emissions to 2030 and is set against the so called 'current ambition' for the decarbonization of transport. Presenting the report, UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler said: ""This comprehensive study analyses the environmental impact of the different modes of transport within the tourism sector. It is now for the tourism sector, especially tourism policy makers to use data effectively and ensure the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate emergency."" Ovais Sarmad, the Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) addressed the need to scale efforts towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement: ""While tourism is mentioned in many Nationally Determined Contributions as a big concern, not enough has yet been done. Industry must do more, but governments must align their policies, so that at the international level we can collectively work to increase ambition. The One Planet Sustainable Tourism Program is a vital ongoing mechanism to promote sustainable tourism around the world."" Some of the main conclusions of the research include:  Against the current ambition scenario, transport-related CO2 emissions from tourism are predicted to increase from 1,597 million tonnes to 1,998 million tonnes between 2016 and 2030, representing a 25% rise.  During the same period, international and domestic arrivals are expected to increase from 20 billion to 37 billion, mainly driven by domestic tourism (from 18.8 billion to 35.6 billion), followed by international arrivals (1.2 billion to 1.8 billion).  Transport-related emissions from tourism represented 5% of all man-made emissions in 2016 and will increase to 5.3% by 2030.  Tourism related transport emissions represented 22% of all transport emissions in 2016 and will continue doing so in 2030 (21%). Moving to a ""high ambition scenario"" Tourism's transport-related CO2 emissions remain a major challenge and require tourism to work closely with transport in order to support its commitment to accelerate the decarbonazition process and the implementation of a high ambition scenario. In addition, the tourism sector must determine its own high ambition scenario, complementing the efforts of the transport sector. Here, tourism would advance towards significantly decoupling growth from emissions in order to grow within the international climate targets.

So-called 'blue forests', composed of large marine algae, are widespread across the planet and thousands of species depend on them to survive. In fact, the higher level of biodiversity within 'blue forests', the more CO2 that will be stored, and the more resilient the oceans will be in the face of destabilising threats. ""Blue forests are one of the main lungs of our oceans we should protect them as they deserve. Scientific reports tend to focus on terrestrial forests, but marine algae can account for as much as one-fifth of the CO2 stored by oceans. It is vital that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) take them into account, and that decision makers include their protection within international policies against the climate crisis"", said Ricardo Aguilar, Senior Research and Expeditions Director of Oceana in Europe. The role of the oceans as allies in fighting climate change is typically undervalued, yet up to 1000 tonnes of CO2 can be stored within a single hectare of marine vegetation. Even when ocean ecosystems are factored into climate change plans, blue forests are often dismissed, even though they can store as much CO2 as mangroves, marshes and seagrass meadows combined. More than 17 000 species comprise large marine algal forests, of which the following are among the most common ones: Brown algae: These species come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Brown algae can live at depths greater than 150 metres, while others can float freely in the open ocean. Kelps are the largest algae on the planet, reaching heights surpassing 30 metres. At the same time, they can store more than 1200 grams of carbon per square metre annually. Green algae: They can often be found mixed with other marine plants, and together they provide food and refuge to hundreds of species of marine animals. Some green algae are single-celled, others form dense belts in coastal ecosystems, and some are calcareous (i.e., they contain calcium carbonate). There are more than 8000 different species of green algae. Red algae: These species play an important role in marine ecosystems, and form highly productive and lush sea meadows and forests. Calcareous red algae represent important carbon sinks, and moreover can have very long lifespans, with some formations reaching 8000 years of age. \"

Civil society and business are now the ones leading the charge. Next year governments will have to show they can catch up. ""On the critical issue of ambition, parties struggled even to reaffirm their prior commitment to submit a new round of national targets next year. And for the second year in a row, they failed to agree on accounting rules for international carbon trading, the last remaining piece of the rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement. Strong rules are critical to ensure the growth and environmental integrity of carbon markets, which can help drive climate investment, lower the cost of meeting climate goals, and enable countries to raise their climate ambition. It may now fall to willing countries to develop their own rules outside the U.N. process. ""The first real test for Paris comes next year when countries deliver their next round of national commitments. Despite the impending U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, U.S. Congressional, state, and business leaders made clear in Madrid that they remain fully on board. It is vital that other countries not use the U.S. withdrawal as an excuse to be less ambitious. ""The science is undeniable. The here-and-now impacts of climate change grow worse every day. Business leaders understand the economic imperative of strong climate action. And citizens around the world are more mobilized than ever. National governments will risk their relevancy - and our collective future - if they fail to deliver next year.""

""I look forward towards more countries factoring in climate education into their national climate action plans."" Compulsory climate education needed The UNFCCC hopes there will be a critical mass of countries by the time COP 26 rolls around next year in the Scottish city of Glasgow. Italy and Mexico are encouraging other nations to prioritize climate education. ""Young people are demanding that governments take climate change far more seriously. There are many areas of society where we must act, and act with increased ambition: compulsory education on these topics needs to be a key part of this national and international response to the big issues of our time"", said Lorenzo Fioramonti, Italy's Minister of Education, Innovation and Research. Martha Delgado, Vice Minister of Global Affairs in Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said her country has incorporated mandatory environmental education into the constitution as the first step in a new comprehensive plan. ""Great transformations can only be achieved through knowledge, awareness and the sense of collaboration"", she said. ""We are convinced that environmental education is the route to meeting Sustainable Development Goals, an essential tool to fight the climate crisis and can prompt a profound cultural change to contribute to our planet's sustainability."" Earth Day milestone a catalyst The two countries propose that other nations can use the celebration of Earth Day in April as the occasion to announce their plans for climate and environmental education. The 2020 commemoration also marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day and the birth of the environmental movement. Kathleen Rogers, President of the Earth Day Network, pointed out that environmental literacy had been at the core of Earth Day since its inception, but that governments had not gone far enough. ""Young people, through movements such as Fridays for Future, have been asking governments to tell the truth about the climate and environmental emergencies that we are now facing - 'telling the truth' needs to happen in the schools and universities, and needs to happen now"", she said.

Workers and their unions have shown this year that they are part of the solution, part of the growing movement to demand action from their governments. Trade unions from Chile to Spain, the Philippines to Nigeria will be part of a trade union delegation at the COP25 , from 2 December - 13 December. ""There is a climate crisis. A net-zero emissions economy with Just Transition measures is our only chance of survival. Without the social dialogue vital to achieve progress on this, the impact on the economy can only worsen. Corporate greed and profit at any cost can no longer underpin transition to a net-zero future, and no company can escape our attention,"" said Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). Unions want decent jobs on a living planet through the guarantees of Just Transition measures for all workers. COP25 must show the commitment of governments to step up ambition in their NDCs and support the Climate Action for Jobs Initiative. Adequate climate finance is the cornerstone of effective climate policy, and governments must live up to their promise to mobilise US$100 billion annually by 2020. ""As workers' organisations, we are faced with a very important responsibility. Social progress has never come for free, without struggle from the people affected. This is also the case for climate protection. We need to fight for our place at the table and to see that our demands for climate justice are taken into account through social dialogue for a Just Transition,"" said Sharan Burrow. Canada, Germany, New Zealand and Spain have led the way with Just Transition agreements, and South Africa and Scotland have Just Transition authorities in place, while Sweden and India have breakthroughs in cleaner steel and cement. Bold action on climate change could generate over 65 million new low-carbon jobs in 2030 and deliver US$26 trillion in economic benefits between now and 2030 according to the New Climate Economy. Ambition and Just Transition plans are urgently required to secure the trust of people in every country. Unions demand that governments:  Stop the delaying measures and increase ambition in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).  Start implementing the social dialogue vital for agreements that deliver Just Transition for all.  Legislate for climate action, including procurement rules.  Ensure Green New Deals mean a New Social Contract in every country with labour rights, climate ambition and Just Transition at the core. ""The ITUC will fight to see no one is left behind, that no worker or community is forgotten. ?We stand in solidarity with the American people who understand that President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement endangers the world's capacity to stabilise the planet. ?The ITUC has expressed their clear view that the presence of President Pinera at COP25 in Madrid puts at risk the trust that people need, the trust that governments will act in their interests. We must not lose another chance for governments to halt the climate emergency,"" said Ms Burrow. The social unrest in Chile and repressive government response that led to President Pinera cancelling the COP in Santiago are symbolic in the global fight for social justice and a reminder of all the lives that are put at risk by regressive policies.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA172","COP25: FINAL DECLARATION OF THE PEOPLE'S SUMMIT 2019","December 20, 2019 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by War on Want: From 2 to 7 December, War on Want was a part of the Cumbre de los Pueblos (People's Summit) in Santiago, Chile. Below is the final declaration of the summit, which highlights that despite the glaring asymmetries present in the climate crisis and the stifling situation of the climate talks at the UN, the solutions to the crises we face today continue to be driven by the communities and movements who defend their lands, water and livelihoods and we must take inspiration from that. Between 2 and 7 December 2019, hundreds of organisations, women, men, Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples, migrant communities, farmers, peasants, workers, young people and children from Chile, Latin America and the world were part of the Peoples Summit held at the University of Santiago de Chile. Amid a country in a state of rebellion, mobilised against an unjust and predatory neoliberal system, and in the face of a violent and abusive state, the public University, fully fulfilling its role, opened the doors for us: to debate about the planetary crisis and its multiple expressions social and environmental, national and territorial; to share our struggles, our denunciations and demands; and to imagine together the possibility of another world. More than 40 activities panels, workshops, councils, conversations and other formats self-organised by participating organisations, two permanent spaces the Women's Tent and the Village of Peace artistic-cultural activities as well as the panels and plenaries of the Peoples' Summit welcomed the active participation of around 1,500 accredited compaeros and compaeras. From the fraternal experience lived and shared during these five days, the organisations of the People's Summit declare the following: 1. We reiterate our commitment to the peoples of Chile and other Latin American countries that have risen against structural injustices, the usurpation and privatisation of common goods, social precariousness, structural violence against women, systemic racism, and the violation of rights of the neoliberal system; and we demand justice in cases of deaths and human rights violations with which states have responded to these mobilisations. 2. We support the demands of social movements and territorial assemblies demanding a true Constituent Assembly in Chile, made up entirely of citizens, and without privileges for political parties, which considers gender parity and significant quotas for indigenous peoples. 3. We do not conceive of a constitutional process that answers to the rules of a political-electoral system that has been one of the pillars of the Chilean neoliberal model, and whose political class has shown a new demonstration of subordination to business interests through the actions of the Chamber of Deputies and the creation of the so-called ""anti-looting"" law, which includes articles that openly criminalise the legitimate social protest. 4. We support the aspirations of organisations and communities in Chile to establish a political constitution endowed with the principles of plurinationality, feminism, and the recognition of the rights of nature. COP25 climate talks in Madrid: We condemn the fact that the COP25 presidency was retained by the Government of Sebastian Piera, responsible for assassinations, torture, rapes, mutilations, injuries, humiliation, arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations committed by State agents. We reject the promotion of false solutions to climate change which deepen the crisis and strengthen the model that created it such as carbon markets, hydroelectricity and other corporate-based energies, carbon sinks based on tree monocultures and agrofuels, industrial energy from forest biomass, incineration, geoengineering and hydraulic fracturing or fracking. We demand that effective measures be taken to avoid the corporate capture of the negotiations, as well as for large corporations and the most polluting countries to radically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and pay their fair share for the damages caused, predominantly in the most vulnerable territories. We call for greater visibility to climate migration and for the promotion of migration policies through a human rights approach. We call for the implementation of a real just transition and truly sustainable solutions, outside of market mechanisms and extractivism, and based on territorial sovereignty, local practices, cultures and economies, on decent working and living conditions, as well as on continuous exchange and solidarity between towns and communities. 6. We reject the imposition and expansion of extractivism by governments and international organisations, in collusion with corporate power, which conceive all territories as potential areas of sacrifice, destroys ecosystems, displaces communities, affecting their lifestyles and local economies. This includes the promotion of, and subsidies for, metallic or non-metallic mining, forest plantations, agribusiness and conventional livestock, which also carries a high dose of cruelty towards animals. 7. We echo and elevate the demands and claims of Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples, for the demilitarisation of their territories particularly the Wallmapu the return of their ancestral lands and the full exercise of their political, social and cultural rights. 8. Citing the statement of the Women's Tent, ""we claim the feminist economy as a strategy of resistance and transformation for the lives of women and their communities, as a way of recognising and valuing the knowledge, domestic work and care that sustains life but which, in this capitalist system, falls on women."" 9. We celebrate the strength and active participation of young people and children in the Summit spaces, and recognise the leading role they have played in denouncing the crisis and promoting structural changes. 11. We demand policies and promote community initiatives aimed at generating fairer and friendlier cities, harmonising the city-countryside relationship, deprivatising basic services, promoting broad and participatory territorial planning, implementing zero-waste models and sustainable urban mobility systems. 12. We demand the radical transformation of energy models to ones based on sovereignty, sufficiency and solidarity, in order to construct clean, decentralised and distributive energy-generation systems through diverse community-based sources. 13. We reject the signing of free trade and investment treaties that benefit corporations, violate social rights and undermine local economies and food sovereignty. We demand the final and definitive withdrawal of Trans Pacific Partnership 11 from the Chilean parliament. 14. We call for the construction of Latin American and international movements and articulations, integrating ecological and climatic justice organisations, feminists, Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples, migrants, workers, peasants, young people, children, in order to stop the model privatising the commons and to raise alternative paradigms like buen vivir and others that flourish from the cosmovisions of the peoples. 15. Finally, citing the declaration of the Village of Peace, ""we invite ourselves to collective co-create ways to relate to nature, and a conscious and loving way to relate to each other. [...] We understood the need to incorporate the rights of nature and of all living beings that sustain the planetary fabric, as constituents of our lives and the laws of the peoples."" Santiago, December 7, 2019 ""SAVE THE EARTH, CHANGE THE SYSTEM"" Cumbre de los Pueblos was the original alternative space running parallel to the COP25 climate talks, which were moved at the very last minute to Madrid, Spain, in an attempt by the Chilean government to divert attention away from the huge popular uprisings that are still happening in the country.

Steven Ko, the founder and chairman of O'right-and the only SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) delegate from Taiwan to be present at the global event--is scheduled to give a speech entitled ""Closing the Circularity Gap--The Power of Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Collaboration."" The Conference of the Parties, known as the COP, is the supreme decision-making body--and also the largest and longest-standing body--in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This December, thousands of delegates from over 200 countries descended on Madrid in an effort to reach a consensus on establishing an international carbon-trading market and carbon-pricing mechanisms. It should be noted that the green beauty brand O'right was the only Taiwanese SME delegate to stand on stage and call for action to mitigate the world's worsening climate change catastrophe.\~ ""To address the climate crisis, we need to dramatically reduce global carbon emissions,"" said Ko. ""Otherwise, we won't be able to survive climate change. As top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, companies should put carbon reduction, or even zero carbon, at the core of their business models. This is why O'right has been embracing sustainability since 2002."" Ko continued, ""By being a part of this major global conference, we hope to show the world the green power of Taiwan and our years of green achievements. We believe that we can inspire individuals, groups and businesses to join us on our zero carbon, sustainability journey."" This year, the ocean is at the heart of climate negotiations. ""In our vision, there cannot be an effective global response to climate change without a global response to ocean issues,"" commented the Minister of the Environment in Chile and COP25 President Carolina Schmidt, who designated the event the ""Blue COP."" ""As you know, this year, 2019, is a very important year for the protection of our ocean from climate change. Our knowledge of the ocean, although still limited, has provided considerable information and evidence to raise alarms and pushed us to start taking concrete actions to protect our oceans."" O'right is headquartered in Taiwan, which is an island surrounded by the sea. As such, the impact of climate change, such as extreme weather, is already being felt across the nation, and it is likely that this will only get worse. In fact, the Climate Change Performance Index, which was published by the environmental think tank Germanwatch in 2018, ranked Taiwan in the bottom 5, which was a clear indication that there is much room for improvement in terms of the country's climate action and climate protection performance. For years, O'right has pledged to protect the oceans by reducing plastic at the source. Notably, the company made history with the world's first 100 percent traceable renewable plastic bottle and plastic pump, in order to stop plastic waste from ending up in our oceans. Recently, O'right joined RE100 to make a commitment to 100 percent renewable energy by 2025, becoming the first company in Taiwan to make such a pledge. O'right also joined forces with the Taiwan Youth Climate Coalition (TWYCC) to initiate the Climate Leader program, bringing climate issues to campuses in order to inspire a new generation of green ambassadors. ""We have a set of standards that we call the O'right Standard that ensure the carbon neutrality of our products, our organization, and our operations,"" stated Ko. ""O'right's zero-carbon actions and achievements are living proof that environmental protection is neither an impossible nor a difficult task."" Ko concluded by saying, ""Sustainability is just a matter of time. Join us in moving forward towards a zero-carbon future!""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA174","Green Party Says Strengthen the Paris Agreement, Shut Down NATO","December 6, 2019 Friday 8:21 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Green Party issued the following news release: The Green Party of the United States today called for NATO to be shut down and for an expansion of measures in the Paris Climate Agreement in light of the deepening global crisis. The NATO summit and 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) are both taking place this week. Dismantling NATO and redirecting military spending towards a Green New Deal would result both in honoring the US's pledge not to expand NATO and help to drastically reduce the U.S. military's carbon footprint, said Green Party leaders. Greens noted that the 2015 Paris Climate Treaty is inadequate to address the climate change crisis. 195 nations pledged to reduce greenhouse gases. However, the pledges are not mandatory, the treaty does not require a phase-out of fossil fuels, and it delays higher aid levels for poorer nations until 2025. ""What is the point of trusting the governments who sign up to this agreement with one hand while investing ever more in fossil fuel extraction, combustion and consumption with the other? The Green Party's platform demands legally binding commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2020 and a 95% reduction by 2030 over 1990 levels,"" said Tina Rockett, delegate from Virginia to the Green National Committee. ""We need to slash carbon emissions to avoid the threat to end civilization as we know it,"" said Mark Dunlea, the Green Party of New York's 2018 candidate for State Comptroller who ran on divesting that state's $210 billion pension fund from fossil fuels. ""We need an immediate halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure in addition to phasing out existing uses."" The United Nations International Law Commission, citing the effects of war on climate change, adopted 28 draft legal principles on the protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts (PERAC) in August, with the final version to be adopted in 2021. This is especially critical as U.S. Armed Forces, with more than 800 bases in over 70 countries, is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, with a larger carbon footprint than many industrialized nations. In response to U. S. objections to PERAC's ""remnants of war"" framing, which covers obligations to address the ""toxic and hazardous"" effects of armed conflict, the Green Party called for the U.S. to sign the Toronto treaty banning the production, stockpiling, use, and sale of land mines, and assist other nations in unearthing and disabling mines buried in their lands; and also sign the convention that will establish the decrease and inspection of all nations' stockpiles of such weapons, which the U.S. abandoned. ""Why should NATO still exist in 2019? Its purpose ended in 1990 with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Since then, NATO has continued to expand into the former east bloc countries, despite this country's pledge not to do so,"" said Trahern Crews, co-chair of the Green Party of the U.S. In light of recent reports showing that the world might already be beyond the climate-change tipping point, the Green Party has called for a WWII-scale national and international mobilization to halt climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet today. The Green Party's Green New Deal aims to revive the U.S. economy by creating millions of jobs with a transition to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030 and investments in public transit, sustainable agriculture, conservation and restoration of critical infrastructure, including ecosystems. The plan also calls for a Just Transition that would empower and support communities and workers most impacted by climate change and the transition to a peace economy.

At the meetings, Pedro Snchez expressed Spain's firm commitment to lead the fight against climate change, as demonstrated in the offer to host the COP25 and organise it in record time. Pedro Snchez met with Al Gore, the former Vice-President of the United States; Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the United Nations General Assembly; Qu Dongyu, Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); Michael Bloomberg, organiser of the Bloomberg Global Business Forum; the actor Harrison Ford; John Kerry, the former US Secretary of State; and Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President of the European Commission. Pedro Snchez agreed with all of them that we are facing an unprecedented climate emergency and that we cannot only not allow ourselves any delay, but we have to raise our level of ambition and continue to drive the agenda at a global level. Pool Moncloa/Borja Puig de la BellacasaAs he did at the official opening of the conference, Pedro Snchez stressed the need to reach ambitious commitments and a ""reinforced multilateralism"" against the climate emergency, stating that the Government of Spain is moving to achieve the main goals of COP25 , which include agreeing on carbon market rules, reviewing the damage and loss mechanism, and ensuring that all the countries, particularly the emitters, adopt the most ambitious policy. Pedro Snchez also remarked on the importance of collaboration with the private sector, pointing out that we cannot act in isolation if we want to limit the increase in temperatures to 1.5 degrees with respect to pre-industrial levels. ""Economic prosperity and the protection of our planet have to be compatible goals"", he explained. The Acting President of the Government also recalled that Spain is fully involved in compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a contribution of 100 million euros for the Joint SDG Fund over the next five years, as announced in September in New York. He also informed his guests that the Government of Spain is concluding strategic partnership frameworks with four priority agencies: UN Women, concluded in March; the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), concluded in September; and the UN Population Fund and UNICEF, still at the negotiation phase. At his meeting with the former US Vice-President Al Gore, Pedro Snchez analysed the reforestation of the two countries, energy efficiency, future mobility and their impact on job creation. Al Gore valued very positively Spain's Energy and Climate Plan.

The 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 will be hosted in Glasgow from November 9 - November 19, 2020 under the presidency of the UK. (Tolga Akmen/Pool via AP)FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  The head of the European Central Bank said Monday that Europe's top monetary authority is ready to take £ppropriate and targeted measures' if necessary to support the economy against the headwinds from the new coronavirus. Christine Lagarde said in a statement that the virus 'is a fast developing situation which creates risks for the economic outlook.' She said the bank would closely monitor developments and act £s necessary and commensurate with the underlying risks.' Lagarde's remarks come as stock markets have risen in the U.S. on speculation that central banks may step in with action to support the global economy against the disruption caused by the spread of the virus. That is the case even though some economists think central bank action might only have symbolic value, since lower interest rates cannot re-open businesses that have been closed to prevent the spread of the virus. Lower rates can boost stocks, however, and might be used to prevent turmoil on equity markets from spilling over to the wider economy. The ECB has less room to cut than the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Frankfurt, Germany based central bank for the 19 countries that use the euro has already cut a key benchmark, its deposit rate, into negative territory. It stands at minus 0.5 percent. The ECB is also purchasing bonds with newly printed money in an effort to support tepid growth and raise inflation toward more normal levels, the bank's chief mandate. While Lagarde said the ECB was ready to act, she also hedged by saying that any action would be 'commensurate with the underlying risks.' The US Dow Jones index jumped 1,300 points or around 5%. The huge gains clawed back some of the ground lost in a massive sell-off that gave stocks their worst week since the financial crisis of 2008.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA180","RMI INTRODUCES THE CLIMATE FINANCE ACCESS NETWORK AT COP25","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI): By Whitney Mann Caroline Ott COP25 ) in Madrid this week have been buzzing with discussions about the complex challenges posed by climate changeand the equally complex solutions. Finance plays a central role in the debate, particularly for developing countries trying to navigate the maze of finance sources theoretically available to support climate investments. Climate finance providers face a different challenge: the need for more and higher quality investment opportunities in developing countries. The good news? Straightforward, cost-effective solutions are beginning to emerge. This week, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and partners unveiled an innovative intervention to unlock finance in developing countries: adding in-country capacity in the form of highly trained climate finance advisors. In 2020, RMI and partners will launch the Climate Finance Access Network (CFAN), which will ensure that more countries have access to finance experts who are better prepared and better connected to finance institutions. At a panel discussion at the climate conference, RMI partners, including representatives of Antigua and Barbuda, Canada, and Tanzania, as well as the African Adaptation Initiative, Green Climate Fund, and NDC Partnership, outlined the underlying challenges that CFAN seeks to resolve and described how CFAN offers a high-impact, scalable approach to building finance capacity. Why CFAN? Although the volume of climate finance flowing to developing countries has increased substantially over the past decade, the system for delivering and accessing finance has become highly complex. Developing countries looking to secure finance for climate projects face hundreds of public and private finance providers, each with their own investment criteria. As a result, climate finance often takes years to reach actual projects. For example, the Climate Funds Update estimates that of the $29.5 billion in climate finance pledged by multilateral funds between 2003 and 2017, only $5.6 billion has been disbursed. Climate Finance from Multilateral Climate Funds 20032017 While several initiatives have emerged to support developing countries in achieving their climate investment objectives, and several have done so through in-country embedded advisors, these services tend to focus on developing national or sectoral strategies and plans as opposed to project-level financial solutions. Furthermore, existing initiatives tend to work with policy or environmental experts as opposed to financial specialists. As a result, developing countries face a critical gap: the lack of in-country finance expertise to accelerate climate investments. That's where CFAN comes in. What is CFAN? CFAN is a network of international organizations, countries, and donors working together to increase the number and impact of in-country climate finance advisors. CFAN will deliver the training, in-country support, and long-term capacity building needed for countries to more quickly access finance and achieve their climate objectives. Understanding that CFAN is not the first initiative to pursue an embedded advisor approach, the network builds on and accelerates efforts of existing initiatives to ensure complementarity and reduce costs. CFAN further adds value through its focus on finance experts and its unique approach to training and supporting advisors. Within the CFAN structure, existing initiatives will continue to work with countries to recruit and manage advisors, while a coordinating entity will provide additional network services. Specifically, advisors will enroll in a cohort-based ""climate finance bootcamp"" which will include both technical training and relationship building with public and private finance institutions. Once trained, advisors will work in-country for at least one year, and CFAN will provide technical support. Finally, CFAN will draw on advisors to facilitate in-country climate finance workshops for civil servants, ensuring that capacity remains in-country beyond the tenure of the advisor. The African Adaptation Initiative, Global Green Growth Institute, Low Emissions Development Strategies Global Partnership, and NDC Partnership have provided ongoing input to the CFAN design and will participate in its implementation. How Does CFAN Respond to Country Needs? Developing countries have played a central role in shaping CFAN's development. To design a data-driven solution, RMI spent last summer surveying over 100 representatives of 45 countries on the CFAN concept. Specifically, RMI asked country representatives to describe their demand for an advisor and how they envision working with an advisor. The demand assessment revealed overwhelming interest in climate finance advisors, with 86 percent of respondents indicating they were ""very interested"" in working with an advisor. RMI also asked country representatives to describe the types of activities that advisors should undertake. Respondents highlighted project- and program-level activities as priority areas requiring support from an advisor (as opposed to sectoral planning, national planning, and regulatory design). Further, respondents indicated strong preference for advisors with experience in project finance and financial structuring. As a result, CFAN will work with its member initiatives to identify professionals with a track record in project-level finance, recognizing that the job description for the advisor will ultimately be informed by the country's priorities. What's Next? COP25 marked an important milestone toward launching CFAN, with a dynamic panel discussion featuring representatives from several CFAN member institutions. Following the COP, the real work begins as these organizations continue to collaborate to officially launch this program in early 2020. The goal? Thirty advisors working in-country within the next year. Stay tuned. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA181","THE COUNCIL SETS OUT EU POSITION FOR UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN SANTIAGO DE CHILE (COP25)","October 4, 2019 Friday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Union: EU countries have agreed the EU position for the UN climate conference in Santiago de Chile ( COP25 ) The UN Climate Action Summit last week helped bring the issue of climate change to political attention and public scrutiny. The Council stresses that it is now even more important both to work hard to make COP25 a success and deliver concrete results. The EU's priorities for the upcoming negotiations in Santiago include: completing the implementation guidelines for the voluntary cooperation mechanism of the Paris Agreement (article 6), completing the second review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage, completing the review of the Lima work programme on gender, and advancing technical work on the arrangements under the Enhanced Transparency Framework. The conclusions outline the EU's position on these objectives, and deliver a strong political message on the urgent need for enhanced global action, the EU's firm commitment to the multilateral process and its level of ambition. The Council expresses its deep concern at the increasing impact of climate change on the deterioration of global biodiversity and the world's water resources and ecosystems, and at UN reports confirming that Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by parties and current greenhouse gas emission (GHG) trajectories fall far short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. It recognises the strong calls by civil society and citizens, especially youth, for enhanced action and ambition. The Council reiterates the importance of stepping up global climate action. It highlights that the EU continues to successfully decouple its economic growth from its emissions - from 1990 to 2017 the EU's economy grew by 58%, while total GHG emissions decreased by 22%. The EU and its member states are therefore set to overachieve the goal of a 20% GHG reduction domestically by 2020 with existing policies under the EU 2020 climate and energy package. In 2014 the EU committed itself to reducing domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, as its contribution to the Paris Agreement. The EU is the first major economy in the world to take the lead in the green transition and to show the way on implementation of the Paris Agreement by already having in place an ambitious, binding, legislative framework to deliver on its commitment. The EU 2030 renewable energy target has been set at at least 32% and energy efficiency target at at least 32.5%, supported by a reliable governance system. These targets lead to greater greenhouse gas emission reductions than previously foreseen. The EU is currently discussing how to achieve climate neutrality. The Council highlights the importance of the broad, inclusive and extensive societal debate across the EU and its member states. In its conclusions, the Council looks forward to the European Council finalising its guidance on the EU's climate neutral vision before the end of 2019 with a view to the adoption and submission of the EU's long-term strategy to the UNFCCC in early 2020. It calls also on other parties to the Paris Agreement to submit their long-term strategies in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement by 2020. \"

According to the UN, up to 23% of all greenhouse gas emissions derive from the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. However, a myriad of forest-based solutions taking place on the ground show the real and promising results that forests can deliver As President of COP25 , Chile initiated the ""Santiago Call for Action on Forests."" The call highlights the fact that climate change, including increases in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, is impacting terrestrial ecosystems, exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, food systems, infrastructure, human and ecosystem health, and biodiversity. The COP25 Together with improved land management options, forests and trees could provide up to 30% of GHG mitigation required by 2030 to keep the increase in global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, the upper temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. All UN agencies at today's high-level Dialogue committed firmly to the common goal of helping countries to reduce deforestation and improve forest management. The United Nations Forum on Forests, represented by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which serves as the Secretariat of the Forum, highlighted the importance of promoting sustainable management of all types of forests and implementation of the UN Strategic Plan for Forests by 2030: ""Implementation of the UN Strategic Plan for Forests by 2030 will reverse the loss of forests and increase them by 3% globally and will also help eradicate extreme poverty for forest-dependent people. UN DESA, through its work in support of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and the UN Forum on Forests, is committed to playing its vital role in accelerating global efforts to halt deforestation and promoting sustainable management of all types of forests."" Mr. Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations underlined that addressing deforestation requires looking beyond the forest sector to identify the main drivers of deforestation: ""We need to look beyond the forests. To step up action against deforestation and forest degradation, we need to find consensus to agree on reducing footprints of agricultural commodities. We need to work with all stakeholders in supporting global efforts to turn the tide on deforestation."" Mr. QU Dongyu, Director-General. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification explained the concept of land-degradation neutrality to help countries identify and address the drivers of deforestation in a robust way: ""Halting deforestation and restoring degraded forests are global imperatives. Land Degradation Neutrality SDG Target 15.3 provides the robust framework needed to keep land, including forests, healthy and resilient over the long haul, which in turn will keep food, energy, carbon and biodiversity in balance. Restoring degraded lands means better lives and income for farmers and herders and for women and youth, and less pressure to migrate to cities."" Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary. The Global Environment Facility emphasized the need for transformative action that connects sustainable activities across different sectors, in particular, land-use and food: ""Faced with growing rates of global deforestation, there is an urgent need to transform economic systems related to food and land use. The new four-year GEF-7 strategy reflects this with a focus on harnessing the existing and emerging multi-stakeholder platforms committed to sustainability, which include important global companies from the food sector."" Ms. Naoko Ishii, CEO and Chairperson. The United Nations Environment Programme agreed with the strong need for action, and highlighted several areas for the implementation of solutions: ""We need to focus on nature-positive agriculture; clean up our supply-chains; adopt sustainable consumption and production methods; partner with the private sector and put a price on carbon. And the good news is that there is much greater awareness about the state of our forests than ever before and when we build leadership in one place, we will witness a race to the top to save our planet's forests."" Ms. Inger Andersen, Executive Director The United Nations Development Programme stressed the need to implement the existing REDD+ framework to reduce deforestation effectively and raise ambition in NDCs: ""Supporting countries to tackle deforestation is an essential component of climate action and thus of UNDP's Climate Promise. REDD+ is a ""ready to go"" nature-based solution. And the UN-REDD Programme provides a platform for the UN to support countries to raise their nature-based NDC ambition."" Mr. Achim Steiner, Administrator. Regarding implementation on the ground, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change added: ""The agreement on the REDD+ framework was a milestone. It gives a clear direction on how countries, civil society and the private sector can collaborate to reduce deforestation. While it's only a starting point, its strength is its flexibility. Each country can adapt it to its national circumstances and enhance implementation over time especially by including REDD+ activities in their NDCs."" Ms. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary. Addressing deforestation is an issue that is a concern throughout the UN organization and for millions throughout the world. All UN agencies emphasized their readiness to support countries in their efforts to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, building on existing efforts to provide technical and financial support, and working together as partners. Trust-building through the UNFCCC transparency framework will remain vital for collaboration on this important matter. Finally, it was also highlighted that reducing deforestation requires an effort by all stakeholders, engaging local communities and indigenous peoples, women and youth, civil society and the private sector, as well as producers and consumers. \"

Recognising that climate change is an existential threat with far-reaching consequences upon all aspects of human life, including development, peace and prosperity, the SI's Commission for a Sustainable World Society established in 2006, worked intensively to develop a social democratic response to the challenge of climate change. The commission report, ""From a High Carbon Economy to a Low Carbon Society"", was published in September 2009 and its conclusions remain pertinent to this day. In the decade since that report, climate change has remained at the heart of the agenda of the SI, as a major theme of Congress, Council and Presidium meetings. The SI has been present at major summits on climate change and sustainable development, including most recently the United Nations Secretary General's Climate Action Summit in September 2019, and sought to coordinate a common approach to be undertaken by its member parties based on the fundamental principle of climate justice. The Presidium of the SI, meeting shortly after the summit, underlined the extent to which socialist and social democratic parties continue to be at the forefront of global efforts to take all necessary steps to avert catastrophic climate change. In conjunction with COP25 , the SI will, as on previous occasions, bring together environment ministers from the social democratic family for exchanges and discussions on their priorities and expectations. Last year, on the eve of COP24 in Katowice, 94 leaders of the Socialist International signed an open letter with 'A global call for a sustainable world society before it's too late', published on 30 November 2018. During the past year, it has become ever more clear that the current level of action is not sufficient. Despite the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, there has been no reduction in the concentration of greenhouses gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, or even a slowdown in the rate at which this is increasing. According to the most recent report of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global concentration of CO2 increased to yet another high 407.8 parts per million (ppm) in 2018, having first crossed the symbolic 400 ppm benchmark in 2015. This trend is confirmed by the UN Emissions Gap Report 2019, which describes a rise in GHG emissions of 1.5% per year over the last decade, reaching a record high of 55.5 gigatonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide (GtCO2e) in 2018. This collective failure to stop the growth in GHG emissions has severe consequences, as for each year of postponed peaking, deeper and faster actions are now required. At the time of publishing, the report calculated that 2030 emissions would need to be 55% lower than 2018 to put the world on the least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to below 1.5C. However, global emissions are not estimated to peak before 2030 if current climate policies and ambition levels of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are maintained, by which time the narrowing window of opportunity to take the necessary action to prevent catastrophic global heating will have firmly closed. The science has long been clear, and the evidence continues to mount that actions are not matching up to ambitions when it comes to reducing GHG emissions. Human activities are estimated to have already caused approximately 1.0C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and if it continues to increase at the current rate, warming is likely to reach 1.5C between 2030 and 2052, according to the recent Special Report of the IPCC on the impacts of global warming of 1.5C. The need to restrict global warming to an absolute maximum of 1.5C is clear. Climate models project a significant difference as a result of limiting warming to 1.5C as opposed to 2.0C, when it comes to increases in mean temperature, hot extremes in most inhabited regions and risks from heavy precipitation events in several regions, and droughts and precipitation deficits in some regions. In short, with an increase of 2.0C, extreme weather events become much more probable. Just this year, we have witnessed the devastating cost of storms, floods, droughts and extreme heat, which all too often bring destruction and loss of life to those least able to deal with the consequences, and who bear least responsibility for the climate emergency. We know the challenge is immense. The IPCC outlines that pathways limiting global warming to 1.5C require unprecedented systems transitions in terms of scale, in energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems. All sectors need to contribute with deep emissions reductions and a significant upscaling of investments. As outlined by the UN Secretary General at this year's Climate Action Summit, the climate emergency is a race we are currently losing. Although the summit was significant in gathering together government leaders, business and civil society actors to increase momentum and impetus in tackling the climate crisis and a number of important pledges were made, more political will and deeper commitments are needed if the race is to be won. Today, as the COP25 Summit begins in Madrid, the Socialist International calls on the international community to build on the Paris Agreement and the pledges made at the Climate Action Summit to raise the ambition of the NDC targets and long-term strategies for all countries, in particular the major carbon polluters, in order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. More than this, a commitment is needed to immediate action to secure the urgent emissions cuts that need to occur in the next couple of years in order to have a chance to limit global heating warming to 1.5C. To this end, the Socialist International strongly advocates action to tackle subsidies for fossil fuels, implement taxes on carbon, and end new coal power beyond 2020. We are living in a climate emergency, which can only be addressed through unprecedented multilateral cooperation by governments, business and civil society. For the future of our planet and the well-being of the generations to come, failure is not an option. \"

In the letter, Senator Murray sounded the alarm on the dangerous, growing impacts of the climate crisis and the damage that will be inflicted on current and future generations unless immediate action is taken. Senator Murray also warned the President against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue, and admonished him for failing to honor his commitment to work with Democrats to renegotiate the Paris Climate Accord or to craft a new deal to address the climate crisis. The letter comes as the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference takes place in Madrid this week. Senator Murray wrote, ""As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs."" Additionally, the letter emphasized the national security implications related to the President's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, underscoring the damage done to the United States' reputation by going back on an international commitment. Senator Murray's letter further illustrates the outcry from Washingtonians and Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks. Senator Murray concluded the letter by reminding the President of the overwhelming number of Americans who believe the United States should participate in the Paris Climate Agreement - three out of every four registered voters - or 77 percent.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA186","World Resources Institute Issues Statement on Conclusion of COP25","December 15, 2019 Sunday 7:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Resources Institute issued the following statement: At the UN climate negotiations in Madrid ( COP25 ), countries made little progress to resolve outstanding rules for implementing the Paris Agreement, but they did send some signals for countries to strengthen their national climate commitments next year. The delegates left several important decisions unresolved that will need to be taken up next year. Following is a statement from Helen Mountford, Vice President for Climate and Economics, World Resources Institute: ""There is no sugarcoating it: The negotiations fell far short of what was expected. Instead of leading the charge for more ambition, most of the large emitters were missing in action or obstructive. This reflects how disconnected many national leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens. They need to wake up in 2020. ""The can-do spirit that birthed the Paris Agreement feels like a distant memory today. Next year will be a key test. The final decision urges countries to ""consider"" the gap between current ambition and where we should be, and to reflect this in the national commitments they put forward in 2020. While this language should have been stronger, it is an important signal that countries must heed. ""Despite a year of deliberation and a final push over the last couple of days, delegates were not able to agree to rules around international carbon markets. Given the high risks of loopholes discussed in Madrid, it was better to delay than accept rules that would have compromised the integrity of the Paris Agreement. ""Developed countries failed to provide sufficient assurance that they would mobilize adequate and predictable finance for vulnerable countries to respond to climate impacts. This resulted in acrimonious negotiations on loss and damage finance and on how to assess progress on the goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020. The door remains open for more progress on these issues in the future. ""There were some important signs of leadership. Eighty countries, mainly the smaller and most vulnerable ones, have committed to ratchet up their climate ambition in 2020. And encouragingly a few major emitters -- including the European Union and Canada -- have started to move in the right direction. ""The demand for action is loud and clear outside the negotiation halls, where a wave of youth activists, city leaders, CEOs, investors, and others are hungry for a global transformation that responds to the climate crisis. Nearly 400 cities, over 780 businesses and 16 investors, with over $4 trillion in assets, have committed to net zero targets by 2050. But we cannot push off action into the future. Now is the time for countries to step up. ""Major emitters need to deliver more ambitious national climate commitments well ahead of the UN climate talks in Glasgow. We need to rebuild the trust and conviction that the global climate crisis deserves. Only with decisive leadership will we have a chance of achieving the vision of the Paris Agreement.

The discussion and visits to local shellfish growers and government ministries organized by Ocean Conservancy will provide an opportunity for an exchange of knowledge between growers, scientists, and government officials from Chile on ocean acidification and its impacts. Shellfish growers from Washington state to Chile feel the harmful impacts of ocean acidification. Acidification hinders the health and growth of shellfish, corals and some fish species. Ocean acidification is a change in seawater chemistry caused by the ocean absorbing carbon emissions, turning it more acidic. Coastal runoff and waste can also increase acidification in coastal waters. This knowledge exchange will provide a space to share experiences and knowledge so that we may collectively address the harmful impacts of ocean acidification. Washington state enjoys a special working partnership with Chile founded around a Memorandum of Understanding between the two governments. As part of this partnership, the two parties cooperate with each other on actions around shared areas of interest including ocean acidification along with disaster risk reduction and their energy sectors and economies.

The Partnership will provide technical assistance to countries to design, pilot and implement carbon pricing and market instruments. It will support the direct implementation of carbon pricing in at least 10 developing countries and help a further 20 countries get ready to do so. ""Well-designed carbon pricing instruments can be a transformative part of the climate action toolkit. Over half of countries worldwide are thinking about how carbon pricing can help them meet their climate targets"", said Laura Tuck, Vice President of Sustainable Development, World Bank . ""This Partnership can help countries wanting to encourage climate action through strong carbon markets to get this right, building on what we know works, sharing experiences and best practices, and helping them ensure their citizens are on board with new policies."" The Partnership is a response to increased demand for carbon pricing implementation support and knowledge exchange. It builds on the success of the World Bank's long-standing program, the Partnership for Market Readiness, that has provided targeted technical assistance on carbon pricing to over 20 emerging economies and developing countries, collectively accounting for over 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The Partnership is expected to begin operations in July 2020 when it anticipates having reached US$100 million in capitalization and, over its 10-year program, will have a total capitalization target of US$250 million. Germany's Minister for the Environment, Svenja Schulze said, ""The PMI is well-positioned to step-up the climate action agenda to the next level of ambition for reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement. Thus, I am pleased to announce for Germany a pledge of 10 million Euros [US$11 million] to the program."" The Partnership aims to: Support countries and jurisdictions in the development and implementation of carbon pricing instruments; Assist countries to cooperate with each other, via the operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; Help countries identify and implement best practices and, where relevant, achieve compatibility with other countries' carbon pricing and markets; Inform national and international policy discussions on carbon pricing, including by providing a platform for collective innovation on instruments; and Develop a comprehensive knowledge base and facilitate information exchange on carbon pricing instruments and proven market mechanisms. ### Quotes from Partners: ""As a recipient of the PMR technical assistance, Vietnam has not only benefited from the capacity built in the country for carbon market instrument, but the PMR has also provided a great platform for knowledge sharing and exchange with many other countries. As we now move towards consolidating our strategy on NDC implementation including use of carbon pricing tools, a program like the PMI is very timely and relevant"". Tra n Ha\'bb""ng H , Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Vietnam ""Spain was an early supporter of PMR, which we believe has provided a strong foundation for developing carbon pricing and markets in many countries. Therefore, it is gratifying to see this program take the next ambitious step of raising the bar on implementing a meaningful and fair price on carbon. As COP25 host, we are proud to endorse this initiative and look forward to working with the World Bank and partner countries to support this agenda."" Teresa Ribera, Minister for the Ecological Transition, Spain ""The Government of Canada has already begun implementing our climate plan that includes over 50 different measures. A central part of our plan involves putting a price on pollution and rebating the money back to families. Here at COP25 , Canada is proud to work with other supporters of pricing pollution to help grow the international momentum for this important policy tool, and for other financial tools that help fight climate change. This new Partnership lead by the World Bank will help to advance job creation and emissions reductions in developing countries."" Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Notes to Editors: 23 countries have benefited from technical assistance under the Partnership for Market Readiness. They are: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam. The Partnership for Market Implementation, which will be operational from July 2020, will help countries move from readiness to rollout of carbon pricing, while supporting new countries that are exploring how carbon pricing can support low-carbon development pathways. \"

Launched on the sidelines of this year's United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP 25 ) in Madrid, the partnership seeks to promote a market-based approach for reducing carbon emissions in the aviation industry globally. Leveraging ICC's extensive global network and Perlin's domain expertise in distributed technology for enterprise, the partnership will seek to facilitate global adoption of the AirCarbon Exchange which is the world's first blockchain based distribution and trading network for CORSIA compliant carbon credits. CORSIA, International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, was signed in Montreal in 2016 by 191 countries. The announcement comes as CORSIA sets to start in 2021 with 80 countries representing more than 77% of international air traffic voluntarily agreeing to commit to more fuel-efficient aircraft, new direct flight paths, the use of biofuels, and other sustainability measures. As CORSIA continues to expand and shape the aviation industry, the partnership will seek to advance blockchain-backed carbon credit schemes to mitigate future liabilities for people and planet. Once implemented, the CORSIA initiative is expected to provide more than USD $40 billion in funding for climate projects and offset more than 2.6 billion tonnes of C02 emissions between 2021 and 2035. The partnership has come at a significant moment in history as industry-led initiatives seek to address the growing climate crisis before emissions reach a critical tipping point for irreversible and catastrophic global temperature rises. Based on the substantial growth in commercial air traffic forecast by IATA (with passenger numbers doubling by 2037), the aviation industry alone could consume up to a quarter of the total global carbon budget for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C by 2050. The partners will seek to directly address the threat posed by significant and growing emissions from aviation by facilitating the efficient and economic sourcing and trade of credible carbon offsets for the aviation industry. ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO said: On the role of blockchain technology to support greater sustainability, Perlin Chief Executive Officer of Perlin, Dorjee Sun said that: ""Carbon and putting a value on the environment is a personal mission for me and distributed ledger technology is well suited to overcome some of the trust, double counting, and governance challenges of carbon provenance and markets. AirCarbon and ICC will be partnering with our practical blockchain infrastructure to build the digital commodity exchange platform of the future. This new partnership will showcase how blockchain can be used in the real-world to support more inclusive, efficient and sustainable marketplaces."" On carbon offset adoption, co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of AirCarbon William Pazos said: ""As society moves towards a carbon constrained economy our technology coupled with ICC's reach will accelerate carbon offset adoption. The key to promoting carbon offsets as a viable tool to tackle climate change is to eliminate market friction. That is our contribution at AirCarbon. Working with ICC we look to make our solution available to all responsible corporate citizens.""

Ahead of the UN COP25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid 2-13 December, the Parliament on Thursday approved a resolution declaring a climate and environmental emergency in Europe and globally. They also want the Commission to ensure that all relevant legislative and budgetary proposals are fully aligned with the objective of limiting global warming to under 1.5 C. In a separate resolution, Parliament urges the EU to submit its strategy to reach climate neutrality as soon as possible, and by 2050 at the latest, to the UN Convention on Climate Change. MEPs also call on the new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to include a 55% reduction target of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in the European Green Deal. Step up global emission reductions for aviation and shipping MEPs say that current aviation and shipping ambitions fall short of the necessary emissions reductions. All countries should include emissions from international shipping and aviation in their national contributions plans (NDCs), they say, and urge the Commission to propose that the maritime sector be included in the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS). More financial support to fight climate change EU countries should at least double their contributions to the international Green Climate Fund, Parliament says. EU member states are the largest providers of public climate finance and the EU's budget should fully comply with its international commitments. They also note that pledges by developed countries do not meet the collective goal of 100 billion USD per year as of 2020. Finally, they urgently call on all EU countries to phase out all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies by 2020.

AOSIS has been calling for increased emissions reductions here at COP25 , as well as action to compensate small island nations and other vulnerable countries for the loss and damage they are already experiencing from climate impacts. The young people participating in the press conference this afternoon emphasized the need for island leaders and youth to come together in order to fight for climate justice. Brianna Fruean, with 350 Samoa and the Pacific Climate Warriors, said that it was critical to remember that some nations here at the COP are fighting for their survival. ""We also need to be highlighting the great leadership that is coming out of COP. It's coming from the islands,"" she said. ""World leaders need to know that people like me are watching them.

""I come here not because I'm scared-I'm scared-but I come here because I have hope that we can work together. We don't have anything to lose if we work together. If anything, we can create a much more beautiful world."" Ambassador Felson ended the press conference by reflecting on island leadership inside and outside the UN Climate process and the need to work with young people to build the political pressure necessary for change. Beyond the process, there is a lot of action occurring, but without a doubt, our action alone will not deliver the type of ambitious results we need to achieve a 1.5 world. We absolutely need the major developed countries who have contributed significantly to what we have now, we need them to raise their ambition. We know that even at 1.5 , all of the islands represented on this podium will still be feeling the impacts of climate change. We will need significantly scaled up support to ensure that we can have resilient infrastructure, resilient homes, so that we can face the consequences.""

But what exactly is a 'feminist' foreign policy? Following more than a year of global consultation and research[4] on the world's handful of existing feminist foreign policies, the International Center for Research on Women[5] has established a working definition[6] for government policy that 'prioritizes gender equality and enshrines the human rights of women and other traditionally marginalized groups, allocates significant resources to achieve that vision and seeks through its implementation to disrupt patriarchal and male-dominated power structures across all of its levers of influence (aid, trade, defense and diplomacy), informed by the voices of feminist activists, groups and movements.' By our measure, the Mexican government has laid out a foundation for what is emerging as a global gold standard. 'Mexico is determined to move forward a progressive foreign policy,' said Cristopher Ballinas Valds, the director-general for human rights and democracy at the Mexican foreign ministry, 'with a main focus on promoting human rights, equality, and women's rights. The feminist foreign policy is based on five principles that rule all foreign-policy activities.' Those five principles include: conducting all aspects of foreign policy with the intent to advance gender equality and a feminist agenda; achieving gender parity at all levels of staff in the foreign ministry; combatting all forms of gender-based violence, including within the ministry; making equality visible; and practicing intersectional feminism, which is to say, an approach that values not only women's rights but also other intersecting social, economic, and environmental justice issues. The government of Mexico has opted for a very broad vision for what its policy would achieve not simply the advancement of women, but also the fulfilment of rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people (the Mexican foreign ministry participated[7] in Mexico City's pride march for the first time last year) and the advancement of broader social and economic justice initiatives. Quoting[8] work by the International Center for Research on Women, the policy explicitly obligates Mexican leadership to advance 'issues that others are not prioritizing,' including sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as climate change. Given the prevalence of gender-based violence and femicide[9] in Mexico, the new policy marks a welcome change of pace. With the policy, according to Ballinas Valds, 'Mexico will pay justice to a long overdue agenda on women's and girls' rights.' This is the first time such an overt women's rights agenda has been advanced in Mexican foreign policy, and officials inside the ministry have indicated that the establishment of a gender-balanced cabinet in President Andrs Manuel L\'f3pez Obrador's administration went a long way toward enabling such change. Mexico's feminist foreign policy commits to an ambitious number of immediate actions across all five areas of engagement, stipulating precise timelines by which they are to be achieved. Trainings, workshops, working groups, and manuals are to be developed and deployed within the first year. By 2024, the government is aiming for full employment parity, equal pay, and the application of a gender lens to every foreign-policy position, resolution, and mandate. This is a tall order and one that will undoubtedly encounter resistance. But if past is prologue, Mexico seems positioned to excel. The new policy's antecedents have already been shaping Mexico's behavior internally and on the world stage. Case in point, Mexico took a clear leadership position[10] at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 [11]) held last month in Spain, where the government promoted gender equality as a nonnegotiable component of any agreement on climate change. '[Mexico is] simply one of the few countries that comes to the table with gender equality and human rights as a red line,' said conference attendee Bridget Burns, a climate activist and the executive director of the Women's Environment and Development Organization. 'Many other actors say it's a priority for them, but Mexico showed real strength in not letting these principles become bargaining chips in a process that often dwindles issues down to the lowest common denominator.' The lowest common denominator appeared to be the likely outcome of COP25 at one point, as countries worked together to exclude activists from the negotiations and even locked a number of activists and indigenous women out of in the cold. But Mexican negotiators made sure feminist climate activists had a seat at the table and led a process that ultimately developed a Gender Action Plan[12], one of the only tangible outcomes in a conference that otherwise 'fell short[13]' of meaningful progress on climate initiatives. 'Having witnessed Mexico championing human rights and gender equality in the context of the U.N. climate negotiations, it's exciting to see the launch of this feminist foreign policy, principled on an intersectional feminist approach,' Burns said. 'We know that to be truly 'feminist,' foreign policy must understand gender equality in the context of all issues, from environment and trade, to peace and economy. We look forward to seeing Mexico put these words into action, and to serving as inspiration for other governments, particularly given their leadership in the upcoming Beijing+25 Generation Equality Forum.' That forum[14] marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, watershed agreements outlining women's human rights. It also marks the first major multilateral test of Mexico's new foreign policy. Mexico and France, which has also recently announced but not yet released a feminist foreign policy, will be co-hosting a 'champions only' progressive, multilateral space, where heads of state from progressive countries will gather to make commitments to the next generation of women's rights issues. The path forward will not be an easy one. Retrogressive foreign policies, including that of the United States, have instilled little trust in some governments to advance and protect[15] the women's rights standards laid out 25 years ago. But if Mexico's level of ambition and the growing number of countries turning their eyes on their own foreign policies are signs of what is to come, the momentum may be just enough to carry this movement forward. 'It's very encouraging to see,' said Kristina Lunz, a co-founder of the Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy[16], 'that with Mexico the first global south country presented a feminist foreign policy. In international circles, there still tends to be this biased perception that industrial countries such as Germany would be leading on topics of social justice and equality but especially when it comes to feminism in foreign policy, Germany and others can learn lots from Mexico.'

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA193","World Wind Energy Association: COP25 - Leading Renewable Associations Urge Policy Makers to Increase Ambition","December 17, 2019 Tuesday 8:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The World Wind Energy Association issued the following news release:    - Leading renewable associations urge policy makers to increase ambition - REN Alliance Side Event on Renewable Technologies Working Together    The leading global renewable energy industry associations have sent a clear signal to the UNFCCC negotiators about the crucial role of renewable energy technologies at the recently concluded COP25 climate conference in Madrid, Spain. Convening at an official side event, speakers from REN Alliance informed the gathered delegates about the latest technological developments of renewable energies and the immense potential offered by these technologies to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Laura Williamson from REN21 was the keynote speaker at the side event and the main message was the need for a global shift from an electricity transformation to an energy system transformation considering the fact that apart the progress of renewable energy technologies is quite slow in heating, cooling and transport sectors. The speech also focused on the need for removing fossil fuel subsidies, adoption of carbon pricing, aligning policies across sectors, understanding the important role of cities and the role of data to better inform policy makers. Representing the International Solar Energy Society (ISES), Dr. Jose Gonzalez Aguilar highlighted the significant drop in costs of renewable energy generation - especially solar PV. Dr. Jose highlighted the opportunities for solar heating and cooling along with solar electricity for transport sectors. Marit Brommer from International Geothermal Association (IGA) urged the delegates to move the discussion towards non electricity sectors and geothermal promotes policy measures for heating and cooling sectors. Renewable technologies work towards the SDG 7 of UN, and that geothermal is relevant to many other goals including SDG 9, SDG 11 and SDG 12 etc. The International Hydropower Association (IHA) representative was Mathis Rogner who highlighted the role of hydropower in developing the renewable energy deployment. It is crucial for policy makers to raise ambition in their national commitments and hydropower contribution is expected to grow substantially globally. Mathis highlighted case studies where hydropower and renewable technologies working together to have mutual benefits and increase resilience. Finally, Remigijus Lapinskas from World Bioenergy Association highlighted that the world is moving away from the Paris goals towards a point of no return. Bioenergy offers sustainable and renewable options for heating and transport sectors and that agricultural residues to energy could be the next revolution in the bioenergy sector. After the panel speeches, the panelists had an opportunity to respond to queries from the audience. In the end, the key messages from the panelists to the policy makers gathered in Madrid was:  Make efforts in increasing renewable energy penetration in the electricity grid  Leadership in policy instruments moving beyond electricity toward energy sector  Form markets rewarding power system flexibility  Stop financing and subsidizing fossil fuels and increase investments in RE technologies All the panelists highlighted the importance of all renewable energy stakeholders including REN Alliance, REN21, IRENA etc. to work together to promote at 100% renewable energy mix. Stefan Gsanger, Secretary General of the World Wind Energy Association, commented from the distance: ""Clearly, the COP25 in Madrid has not achieved what we would have liked to see. This underlines the need to act on the ground, on the local and on the national level. Hand in hand with the new climate movement, the renewable energy community is prepared to reinforce the urgently needed momentum and to do the steps that are necessary for a 100% renewable energy world.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA194","The Time for Action Is Now, the Time for Trees Is Now","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Mar 18, 2020( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com United Nations Climate Change Conference during the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 )[1] in Madrid, Spain. The Foundation's featured event at COP25 was Forest Restoration: Climate Offense for Business[2]. With the negative impacts[3] of climate change already being felt around the world and reported on daily, the theme of COP25 was 'Time for Action.' Listed below are 10 key takeaways the Foundation has distilled over the last few years, and discussed at COP25 , that make forest restoration an essential part of the total climate solution for 2020 and beyond.10 Takeaways for Facilitating Global Forest Restoration at-Scale 1. There is tremendous momentum for natural climate solutions[4] (NCS) and reforestation in particular, with a proliferation of new global, regional, and local tree planting and forest restoration initiatives over the last few years - Bonn Challenge, African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative, Trillion Trees, 1t.org and many more. Tree planting resonates with people. Scientifically, reforestation also has the most global climate mitigation potential in comparison to all other natural climate solutions. However, forest restoration is getting the least amount of investment. Protecting intact forest and wetland landscapes, improving forest management for working timberlands, and enhancing soil carbon in agriculture are vitally important defensive climate strategies to avoid additional carbon emissions and to maintain some balance in the global carbon cycle (forests and oceans currently absorb about half of global carbon emissions[5]). Now, it is time to go on climate offense by utilizing forests' proven natural ability to remove and store carbon at-scale. It's a simple equation. The right trees in the right places equal more carbon stored. 'For the first time in 2019, we saw very clearly a significant uptick in demand for natural climate solutions, thanks in large part to a surge in corporate ambition. After nearly a decade and a half of Ecosystem Marketplace's tracking of carbon markets, we see forestry and land-use offsets - for example, transactions of tree planting offsets increased 342% from 2016 - push voluntary markets to near-record highs. We're past the point where reducing emissions is enough. We need negative emissions to stay below 1.5 degrees of warming. Natural climate solutions offer us that path.' -Stephen Donofrio, Director, Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace and Supply Change Initiatives2. Investments into forests must occur concurrently or in-addition-to decarbonizing the economy. To establish credibility and integrity, investments into natural climate solutions must be a part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce and avoid direct and indirect GHG emissions, while not being an excuse to continue business-as-usual. 'Reforestation, regeneration, and afforestation are going to play a crucial role in achieving nature's potential to be the planet's 'superpower' to help deal with climate change - in addition to, and not instead of all the other hard and urgent work on decarbonizing the economy and our ways of living. Restoring landscapes doesn't just offer the potential to sequester significant amounts of CO2; it also will be a game-changer for rural livelihoods, watershed protection, and biodiversity."" -Duncan van Bergen, VP of Nature Based Solutions at Shell(3) The work to restore forests and other critical ecosystems is just beginning. But a shared vision and ambition is becoming clearer[6] because of science-based consensus building through our strategic partners like Forest Trends, NCS Alliance[7], IETA[8], and ICROA[9]. The world is no longer searching for silver-bullet solutions. Instead, there is a clear pivot underway towards more holistic, practical collaborations that leverage a range of existing and emerging technologies[10]. 'We have always tried to incubate a variety of different approaches to forest restoration in our projects around the world and be partnership-oriented and entrepreneurial, so projects are successful. We've done forest carbon offsets with the Surui indigenous community in Brazil, climate-smart cocoa in Ghana, and a water security-driven approach in Peru. We need to be able to design projects that are locally appropriate but understand how they roll up into the bigger picture in terms of global restoration.' -Michael Jenkins, CEO and Founding President, Forest Trends(4) It is time to take the climate conversation beyond carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions to emphasize all the other co-benefits forests provide[11]; clean air and water to support all forms of life, restored habitats to promote biodiversity, economic empowerment to people living in rural parts of the world, improved human health outcomes, etc. How do we adequately price and attribute claims to all the other stacked benefits when trees are planted? Answers can be provided with the integration of unique monitoring, reporting, and verification technologies like Microsoft's AI for Earth[12] and other commodity-centric traceability tools like Farm Trace[13]. Nevertheless, we need to be social-conscious when implementing these technologies in developing parts of the world where people need economic opportunities, not robots and algorithms. (5) Connecting people to trees and their environments. Forest restoration is not just about improving the environment. It must be about empowering people and revitalizing communities by reestablishing the connection people and communities intrinsically have to nature. When these fundamental connections are explicit and properly valued, it will ensure humanities' ability to create and nurture. Over 1.5 billion people[14] directly depend on forests for their livelihoods. All humans depend on forests and nature to sustain human life. The awesome power of public £rt plus purpose'can reconnect communities withnature's life-sustaining ecosystems. On the sidelines of COP 25 in Madrid, we painted two GreenPoint EARTH murals withartist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada[15] toinspire and guide local citizens and global audiencestowards nature-based climate action through the beauty of forests and indigenous people.This workwouldn't have been possible withoutsupport fromArbor Day and other supporters, including NWF-International, UNFCCC, and the City and Community of Madrid.' - Stephen Donofrio, Founder, GreenPoint Innovations(6) Climate change is a risk to the continuity of complex global supply chains, but there is also a societal risk to the bottom-line, which is the license to do business. Many industries, especially in the land-use sector, are already experiencing significant disruptions to their supply chains[16] because of extreme fires, floods, droughts, etc. However, increasingly conscious consumers and employees are pressuring companies and brands to take more ambitious climate actions. Companies and brands that respond authentically are rewarded with customer loyalty and community respect. If sustainable business practices are not saving your business money or creating new market opportunities, you are doing it wrong. When your company or brand is doing the right thing, it is also important to let the world know about it to inspire others. (7) The role of policy cannot be overlooked. Responsible, science-based public and private sector policy ultimately drive scale and can help soften large economic transitions in labor, land-use, education, and behavior. New policy can be a political risk initially. But it can also be an opportunity to economically empower rural parts of the world that have been left out of the story of economic prosperity that has grown over the last five decades. Genuinely lifting-up our fellow humans on the lower end of the economic ladder creates more prosperity and less conflict for us all. 'Forest Trends started looking at the policy side when we realized that great conservation projects have a very hard time competing against illegal logging and illegal forest conversion for agriculture because the latter are so lucrative. Illegal activities also usually come hand-in-hand with human rights abuses and corruption. Forest countries need to have strong policy, transparency, and civilian oversight in place, or the conservation piece won't work.' -Michael Jenkins, CEO and Founding President, Forest Trends(8) 'Cooperation and collaboration' are key to addressing challenges of transitioning from a patchwork, individual project-level approach to a holistic landscape-level approach. Ashley Allen, Senior Manager-Climate and Land at Mars Incorporated, emphasized the importance of having harmony with the communities and individuals directly impacted by land degradation. From the start, when landscape interventions are designed, all stakeholders need to be at the table to decide how benefits will be shared. This holistic, humble approach may be slow initially. However, in the long run, this creates long-term security and prosperity for communities living in the landscape and for private sector supply chain commodities by balancing overall ecosystem needs with the present climate realities. (9) Setting Science Based Targets (SBTi)[17] help companies evaluate various options for restoring forests because the SBTi process forces companies to recognize what is material to business as it relates to sustainability. Science and business can coexist. Look at the growing list[18] of profitable, innovative companies that are aligning their business goals to a low carbon future by setting science based targets. The Foundation works with our corporate and strategic partners to help influence and evolve how major corporate sustainability/climate disclosure and reporting platforms, like SBTi[19], Greenhouse Gas Protocol[20], CDP[21], etc., integrate the forestry carbon market and NCS value/supply chain investments into their frameworks. (10) The worst thing we can do is wait. We are getting close to irreversible tipping points. Many experts and scientists think that we may have already done irreversible damage to ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest. If forest restoration is to fulfill its part of the total climate solution and be aligned to key Paris Agreement targets - 2030 (cutting global emissions in half), 2040 (cutting global emissions in half again), and 2050 (net-zero global emissions), we have to build out the infrastructure, plant, manage, and monitor in the 2020s. We are quickly running out of time to keep the Paris Agreement goals viable, and we only have one chance to get the forest part right. It is time to accelerate the restoration revolution. Forest restoration work cannot happen without trusted and unique partnerships. The Arbor Day Foundation is grateful to have amazing partners and allies. It is time to heal the world's forests, wetlands, agricultural, and ocean assets. The healing that will come from these activities will not only restore natural ecosystems, but we will heal ourselves and the debilitating political, moral, economic, and social divisions that impede each human's pursuit of connection, belonging, and happiness. The time for action is now. The Time for Trees[22] is now.

The 2-week-long conference yielded very few tangible outcomes related to addressing climate change. Here's what to know about COP25 and its disappointing conclusion, by the numbers. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The 25th iteration of the United Nations' biggest annual conference on climate change, COP25 , came to an end on Sunday in Madrid, Spain. But despite a year of increased climate cognizance worldwide  led in part by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg  the 13 days of negotiations yielded few tangible outcomes. ""I am disappointed with the results of COP25 ,"" Ant\'f3nio Guterres, UN secretary general, tweeted[2] as talks closed. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation, and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up."" Delegates arrived in Madrid on December 3 with the intention of solidifying the legislative ""operating manual"" for how to achieve the goals set in the Paris climate agreement. The Paris agreement, established in 2015, is a voluntary accord between 200 countries to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. But recent research has revealed that meeting those objectives is becoming more and more challenging, especially given that President Donald Trump has initiated the process of pulling the US out of the accord. Limiting warming seems even more difficult given the lack of progress made at COP25  the world's biggest emitters failed to sign onto any binding emissions reduction agreement. Critics pointed to the final declaration's weak language, which cited only an ""urgent need"" to close the gap between the world's current path and the Paris agreement goals. Here's what to know about the climate conference, by the numbers. Number of participating nations in the COP conference: 190 Number of delegates who went to Madrid for the two-week proceedings: 27,000Number of years COP has been held annually: 25 Cost of putting on the event: an estimated $100 million dollars Number of hours COP proceedings went past their scheduled conclusion[3]: 44 Number of people who marched in Madrid on Friday to demand climate justice: 500,000 Number of protestors kicked out of the conference venue:about 200[4] Truckloads full of horse manure dumped outside COP25 by protesters with the Extinction Rebellion group: 1 (It was accompanied by the message: ""The horseshit stops here."")Number of miles between the conference's original location, Santiago, Chile, and Madrid: 6,646 (On November 1, the UN moved the conference to avoid protests and riots at the Chilean capital.)

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA196","COP25 - EIB and Iberdrola Sign Two Financing Agreements for EUR 690m for Renewable Energy Projects in Brazil and New Digitalisation of Electrical Networks","December 5, 2019 Thursday 7:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Investment Bank issued the following news release: At the Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) being held in Madrid, the EIB and Iberdrola today announced two new agreements to promote climate action by investing in renewable energy projects and electricity distribution networks. To do so, the Vice-President of the EU bank Emma Navarro and the President of Iberdrola Ignacio Galan agreed two loans for a total of EUR 690m. EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, head of climate action at the Bank and its operations in Spain and Latin America, remarked: ""We are delighted to be signing these agreements at the Madrid Climate Change Conference, because they are a great example of the EIB's efforts to support climate action inside and outside of Europe. To fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we need to mobilise resources on an unprecedented scale, and the EIB is seeking to lead the response to this challenge. We are the EU's climate bank, and that is why we have strengthened our climate ambition. We are working on mobilising up to EUR 1tn over the coming decade through projects that, like the ones we are supporting today, are going to help with the transition towards a low-carbon economy by promoting renewable energies."" Ignacio Galan expressed his satisfaction for sealing this deal during the Climate Change Conference. ""The byword for this COP is the need to start taking action, and that is what Iberdrola and the EIB are doing today: undertaking specific actions that will help to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 C"" He also said that Iberdrola ""got a head-start with this transition 20 years ago, when we realised that the economy of the future had to be carbon-free. Since then, we have invested EUR 100bn in renewables, smart networks and efficient supply, becoming one of the world's largest utility companies."" The Iberdrola President also congratulated the EU bank on its decision to increase its climate ambition and to cease financing projects based on fossil fuels: ""We all have to be part of the solution. As leaders in sustainable financing, we believe that agreements such as the ones we are signing today are essential to turning climate change into an opportunity and leaving an inhabitable planet for future generations."" Of the EUR 690m total, EUR 250m will go to financing the construction of 15 wind farms to be developed in the country by Neoenergia, the Iberdrola subsidiary in Brazil. These new facilities will be located in three states in the north east: Paraiba, Bahia and Piaui. Once operational, they will have a total installed power of 520 MW and produce an annual average of 2 300 GWh of clean energy. Commissioning these wind farms will help to reduce CO2 emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in the country's electricity generation. The investments in these new wind farms will be made over a five-year period and will enable the creation of 2 300 jobs. The EIB is granting this financing under the Latin America lending mandate 2014-2020, meaning that the agreement is covered by the EU budget guarantee. By supporting this project, the EU bank is helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. The EIB has been working in Latin America for some 30 years and one of the major priorities in the region is to promote climate action. Smart electricity networks in Spain The EU bank and Iberdrola have also joined forces to develop digitalisation of infrastructure essential to the decarbonisation of the economy: the electricity distribution networks. To do so, they have agreed a EUR 440m loan to finance new investments in Spain for infrastructure to help improve the reliability of the network and the quality of supply. These networks are key to the energy transition, as they enable the integration of more renewables, sustainable mobility, smart cities and decentralised consumption. Transforming the networks into smart infrastructure that is more reliable and more secure puts consumers at the centre of the business, giving them greater decision-making power and connectivity. The EIB and climate action The EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2 C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, with the goal of ensuring that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1bn by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021. The EIB is the world's largest issuer of green bonds and was the first organisation to make an issue on this market in 2007. In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.

""We are still losing the climate race"", Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said, ""but we can choose another path, the path of climate action and well-being for people and planet"", which is about jobs, health, education, opportunities and the future. He maintained that the answer to the climate crisis lies in ""transforming how we generate our power, design our cities, and manage our land"", but it also requires actions ""consistent with making people's lives better"". Economic growth and tackling the climate crisis go hand in hand. The green economy is the economy of the future and we need to make way for it right now.

""We can no longer refuse to face up to the climate crisis"", he spelled out, urging governments to commit, businesses to lead and people everywhere to ""embrace the transformation that will bring us to a carbon-neutral world by 2050"". New Climate Economy Mr. Guterres spoke encouragingly about ""enormous opportunities"" linked to climate action. According to the UN chief, shifting to a low-carbon economy represents a $26 trillion-dollar growth opportunity that could create 65 million new jobs by 2030 with solar, wind and geothermal energy already being the fastest-growing job creators in several economies. ""The green economy is the economy of the future and we need to make way for it right now"", he stated, encouraging countries to re-train people so they can ""switch careers with the concept that education now became a lifelong enterprise"". Stressing that the transition to a low-carbon future be ""fair and inclusive"", he said that this means ""a future of green and decent jobs...of thriving, resilient communities, cities and countries"" where developing nations are not raided for resources and human capital but are treated as equal partners...where the skills and knowledge of those currently employed in traditional energy industries provide the foundational expertise for the clean industries of tomorrow"". He upheld to workers in traditional energy industries, ""we want the same thing as you: decent jobs in a cleaner, healthier world"" for which government, businesses and labour leaders must together develop a pathway. Turning to the Climate Action for Jobs initiative, which puts job creation and livelihoods at the centre of national climate action plans, the UN chief enumerated measures to ensure inclusivity, such as assessing the employment, social and economic impacts of ecological transition and the potential of green jobs. We cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time -- UN chief ""A just transition is not only necessary, it is possible, but it will only work if governments and businesses continue to boost their overall climate action as well"", he emphasized. He underscored that economic growth and tackling climate change are ""mutually reinforcing"", adding that ""failing to tackle global heating is a sure-fire recipe for economic disaster"". Cleaner, greener future for all Detailing the need to ""reduce emissions 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century"", Mr. Guterres said the Paris Agreement must be used as ""our multilateral path forward"". Without achieving our climate goals, the Secretary-General maintained that only the richest would survive. And because ""we cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time"", he underlined that developed nations must fulfil their pledges under the Paris Agreement to mobilize at least $100 billion dollars a year for mitigation and adaptation in developing nations. ""We need to be innovative, we need to be determined and we need to be entirely coherent with the perspective that this transition needs to be done to benefit everybody"", concluded the Secretary-General. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA198","COP25 really is the 'point of no return' in the climate emergency. Here's why","December 2, 2019 Monday 10:55 AM EST","CNN.com","It's a summit that could make or break the world's climate commitments. Around 25,000 people from 200 countries are descending on Madrid this week to attend the COP25 climate change conference. They include dozens of heads of state and government, business leaders, scientists and, of course, activists -- including Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Sunday that the summit marks the ""point of no return"" in humanity's fight against climate change. Just getting there was tricky. The gathering was originally going to be hosted by Brazil. But the country dropped out under the then-newly elected president Jair Bolsonaro late last year, so the meeting moved to Chile. When violent anti-government protests erupted in Chile in October, the meeting was moved again, this time to the Spanish capital. What is COP25 Remember the Paris Climate Accord? Under the 2015 agreement, more than 200 nations committed to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and, if possible, to less than 1.5 degrees above. The world is now 1.1 degrees warmer than it was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution -- a change that has already had a profound effect on the planet and people's lives. COP -- officially, the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change -- is the body that makes sure the Paris agreement is implemented. The 25 signifies that this is the group's 25th meeting. But there are so many climate change conferences. Just on Monday, a new report from Oxfam found that one person is forced out of their home every two seconds as a result of climate change. Guterres said Sunday that ""climate change is no longer a long-term problem."" ""We are confronted now with a global climate crisis,"" he said. ""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and hurtling towards us."" That sounds a bit alarmist. Is COP25 really the 'point of no return'? Guterres has a point. While scientists have been making the connection between climate change and greenhouse gases for decades, emissions are still going up. The Madrid meeting is the last gathering of the COP group before 2020, the year when the Paris agreement comes into effect. When nations signed the deal back in 2015, they agreed that global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak in 2020 at the latest, and then start coming down -- or the world will face disastrous and irreversible damage. That will require most countries to up their commitments ahead of the next COP meeting in Glasgow next November. According to the UN, if we rely only on the current climate plans, temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.2 degrees this century. That sounds scary. Can we do anything to stop this? To make meeting the reduction targets even remotely possible, global leaders must come up with a practical plan for cutting emissions in the next two weeks. Some rules were agreed at the COP24 conference in Poland last year. But that meeting failed to agree the rules for a new international emission-trading system, a crucial part of the plan. That discussion is back on the agenda this year. Experts say that if the delegates reach a deal on emissions trading, we might just about be able to reach the targets. If they fail, we will definitely trail behind the plan. That doesn't mean all is lost -- but it does make dealing with the consequences of climate change even more expensive. The later we wait, the more drastic (and pricey) measures will be needed to save the planet. What is emissions trading? A global market for carbon dioxide emissions would allow governments and businesses to trade their greenhouse gas output. Those that manage to keep their emissions below a set cap could sell the remaining allowance to those that can't. Experts agree that an efficient trading mechanism could make our fight against climate change cheaper and fairer. It would also allow business to play much bigger role -- something scientists say is necessary in order to achieve the Paris goals. But the issue is thorny. A badly designed trading system could lead to double counting, which would make cuts look bigger then they actually are. And a carbon price that is too high or too low could jeopardize the whole idea. This is not a groundbreaking idea. The European Union set up the world's first trading system in 2005. It covers the bloc's most polluting power stations and industrial plants, and airlines. The EU says it works -- emissions from the installations covered the system are falling. Isn't it all pointless if the US isn't on board? The US is responsible for 13% of global emissions, the world's second biggest emitter after China. If calculated per head, the US is well above anyone else. But while it may be more difficult to reach the targets without the US -- the American absence means the world's other big polluters will have to step up their commitments. -- some global leaders doubled down on the pledge. Just days after the US withdrew from the Paris agreement, Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron signed a pact recommitting to it. And even though the US has formally withdrawn, under the framework of the agreement, the withdrawal process cannot be completed until November 4, 2020, which happens to be one day after the 2020 presidential election. Should Trump lose the 2020 election, a new president could rejoin the agreement. In that case, the US would have to make new, more ambitious climate commitments to the UN straightaway (something other countries will do gradually in the coming months). In the meantime, some individual American cities and states have pledged to stick to the agreement. \"

The tasks are many, timelines are tight, every item is important Mr. Guterres outlined the work programme for what will be a busy two-week event covering multiple aspects of the climate crisis, including capacity-building, deforestation, indigenous peoples, cities, finance, technology, and gender. ""The tasks are many"", he said, ""our timelines are tight, and every item is important"". In several regions of the world, coal power plants continue to be built in large numbers. Either we stop this addiction to coal or all our efforts to tackle the climate crisis will be doomed. We need ambitious #ClimateAction now. My remarks at # COP25 : HYPERLINK https://t.co/OlQxOD7dEJ https://t.co/OlQxOD7dEJ Antnio Guterres (@antonioguterres) December 2, 2019 COP25 marks the beginning of a 12 month process to review countries' ""Nationally Determined Contributions"" or NDCs (the commitments made under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement), and ensure that they are ambitious enough to defeat the climate emergency. Overcome divisions, put a price on carbon Encouraging signs of progress, noted Mr. Guterres, came out of the UN's Climate Action Summit, held in September, which saw initiatives proposed by small island nations and least-developed countries, major cities and regional economies, as well as the private and financial sectors. The stated intention of some 70 countries to submit enhanced NDCs in 2020 - with 65 countries and major economies committing to work for net zero emissions by 2050 while governments and investors are backing away from fossil fuels, were also cited as positive signs. The UN chief called for leaders to end division over climate change, and reach consensus on carbon pricing, a crucial tool for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so, he said, will ""get markets up and running, mobilize the private sector, and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone."" Is this the generation that 'fiddled while the planet burned?' However, failing to decide on a price for carbon will, warned Mr. Guterres, risk fragmenting the carbon markets, sending a negative message that can undermine efforts to solve the climate crisis. Throughout his speech, the Secretary-General was crystal clear about the urgent, existential level of the climate crisis. Failure to act, he said, will be the path of surrender: ""Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?"" Wildfires have broken out across Queensland and New South Wales in Australia. , by Queensland Fire and Emergency Services The signs of potential disaster are unmissable, he declared. For example, the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is comparable to that seen between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today. Other indicators include the fact that the last five years have been the hottest on record, and have seen extreme weather events and associated disasters, from hurricanes to drought to floods to wildfires. Ice caps are melting at a rapid rate, sea levels are rising, and oceans are acidifying, threatening all marine life. Meanwhile, coal plants continue to be planned and built, and large, important parts of the global economy from agriculture to transportation, from urban planning and construction to cement, steel and other carbon-intensive industries are still run in ways that are unsustainable. ""There is no time and no reason to delay"", concluded Mr. Guterres. ""We have the tools, we have the science, we have the resources. Let us show we also have the political will that people demand from us. To do anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human family and all the generations to come"". Time for politicians to lead, not follow Speaking at a roundtable with Heads of State and government attending COP25 , Mr. Guterres urged them to lead, and not follow, at a time when public opinion over the environment is evolving very quickly, and cities, regions and the business community are taking action to tackle the climate crisis. The Secretary-General reminded them that at the recent G20 meeting of the world's leading economies in Osaka, a group of asset management companies, representing some $34 trillion dollars had asked political leaders to enhance climate action, end subsidies to fossil fuels, and put a price on carbon. The private sector, he added, is increasingly demonstrating a strong commitment to move forward, and complaining that it's governments who are lagging behind: regulation is inadequate, fiscal systems are not favourable, subsidies are still going to fossil fuels, and companies face obstacles to climate action. With a head of steam building for action, it is for political leaders to ""to be able to take profit of this movement and to lead, for us to be able to defeat climate change"". Climate crisis mostly effecting 'those least responsible for it' The Secretary-General also addressed a forum of ""climate vulnerable"" countries, where he pointed out the ""great injustice"" of climate change: its effects fall most on those least responsible for it. He cited examples, including Mozambique and the Caribbean, ravaged by storms that cause devastation, in terms of lives lost, communities uprooted, and economies crippled; and drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Nevertheless, some of the most vulnerable nations are in the forefront of climate action, showing leadership at September's Climate Action Summit: Mr. Guterres expressed his hope that their example will be followed by the world's big emitters.

The 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) is underway in Madrid to convene a meeting on the historic Paris Climate Agreement. Shaheen also led a group of Senators in calling on President Trump to once again reconsider his decision to withdraw the United States from the historic accord. The Senators wrote, ""Failing to address the worsening crisis of climate change will wreak damages on all Americans for centuries into the future. Now more than ever, the American people are demanding action on climate change from our federal government and our international partners."" In their letter, the Senators urged the UNFCCC and all international participants in the convention to explore all solutions and paths forward to combat the effects of climate change. In closing, the Senators reiterated that though the administration is not prioritizing this existential crisis, there is bipartisan support in Congress to take action. The Senators concluded, ""In a moment where the commitment of the United States to address climate change seems threadbare, we, the undersigned, assure you that we are working diligently to respond to this global threat and we support your efforts in Madrid."" The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Susan Collins (R-ME), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tom Udall (D-NM), Angus King (I-ME), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV). Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation - the International Climate Change Accountability Act - that would prevent the President from using funds to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris Climate Accord.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA201","Tourism's Carbon Emissions Measured in Landmark Report Launched At COP25","December 5, 2019 Thursday 7:53 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The United Nations World Tourism Organization issued the following news: Transport-related emissions from tourism are expected to account for 5.3% of all man-made CO2 emissions by 2030, up from 5% in 2016, a landmark new report from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the International Transport Forum (ITF) shows. At the same time, as tourist numbers rise and the sector makes progress in achieving low-carbon travel, emissions per passenger kilometer are expected to decline over the coming decade. Against this backdrop, UNWTO calls for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to effectively transform tourism for climate action. Launched at an official side-event of the One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme during the UN Climate Summit, COP25 in Madrid, the ""Transport Related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector"" presents the emissions produced by the different modes of tourism transport. As the number of both international and domestic tourists continues to rise, this data is presented alongside the predicted growth in emissions to 2030 and is set against the so called 'current ambition' for the decarbonization of transport. Presenting the report, UNWTO Executive Director Manuel Butler said: ""This comprehensive study analyses the environmental impact of the different modes of transport within the tourism sector. It is now for the tourism sector, especially tourism policy makers to use data effectively and ensure the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate emergency."" Ovais Sarmad, the Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) addressed the need to scale efforts towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement: ""While tourism is mentioned in many Nationally Determined Contributions as a big concern, not enough has yet been done. Industry must do more, but governments must align their policies, so that at the international level we can collectively work to increase ambition. The One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme is a vital ongoing mechanism to promote sustainable tourism around the world."" Some of the main conclusions of the research include:  Against the current ambition scenario, transport-related CO2 emissions from tourism are predicted to increase from 1,597 million tonnes to 1,998 million tonnes between 2016 and 2030, representing a 25% rise.  During the same period, international and domestic arrivals are expected to increase from 20 billion to 37 billion, mainly driven by domestic tourism (from 18.8 billion to 35.6 billion), followed by international arrivals (1.2 billion to 1.8 billion).  Transport-related emissions from tourism represented 5% of all man-made emissions in 2016 and will increase to 5.3% by 2030.  Tourism related transport emissions represented 22% of all transport emissions in 2016 and will continue doing so in 2030 (21%). Moving to a ""high ambition scenario"" Tourism's transport-related CO2 emissions remain a major challenge and require tourism to work closely with transport in order to support its commitment to accelerate the decarbonazition process and the implementation of a high ambition scenario. In addition, the tourism sector must determine its own high ambition scenario, complementing the efforts of the transport sector. Here, tourism would advance towards significantly decoupling growth from emissions in order to grow within the international climate targets.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA202","COP25: National Governments Fail to Seize the Day, but Business Climate Action Continues","3BL Blogs","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 18, 2019( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP25 , was a poor jumping-off point. This year's COP was designed to pave the way for greater ambition on the part of national governments. Unfortunately, they failed to live up to the importance of the moment. In advance of the climate conference, the UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap report called for annual emissions reductions of 7.6 percentif the world is to keep global heating to 1.5C. Measured against that benchmark, the last COP of the 2010s represents a serious setback. There were multiple disappointments in Madrid. There was no agreement on alignment of carbon market rules, which would provide guidelines on how countries can trade emissions internationally. Also, countries did not prioritize the ground rules that would protect vulnerable nations after a climate disaster. Even the aspirational language emerging from the negotiations took a step backwards from the more concrete commitments to heightened ambition in the run-up to next year's pivotal COP26, when the 'ratchet' of national contributions is intended to happen. And while 121 nations have committed to net-zero emissions, this is less significant in terms of impact: these countries represent only 15 percentof global emissions. There is little doubt that this reflects, in part, the absence of American leadership under the current administration in Washington. While American business and investors were visible and there was political representation from a climate-friendly delegation of congressmembers, state governors, and mayors, they are not able to shift national government commitments. While the We Are Still In coalition remains vibrant and important, it cannot make up for the loss of climate diplomacy from the White House. And with the exception of the European Union, other major emitting nations did not step up either. But while this was clearly a COP where national governments did not seize the day, there were still some glimmers of hope. Because while national government action matters a lot it is far from the only pathway to progress.And in many other areas, COP showed important steps forward.Many businesses, reflecting what is known in the hallways of the climate talks as 'the real economy,' continue to make new commitments.Nearly 800 companies are now committed to net-zero emissions by mid-century. Many businesses, reflecting what is known in the hallways of the climate talks as 'the real economy,' continue to make new commitments.While many heavy-emitting industries remain on the sidelines, there are some interesting new commitments. For example, Spanish oil and gas producer Repsol made itsCOP host country proud by announcing the first net-zero commitment in that sector to include Scope 3 emissions. More broadly, the number of companies joining the UN Global Compact's Climate Ambition Coalition, committing to a 1.5C target has doubled since September, expanding to 177 companies representing US$2.8 trillion in market capitalization. Goldman Sachs and AXA have both announced new divestment strategies. In addition to action by businesses and investors, public demand for climate action continues to be heard. Coinciding with COP,Timenamed Greta Thunberg the Person of the Year for 2019, and 'climate emergency' was named the word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries. It is clear public expectations about climate action are stronger than ever and growing. What does this mean for business? Looking ahead to 2020, business has both the interest and the opportunity to continue to raise its ambition. Companies can act by joining the growing parade of businesses committed to 100 percent renewable energy in service of augmented science-based targets and aligning their business strategies with the 1.5C target. Companies also can enable progress by working with their supply chains as the number of businesses seeking deep Scope 3 emissions cuts continues to grow. And finally, business should leverage its influence by calling on governments to drop the timidity that was unfortunately on display in Madrid. A loud business voice was vital in the run-up to the Paris Agreement in 2015, and it will be essential to delivering the strong result that will be badly needed at COP26 next November in Glasgow. The need for heightened urgency is coming from the science, the streets, and the employees of global companies.2020 must be a year when the promise of Paris is given new life in Glasgow. With business engagement in the year ahead, we can redefine Madrid as a footnote in history, rather than lasting damage to climate ambition. Originally appeared on BSR[2].

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA204","COP25: 'SIGNALS OF HOPE' MULTIPLYING IN FACE OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS, INSISTS UN CHIEF GUTERRES","December 2, 2019 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the UN Economic Commission for Africa: The UN Secretary-General has outlined the ""increased ambition and commitment"" that the world needs from governments during the coming days of the COP25 UN climate change conference which opens in Madrid on Monday, calling for ""accountability, responsibility and leadership"" to end the global climate crisis. ""My message here today is one of hope not of despair"" said UN chief Antnio Guterres addressing journalists at a press conference in the Spanish capital on Sunday, after revealing the key takeaways from the World Meteorological Organization's State of the Climate report, due to be published during COP25 . But scientists have provided a roadmap away from that point, which will allow us to limit global temperature rise to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels, by 2030. 1.5 degrees 'still within reach' Efforts so far have been ""utterly inadequate"" and the Paris Agreement commitments still mean a rise of 3.2 degrees unless more drastic action is taken, said the UN chief, but 1.5 degrees ""is still within reach."" ""The technologies that are necessary to make this possible are already available"", he added, ""the signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere. Young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilization."" The key missing ingredient is a lack of political will he said: ""Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels"", or to shift taxation from income to carbon, ""taxing pollution instead of people."" Stop digging and drilling He said digging and drilling had to stop, replaced by renewable energy and nature-based solutions to drastically slow climate change. ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments particularly from the main emitters to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050."" Mr. Guterres said at least $100 billion dollars must be made available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and to take into account their ""legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery."" The ""social dimension"" of climate change must also be paramount, so that national commitments include ""a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected as we move from the grey to the green economy."" Mark Carney to be new Special Envoy for Climate Action The Secretary-General announced on Sunday that the current head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is to become the UN's new Special Envoy for Climate Action. Describing the Canadian as ""a remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to act on climate"", Mr. Guterres said the new envoy would be focusing on ambitious implementation of action, especially shifting markets and mobilizing private finance, towards limiting global warming to the key 1.5 degrees mark. Mr. Carney replaces former New York mayor and billionaire philanthropist, Michael Bloomberg, who has embarked on a US presidential run. A statement from the Spokespersons' office said his tasks would include ""building the frameworks for financial reporting, risk management and returns in order to bring the impacts of climate change to the mainstream of private financial decision making and to support the transition to a net zero carbon economy."" The Bank of England Governor has held numerous positions in finance in both the private and public sectors and will become a member of UN staff at the point at which he ceases to work for the Bank. He also served, from 2011 to 2018, as Chair of the Financial Stability Board and Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013. ""The Secretary-General will count on Mark Carney to galvanise climate action and transform climate finance"", as the UN looks to next year's 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), due to take place in Glasgow, Scotland. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA205","DESPITE DISAPPOINTING RESULTS OF UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE, THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH IS 'STILL IN' FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Episcopal Church: By Egan Millard [Episcopal News Service] The United Nations Climate Change Conference known as COP 25 went into overtime, running two days later than scheduled, but ended on Dec. 16 without taking the actions scientists say are necessary to avoid a catastrophic future. The United States and other wealthy, high-emitting countries refused to implement carbon pricing or address the losses and damages that smaller, poorer states are suffering. But while political leaders fell short of those goals, the delegation from The Episcopal Church and its interfaith allies showed the international community at COP 25 (the 25th Conference of the Parties) in Madrid, Spain, that the church remains committed to a swift and just transition away from fossil fuels and will continue pressing those in power to act. "" COP 25 The conference had been seen by many as the last chance to amend current insufficient emissions commitments to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, beyond which humanity runs the risk of inflicting ""increasingly severe and expensive impacts"" on itself, according to the U.N. But with crucial action points in the implementation of the 2015 Paris accord delayed until next year's COP, ""the point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" U.N. Secretary General Antnio Guterres warned as the conference drew to a close. ""It is in sight and hurtling towards us."" This is the biggest disconnect between this process and what's going on in the real world that I've seen, Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists who has been attending climate talks since 1991, told The Washington Post. You have the science crystal [clear] on where we need to go. ... It's like we're in a sealed vacuum chamber in here, and no one is perceiving what is happening out there what the science says and what people are demanding. And what the science says is so dire it demands an urgent response, Main told Episcopal News Service. ""One stunning statistic I heard from [ex-U.N. Secretary General] Ban Ki-Moon's former speechwriter on the subject was that the decisions we make over the next 30 years will determine the outcome for the next 10,000 years,"" Main said. Despite the political inaction, the delegation representing Presiding Bishop Michael Curry offered a unique perspective at the conference, grounded in The Episcopal Church's commitment to social justice and creation care a perspective that is increasingly valued at these summits. ""We heard time and again, from U.N. officials and from other faith-based partners, that increasingly there is a recognition that climate change is a symptom not just of what is happening to the physical world, but of overconsumption, selfishness and apathy,"" Main said. ""U.N. officials are increasingly recognizing that at least part of the solution lies with faith leaders who can mobilize their communities through the teachings and actions required to generate this change."" The delegation made a powerful impression, Main said, through its activities during the two-week summit, which included partnering with other faith groups for discussions and prayer services, hosting a booth to educate attendees about the links between climate justice and faith and meeting with negotiators. ""The fact that The Episcopal Church shows up at a U.N. meeting speaks volumes to member state governments and U.N. officials; it shows that we care enough about the issue to physically show up in another country, for a long protracted period, and to invest resources and people in active participation,"" she told ENS. The delegation also educated national leaders and other representatives about how The Episcopal Church is setting an example by supporting the goals of the Paris agreement, reducing its carbon footprint, supporting indigenous peoples like the Gwich'in in their fight against oil and gas development on sensitive lands, coordinating the Creation Care Pledge, funding advocacy and mitigation work and much more. In order to convince governments to act, it's important to show that the church as an institution and Episcopalians as individuals are committed, Main said: ""As we look ahead to COP 26 in Glasgow next November, we must ask ourselves how we, as faith-based actors, will undertake the self-examination and self-reform that this era requires of us. Jesus calls us to love our neighbor as ourselves. We cannot push our governments to do better, to do more, unless we too are demonstrating that we are still in.""

The United Nations confirmed Friday the meeting will take place in Madrid in December after Chile withdrew as host because of protests that have paralyzed the nation over the past two weeks. Thunberg has traveled halfway to the South American nation but will need to turn back to make the UN climate summit. The activist refuses to fly due to high levels of emissions from air travel and instead uses boats, trains and electric cars to get around. ""It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way,"" Thunberg wrote on Twitter. ""Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful."" Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said Wednesday that he was ""deeply sorry for the problems and inconveniences"" his decision would cause. In the televised statement, he said that ""as the president of all Chileans, I always have to put the problems and interests of Chileans first, their needs and hopes."" Pinera also canceled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit scheduled for November. Chile's protests began over a now-suspended price hike for subway tickets in Santiago. They expanded, revealing anger among ordinary Chileans who feel excluded from the nation's economic rise. Many of the protesters are now asking for Pinera's resignation. The move also affects a group of 36 young climate activists crossing the Atlantic by sailboat to attend. They were shocked to learn the event was canceled four weeks into their grueling voyage, after they set off from Amsterdam on October 2. They were using a sailboat highlight the impact of flying on greenhouse gas emissions. The Sail to the COP group said in a statement Thursday that it had decided to sail on to Bel\'c3\£9m, Brazil. ""After the initial shock and sadness the news brought, everyone came together determined to continue what we started: putting the climate impact of aviation on the international agenda,"" read a statement from the group.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA207","University of Pennsylvania Sends Largest Ever Delegation to UN Climate Conference","December 12, 2019 Thursday 8:30 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The University of Pennsylvania issued the following news: At COP 25 , representatives from the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, Perry World House, Penn IUR, and elsewhere discuss global climate challenges. At this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 25 Having this status gave Penn the opportunity to nominate and support faculty, staff, and students to attend COP on official credentials, Colijn says. ""It meant the University was able to join the governments, international organizations and nonprofits, businesses, and members of civil society who are working on a range of climate change issues today."" ""This is all part of Penn building a collaborative relationship with UN Climate Change and the affiliate organizations and their policymakers,"" adds Jocelyn Perry, the global shifts program manager for Perry World House. COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and specifically it means member states who signed onto the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) created in 1992. The Paris Agreement came out of COP 21 in 2015. At the meeting happening now, treaty signatories are negotiating the rules of the Paris accord, such as how countries will track progress and what financing mechanisms will be put in place. COP 25 is the final gathering before 2020, the point at which many participating nations must submit new climate plans to UNFCCC. Beyond the member countries, observer-status participants like Penn join UN staff and other organizations to hold conversations around pertinent climate-related issues. ""Everyone who works on these at the international policy level will be at this conference,"" says Michael Weisberg, a Penn philosophy professor and the inaugural PWH faculty fellow, who has several roles at this year's gathering. Last Friday, he facilitated portions of an UNFCCC forum centered on oceans. His section focused on technology and innovation, funding, and education related to resilience and adaptation around sea-level rise. Weisberg, Perry, and several other Penn representatives also participated in the Resilience Lab. ""This is a forward-looking UNFCCC initiative addressing future sustainability concerns,"" Perry says. ""It asks, What do we want to achieve by 2030, and how do we get there? It's focused on eight pathways for engagement, including equitable and just use of resources and building on indigenous expertise."" Her panel--which also included William Burke-White of Penn Law, Dina Ionesco of the UN Migration Agency, and Shyla Raghav, vice president of climate change for Conservation International--covered climate displacement. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, the effects of climate change may displace more than 140 million people within their own countries; projections of climate-induced international displacement vary widely but could be immense. The Penn-led session touched on some challenging topics. ""With climate change and increasing climate-induced migration, especially forced displacement, how do we make that fair, equitable, and just for everyone affected? How do we build the legal structures at the highest levels of international and climate law and make them speak to one another?"" Perry says. ""How do you foresee conflicts over resources, as water or food become scarcer, and how do you proactively build the structures you need before the crisis hits rather than after?"" Penn also hosted a moderated discussion on climate-resilient urban infrastructure with the UNFCCC's Nairobi Work Program and other partners, and the Kleinman Center's Mark Alan Hughes introduced former Quito mayor Mauricio Rodas, a Penn alum and current visiting fellow with PWH and Penn IUR, for a talk he gave on climate financing for cities. This year, four Penn schools sent delegates, and Colijn says she's certain that in climate conferences to follow, the number interested will grow. ""It really shows just how interdisciplinary climate change is,"" she says, ""and the diversity of researchers and backgrounds needed to find solutions."" Representatives from the Stuart Weitzman School of Design include the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy executive director, Cornelia Colijn, and founding faculty director, Mark Alan Hughes, as well as Allison Lassiter, an assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning. Representatives from Perry World House include Michael Weisberg, a professor in the Department of Philosophy in the School of Arts and Sciences and the inaugural PWH faculty fellow; Jocelyn Perry, global shifts program manager; William Burke-White, inaugural director and a professor in the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School; and Koko Warner, a PWH visiting fellow and manager of the Climate Impacts, Vulnerability, and Risks Subprogram at UNFCCC.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA208","United Nations Climate Talks: No United Decision","December 16, 2019 Monday","Stillman Advance: Stillman College","Saudi Arabia and Russian Federation, for example, said they would not accept an agreement that acknowledged the Oceans report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change but ignored the Land Report by the same organisation. The recently unveiled Climate Action Plan is wholly deficient in contributing appropriately to emission reductions of 7.6 per cent every year for the next decade. Another gripe: a failure to build consensus on key issues like carbon trading, even as the second week of negotiations wore on. A major United Nations climate conference came to an end yesterday, Sunday, December 15, amid significant disagreement among countries and climate activists on how to tackle climate change. In the first four it failed totally. Earlier, talks president Chile triggered outrage after drafting a version of the text that campaigners complained was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the 2015 Paris Agreement. But it will be hobbled by lack of money. Developing countries also demand that compensation be kept a separate issue from funds to help the countries adapt and mitigate the effects of a warming planet. Many countries had other problems as well. The main point of resistance lies in the existence of old carbon credits leftover from a now-discredited system established under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Others accused the European Union of blocking progress to shield its internal carbon market. ""We can survive a failed COP inMadrid"", said May, ""but we will not recover if political leadership fails at COP26 in Glasgow"". The accord enters in to action next year, and it had been hoped COP 25 would show the world that governments had listened to the weekly protests, irrefutable science and more extreme weather events to redouble their efforts. China trade deal 'totally done': USA trade rep But delegates could not agree on various elements of Article 6. A formal withdrawal from the Paris Agreement could trigger far wider criticisms, perhaps calls for import taxes on USA goods. That way, the U.S. would not have to provide any money on this score once it left the agreement. Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity. The so-called pre-2020 actions have received passing mention in some of the summit resolutions, but without teeth. Discussions held during COP25 broadened the understanding of the science behind the climate crisis, and the critical need for urgency: the UN Global Compact, which works with the private sector, announced that 177 companies have now agreed to set science-based climate targets that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. In a statement to SBS News, Energy Minister Angus Taylor, who addressed the summit, said Australia re-confirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement at COP25 . The Global Climate Lead at Christian Aid, Dr Katherine Kramer, said: ""The UK now has a gargantuan task of overseeing a successful climate summit in Glasgow next year"". Still,Madrid authorities earned praise from everyone for the near-perfect logistics at the venue, all put together in four weeks. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations at the COP25 climate talks summit inMadrid, Spain, Thursday, Dec. 12, 2019. Bill Hare, head of the Climate Analytics think-tank, said they may remain at current levels by 2030 with Trump's policies. ""We had so many talks till so late, without sleeping all night"", said Carolina Schmidt, chairwoman of the COP25 and the environment minister of Chile, at the closing plenary of the conference that ended Sunday afternoon. We came here asking for urgent action, and several countries only offered accounting tricks and cover for climate inaction. And whileMadrid focused on narrow technical issues, it is past time to move beyond that. Our leaders need to step up. ""But we must not give up, and I will not give up"".

On the second day of the event in Madrid, the ETUC held a joint side event with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung to highlight the consequences of climate change for the world of work. Confederal Secretary Ludovic Voet told delegates that the consequences of climate change are already visible through an increased number of wild fires, floods, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events. As a result, people working outdoor in the construction and agriculture sectors are exposed more frequently to extreme weather and the conditions also create more workload and stress for emergency services staff such as firefighters, nurses and doctors. ""The consequences of climate change are creating new risks for workers or will exacerbate existing ones, while impacting the content and intensity of work in many sectors,"" said Voet. ""That's why trade unions must be involved at local, national and European level in designing policies to help workplaces adapt to climate change."" The ETUC is currently running a project to identify which sectors and regions are most at risk, how workers are affected and what concrete measures are need to adapt workplaces to cope with climate change. The first findings of the EU-funded project were presented to and discussed by delegates at the event.

Madrid did its best to send them a simple message - every country and every individual needs to do much more. The streets of Madrid sending a message to the negotiators at COP 25 [image by: Soumya Sarkar] Thunberg was mobbed wherever she went, at the summit venue or the city centre. Speaking to journalists, she said, 'I hope COP25 will lead to something concrete. We need to also increase awareness in people in general. The world leaders and people in power need to recognise the climate crisis and that doesn't seem to be the case now.This [climate change] is not something they can just hide away.' Asked why she was being trolled so viciously around the world, Thunberg responded, 'They are afraid of change and change is what young people are bringing and that's why they are anxious. And that's proof that we're having an impact and our voices are being heard. They want to desperately silence us.'When asked what immediate steps she wanted taken on the climate change front, Thunberg said, 'We have to adapt and we have to solve the problem and try to prevent the worst consequences. Basically nothing has happened. It cannot go on like this. We would like to have some action from people in power because people are suffering, they are dying because of the climate emergency today. We cannot wait any longer.'Share this story \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA211","VC'S UPDATE - GRAND GRADUATION, MICROSOFT VISIT AND COP25","December 12, 2019 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Australian National University: Hi everyone, I've just attended the final graduation ceremony for 2019, which is one of the most important weeks of the year for us here at ANU. It's a time that brings our community together to recognise the achievements of our students - and for many, this will be one of the most special and memorable days of their lives. For our Chancellor, Gareth Evans, it was the final time he'll confer degrees - and he tells me that in the last decade he has shaken hands with more than 28,000 graduates as they cross the stage. For our graduates, this is an important milestone -and a day that often grows in importance through reflection over time. Graduation is a time when our students often make big decisions that help shape their future, and in turn the world around them. One of our current student cohorts, is our 3Ai Masters students - 16 postgraduate students from around the world who are nurturing a new applied science devoted to the responsible use of AI by both organisations and individuals. A few weeks ago they were visited by the global head of Microsoft - CEO Satya Nadella, who met with the students to learn about their studies as they help create a new field. We were the only university that Satya visited - a testament to the importance of what 3Ai is trying to do, and it was great to see Microsoft contribute $300,000 to support this degree - and I am pleased to announce that ANU will match their contribution. Speaking of brilliant graduates, this week I was also pleased to see that three ANU scholars have won prestigious Rhodes Scholarships. This is an incredible achievement, with universities rarely winning two, let alone three scholarships. The three students - Emily Rowland, Matt Goh and Marcus Dahl - have all made incredible contributions to our campus and community during their time here. They'll get a chance to show Oxford University how great they are and change the world however they best see fit. Like this graduating cohort, the next generation of ANU students will continue to be the best and brightest in the world. We will give them every opportunity to succeed in their chosen field by ensuring they are taught by the best academics, who excel and lead in their field. This includes leading intellectuals like Professor Frank Jotzo and Dr Nerilee Abram, who are attending COP25 , where they are listening and contributing to discussions about climate change. They tell me there are many more ANU graduates in Madrid as part of this world event. In a time when Australia's east coast is experiencing catastrophic bushfire conditions, and Eastern Australia is experiencing the worst drought in recorded history, the University will continue to provide governments, organisations and individuals the research and evidence about how to deal with this emerging global threat. The students graduating this week will be the next generation of leaders, and I am looking forward to them shaping a future that creates a sustainable future for humanity. Finally, earlier this week, we held our inaugural Grand Graduation on the lawns of University Avenue. It was a tad bit hot, but more than 1,500 graduands, their friends and family as well as staff came out to support our students. There was a parade, DJ, live music and a picnic to share - and we were privileged to hear from The Honourable Helen Clark, who received an honorary degree from ANU in recognition of her service to contribution to politics, international affairs, women's empowerment, development issues and environmental sustainability. We were also inspired by the journey of Karlie Noon, a Gamilaraay woman who, this week, graduated with an Advanced Masters of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Karlie is now inspiring the new generation of Indigenous girls from her community to consider university as a pathway to a better future. If you were unable to attend, I encourage you to read their remarks here. Both were impressive speakers who shared a lot that we can learn from. I hope to see the entire community there in 2020 at the University's most important celebration of the academic year. This is my final blog of 2019, and I hope everyone is looking forward to a great holiday break; or the next adventure if you're leaving campus. Thank you to everyone for a great year, and keep an eye out for my end-of-year video next week, it'll be quite a ride...! Brian \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA212","5 things to know for December 16: Impeachment, Afghanistan, Lebanon, COP25, North Korea","December 16, 2019 Monday 11:32 AM GMT","CNN Wire","(CNN) -- Did you have a somewhat temperate weekend? Enjoy it while it lasts. Most of the country will be hit\~with snow and freezing rain sometime this week. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Impeachment Are you ready for another contentious week of impeachment activity? This is the week the House is supposed to conduct a full vote of the articles of impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee released a 658-page report explaining its decision to charge Trump with two articles of impeachment -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\~It will only take a simple majority vote to formally impeach President Trump, and then it's on to a Senate trial. When the trial starts, you'll be introduced to a whole new impeachment vocabulary. First up: Impeachment manager. Those will be the head Democrats chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to lead the prosecution of the President. Who will she choose? One option is independent Justin Amash, a\~congressional Republican who switched parties after backing\~impeachment proceedings. However, fellow lawmakers say it's\~""highly unlikely""\~Pelosi would make a flashy partisan gamble on such an important decision. 2. Afghanistan The Trump Administration is preparing to announce a long-awaited reduction of US troops in Afghanistan, a senior administration official confirmed to CNN. There are between 12,000 and 13,000 US troops in the country right now, and the US has maintained a solid presence throughout the 18-year war in the area. This drawdown would remove up to 4,000 troops, with more possible reductions in the future, the official said. That matches the claim Trump made on Fox News Radio in August that his administration would take the number\~""down to 8,600."" The reduction comes at the same time the US is restarting peace talks with the Taliban, and some worry the troop drawdown could be seen as a concession to the terrorist group.\~ 3. Lebanon Protests in Lebanon took a violent turn this weekend. On Saturday night, at least 46 people were injured in clashes between protesters and security forces in the capital of Beirut. The protests have been going on since October and center around accusations of corruption and mismanagement against Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. If your memory is particularly sharp, you'll recall Hariri actually stepped down in late October, a few weeks after the protests began. He's back again, and is expected to be named head of the next government during parliamentary consultations today. Some other Lebanese leaders have said they won't join any government led by Hariri, which adds another layer of conflict on top of an already incendiary situation. 4. COP25 The marathon COP25 summit in Madrid concluded two days late and with little to show for it all. The climate summit was supposed to end with global leaders hammering out important new emissions regulations and other environmental guidelines to stave off the effects of climate change. Instead, 12 days turned into 14 and the resulting agreement was largely inconclusive, with vague language that deferred big decisions until next year's summit. For instance, the agreement concludes there's an urgent need for new carbon-cutting commitments, but doesn't really outline how to secure those commitments or what that system would look like. Some leaders put the blame on ""large emitters""\~who were either missing in action at the summit or reportedly dug in their heels at the negotiation table. 5. North Korea\~ Remember when North Korea threatened the US with a possibly-nuclear ""Christmas gift?"" US officials are urging the country to restart denuclearization\~talks, sending US\~special representative to North Korea, Stephen Biegun. Those talks fell apart last February after President Trump cut short a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\~North Korea has given the US until the end of the year to\~make a move\~in the nuclear negotiations, which means the country wants some sort of concession, like sanctions relief. What happens after that is anyone's guess, but it could\~include restarting long-range missile tests and completely severing the on-again, off-again diplomatic bromance between Trump and Kim.

This meeting almost didn't happen - there were many challenges and obstacles to face. But organizers and world leaders made an important choice: We can't wait for tomorrow to make decisions about a climate crisis that threatens the health, well-being, and survival of people and communities in every nation on Earth right now. ""Sea levels are rising. Wildfires and severe storms are becoming increasingly intense and frequent.

""ASLA is a proud signatory of the We Are Still In Declaration, calling on U.S. leaders to fulfill the nation's commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement. We were disappointed that this Administration filed official paperwork to withdraw the U.S. from that agreement, and sincerely hope they reverse this decision. ""Landscape architects understand that ""climate change"" isn't just a term on a page - it's a constant reality in their work. They use nature-based solutions to plan and design projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make communities more resilient to climate impacts. They design green roofs, green complete streets, living shorelines, and other forms of green infrastructure projects that both sequester greenhouse gases and manage water and air quality. ""Landscape architects, working with nature, design smart climate solutions for all communities - and those are exactly the kind of solutions we need right now.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA214","Spain: COP25 - Support for Renewable Energy EIB, IM2 Energia Solar Join Forces to Create Platform for Photovoltaic Power Plants","December 10, 2019 Tuesday 9:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The European Investment Bank issued the following news release:    - The EIB will provide EUR 26m for the Solar Storm 200 project, making it possible to build 15 solar power plants with a total capacity of 218 MW - The agreement is supported by the Investment Plan for Europe    The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Spanish multinational IM2 Energia Solar signed an agreement today in Madrid to promote the development of renewable energy in Spain and help meet the EU's climate objectives. The EIB is set to provide EUR 26m to support the Solar Storm 200 project, which includes the construction of 15 solar photovoltaic power plants in Spain. The agreement was signed today at the EU bank's COP25 stand by EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro and IM2 Energia Solar CEO Enrique Selva, and is supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the main pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe (the Juncker Plan). The 15 new photovoltaic power plants will have a total capacity of 218 MW and will be located in four autonomous communities: Extremadura, Andalusia, the Valencia Region and Murcia. Their installation will prevent the release of 116 000 tonnes of CO2 a year, 400 people will be employed for their construction and a further 20 permanent jobs will be created. The operation has an innovative structure that will see the EU bank investing in a platform for developing renewable energy projects for the first time. This agreement will make the EIB an equity partner of Solar Storm 200, the sustainable investment vehicle via which IM2 has planned the development and construction of this infrastructure in Spain. This is a flagship project for IM2, a company with 16 years of experience in the photovoltaic sector with offices in Spain and Chile, and that works with both investment projects and high-power industrial self-consumption projects. During the signing ceremony at COP25 , EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, who is responsible for the Bank's climate action and its business in Spain, said: ""It is a pleasure to be at the Climate Change Conference supporting projects such as this that will help cut CO2 emissions and increase the amount of renewable energy generated in Spain. Our country has great potential for producing this kind of energy and the EIB wants to help take advantage of this. As the EU climate bank, the EIB is working to ensure that Europe leads the response to the climate emergency."" European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for An Economy that Works for People, said: ""Investing in renewable energies is a crucial element to achieving the Paris Climate Agreement goals and reaching climate neutrality by 2050. I am pleased to be in Madrid for COP25 where the European Investment Bank has signed an agreement under the Investment Plan for Europe which will see 15 new solar energy farms constructed in Spain. Not only will this deal provide new sources of clean energy, but it will also create jobs in the process."" According to IM2 Energia Solar CEO Enrique Selva, ""the Spanish photovoltaic power sector is growing exponentially and Solar Storm is a major opportunity to invest in clean energy, in a project combining sustainability and long-term profitability. We have the opportunity to take advantage of Spain's high levels of sunshine (the highest in Europe) and a highly cost-effective technology to generate energy that can compete economically with other technologies."" This agreement will enable Solar Storm to be launched as the investment platform of Umbrella Capital - IM2 Energia Solar's holding company - with an Independent Power Producer (IPP) focus and becoming a renewable power producer. In addition to the EIB investment, Solar Storm 200 is backed by the commercial banking sector via project finance. The EIB and climate action The EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2 C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its roadmap to consolidate its position as the EU climate bank, together with the new energy lending policy. The core components of these agreements are: the EIB Group's commitment to mobilise at least EUR 1tn in climate and environment investment over the next decade from 2021 to 2030; to this end , the Bank will gradually increase the financing it dedicates to these objectives to represent 50% of its financing by 2025. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021. In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.    - The new photovoltaic power plants will be built in Andalusia, the Valencia Region, Murcia and Extremadura - Employment impact: the project will help create 400 jobs during the implementation phase Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6955645 MSTRUCK \"

Control of you, those around you - everything iota of modern life. And she has little to no awareness of the irony of her not flying across the Atlantic twice due to 'carbon footprint' but little to say about the necessary crew members / captain needed to fly back and forth to enable her 'boasting' (er, lying) about her 'Carbon Puritanism'. But this sums up what is going on; the kicker is from Drieu Godefridi's new book: Is Environmentalism the New Totalitarianism[1]? In order to prevent climate-induced economic harm sometime in the future, these people plan to devastate the economy now. They make no secret of their intent to shut down virtually all human activity, including travel and trade. This, says Godefridi, makes environmentalism more £mbitious in its desire to subdue' humanity 'than any previous doctrine.' Unlike Marxism, he writes, Environmentalism does not intend to seize the means of production to increase and distribute the fruits in an equal manner. Environmentalism plans to seize the means of production to stop it.(H/T: The Blaze[2], Daily Wire[3], WattsUpWithThat[4]) The post COP25 : Poor countries want to loot rich countries and Greta Thunberg starts to realize her '15 minutes of Leftist use' is over[5] appeared first on Granite Grok[6].

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA217","MEDIA ADVISORY: SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY SCHEDULE OF EVENTS DURING WEEK TWO AT COP25","December 8, 2019 Sunday","States News Service","The following information was released by Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Issues such as the importance of ocean protections, the value of the knowledge of indigenous people, and the growing need for more observational data are receiving unprecedented attention at the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, Spain. Researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego will present research and release new findings on these topics and more during the event's second week beginning Dec. 9. Scripps Oceanography has been a leader in making the most up-to-date science available to COP negotiators since the University of California was accepted as an observer organization by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2000. This year, Scripps Oceanography hosts three press conferences and several side events to continue that mission. The complete list of events during the first week of the conference from Dec. 9 to Dec. 13 is below: December 9 Press Conference: ""Colorado State University: Students Doing Goal-Oriented Science for the Sustainable Development GoalsSDG 2: Zero Hunger"" Time/Location: 9:3010:00 Mocha Press Conference Room, Hall 4 Description: Several student SDG groups will share SDG-relevant efforts taking place on their campuses. This group of students (twitter @adapt_ag) is exploring composting initiatives of United States academic institutions and researching the science behind improved soil as both an adaptation and mitigation strategy. Students will provide information on composting initiatives across college campuses. Speakers: Julia Dohner, Scripps Oceanography, and student leaders from Colorado State University and Clark University Press Conference: ""Why Local and Indigenous Knowledge and Land Rights are So Important in the Climate Change Fight"" Time/Location: 10:00-10:30 Mocha Press Conference Room, Hall 4 Description: At COP25 , representatives of indigenous communities around the world have noted climate change science is only now describing what they have known for millennia. The speakers will note that even well-intentioned environmental advocates can overlook the value of the knowledge of indigenous peoples, whose ways of living help sustain wilderness. Speakers: Daniela Faggiani-dias, Leticia Cavole, Rishi Sugla of Scripps Oceanography Side Event ""Global ocean governance for enhancing the ambition of national commitments on oceans"" Time/Location: 13:15-14:45 Side Event Room 1 Description: There is a challenge between national commitments (NDC) and the characteristics of the ocean, which goes beyond that logic. In that sense, a conversation related to addressing the challenge (i.e. of the Pacific Ocean) in an integrated/coordinated manner including: integrated information, measures of integrated adaptation, integrated governance, etc. Speakers: Natalya Gallo of Scripps Oceanography joins members of the Chilean government, CIDCE, the Center for Climate and Resilience Research, Chile, and Sociedad Francesa por el Derecho Ambiental. Side Event Release of report ""Accelerating the low carbon transition: the case for stronger, more targeted and coordinated international action"" Time/Location: 13:15-14:45 UK Pavilion Description: The report brings together a historical understanding of how technology transitions happen (such as from horses to cars, or from wells to piped water); lessons from the experience of international cooperation in security, trade and environment; and practical knowledge of the sectors that must be decarbonized. It identifies points of leverage for coordinated international action to accelerate low carbon transitions in ten of the highest emitting sectors, and highlights the urgent need for institutions that can support such cooperation to be strengthened.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA218","ELLIOT DIRINGER ON THE CONCLUSION OF COP 25","December 15, 2019 Sunday","States News Service","The following information was released by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES): Statement of Elliot Diringer COP 25 , the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in Madrid: ""The clearest message from Madrid is the widening gap between the action needed to stem climate disaster and the sluggish response of national governments. Civil society and business are now the ones leading the charge. Next year governments will have to show they can catch up. ""On the critical issue of ambition, parties struggled even to reaffirm their prior commitment to submit a new round of national targets next year. And for the second year in a row, they failed to agree on accounting rules for international carbon trading, the last remaining piece of the rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement. Strong rules are critical to ensure the growth and environmental integrity of carbon markets, which can help drive climate investment, lower the cost of meeting climate goals, and enable countries to raise their climate ambition. It may now fall to willing countries to develop their own rules outside the U.N. process. ""The first real test for Paris comes next year when countries deliver their next round of national commitments. Despite the impending U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, U.S. Congressional, state, and business leaders made clear in Madrid that they remain fully on board. It is vital that other countries not use the U.S. withdrawal as an excuse to be less ambitious. ""The science is undeniable. The here-and-now impacts of climate change grow worse every day. Business leaders understand the economic imperative of strong climate action. And citizens around the world are more mobilized than ever. National governments will risk their relevancy and our collective future if they fail to deliver next year."" \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA219","AFRICA'S CIVIL SOCIETY CALLS FOR ACTION AS COP25 KICKS OFF IN MADRID","December 2, 2019 Monday","IPS - Inter Press Service","During the 25th round of climate change negotiations starting today in Madrid, Spain, African civil society organisations will call on governments from both developing and developed nations to play their promised roles in combating climate change. ""We're fatigued by COP [Conference of Parties] jamborees which have become a ritual every year,"" said Dr Mithika Mwenda of the Pan Africa Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) - an umbrella organisation that brings together over 1,000 African climate and environment civil society organisations. ""We know the science is clear about the level [in which] we need to act, yet we procrastinate and prevaricate while maintaining our profligate lifestyles,"" he told IPS in an interview. The 25th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties ( COP 25 ) comes a week after the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report warning that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 percent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\'c2\'b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is an agreement reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, France, where the world's nations undertook a determined course to reduce climate change. Among the commitments was to reduce the increase in global temperatures. The annual Emissions Gap Report, which was released on Nov. 26 warns that even if all current unconditional commitments under the Paris Agreement are implemented, temperatures are expected to rise by 3.2\'c2\'b0C, bringing even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts. ""Any slight change in global temperatures can have a devastating effect on millions of livelihoods, and could expose people to life-threatening heat waves, water shortages and coastal flooding,"" said Dr Mohammed Said, a climate change research scientist based in Kenya. According to his research in Kenya's Arid and Semi Arid regions, people in counties that experienced increased temperatures in the past 50 years have suffered significant loss of livelihoods with some having to change their lifestyles altogether. ""In Turkana County for example, the temperatures increased by 1.8\'c2\'b0C, and as a result, the cattle population declined by 60 percent, and now residents have been forced to turn to more resilient camels, goats and sheep,"" he told IPS. It is the same situation all over the world. A study published in Nature Climate Change points out that if global warming causes a rise of 1.5\'c2\'b0C or 2\'c2\'b0C, then there will be extremely hot summers across Australia, more frequent drought conditions and more frequent heat leading to bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. Another study by the United Kingdom's Met Office reveals that the changing climate will make heat waves a common phenomena worldwide and even intense in the U.K.. In Africa, climate change has caused flooding, drought, change in the distribution of rainfall, and the drying up of rivers. It has affected\'c2\~agriculture, food security and human health. And it has also led to conflicts over resources, impacting national security in various countries. In Kenya, residents of West Pokot County are currently grappling with the deaths of 50 people who were last week buried alive by landslides following heavy rainfall that continues to pound the East African region. According to the Kenya Meteorological Department, the above-normal rainfall has been caused by sea surface temperature anomalies in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans caused by global warming. Floods in the region, which have already displaced hundreds of households and have swept away bridges, roads and property, are expected to continue for the next three weeks, according to the meteorological focus. However, Mwenda believes that all is not lost. He notes that though the Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) are inadequate to lead to emission levels required by science and justice, there is still hope that momentum building on their implementation won't be compromised. ""We will not be tired of telling our leaders that the future generations will judge them harshly as they have failed to rise to the occasion even when science is very clear that we have exceeded planetary boundaries,"" he said. In order to address climate change adequately, civil society is also calling for a dedicated financial mechanism to be established in Madrid to support Loss and Damage with a clear agreement on new sources of finance. During the 19th round of negotiations in Poland, the COP established the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (Loss and Damage Mechanism), to address loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change, including extreme events and slow onset events, in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. ""As we head to Madrid, we expect that all countries will endeavour to deliver on ambitious commitments in climate finance, especially in regard to loss and damage, strong national targets, and clear rules on trading emissions between countries,"" said Robert Bakiika, the Executive Director of EMLI Bwaise Facility, a Ugandan NGO and one of the admitted observer organisations at the UNFCCC. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA220","SECRETARY-GENERAL'S REMARKS AT OPENING CEREMONY OF UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE COP25","December 2, 2019 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by United Nations Secretary-General: [as delivered] Excellencies, Honourable guests, Delegates, All protocol observed, Quiero agradecer a los gobiernos de Chile y de Espaa por haber trabajado juntos en un espritu de multilateralismo inclusivo para tornar a esta COP25 posible y felicitarlos por la impecable organizacin conseguida en un tan corto espacio de tiempo. Felicitaciones y muchas gracias. Such solidarity and flexibility are what we need in the race to beat the climate emergency. We stand at a critical juncture in our collective efforts to limit dangerous global heating. Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned? The other option is the path of hope. A path of resolve, of sustainable solutions. A path where more fossil fuels remain where they should be in the ground and where we are on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. That is the only way to limit global temperature rise to the necessary 1.5 degrees by the end of this century. The best available science, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us today that going beyond that would lead us to catastrophic disaster. Millions throughout the world especially young people are calling on leaders from all sectors to do more, much more, to address the climate emergency we face. They know we need to get on the right path today, not tomorrow. That means important decisions must be made now. COP25 is our opportunity. Dear Delegates, Before I focus on what we need to do at this session, let me step back to give a sense of perspective to our deliberations. The latest, just-released data from the World Meteorological Organization show that levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high. Global average levels of carbon dioxide reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018. And I remember, not long ago, 400 parts per million was seen as an unthinkable tipping point. We are well over it. The last time there was a comparable concentration of CO2 was between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today. The signs are unmissable. The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded. The consequences are already making themselves felt in the form of more extreme weather events and associated disasters, from hurricanes to drought to floods to wildfires. Ice caps are melting. In Greenland alone, 179 billion tonnes of ice melted in July. Permafrost in the Arctic is thawing 70 years ahead of projections. Antarctica is melting three times as fast as a decade ago. Ocean levels are rising quicker than expected, putting some of our biggest and most economically important cities at risk. More than two-thirds of the world's megacities are located by the sea. And while the oceans are rising, they are also being poisoned. Oceans absorb more than a quarter of all CO2 in the atmosphere and generate more than half our oxygen. Absorbing more and more carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans and threatens all life within them. Three major reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on land, on the oceans and cryosphere, and on the 1.5 degree Celsius climate goal each confirm that we are knowingly destroying the very support systems keeping us alive. And indeed, we are. In several regions of the world, coal power plants continue to be planned and built in large numbers. Either we stop this addiction to coal or all our efforts to tackle climate change will be doomed. And, as the UN Environment Programme has just revealed, countries are planning to produce fossil fuels over the next decade at over double the level that is consistent with keeping temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And the fossil fuel industry is not alone. From agriculture to transportation, from urban planning and construction to cement, steel and other carbon-intensive industries, we are far from a sustainable path. What we need is not an incremental approach, but a transformational one. We need a rapid and deep change in the way we do business, how we generate power, how we build cities, how we move, and how we feed the world. If we don't urgently change our way of life, we jeopardize life itself. For the past year, I have been saying we need to make progress on carbon pricing, shift taxation from income to carbon, ensure no new coal plants are built after 2020, and end the allocation of taxpayers' money for perverse fossil fuel subsidies. We must also ensure that the transition to a green economy is a just transition one that recognizes the need to care for the future of negatively impacted workers, in terms of new jobs, lifelong education, and social safety nets. If we want change, we must be that change. Choosing the path of hope is not the job of one person, one industry or one government alone. We are all in this together. The road map established by the scientific community is clear. To limit global temperature rise to the necessary 1.5 degrees by the end of this century, we must reduce emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and we must achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Ten years ago, if countries had acted on the science available, they would have needed to reduce emissions by 3.3 per cent each year. We didn't. Today, we need to reduce emissions by 7.6 per cent each year to reach our goals. So, it is imperative that governments not only honour their national contributions under the Paris Agreement, they need to substantially increase their ambitions. And even if the Paris commitments are fully met, it would not be enough. But unfortunately, many countries are not even doing that. And the results are there to be seen. According to the latest Emissions Gap Report from the UN Environment Programme, greenhouse gas emissions have risen 1.5 per cent a year over the last decade. At current trends, we are looking at global heating of between 3.4 and 3.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The impact on all life on the planet including ours will be catastrophic. The only solution is rapid, ambitious, transformative action by all governments, regions, cities, businesses and civil society, all working together towards a common goal. That was the purpose of the Climate Action Summit I convened in September. And in many ways it was encouraging. Small island nations and least developed countries, major cities and regional economies all came with initiatives, as did a sizable representation from the private and financial sectors. Some 70 countries announced their intention to submit enhanced national contributions in 2020, with 65 countries and major subnational economies committing to work for net zero emissions by 2050. I am pleased to see governments and investors backing away from fossil fuels. A recent example is the European Investment Bank, which has announced it will stop funding fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021. But we are still waiting for transformative movement from most G20 countries, which represent more than three-quarters of global emissions. My new report on the Summit sets out what needs to be done going forward. Primarily, all the main emitters must do more. This means enhancing national determined contributions in 2020 under the Paris Agreement, presenting a carbon neutrality strategy for 2050, and embarking on the decarbonization of key sectors, particularly energy, industry, construction, and transport. Without the full engagement of the big emitters all our efforts will be completely undermined. A green economy is not one to be feared but an opportunity to be embraced, one that can advance our efforts to achieve all the Sustainable Development Goals. But what frustrates me is the slow pace of change, especially given that most of the tools and technologies we need are already available. So, my call to you all today is to increase your ambition and urgency. Dear Delegates, You are here at COP25 to reach progress on key items namely, achieving success on Article Six and continuing to boost ambition in preparation for new and revised national climate action plans due next year. Article Six was the outstanding issue not resolved at COP24 in Katowice. To put a price on carbon is vital if we are to have any chance of limiting global temperature rise and avoiding runaway climate change. Operationalizing Article Six will help get markets up and running, mobilize the private sector, and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone. Failure to operationalize Article Six risks fragmenting the carbon markets and sends a negative message that can undermine our overall climate efforts. I urge all Parties to overcome their current divisions and to find common understanding on this issue. The COP will also advance work related to capacity-building, deforestation, indigenous peoples, cities, finance, technology, gender and more. And it must complete several technical matters to achieve the full operationalization of the transparency framework under the Paris Agreement. The tasks are many, our timelines are tight, and every item is important. It is imperative to complete our work and we have no time to spare. But as important as the successful conclusion of the negotiations, the COP25 must convey to the world a firm determination to change course. We must finally demonstrate that we are serious in our commitment to stop the war against nature that we have the political will to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. I expect all governments will be able to commit now to review during this next year on the way to COP26 in Glasgow their nationally determined contributions with the necessary ambition to defeat the climate emergency. Ambition in mitigation, ambition in adaptation, and ambition in finance. And let us not forget, we should ensure that at least $100 billion US dollars a year are available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and take into account their legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery. Dear Delegates, The decisions we make here will ultimately define whether we choose a path of hope, or a path of surrender. Remember: we made a commitment to the people of the world through the Paris Agreement. Let us open our ears to the multitudes who are demanding change. Let us open our eyes to the imminent threat facing us all. Let us open our minds to the unanimity of the science. There is no time and no reason to delay. We have the tools, we have the science, we have the resources. Let us show we also have the political will that people demand from us. To do anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human family and all the generations to come. Thank you. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA221","5 Key Actions for COP25 to Bolster Global Health","November 28, 2019 Thursday 1:52 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The United Nations World Health Organization issued the following news release: The 25th UN Climate Conference ( COP25 ) will be a key moment to finalize the rulebook for the Paris Agreement on climate change. It will have a strong focus on increasing climate ambition, strengthening the implementation of climate policy, and dealing with the climate change impacts the world is already experiencing. The World Health Organization and the global health community call on governments, businesses, institutions and financial actors to deliver an ambitious COP, and recommend 5 key actions that will both increase climate ambition and protect our health. Commit to save lives, cut carbon emissions and clean air Air pollution kills over seven million people a year, and 2/3 of outdoor air pollution is from burning fossil fuels. As a national or subnational government, you can achieve air quality that is safe for your citizens, and bring down the carbon emissions that are driving climate change. Following the UN Climate Action summit in September 2019, over 50 national and 80 subnational governments representing over a billion people, have already joined the Clean Air Initiative, committing to achieve WHO Air Quality Guideline values, and align their climate and air quality policies, by 2030. Act Now: Join the Clean Air Initiative here ( HYPERLINK https://www.who.int/globalchange/commit/en/ https://www.who.int/globalchange/commit/en/ ). Commit to invest in climate action, public health and sustainable development The global health benefits of strong climate mitigation outweigh the financial costs, and there are highly cost-effective health interventions to protect people from climate risks. However, less than 0.5% of multilateral climate finance goes to health protection. As a financial actor, you can commit to significantly scale up your investment in proven interventions for climate-resilient health systems, and in air quality monitoring and policy implementation. Following a call for financial health commitments at the UN Climate Action summit in September 2019, a new philanthropic fund to tackle air pollution was created. A great first step, but more climate finance still needs to be directed towards protecting public health in order to build a healthy, climate-resilient future. Act Now: Commit to invest in climate action and public health here ( HYPERLINK https://www.who.int/globalchange/commit/en/ https://www.who.int/globalchange/commit/en/ ). Place health at the heart of the Paris Agreement By systematically addressing the health impacts and health opportunities from climate actions in Nationally Determined Contributions - as well as National Adaptation Plans, climate finance pledges, and National Communications to the UNFCCC - the Paris Agreement could become the strongest international health agreement of the century. Act Now: Learn more about the close connection of health and climate change, and how to reflect this in NDCs, here ( https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health ). Implement and monitor national policies that protect the health of your citizens from climate change In a WHO country survey of 101 governments, about half reported to have developed a national health and climate change strategy or plan. Only 53% of governments reported a high to moderate level of implementation of their strategies, and less than 10% indicated to have sufficient budget to fully cover their implementation costs. For the Paris Agreement to be effective at protecting the world's most vulnerable, all levels of government need to prioritize the health impacts of climate change. This can be achieved by cross-ministerial collaboration to carry out health Vulnerability and Adaptation assessments (V&#38;As), develop the health components of National Adaptation Plans (H-NAPS), invest in climate-resilient health systems, and track progress. Act Now: Collaborate with WHO and the UNFCCC to monitor national progress on health and climate change, through the Health and Climate Change Country Profiles. Evaluate and promote the health co-benefits from climate action The value of health gains from climate action are about twice as large as the cost of mitigation policies at global level, and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. Quantifying the health co-benefits from taking climate actions allows for a more balanced cost-benefit analysis when designing policies, and offers a strong argument when gathering support for the transformative changes needed. Mobilizing the health community as trusted advocates, can transform public support for climate action. Act Now: Quantify the health and economic consequences from domestic carbon reductions, e.g. by using WHO's CarbonH tool., and connect to the growing worldwide community of health advocates for climate action, for example through the WHO-Civil Society Working Group on Climate Change and Health.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA222","CLIMATE CHANGE: A TALE OF WEATHER EXTREMES WITH MIXED FORTUNES FOR ZAMBIA","January 15, 2020 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","It is early Saturday morning and Planeta Hatuleke, a small scale farmer of Pemba District in Southern Zambia, awakens to the comforting sound of rainfall. As the locals say, the ""heavens have opened"" and it is raining heavily after a prolonged dry spell.\'c2\~ ""This is welcome after two weeks of a dry spell,"" says Hatuleke with a sigh of relief. ""The rainfall pattern has not been consistent so far; we could be headed for a repeat of last season"" she adds pessimistically. The 2018/19 farming season was characterised by drought and prolonged dry spells, which, according to the government\'c2\~Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU), left 2.3 million people severely food insecure and in need of humanitarian food assistance. Hatuleke along with her 8-member family members are part of the hunger stricken population. Last farming season, the family harvested only five 50Kg-bags of maize, 10 short of their annual food requirements. ""It has not been easy to feed my family since the five bags finished. I am grateful to government for relief food support but for big families like mine, we have to supplement through other means,"" says the 55-year old widow. ""As a family, we have been surviving on sales from our gardening activities."" Statistics from DMMU show that at least 70,000 metric tonnes of relief food (maize grain and maize meal) has been distributed to the affected people between September 2019 and January 2020. According World Food Programme (WFP) country director for Zambia, Jennifer Bitonde, the United Nations' food agency ""requires $36 million to effectively support the government in responding to the crisis."" WFP is currently supporting the government's response by delivering government-supplied maize meal, as well as by procuring and delivering pulses to ensure a nutrition-sensitive food basket. WFP is also working closely with partners to monitor food distributions and guarantee that resources reach those most in need. In a statement after receiving a contribution of $3.39 million from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help meet the immediate food needs of drought-affected people in Zambia, Bitonde added that ""USAID's contribution represents approximately 10 percent of the total needs and will allow WFP to ensure that drought-affected people will not go to bed hungry during this year's lean season.'' Other partners who have made a contribution to WFP Zambia include the Swedish government, which has contributed $2 million, and the Italian government with a contribution of $ 610,000. Last October, the three U.N. food agencies-the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and WFP-called for urgent funding to avert a major hunger crisis and for the international community to step up investment in long-term measures to combat the impact of climate shocks and build the capacity of communities and countries to withstand them. They warned that a record 45 million people across the 16-nation Southern African Development Community would be severely food insecure in the next six months starting from October 2019. At the time, they reported that there were more than 11 million people experiencing ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" levels of food insecurity (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Phases 3 and 4) in nine countries: Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, Eswatini and Lesotho.\'c2\~ ""Late rains, extended dry periods, two major cyclones and economic challenges have proved a recipe for disaster for food security and livelihoods across Southern Africa,"" said Alain Onibon, FAO's Sub-Regional Coordinator for Southern Africa. ""As it could take many farming communities at least two to three growing seasons to return to normal production, immediate support is vital. \'c2\~Now is the time to scale up agricultural emergency response. We need to ensure farmers and agro-pastoralists take advantage of the forecasted good rains, assuming they happen, as this will be crucial in helping them rebuild their livelihoods."" While Southern Africa has experienced normal rainfall in just one of the last five growing seasons, persistent drought, back-to-back cyclones and flooding have wreaked havoc on harvests in a region overly dependent on rain-fed, smallholder agriculture. Interestingly, Zambia is experiencing both climate extremes at the same time. While farmers in the southwestern parts of the country are anxious about the rainfall pattern that has been erratic so far, their counterparts in the northeast are battling flash floods, adding pressure on the already overstretched resource base. Over 300 families have been reported as being affected by floods in the Mambwe and Lumezi districts of Zambia's Eastern Province. And Zambian President Edgar Lungu, continues to urge government technocrats to work at finding a lasting solution to the climate problem. ""So as we provide relief, I think that we should put our heads together. My Permanent Secretaries are here so we can work together to find a lasting solution,"" said Lungu when he toured and interacted with flood victims on\'c2\~Jan 9.\'c2\~\'c2\~ It is unanimously agreed globally that climate change is due to human activities that cause damage (either directly or indirectly) to the environment. Such activities include overexploitation of natural resources, pollution and deforestation, among others. Experiencing a critical energy deficit, with over 2 million food-insecure people to feed due to a climate-induced droughts and flash floods in a single year, are key lessons for leaders and ordinary people alike. This December, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ), Zambia's Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources Ndashe Yumba highlighted the adverse effects of climate change on his country's natural resource-sensitive sectors, such as energy and agriculture, and how the country was moving away from a business-as-usual approach. ""There is still increasing evidence that climate change is negatively impacting critical sectors of our country,"" said Yumba during a high-level event at COP25 . ""In the recent past, drastic reduction in precipitation and rising temperatures in Zambia has led to a reduced agricultural productivity by about 16 percent and subsequently slowed down our economic growth. While Zambia is still pursuing her aspirations on socio-economic development, it is mindful of the need to maintain a healthy environment in order to achieve sustainable development...a recipe to a healthy climate is a healthy environment,"" he added. Back in\'c2\~Pemba District in Southern Zambia, Hatuleke is hoping that climate smart agricultural principles which are routed in sustainable environmental management, and which she has recently implemented, will bring her a better harvest this year.\'c2\~ ""I ripped my field and planted early; just after the first rains in mid-November and as you can see, my maize is at tussling stage,"" she says. ""I am hopeful of a good harvest, provided it consistently rains in the remaining half of the season."" \"

Guess who No. 1 is. I'll put the answer in the ""And finally..."" section below. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Impeachment investigation Welcome to the next phase of the impeachment investigation. The House Judiciary Committee is officially in control now, and will kick off its first round of hearings today. Don't expect any fireworks, though: Participants in these hearings will discuss the finer points of the impeachment case in terms of Constitutional and federal laws. Keep an eye on\~House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. He'll be the one helming the process, and he's responsible for deciding on the scope of the articles of impeachment and whether or not to include things outside of the Ukraine situation, like information from the Russia investigation. As for the report that the House\~Intelligence Committee sent over to the Judiciary Committee, it's pretty damning. The 300-page report alleges\~Trump abused his power and obstructed justice in his Ukraine dealings, and calls the evidence for those claims\~""overwhelming.""\~ 2. NATO World leaders will wrap up the two-day 70th anniversary NATO summit today by discussing\~how the alliance can ""be the bedrock of peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area."" That's no easy feat given the strained relationships between many of its members. President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron continued to trade barbs yesterday, but Trump seemed to have better luck with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said today that meetings between the two have been ""successful."" Trump and Johnson reportedly discussed the future of NATO, the state of Syria and global security matters. Today, alliance members are also scheduled to discuss their relationship with Russia (not a NATO member) and the challenging rise of China.\~ 3. Election 2020 Kamala Harris is out. The Senator from California officially ended her 2020 presidential campaign yesterday, citing a lack of financial resources and unmoving poll numbers. It's a rather abrupt exit for someone who was once seen as a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, and her absence significantly cuts into the diversity of the strongest remaining candidates. Now that Harris is out, only six Democrats have raised enough money to guarantee a spot on December's debate stage, and they're all white: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer.\~New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is among the other contenders trying frantically to up their fundraising numbers to make the December 12\~debate deadline. 4. COP25 Around 25,000 people from 200 countries have gathered in\~Madrid this week to attend the COP25 climate change conference. Among them is 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who sailed across the Atlantic for three weeks to get there. Conference leaders have issued a dire message, saying the meeting represents the ""point of no return"" in the climate emergency. Over the next two weeks,\~global leaders will try to come up with a practical plan for cutting emissions to stem the threat of global warming. The plan will probably include an\~international emission-trading system, where\~governments and businesses can trade their greenhouse gas output. For instance, if one party keeps their emissions below a certain threshold, they can sell their remaining allowance to someone else.\~ 5.

The role of International Standards as essential tools for action on climate change in many countries was emphasized at the ISO-organized side event ""Carbon Neutral Transitions and Standards as a 'Measure, Reduce, Compensate' Toolkit"" held on 4 December 2019 within the framework of COP 25 . ""To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, we need urgent action by everyone. But that action needs to be credible,"" he said. ""We are at risk of seeing a race to the bottom among actors wishing to be seen as ""climate-friendly"", including those claiming climate neutrality. ISO standards and internationally agreed rules and guidelines play a crucial role in ensuring such credibility."" Naranjo was speaking at the ISO-led event about the role of standards in achieving carbon neutrality and presented examples from UNFCCC Climate Neutral Now, an initiative to encourage everyone in society to play their part in achieving a climate-neutral world. The event was held as part of the 25th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP 25 ) taking place under the presidency of Chile and held in Madrid, Spain, from 2-13 December 2019. The keynote presentation was delivered by Laura Mora, from the government of Costa Rica, who highlighted the country's pioneering climate leadership as well as the importance of standards for their national carbon neutrality programme (Programa Pais Carbono Neutralidad, PPCN). Other guest speakers included Tetsuya Tanaka from the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The Task Force TF7 works with experts from across ISO committees, guiding them to address critical aspects of climate change in ISO standards. Nick Blyth, Chair of the ISO TF7, stressed the importance of International Standards in helping organizations achieve their climate action goals and address their carbon footprint. ""ISO standards are increasingly recognized as an essential part of the climate action toolbox through enabling organizations to measure their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and take appropriate measures to reduce them,"" he said. The event was also an opportunity to discuss the proposal for a new project on carbon neutrality, which will provide the requirements and principles to achieve that through the quantification, management, avoidance, reduction and compensation of GHG emissions.

Below are the Speaker's remarks: Speaker Pelosi. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your leadership. It's an honor to be with each and every one of you and all of you, because we're here at the heart of the matter - the vulnerable countries, vulnerable. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister, for your courage and taking on the leadership of all of this. Bringing your experience from the challenges you face to the reputation you enjoy, we're all blessed by your leadership. [Laughter] Madam Chair from Texas - Madam Chair, thank you - Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the [Science, Space and Technology] Committee; Frank Pallone, Chair of Energy and Commerce; Scott Peters of California, member of the - of that committee; Mike Levin, member of the Select Committee on Climate; Jared Huffman, member of the Select Committee, as well from California; Joe Neguse of Colorado; Mr. Casten from Illinois - Did I reach everyone here"" All of them? We're very proud of them, because they have at the top of their agenda their priority to recognize the U.S. goal in saving this planet for future generations. This is a mission. This is a passion. This is a scientifically-based approach to all of our views. And we are here to say to all of you, on behalf of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States, we're still in it. We are still in it. [Applause] We are - it's an honor, Patrick, to be with you and to all of the distinguished guests who are here. Patricia - oh no, we lost Patricia - but Patricia has been to California. She's seen what our Governor Jerry Brown and, now, our current Governor Gavin Newsom are doing in this, but you made two examples across the country: mayors, governors, non-profits, for-profits, the private sector - everyone understands. But nobody understands it better than our children, than what is at stake and I'm so glad that we have a youth representative that will be here, because the future is yours and you have a responsibility to save it, as well as to urge us to help you do so. Here's how we see it: we see this as an existential threat. Mr. President, you were twelve, but I was at the Rio Conference, and we never would have suspected then, with all the ambition that we have - had then, that we would be where we are today, fighting this fight. We have not, we have not lived up to the challenge. They say the challenge that was generational, continues to be generational. We see it as a public health issue. Clean air, clean water for everyone, including the most vulnerable, of course, because the most vulnerable, whether it's other nation or a vulnerable community pay the biggest price. Clean air, clean water, public health. We see it as an economic issue, because this is a way for us to [advance] new green technologies, based on science and technology to take us into the future, while creating good-paying jobs, lifting everyone up. And we have seen, Mr. President, when we were recently in the Northern Triangle of Central America, migration resulting from the fact that farmers can't farm because of drought, one thing or another. Everything in nature is connected and it becomes a national security issue, when the competition for resources, land and the rest. So, mitigation and resilience and all the rest of that, have to be so much a part of all of this and not - nowhere does it fall harder than the vulnerable nations. And, then we see it as a moral issue. When we were in Rio, they had a big religious service, every aspect of religion or no religion, but just belief in the future, and that was about our moral responsibility. If you believe, as some of us do, that this is God's creation, that we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. Being real sure, that if you're faith-based or lack thereof, that we all do believe we have a moral responsibility to future generations to pass on this planet in a better way, in the best possible way. So, that is the agenda that we bring, that and other - technology and science and the rest of that being the basis for how we can lead the challenge, but it is something very, very - how can I say this"" - urgent to the people of the United States. They understand it. Our young people are leading the way, as they are in the rest of the country. I just want to say, next year, the G-7 will meet in San Francisco - no - in the United States. It will probably be in Washington. I'd like it to be in San Francisco, that's my home district. But, the reason I mention that is because in a meeting we had this year was in France - it was in Brest - we focused on the oceans and the challenge to the oceans. By 2050, if we don't do things differently, there can be as many tons of plastics in the oceans as there are tons of fish in the ocean. That's the urgency of addressing this urgently. And, I'm glad that this is a blue cup about the oceans, as well. And I just will say this, when we focused on the - they had the G-7 of the heads of state, and then we had the G-7 of the heads of parliament and in the heads of parliament meeting, in Brest, in France, under leadership of the Prime - the President of the National Assembly, we focused on climate and the oceans. Next year, when we have one in the United States, the title of our meeting for the heads of parliament is 'Addressing the Climate Crisis with Economic and Environmental Justice for All.' We see this as a big environmental justice issue, as well. I just want to quote His Holiness the Pope, as I close - did I say I was closing already"" His Holiness, when he came to Congress and spoke to us a few years ago, he said, and he wrote in his encyclical, no doubt they've seen, 'The climate is a common good belonging to all and meant for all.' Together we can and must build a climate resilient - now, this is me, I just wanted to - a resilient world to defend that common good now and for generations to come. For health, for the economy, for security, national security and for honoring our responsibilities to future generations. That's why we have such a large, distinguished delegation, chairs of the committees working on this issue. We've had already 100 hearings already on this subject, on the subject of climate. We are preparing legislation, as we go forward. We are here to listen and learn from all of you, as to how we can do better. Thank you all very much for the opportunity. \"

Seychelles, Belize, Indonesia and Costa Rica were among Parties that signaled their support during the 25th Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ), held in Madrid from 2-13 December. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required to submit new and improved commitments, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), every five years. Next year is the first milestone for countries to submit new or updated NDCs since the agreement was adopted in 2016. Coastal wetlands-such as mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal salt marshes-are home to some of the richest biodiversity on the planet, and\~scientists recognize their effectiveness in combatting climate change. For instance, mangrove forests can sequester three to five times more carbon per acre than other tropical forests. Along with coral reefs, they can also help communities adapt to climate change by buffering shorelines from strong storms and rising sea levels. But coastal habitats are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world: Half of the world's mangroves have been destroyed in the past 50 years, while at least a third of coral reefs have died as a result of warming ocean waters, pollution, and other factors. Simon Reddy, director of Pew's protecting coastal wetlands and coral reefs project, issued this statement: ""The role of coastal wetlands in contributing to the health of our planet has been neglected for too long. It's encouraging to see growing recognition of the role these vital ecosystems can play as nature-based solutions for combatting climate change and making communities more resilient to its impacts. ""By including more protections for, and restoration of, coastal wetlands in their NDCs, the Seychelles, Belize, Indonesia and Costa Rica are promoting the adaptation, mitigation, and resilience values of thesepowerful ecosystems. ""We look forward to additional commitments next year from Parties that understand the importance of coastal habitats.""

Below are statements by Alden Meyer and Rachel Cleetus at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), on the final outcome of COP25 and what needs to occur before COP26 in Glasgow next November. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at UCS: ""I've been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we've seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action. ""Led by the youth, growing numbers of people around the world are demanding that their leaders take bold, ambitious actions to tackle the climate crisis. Nearly 70 countriesmost of them climate vulnerable, developing nationshave risen to the challenge by committing to enhance the ambition of their Paris pledges. ""But most of the world's biggest emitting countries are missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition. The outcome here in Madrid reflects that resistance, with the absence of any clarion call to actionboth on reigning in emissions and on climate financein the final decisions. If this stance doesn't change between now and next year's climate summit in Glasgow, it will make the task of meeting the well below 2 degrees Celsius temperature limitation goal that leaders agreed to in Parismuch less the 1.5 degrees Celsius goalalmost impossible. ""With the announcement of its Green Deal and its commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, the European Union is showing welcome indications of taking a leadership role. To break the current logjam, the European Union must commit to raise the ambition of its 2030 reduction target as early in 2020 as possible, putting it in a position to engage major-emitting countries like China and India on increasing their ambition as well. ""Despite its announced intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the United States resisted efforts to make progress on several Paris implementation issues; most egregiously, the U.S. delegation refused to acknowledge the responsibility of the United States and other industrialized nations to assist countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change through no fault of their own. These impacts are going to increase over the coming years, and it's essential to mobilize much greater support for the countries and communities that are facing ever-more-devastating impacts of climate change. ""The planet is on fire and our window of escape is getting harder and harder to reach the longer we wait to act. World leaders have a clear choice: stand by the blockers of progress such as the United States and Brazil that prioritize the profits of the fossil fuel polluters and big agribusiness over the well-being of their citizens, or listen to the voices of their people; the scientific community; and youth, indigenous, labor, business, environmental, social justice, faith and other leaders working hard to create a better world for current and future generations. It's time to choose."" Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist in the Climate and Energy Program at UCS: ""At a time when the science and the urgent need to address the human toll of climate impacts couldn't be clearer, the deeply flawed outcome here in Madrid is plainly unjust and immoral. Instead of stepping up to respond to the demands from youth, indigenous people and climate vulnerable communities around the world, major emitters and rich countries have failed them. And despite hearing powerful calls to action from nations fighting for their very existence, the richest countries most responsible for climate change have done little to provide funding to help them in their time of need. ""The United States came into these talks having already announced its shameful intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Over the last two weeks, they proceeded to take numerous opportunities to ensure a poor outcome by inserting poison pills into key decisions such as around loss and damage. Others, including Australia, Brazil and Japan, were complicit in blocking a more ambitious outcome in here in Madrid, while the European Union failed to lead in the way many had hoped. China and India, too, fell short in committing to greater ambition. ""We already have at our fingertips many of the technologies needed to sharply reduce global warming emissions and know what it takes to make a rapid and just transition to a low-carbon economy. Whether in the United States or in the global south, communities on the frontlines of climate change are already struggling with intensifying tropical storms and wildfires, extreme heat, rising seas and drought, and they urgently need investments in climate resilience. ""Yet, those in power remain beholden to the very fossil fuel corporations driving this global emergency, much to the detriment of the people they are bound to serve. The people of the world who care about the future of our planet will not give up the fight for bold, transformative climate action. The pressure is on to exert power from the streets to the highest levels of government to secure ambition well ahead of COP26 in Glasgow and beyond."" \"

Recognising the urgency to raise climate ambition and action now, panellists showcased initiatives aimed at mobilising the private sector to advance long-term climate policies and achieve the emission targets outlined in the Paris Agreement. Chambers Climate Coalition On behalf of ICC, Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO discussed the significance of the Chambers Climate Coalition, which represents an unprecedented grassroots mobilisation of more than 2,100 Chambers of Commerce - representing over 10 million local business leaders - in support of ambitious climate action aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5degreeC above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. The Chambers Climate Coalition includes broad support from communities and regions around the world, including signatories from across six continents. Speaking to the Coalition's widespread support from local business, Mr Denton said: ""This is not a movement of the North, this is a movement of the world."" For Mr Denton, the Coalition represents a common framework that can be used to amplify private sector innovation and mitigation investment opportunities. ""We need to make sure there is alignment to make sure that business can take action on climate,"" Mr Denton said. Step up climate action together Paul Polman, Chair of ICC, discussed the immediate need for business, government and civil society to work together to step up climate ambition. ""There is no doubt that the IPPC report has not only made clear that the 1.5 is still possible but that it also requires more radical and urgent transformation."" Despite the clear warning signs of the IPPC report, Mr Polman warned that governments are in many cases impeding private-sector climate ambition. ""Business in many areas has started to move faster than governments and government policy is starting to hold us back,"" he said. Biodiversity matters Increasingly, business leaders are also taking concrete action to reverse nature loss and protect the world's natural ecosystem. Most notably, Business for Nature, an umbrella organisation of more than 40 business and conservation organisations - including ICC, one of the initial partners - is mobilising the private sector to pursue commitments, solutions and policies aimed at protecting biodiversity. On advancing business ambition on biodiversity, Eva Zabey, Executive Director, Business for Nature said: ""We can't reach a 1.5 net zero world without using nature as our ally. We've all come together to unify the business voice to give the policymakers the courage and comfort to make really ambitious agreements on nature in 2020."" Ahead of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Kunming, China, ICC is working hand in hand with Business for Nature to mobilise business leaders to conserve natural ecosystems and restore biodiversity loss.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA233","Save the Children Analysis Reveals Natural Disasters Claimed 1,200 Lives Across East & Southern Africa in 2019","December 3, 2019 Tuesday 7:25 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Save the Children issued the following news release:    - As world leaders meet at COP25 , Save the Children calls for commitments to greater action to reduce impact of climate change on children    2019 will be remembered as the year the climate crisis devastated parts of east and southern Africa, with floods, landslides, drought and cyclones leaving at least 33 million people at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse, according to new analysis by Save the Children. KEY FACTS  Climate crisis contributes to least 33 million people in the region - or 10 percent of the population across ten countries - at emergency levels of food insecurity or worse/1. Over 16 million are believed to be children/2.  New analysis from Save the Children shows more than 1,200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi/3.  Southern Africa is warming at twice the global rate/4 and many countries have been buffeted by multiple shocks, including Mozambique experiencing two strong cyclones in the same season for the first time in recorded history.  As world leaders meet this week at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 A recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows increasing evidence that climate change is contributing to higher temperatures in the region, and that these temperatures are exacerbating the impacts of drought and flooding/5. These climate shocks decimate livelihoods, leaving households desperate for food and putting children at risk of acute malnutrition - a life threatening condition requiring urgent treatment. Children also bear close to 90 percent of the burden of disease attributable to climate change, such as malaria and dengue fever/6. Repeated erratic and extreme weather events in east and southern Africa has meant that in 2019:  At least 1,200 people lost their lives as the result of cyclones, floods and landslides in Mozambique, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Malawi/7. This figure does not include the thousands of lives lost to drought, and Save the Children fears that soaring hunger levels over the past 12 months will have contributed to further loss of life as well as malnutrition, particularly amongst infants.  Ten countries across East and Southern Africa - Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya - are experiencing an ongoing weather-induced crises, with an average of 10 percent of people living in these countries currently experiencing serious hunger/8. With high populations of children - a total of 162 million under 18 year-olds across the ten countries - Save the Children estimates these figures include over 16 million children now at crisis or emergency levels of hunger/9.  Massive movements of people have created additional risks of children being exploited, separated from their families, or dropping out of school. By June 2019/10, over 1 million people across seven of the ten countries had been newly displaced by climate-related shocks/11. Over half of these displacements were the result of Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi in March 2019, and was followed six weeks later by Cyclone Kenneth, which was the first time in Mozambique's recorded history of two strong tropical cyclones in the same season. The storms were also the strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent/12. By June 2019, the number of people forced to flee their homes as a result of climate shocks in the region was already the same as for the whole of 2018/13, and does not count more recent displacements from floods which have struck Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan over the past three months. These disasters have currently displaced at least an additional 1.1 million people/14, compared to 1,021,600 at the end of 2018. Based on the current trajectory, this figure could double by the end of 2019. Save the Children is urging the international community to take greater steps to tackle the climate crisis and its impact on children around the world, which is vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2030 Agenda Pledge to Leave No One Behind and ultimately the rights of all children as outlined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. As part of this, the international community needs to work with governments in east and southern Africa and across the globe to support the development and implementation of national action plans on climate change. Amran is a 13-year-old girl whose home was flooded when the banks of the Shabelle River broke in Beledweyne, Somalia. Amran is now living in a tent with her parents and three siblings. Amran said, ""I was very horrified when I heard the water is coming and will be reaching our house. I did not know what would happen to me and my family. We were all very scared."" Save the Children's Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, Ian Vale, said: ""The findings of this analysis are grim, and show that the climate crisis is further entrenching inequality, poverty and displacement across East and Southern Africa. The climate crisis is happening here, it's killing people, it's forcing them from their homes, and it's ruining children's chance of a future. ""With these overlapping, unrelenting emergencies, the humanitarian system is also being stretched to breaking point. Repeated cycles of food insecurity from climate-related shocks is resulting in significant funding shortfalls and unmet humanitarian needs. We are reaching a crisis point in this region. ""As world leaders come together for COP25 , we call on them to take strong decisions to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure the lives and futures of our children is protected. We call on donors to increase and sustain funding for humanitarian assistance across East and Southern Africa, with initiatives linked to existing measures to increase children's protection, access to health and education, and livelihood support. And most importantly, children need to be actively involved in international, national and local efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change."" Save the Children is the global leader in protecting children in emergencies and natural disasters, working with communities to set up evacuation routes, pre-position emergency supplies, fight against the effects of drought and access clean water.

We do whatever it takes for children - every day and in times of crisis - transforming their lives and the future we share.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA234","PENN SENDS LARGEST EVER DELEGATION TO UN CLIMATE CONFERENCE","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of Pennsylvania: At this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 25 , now in its second week in Madrid, Penn has its largest presence ever, with representatives from the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, Perry World House (PWH), Penn Law, the Weitzman School of Design, and the Penn Institute for Urban Research (Penn IUR). For the first time, the University also secured observer status, an initiative driven by Kleinman's executive director, Cornelia Colijn. Having this status gave Penn the opportunity to nominate and support faculty, staff, and students to attend COP on official credentials, Colijn says. ""It meant the University was able to join the governments, international organizations and nonprofits, businesses, and members of civil society who are working on a range of climate change issues today."" Ovais Sarmad, deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and Jocelyn Perry, global shifts program manager for Penn's Perry World House. (Image: Courtesy of Jocelyn Perry) ""This is all part of Penn building a collaborative relationship with UN Climate Change and the affiliate organizations and their policymakers,"" adds Jocelyn Perry, the global shifts program manager for Perry World House. COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and specifically it means member states who signed onto the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) created in 1992. The Paris Agreement came out of COP 21 in 2015. At the meeting happening now, treaty signatories are negotiating the rules of the Paris accord, such as how countries will track progress and what financing mechanisms will be put in place. COP 25 is the final gathering before 2020, the point at which many participating nations must submit new climate plans to UNFCCC. Beyond the member countries, observer-status participants like Penn join UN staff and other organizations to hold conversations around pertinent climate-related issues. ""Everyone who works on these at the international policy level will be at this conference,"" says Michael Weisberg, a Penn philosophy professor and the inaugural PWH faculty fellow, who has several roles at this year's gathering. Last Friday, he facilitated portions of an UNFCCC forum centered on oceans. His section focused on technology and innovation, funding, and education related to resilience and adaptation around sea-level rise. ""In many parts of the world, not only are they going to be the hardest hit from climate change and will have to do the most about resilience planning, but they also struggle with capacity and access to information,"" he says. ""In Philadelphia, we worry that sea-level rise will mean moving the airport. But in some places, it will mean moving whole towns."" Weisberg, Perry, and several other Penn representatives also participated in the Resilience Lab. ""This is a forward-looking UNFCCC initiative addressing future sustainability concerns,"" Perry says. ""It asks, What do we want to achieve by 2030, and how do we get there? It's focused on eight pathways for engagement, including equitable and just use of resources and building on indigenous expertise."" Mark Alan Hughes (second from left), founding faculty director of Penn's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, engaged in conversation with Maryke van Staden, manager of the Low Carbon Cities Program, Ashok-Alexander Sridharan, mayor of Bonn, Germany, and Mauricio Rodas, former mayor of Quito, Ecuador. At COP 25 , Penn also launched the City Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Financing Initiative (C2IFI), an effort to help connect cities to new financing mechanisms. (Image: Jocelyn Perry) Her panelwhich also included William Burke-White of Penn Law, Dina Ionesco of the UN Migration Agency, and Shyla Raghav, vice president of climate change for Conservation Internationalcovered climate displacement. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, the effects of climate change may displace more than 140 million people within their own countries; projections of climate-induced international displacement vary widely but could be immense. The Penn-led session touched on some challenging topics. ""With climate change and increasing climate-induced migration, especially forced displacement, how do we make that fair, equitable, and just for everyone affected? How do we build the legal structures at the highest levels of international and climate law and make them speak to one another?"" Perry says. ""How do you foresee conflicts over resources, as water or food become scarcer, and how do you proactively build the structures you need before the crisis hits rather than after?"" Penn also hosted a moderated discussion on climate-resilient urban infrastructure with the UNFCCC's Nairobi Work Program and other partners, and the Kleinman Center's Mark Alan Hughes introduced former Quito mayor Mauricio Rodas, a Penn alum and current visiting fellow with PWH and Penn IUR, for a talk he gave on climate financing for cities. This year, four Penn schools sent delegates, and Colijn says she's certain that in climate conferences to follow, the number interested will grow. ""It really shows just how interdisciplinary climate change is,"" she says, ""and the diversity of researchers and backgrounds needed to find solutions."" Representatives from the Stuart Weitzman School of Design include the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy executive director, Cornelia Colijn, and founding faculty director, Mark Alan Hughes, as well as Allison Lassiter, an assistant professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning. Representatives from Perry World House include Michael Weisberg, a professor in the Department of Philosophy in the School of Arts and Sciences and the inaugural PWH faculty fellow; Jocelyn Perry, global shifts program manager; William Burke-White, inaugural director and a professor in the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School; and Koko Warner, a PWH visiting fellow and manager of the Climate Impacts, Vulnerability, and Risks Subprogram at UNFCCC.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA235","Earthworks: Texas & New Mexico Communities & Experts Urge COP25 to Defuse Permian's Carbon Bomb","December 4, 2019 Wednesday 7:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Earthworks issued the following news release:    - Impacted residents travel to Madrid to highlight that planned infrastructure to process &#38; export Permian oil &#38; gas would guarantee catastrophic climate change    Today at an official COP25 side event Texas and New Mexico residents -- impacted by the extraction of Permian Basin oil &#38; gas, and by planned infrastructure to transport, process and export it -- informed delegates and other attendees that catastrophic climate change is inevitable unless the Permian infrastructure expansion is stopped. ""The Permian Basin is an oil and gas carbon bomb that's exploding, and it's happening right now. If we can't defuse it, the world cannot avoid catastrophic climate change. Major oil companies are trying to lock in decades more oil and gas demand by building infrastructure from the Permian to the Texas Gulf Coast to transport, process and export the world's largest current oil &#38; gas play,"" said Earthworks' Energy Campaigner Ethan Buckner. Between 2018 and 2050, production of new U.S. oil and gas reserves could unlock 120 billion metric tons of new carbon pollution. Meanwhile the U.S. -- thanks to Permian production -- just marked its first month as a net exporter since records have been kept. If production and expansion are not curtailed, U.S. oil and gas expansion will impede the rest of the world's ability to manage a climate-safe, equitable phase out of oil and gas production. Although communities across the region are bearing the brunt of impacts from oil, gas and petrochemical development, those most at risk from the Permian expansion are those already the most impacted by social and environmental injustice. And on Texas' Gulf Coast -- where the oil &#38; gas is processed and exported -- they're suffering twice: from the operations' toxic pollution, and from intensified climate change. ""I live less than two miles from the Ship Channel in the East End of Houston, TX. My dad was a United Steelworker who died of cancer in 2016, and I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that same year. So I'm well aware that workers and fenceline communities are paying with their health the price of daily exposure to toxic pollution from oil and gas infrastructure,"" said Ana Parras, Co-Executive Director Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services. ""America's national leadership has failed by placing short term gain over global sustainability and ecological responsibility. I am deeply concerned that the wild abandon and insane profits of the oil patch in Carlsbad have exacerbated the divide between rich and poor, creating serious economic injustices,"" said Reverend David Rogers, First Christian Church Disciples of Christ, Carlsbad, NM Scientific study and optical gas imaging videos demonstrate that the worst recorded oil and gas methane pollution is in the Permian Basin of Texas &#38; New Mexico. Because methane is 86 times more powerful a climate pollutant than carbon dioxide, and because it only stays in the atmosphere for 12 years while carbon dioxide remains for as long as 200 years, eliminating methane pollution is among the quickest, if not the quickest, way to mitigate future climate change impacts. ""I travel the Permian Basin with an optical gas imaging camera that makes visible the normally invisible methane pollution the oil &#38; gas industry often claims doesn't exist. If you could see what I see, there might not be a fracking boom. Seeing is believing,"" said Earthworks Field Advocate Nathalie Eddy.

Bob Wieckowski: State Senator Bob Wieckowski, who attended the 2015 COP 21 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, ... released the following statement after the Trump administration announced it was officially withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The decision makes the United States, the world's second-largest emitter, the only country to abandon the Agreement. ""While no surprise, today's action by the Trump administration is another example of its complete abdication of global leadership on climate issues. The rest of the world marches forward, investing in wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, solar panels and other clean energy sources. ""Trump continues to push policies that will make the United States more reliant on fossil fuels, worsen air quality and contribute to climate change.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA238","World's Nations Take Immoral Stance at COP25, Side With Trump, Bolsonaro Rather Than Youth Across the Globe","December 15, 2019 Sunday 7:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Union of Concerned Scientists issued the following news release: The UN climate talks taking place in Madrid, Spain, are on the verge of closing having set the record for the longest running COP. Below are statements by Alden Meyer and Rachel Cleetus at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), on the final outcome of COP25 and what needs to occur before COP26 in Glasgow next November. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at UCS: ""I've been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we've seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action. ""Led by the youth, growing numbers of people around the world are demanding that their leaders take bold, ambitious actions to tackle the climate crisis. Nearly 70 countries--most of them climate vulnerable, developing nations--have risen to the challenge by committing to enhance the ambition of their Paris pledges. ""But most of the world's biggest emitting countries are missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition. The outcome here in Madrid reflects that resistance, with the absence of any clarion call to action--both on reigning in emissions and on climate finance--in the final decisions. If this stance doesn't change between now and next year's climate summit in Glasgow, it will make the task of meeting the well below 2 degrees Celsius temperature limitation goal that leaders agreed to in Paris--much less the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal--almost impossible. ""With the announcement of its Green Deal and its commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, the European Union is showing welcome indications of taking a leadership role. To break the current logjam, the European Union must commit to raise the ambition of its 2030 reduction target as early in 2020 as possible, putting it in a position to engage major-emitting countries like China and India on increasing their ambition as well. ""Despite its announced intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the United States resisted efforts to make progress on several Paris implementation issues; most egregiously, the U.S. delegation refused to acknowledge the responsibility of the United States and other industrialized nations to assist countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change through no fault of their own. These impacts are going to increase over the coming years, and it's essential to mobilize much greater support for the countries and communities that are facing ever-more-devastating impacts of climate change. ""The planet is on fire and our window of escape is getting harder and harder to reach the longer we wait to act. World leaders have a clear choice: stand by the blockers of progress such as the United States and Brazil that prioritize the profits of the fossil fuel polluters and big agribusiness over the well-being of their citizens, or listen to the voices of their people; the scientific community; and youth, indigenous, labor, business, environmental, social justice, faith and other leaders working hard to create a better world for current and future generations. It's time to choose."" Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist in the Climate and Energy Program at UCS: ""At a time when the science and the urgent need to address the human toll of climate impacts couldn't be clearer, the deeply flawed outcome here in Madrid is plainly unjust and immoral. Instead of stepping up to respond to the demands from youth, indigenous people and climate vulnerable communities around the world, major emitters and rich countries have failed them. And despite hearing powerful calls to action from nations fighting for their very existence, the richest countries most responsible for climate change have done little to provide funding to help them in their time of need. ""The United States came into these talks having already announced its shameful intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Over the last two weeks, they proceeded to take numerous opportunities to ensure a poor outcome by inserting poison pills into key decisions such as around loss and damage. Others, including Australia, Brazil and Japan, were complicit in blocking a more ambitious outcome in here in Madrid, while the European Union failed to lead in the way many had hoped. China and India, too, fell short in committing to greater ambition. ""We already have at our fingertips many of the technologies needed to sharply reduce global warming emissions and know what it takes to make a rapid and just transition to a low-carbon economy. Whether in the United States or in the global south, communities on the frontlines of climate change are already struggling with intensifying tropical storms and wildfires, extreme heat, rising seas and drought, and they urgently need investments in climate resilience. ""Yet, those in power remain beholden to the very fossil fuel corporations driving this global emergency, much to the detriment of the people they are bound to serve. The people of the world who care about the future of our planet will not give up the fight for bold, transformative climate action. The pressure is on to exert power from the streets to the highest levels of government to secure ambition well ahead of COP26 in Glasgow and beyond.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA239","THE VITAL RESOURCE BENEATH OUR FEET RESEARCHER HELPS LEAD A CALL TO PROTECT GLOBAL GROUNDWATER RESOURCES","December 9, 2019 Monday","States News Service","The following information was released by the University of California - Santa Barbara: By Harrison Tasoff We see it lapping at the shores of tranquil lakes, gurgling through creeks and rivers, and rushing over waterfalls. But the vast majority of liquid freshwater on our planet actually flows out of sight, well beneath our feet. This groundwater is a vital resource across the globe, providing irrigation and drinking water to billions of people. A group of international scientists and practitioners say we are not doing enough to protect and manage global groundwater resources an oversight they argue will have long-term effects on the planet's drinking water, food production and adaptation to a rapidly changing climate. ""In some places, our management of groundwater has lagged, but our use of the resource has not. The result is groundwater depletion and the many undesirable impacts associated with over pumping,"" said Debra Perrone, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, and one of the researchers leading the new initiative. These impacts include land subsidence, seawater intrusion and declining water levels. Perrone and several colleagues penned a call to action that appears in the journal Nature and authored a statement that has already garnered signatures from over 750 researchers, practitioners and policymakers from more than 80 countries around the world. The idea for the statement developed during a groundwater research conference that Perrone co-organized in Valencia, Spain in October 2019. The call to action outlines three key action items to address the situation: Put the spotlight on global groundwater sustainability by completing a UN World Water Development Report on the state, trends and prospects of global groundwater sustainability for the 2022 UN World Water Day, dedicated to groundwater and recognizing the global importance of groundwater to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; Manage and govern groundwater sustainably from local to global scales by applying sustainability guiding principles by 2030; Invest in groundwater governance and management by implementing groundwater sustainability plans for stressed aquifers by 2030. ""Groundwater is the forgotten secret that we have under our feet, yet it is critical to our lives,"" said Tom Gleeson, co-author of the Nature correspondence and an associate professor at the University of Victoria. ""Protecting and managing groundwater is critical for the future of food production, adapting to a changing climate, and for sustainable development of communities and building better societies worldwide."" The call comes on the eve of United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid ( COP 25 ""The statement's goal is to highlight the importance of groundwater as we talk about climate resilience and sustainability,"" Perrone said. ""Groundwater is the world's largest freshwater resource,"" she added, ""and it tends to be more resilient to climate variability, which means that it is a key resource during prolonged drought."" The researchers' statement notes that groundwater provides drinking water for more than two billion people, as well as more than 40% of the water for irrigated agriculture worldwide. However, around 1.7 billion people live above aquifers that are stressed by overuse. ""We are seeing a picture that is incredibly troublesome,"" said Jay Famiglietti, another of the statement's coauthors and the director of the Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan. ""All over the world, especially in the mid-latitudes, water is going to be increasingly scarce, and particularly from our groundwater aquifers. Those are being overtaxed and pumped at an unsustainable rate and so that will pose major threats for water availability, water security and food security as well."" ""Groundwater depletion is occurring in many places around the world, but there is room for optimism,"" Perrone said. ""There are examples of communities that have come together to improve groundwater governance and manage their groundwater resources sustainably."" \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA241","TARGETED: COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES TAKE AIM AT ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS CIVIL SOCIETY INPUT CRUCIAL TO 'COP25' CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT","November 28, 2019 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by Human Rights Watch: Letta Tayler lettatayler Senior Researcher, Crisis and Conflict Division Cara Schulte @CaraHRW Associate, Environment and Human Rights Katharina Rall @katha_nina Researcher, Environment and Human Rights Division Protecting the endangered Asiatic cheetah. Tweeting a satirical poem. Attending a climate conference. Campaigning against a power plant. These actions hardly conjure images of suicide bombers or coup plotters. Yet they have been labeled ""eco-terrorism,"" ""extremism,"" or ""threats to national security"" by governments and businesses that seek to block the work of environmental activists. On November 29, 2019, young people will gather at locations around the world for a Fridays for Future Global Climate Strike. On December 2, United Nations delegates, world leaders, business executives, and activists will meet at the 25th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ) in Madrid to discuss ways to protect the environment. Participants in these events should also discuss ways to protect the protectors: the individuals and groups targeted around the world for their efforts on behalf of the planet. The dangers facing environmental defenders do not stop at accusations that they are national security risks. From the Amazon rainforest to South African mining communities, activists seeking to preserve ecosystems and ancestral lands are being threatened, attacked, and even killed with near total impunity, Human Rights Watch has found. But in contrast to many of these illegal acts, the unjust labeling of environmentalists as security threats is often more insidious, as it is generally carried out under the color of law. And while not all environmental activism is peaceful, only in exceptional cases would the actions of environmental activists meet a generally recognized definition of terrorism actions aimed at terrorizing populations by causing or threatening death or serious physical harm to others to advance an ideological or political agenda. Nor, in nearly all cases, do their actions aim to undermine the rule of law. Typically, these individuals and groups are peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of speech, association, and assembly. When they engage in civil disobedience, their aim is usually to strengthen and improve the enforcement of existing environmental protection measures. Here are a few examples where environmental activists have been smeared as terrorists or other national security threats: In Poland, the authorities denied entry in December 2018 to at least 13 foreign climate activists who were registered to attend COP24 in the southern city of Katowice, contending they posed a threat to public order and national security. Along with other individuals and groups, the activists had planned to press COP24 participants for rapid action to address climate change. The authorities had previously passed a special law empowering the police to collect data about conference participants without judicial oversight or the participants' knowledge and consent and ban spontaneous protests during COP24. They also issued a terrorism alert that authorized increased vehicle checks and other security controls for Katowice and surrounding areas for the duration of the summit. Border officials detained and questioned several activists for hours, in some cases without allowing them to communicate their location or contact a lawyer. In November 2015, French police used a sweeping counterterrorism emergency law enacted in response to the deadly Paris attacks earlier that month to place at least 24 climate activists under house arrest without judicial warrant, raid activists' homes, and seize computers and personal belongings. The activists were accused of flouting a ban on organizing protests related to COP21, which was being held in France the following week to sign the Paris Agreement on reducing emissions that contribute to global warming. In Iran, six members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF), imprisoned since early 2018, were handed prison terms of up to 10 years in November for allegedly spying for the United States. During a deeply flawed trial, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards said the environmentalists used their work to protect the Asiatic cheetah one of the world's most endangered species as a cover. A charge against four of the accused of ""spreading corruption on Earth,"" a crime that can carry the death penalty, was reportedly dropped in October. Two other PWHF members also detained in early 2018 were awaiting judgment. A ninth environmentalist, PWHF founder Kavous Seyed Emami, died a few weeks after his arrest under suspicious circumstances in what the Iranian authorities alleged to be a suicide. Issa Kalantari, the head of Iran's Department of Environment, said there was no evidence that the detained environmentalists were spies. He said the arrests have had a chilling effect on environmental groups in the country. The arrests appear to be motivated both by Iran's ""paranoia"" about foreign countries using environmentalists as cover and its recognition that anger over environmental degradation can unite populations against government policies, said Kaveh Madani, the country's former deputy environmental director. Madani returned to his native Iran from London in 2017 to take up the post, but said he was immediately detained and questioned by Revolutionary Guards, who broke into his phone, computer, emails, and social media accounts, and called him a ""bioterrorist,"" a ""water terrorist,"" and a spy. He left Iran after seven months, alleging repeated harassment including for his criticism of dam projects, which are constructed by the Revolutionary Guards. In Kenya, the police and military have frequently labeled environmental activists opposing a mega-infrastructure project in the Lamu coastal region, including a coal-fired power plant, as ""terrorists"" while subjecting them to threats, beatings, and arbitrary arrests and detentions. In 15 cases documented by Human Rights Watch between 2013 and 2016, the authorities accused environmental defenders of membership in, or links to, the extremist armed group al-Shabab but provided no compelling evidence. The activists are protesting construction of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor, the biggest infrastructure project in Central and East Africa, which is to include a 32-berth seaport, three international airports, a road and railway network, and three resort cities. They contend that LAPSSET will pollute the air and water, destroy mangrove forests and breeding grounds for fish, and take farmland without just compensation, displacing communities and destroying their livelihoods. In July, Kenya's environmental tribunal blocked approval of the power plant absent a new environmental impact study, finding the China-backed developers' original assessment and public consultation process inadequate. The rest of the LAPSSET project continues. So does the intimidation campaign, activists protesting LAPSSET told Human Rights Watch. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte in 2018 placed 600 civil society members, including environmentalists and indigenous rights defenders, on a list of alleged members of the country's communist party and its armed wing, which he declared to be a terrorist organization. Duterte's ""terrorist list"" included Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, an indigenous Filipina who is the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and a climate change activist. In late 2017, Tauli-Corpuz had criticized the government for attacks and other abuses against indigenous communities that opposed coal and diamond mining on ancestral lands. Although a Manila court months later ordered the government to remove Tauli-Corpuz from the list, a Philippines military official in 2019 renewed the campaign against her, accusing her of ""infiltrating"" the UN for the communist insurgents. Several UN human rights experts condemned Tauli-Corpuz's listing. In Ecuador, eight years passed before the prominent environmental activist Jose ""Pepe"" Acacho, a Shuar indigenous leader, was able to clear himself of ""terrorism"" charges for his activities opposing mining and oil exploration in the Amazon. Acacho was charged with terrorism in 2010 for allegedly inciting violence during Shuar protests against a mining law. He was convicted in 2013 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Human Rights Watch reviewed the trial documents and found no credible evidence of terrorism-related crimes. In 2018, Ecuador's highest court threw out the terrorism conviction but instead sentenced him to eight months in prison for ""public services obstruction"" a charge for which he was never tried and hence never had the opportunity to contest. Acacho spent 17 days in jail before receiving a presidential pardon in October 2018. In the US in August 2018, then-US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed ""environmental terrorist groups"" that opposed logging for wildfires on the West Coast a proposition immediately attacked by leading environmental organizations including the Sierra Club. In 2017, 84 members of the US Congress, most of them Republicans, asked the Justice Department if activists mobilizing against the construction of oil pipelines could be prosecuted as terrorists. (The department's response was that in some cases, yes.) That same year, a major pipeline operator, Energy Transfer Partners LP, filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace and other environmental groups, accusing them of launching a ""rogue eco-terrorist"" campaign against the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline. Environmental activists and Native American tribes had tried to block construction of the 1,172-mile-long, underground pipeline through North Dakota during a protracted standoff with the authorities in 2016, saying it threatened sacred sites and drinking water. A federal court dismissed the lawsuit earlier this year. Although the protesters were largely peaceful, some resorted to violence and were convicted of protest-related crimes, but none for offenses that even remotely approximated terrorism. UN experts condemned security force responses to the protests as ""excessive,"" including their use of rubber bullets, teargas, compression grenades, mace, and ""inhuman and degrading"" detention conditions. In Russia, at least 14 environmental groups have stopped work in recent years, and the head of the prominent group Ekozaschita! (Ecodefense!), Alexandra Koroleva, fled the country in June to avoid prosecution under the draconian Law on Foreign Agents. The 2012 law requires any Russian group accepting foreign funding and carrying out activities deemed to be ""political"" to register as a ""foreign agent,"" a term that in Russia implies ""spy"" or ""traitor."" Authorities have used the law to silence groups that opposed state-sanctioned development projects and petitioned authorities for the release of imprisoned environmental activists, a Human Rights Watch investigation found. Russian officials including the special envoy for environmental protection, Sergey Ivanov, have applied the ""extremist"" label to Greenpeace Russia. An activist with Stop GOK, a Russian group seeking to block mining and enrichment plants, was fined in April 2019 for ""mass distribution of extremist materials"" because he published a poem on the organization's social media page that the government had banned as extremist in 2012. The Russian nongovernmental organization SOVA Center, which analyzes counter-extremism trends, found that the poem, ""Last Wish to the Ivans,"" is a satirical address to destitute, alcohol and drug-addicted Russians from oligarchs and authorities profiting from extracting natural resources. Stop GOK and Greenpeace Russia were among groups named in a 2018 report by pro-government technologists as ""environmental extremists"" working for ""influential forces in the West"" bent on sabotaging strategic industries. The report was widely covered by state-controlled media. Civil society participation will be crucial to ambitious outcomes at COP25 . Parties to the summit, which include all UN member countries and the European Union, should allow activists ample opportunity to air their concerns about the climate crisis and use their combined expertise to help identify solutions. They should also provide activists with a safe space to speak out about the threats they face for carrying out their work. In addition, parties should publicly commit to robustly carrying out international and regional treaties that protect environmental defenders. One of these treaties is the Escazu Agreement (the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean), the world's first covenant to include specific provisions promoting and protecting environmental defenders. Twenty-one countries have signed the 2018 agreement. But only six countries have ratified it five shy of the ratifications needed to enter it into force. Chile, which stepped down as COP25 host because of protests stemming from economic grievances, but will still preside over the negotiations in Madrid, should lead by example and ratify the agreement. COP25 participants should also commit to upholding the Aarhus Convention (the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters), to which Spain is a signatory. The convention an environmental pact for Europe, the European Union, and Central Asia grants the public, including environmental groups, an array of rights including public participation and access to information and justice in governmental decisions on the environment, without harassment or persecution. Parties to the treaty, including the EU, and Poland for its crackdown at COP24, have been criticized including in some cases by the Aarhus Convention's own oversight body for flouting these provisions. COP25 delegates should recognize that to genuinely protect the environment, they also need to protect its defenders including those unjustly targeted in the name of security. \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA243","O'right's Steven Ko to Promote Innovative Sustainability at COP 25","October 14, 2019 Monday 8:36 AM EST","PR Newswire","PR Newswire Steven Ko, Chairman of Green Beauty Brand O'right, will represent Taiwan's small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) at the 2019 Santiago Climate Change Conference (NFCCC COP 25 ) this December. As Taiwan's foremost sustainability leader, Ko is ready to share O'right's revolutionary green practices with the rest of the world. This past September, Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate-change activist and Fridays for Future founder, opened the United Nations Climate Action Summit, with world leaders convening in New York in an effort to jump start action on climate change. At the summit, many condemned world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change. O'right, however, strongly supports the Fridays for Future movement. In fact, this fall, O'right joined forces with the Taiwan Youth Climate Coalition (TWYCC) for ""Stand Up for Future!"", an event to encourage youth action on climate change and to inspire passersby to take a stand and speak up for the planet. Ko himself continues to stress the urgency of dealing with climate change and believes that young people need to be heard. Leading by example, Ko began promoting sustainability programs in elementary schools across Taiwan in March in the hopes of raising environmental awareness among teachers and students. Ko has also championed a ""Climate Leader"" program that aims to inspire a new generation of green ambassadors. This December, Ko will stand alongside DuPont Biomaterials and other industrial leaders who are active in the circular economy field in order to share O'right's journey towards becoming an even more progressive green beauty brand by reducing marine plastics at the source. In addition to its pioneering position in raising the standard for sustainability and its efforts to move towards a more circular economy, O'right also introduced the world's first 100% renewable plastic shampoo bottle and renewable plastic pump in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Recently, O'right obtained the respected USDA Certified Biobased Product Label, which displays the biobased content of a product that comes from a renewable source. Ko understands that being ""organic"" does not guarantee sustainability. Therefore, the best, and ultimate, way to move closer towards sustainability is to achieve ""zero-environmental impact."" With sustainability efforts that have already achieved an impressive 80% reduction in carbon emissions, O'right is dedicated to developing sustainable solutions that lead the way in the worldwide beauty industry while ensuring that its brand continues to contribute to a better world-for people, society, and the environment. ""We aspire to be great instead of big, which means taking giant innovative leaps to make a lasting impact,"" Ko emphasized. With sustainability at the heart of its business, O'right is living proof that businesses can be both green and successful.

The great injustice of the climate crisis is that its effects fall most on those least responsible for it. I have seen this first-hand. In Mozambique and in the Caribbean, I have seen the aftermath of terrible storms that have caused -and continue to cause -- devastation that we count in the cost of lives lost, communities up-rooted and economies crippled. In the Sahel and the Horn of Africa I have witnessed the dreadful toll of drought, powered by climate change, that is destabilizing an entire sub-region. And around the world, floods, drought and other extreme weather are being made worse by climate disruption. And it is the most vulnerable who hurt first and worst. It is commendable, then, that some of the most vulnerable nations are also in the forefront of climate action. For a decade or more you have been in the vanguard of the call to follow science by limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. You know that any more will spell untold disasters for your people and for your development prospects. At the recent Climate Action Summit, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries once again showed leadership. We saw commitments to come forward with strategies to reach net zero emissions by 2050. And we heard from countries prepared to bring more ambitious national commitments in 2020. For this I thank you and I hope your example will be followed by the big emitters. It is essential that you follow through on these commitments to put maximum pressure on the big emitters next year. The United Nations is ready to support SIDS and LDCs in this -- including through the ""Climate Promise"" made by UNDP at the Summit. We must also ensure that at least $100 billion dollars a year is available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and to take into account their legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery. You have my personal commitment to continue to fight for more ambitious climate action and also for the particular cause of SIDS and LDCs. Visiting the most vulnerable regions of the world has only served to galvanize my efforts in this regard. I wish you a very productive forum. Thank you.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA246","Groupe Speciale Mobile Association: Mobile Technologies Enabling Huge Carbon Reductions in Response to Climate Emergency","December 12, 2019 Thursday 7:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association issued the following news release:    - New Report Calculates that Mobile Enabled 2,135 Million Tonnes CO2e Reductions in 2018    The use of mobile technology enabled a global reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of around 2,135 million tonnes CO2e last year, according to a new study commissioned by the GSMA - a quantity approximate to the total emissions emitted yearly by Russia/1. The emissions savings were almost ten times greater than the global carbon footprint of the mobile industry itself/2. The new GSMA report, produced in collaboration with the Carbon Trust, an independent sustainability specialist, is being presented at the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) held in Madrid this month. It found that the majority of avoided emissions made possible by mobile technologies were the result of significant reductions in energy and fuel consumption. In 2018, mobile technologies such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled a 1.44 billion MWh reduction in energy and saved 521 billion litres of fuel, globally. ""The mobile ecosystem enabled savings of enough electricity and gas last year to power more than 70 million houses for an entire year in the US. Additionally, fuel for all 32.5 million registered cars in the UK to drive for 19 years was saved,"" said Mats Granryd, Director General of the GSMA. ""Today's study underlines how mobile and smart technologies are powering sustainable economic growth while enabling the avoidance of emissions across multiple industry sectors. These technologies will be crucial to the world reaching its Net Zero targets."" ""Climate change requires a collective effort across governments, businesses and civil society if we are going to succeed in limiting global temperature increases to within 1.5 degrees,"" said Tom Delay, CEO of the Carbon Trust. ""This analysis shows the positive role that mobile technology is playing in the evolution of other sectors and is a great example of what is possible."" The Carbon Trust examined 14 markets around the world/3 to form a representative sample of the 'enablement effect' of the mobile sector's ability to reduce emissions. The results indicate an even split between the enablement effect of M2M/IoT technologies, and those enabled through behaviour changes from the personal use of smartphones. The majority of avoided emissions from M2M technologies are primarily in buildings, transport, manufacturing and the energy sector - sectors that make up a large portion of global GHG emissions. For example, savings in buildings are a result of technologies that improve energy efficiency such as building management systems and smart meters. In the transport sector, the use of telematics can improve route optimisation and vehicle fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, personal smartphone usage is enabling emissions reductions due to encouraging behaviours such as reduced travel, increased use of public transport, remote home heating control and online shopping. The report provides a high-level analysis of six categories of enabling mechanisms, along with case studies. The biggest category of avoided emissions is 'Smart living, working and health' (39 per cent of total avoided emissions in 2018), followed by 'Smart transport and cities' (30 per cent), 'Smart manufacturing' (11 per cent), 'Smart buildings' (10 per cent), 'Smart energy' (7 per cent), and 'Smart agriculture' (3 per cent). 'The Enablement Effect: The impact of mobile communications technologies on carbon emission reductions' is produced by the GSMA and the Carbon Trust. The report provides a breakdown of the results and the assumptions used in the calculations, including a full methodology.

The disclosures form the first phase of an industry-wide, climate action roadmap.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA247","COP 25: Climate Alarmists Wage a War of Words, but Where's the Beef?","Western Free Press( Arizona)","Newstex Blogs","Dec 12, 2019( Western Free Press: HYPERLINK http://www.westernfreepress.com/Delivered by Newstex) Looking back, the climate alarmist's movement started with Al Gore's 2007 movie when he proclaimed the eminent extinction of the polar bears due to global warming. Since the population of polar bears has blossomed over the last decade, we've yet to hear another word from Al Gore on that subject. The doomsday forecasters are now grasping at new names to rebrand the movement. What was once global warming, is now climate change, climate disaster, global meltdown, climate collapse, scorched earth, climate emergency, and the latest movement, 'we don't have time'. Like Gore's initial predictions, all the tweets lack the basis for their dismal projections. The grandparents of millennials may remember from the late 1950's this best-known quote 'Just the facts, ma£m.' from Sgt. Joe Friday with the TV series Dragnet. A few decades later there was Clara Peller who was a manicurist and American character actress who, at the age of 81, starred in the 1984 'Where's the beef?' advertising campaign for the Wendy's fast food restaurant chain. The short emotional tweets from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) with 5.9 million followers, Greta Thunberg with 3 million followers, Al Gore's 3.1 million followers, Tom Steyer's 250 thousand followers, and Jane Fonda's 500 thousand followers, all bumble about the doomsday that's coming. The tweets are void of any 'beef or facts' as to what's going to cause this forthcoming demise. They tweet rhetorical questions and emotional statements, and the millions of followers beingbrainwashed with scaremongering dogmaslurp it up, as environmentalism has become the new religion. The alarmism over global warming, climate change, etc., is at the forefront of these tweeted fear tactics, but when such alarmist conclusions are openly rebutted, the rebutters are being besieged with oratory that 97 percent of £ll' scientists, and even the non-scientific community of175+organizationsactive onclimate change[1]believe mankind has played a role in changing the earth's climate. I have two problems with that 97 percent claim, 1) common sense tells us that nolarge group of people on our planet could ever reach 97 percent agreement onanything, even the world being round, and 2) shockingly, none of the scientists of the 97 seem to have a name, it's just a holistic group of no-names! It seems that none of these '97' are able to 'talk' specifically about selective microscopic sound bites from vast data that are the supposedly the basis of these dire warnings abouttimerunning outand the idea of a 12-year deadline for the annihilation of life as we currently know it. Of the almost 8 billion people living on this planet, we know that 80% of them, or more than 6 billion, are living on less than$10 a day[2]. Obviously, those poor in underdeveloped countries cannot afford to subsidize themselves out of a paper bag and continue to use what's readily available - coal. It must be the other 20 percent of the population, or about 1.6 billion, in developed countries that are the targets of these climate alarmists rebranding efforts. The tweeters are promoting a global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. Yet, it's that same 20% that have come out of poverty in the last one hundred years as a result of what those deep earth mineral and fuels have provided society, enhancing their lives and improving their standard of living. Basically, the same fossil fuels that are being deprived from the other 80 percent that now live in abject poverty with no hope of reaping the benefits of what prosperous societies are enjoying. The folks in prosperous societies that have embraced and increased their production of fossil energy have been amply rewarded with greater economic development and growth, and a healthier society. Virtually all diseases are now under control with medications and medical equipment that was not available in the 1800's, before fossil fuels starting to run everyone's lives. Today, we can live in any weather condition and we've got military equipment, airlines, merchant ships, cruise ships, truck and cars all over the world that dominate the lifestyles of prosperous societies. The fossil fuel industry would not be needed except to meet the demands of the current users in those prosperous societies. My belief is that those users are less inclined to go back to living in medieval times without all the amenities that the thousands of products and the various fuels that the fossil fuel industry have been able to fulfill in their daily lives. I presume the alarmists that constantly refuse to surface from behind their tweet machines to debate is because they have no case to debate the facts that they are using to justify their growing alarmist vocabulary. Unless there's a face to face debate with the supposedly deniers, that have more data than words, we'll never hear both sides of the climate discussions. It's definitely time for the alarmists to show us 'where's the beef' behind their tweets and marches, so the public can decide for themselves to consider the data from each side or just continue to accept the barrage of tweeted words of impending climate disasters that will end life as we know it. From the extensive data available on temperatures, weather, sea levels, emissions, etc. that several scientists have shared, I don't see the cause for such a dismal outlook for the earth and its civilization. I suspect that classifies me as a 'denier'. I'm willing to join the doomsday parade, but only if the tweeters would come out from behind their tweet machines and 'show their cards'. Looking forward to face-to-face discussions.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA248","GSMA: Mobile Technologies Enabling Huge Carbon Reductions in Response to Climate Emergency; New Report Calculates that Mobile Enabled 2,135 Million Tonnes CO2e ....","December 11, 2019 Wednesday 9:00 AM GMT","Business Wire","The use of mobile technology enabled a global reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of around 2,135 million tonnes CO2e last year, according to a new study commissioned by the GSMA - a quantity approximate to the total emissions emitted yearly by Russia1. The emissions savings were almost ten times greater than the global carbon footprint of the mobile industry itself2. The new GSMA report, produced in collaboration with the HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carbontrust.com%2F&esheet=52143744&newsitemid=20191211005056&lan=en-US&anchor=Carbon+Trust&index=1&md5=01ecbd1319e6203712cdb6093c6781e5 Carbon Trust , an independent sustainability specialist, is being presented at the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( \~ HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Fcop25&esheet=52143744&newsitemid=20191211005056&lan=en-US&anchor=COP25&index=2&md5=e8a2dc9bf2ffbd6d652ab9b5d5531cf2 COP25 ) held in Madrid this month. It found that the majority of avoided emissions made possible by mobile technologies were the result of significant reductions in energy and fuel consumption. In 2018, mobile technologies such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled a 1.44 billion MWh reduction in energy and saved 521 billion litres of fuel, globally. ""The mobile ecosystem enabled savings of enough electricity and gas last year to power more than 70 million houses for an entire year in the US. Additionally, fuel for all 32.5 million registered cars in the UK to drive for 19 years was saved,"" said Mats Granryd, Director General of the GSMA. ""Today's study underlines how mobile and smart technologies are powering sustainable economic growth while enabling the avoidance of emissions across multiple industry sectors. These technologies will be crucial to the world reaching its Net Zero targets."" ""Climate change requires a collective effort across governments, businesses and civil society if we are going to succeed in limiting global temperature increases to within 1.5 degrees,"" said Tom Delay, CEO of the Carbon Trust. ""This analysis shows the positive role that mobile technology is playing in the evolution of other sectors and is a great example of what is possible."" The Carbon Trust examined 14 markets around the world3 to form a representative sample of the 'enablement effect' of the mobile sector's ability to reduce emissions. The results indicate an even split between the enablement effect of M2M/IoT technologies, and those enabled through behaviour changes from the personal use of smartphones. The majority of avoided emissions from M2M technologies are primarily in buildings, transport, manufacturing and the energy sector - sectors that make up a large portion of global GHG emissions. For example, savings in buildings are a result of technologies that improve energy efficiency such as building management systems and smart meters. In the transport sector, the use of telematics can improve route optimisation and vehicle fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, personal smartphone usage is enabling emissions reductions due to encouraging behaviours such as reduced travel, increased use of public transport, remote home heating control and online shopping. The report provides a high-level analysis of six categories of enabling mechanisms, along with case studies. The biggest category of avoided emissions is 'Smart living, working and health' (39 per cent of total avoided emissions in 2018), followed by 'Smart transport and cities' (30 per cent), 'Smart manufacturing' (11 per cent), 'Smart buildings' (10 per cent), 'Smart energy' (7 per cent), and 'Smart agriculture' (3 per cent). 'The Enablement Effect: The impact of mobile communications technologies on carbon emission reductions' is produced by the GSMA and the Carbon Trust. The report provides a breakdown of the results and the assumptions used in the calculations, including a full methodology.

In this week's address, the Congressman discussed the upcoming Congressional Delegation to the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid and the importance of the United States' leadership in addressing the climate crisis. Video and audio of the Weekly Democratic Address can be downloaded here ( HYPERLINK https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6kcbzy0gsc4fx8z/AABzkdwHnIqja66qHf-2NdnGa?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6kcbzy0gsc4fx8z/AABzkdwHnIqja66qHf-2NdnGa?dl=0 ). Below is a full transcript of the address: ""Hi, I'm Congressman Sean Casten from Illinois' 6th district. ""This weekend, I am proud to travel to Madrid, Spain, as part of a Congressional Delegation to the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference . We will be there to represent the United States Congress and to send a clear message that we understand the existential threat that is the climate crisis. ""The climate crisis is the greatest test we have ever faced, but it is also an opportunity. ""Atmospheric carbon dioxide pollution concentrations are already well above the 350 ppm level that - not that long ago - was understood to be the cap we had to stay under. Several feet of additional sea level rise are already guaranteed, and several tipping points have already been passed. ""In the final analysis, we will be judged not by our colleagues or even our voters, but by our grandchildren. We owe them a climate that is as stable as the one we inherited from those who came before us. That will require massive, coordinated, international action, and that is our test. ""But the climate crisis is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity because the biggest source of carbon pollution is burning fossil fuel, which costs money. ""Lowering carbon pollution saves money. Every solar panel, every electric vehicle, every reinsulated home represents a financial investment that also provides a more stable climate for our children. As Amory Lovins says people don't want coal or oil. They want warm showers and cold beers. ""Every time we invest in projects to give us useful, clean energy with less purchased fuel input, we make ourselves wealthier and help our environment. That is our opportunity. ""In 1988, the United States ratified the Montreal Protocol, using market mechanisms to reduce ozone-destroying compounds. That was the direct result of leadership. Leadership from the Reagan and Bush administrations it should be noted. ""That idea was subsequently incorporated into the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to lower acid-rain forming compounds. In both cases, we proved that economic and environmental policy can work in harmony with one another to avert environmental disaster. ""Unfortunately, the United States has failed to bring that leadership to greenhouse gas emissions. Even worse, we have walked away from the international agreements that would do so. ""And while House Democrats joined together to pass H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, sending a clear message that just like the thousands of localities, cities and U.S. companies, we are still in on the Paris Agreement, Senate Republicans and the President have met this historic effort with inaction and a resounding silence. That is not leadership. It is cowardice. ""It is also dangerous. Half of all the carbon pollution we have ever emitted as a species has been released since 1988. ""Since the year we signed the Montreal Protocol. Since the year Bruce Springsteen played 'Chimes of Freedom' in front of a still-standing Berlin Wall. Since the year that James Hansen testified to the U.S. Senate that global warming was, in fact, already well-underway. ""But the greatness of the United States - and our greatest gift to the world - is our leadership. We are not perfect, but since World War II there has been no greater advocate for equality, for the rule of law and for international peace than the United States. ""We have the ability - no, we have the moral obligation - to lead in this moment as well. ""The times have found us, and we will not shirk from our responsibilities. That will be our message to our allies in Madrid, and that is our charge moving forward. ""House Democrats will continue leading For The People: to lower health costs and prescription drug prices; to raise wages by rebuilding the infrastructure of America in a green, resilient, transformative way; and to clean up corruption to make Washington work for you. ""With optimism, with patriotism, but with a fierce and unbending commitment to the urgency we face, we will lead. ""Thank you."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6945009 MSTRUCK \"

The UN welcomes opportunities to review its effectiveness, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the meeting on Resolution 2436, adopted in September 2018. The UN chief recalled that his Action for Peacekeeping initiative renews collective commitment to excellence amid an increasingly dangerous landscape for 'blue helmets' and their civilian colleagues. For our full coverage, see here ( HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1052941 https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1052941 ). Spike in Syria attacks on civilians Syrian civilians are dealing with a growing threat of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, despite a fragile ceasefire in the northeast of the country, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, reported on Friday. Briefing reporters in Geneva, Mr. Colville said that a spike of apparently indiscriminate IED attacks had been noted in residential areas and local markets, mainly in areas controlled by Turkish forces and their allies, since the October offensive into Syria began, but also in some areas under the control of Kurdish groups. The UN has verified at least 49 attacks between 22 October and 3 December, recording some 78 civilian deaths, including 18 children. Mr. Colville warned that these killings could amount to a serious violation of international humanitarian law and constitute a war crime. Another cause of concern for the UN is the continued fighting in the Idlib area, where ground strikes and airstrikes by forces aligned with the Government are resulting in civilian casualties. Mr. Colville called on all parties to the conflict to refrain from directing attacks against civilians, and from any indiscriminate attack, and to investigate all such incidents. UN rights chief 'extremely concerned' over deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran In the wake of recent protests in Iran, the top United Nations human rights official expressed alarm on Friday over multiple human rights violations which have reportedly taken place across the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet highlighted a continuing lack of transparency concerning casualties, the alleged mistreatment of thousands of detainees and continued arrests reported throughout Iran, after weeks of protests which began over major increases in petrol prices. More on this story here ( HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1052911 https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1052911 ). Australia's end to medical evacuation for refugees may put lives at risk Repealing an Australian law that allowed sick refugees and other migrants, held in offshore detention centres, to be sent to the country for treatment, deprives them of appropriate medical care, and may put their lives at risk. This is how the High Commission for Human Rights has responded to the Australian Government's decision, which came despite rights chief Michelle Bachelet's recent appeal to Members of Parliament not to reverse the so-called Medevac legislation. During Rupert Colville's Friday briefing in Geneva, the spokesperson said that ""Medical experts, not politicians, should be at the heart of decisions about people's medical care"". Mr. Colville highlighted the fact that, before the laws were passed, twelve people died in offshore detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, and noted that, under international human rights law, all individuals, regardless of their status, have the right to health. The repeal of the laws means that sick people in offshore detention will now have no option but to take legal action in order to access medical care which, he said, will mean place an unnecessary burden on the Australian court system, and will mean further suffering for the affected people. Haitians facing 'dramatic' food crisis With around one in three Haitians in urgent need, the World Food Programme (WFP) is scaling up operations in the country to provide emergency food assistance to 700,000 people. On Friday, the WFP announced that, along with its partners, it is doing its utmost to reach a growing number of vulnerable people. In order to be able to deliver humanitarian services, the agency is appealing for $62 million. Millions of Haitians have been hit hard by rising prices, a weakening local currency, and a drop in agricultural production. The demonstrations and unrest in the country over the past three months have made it difficult for poorer households to access food, although a slight improvement in security has allowed WFP to deliver food assistance to families cut off since September. The UN food agency is also providing cash and vouchers to tens of thousands of affected people, in order to help local markets to recover, and allow households to buy local food. So far this year, WFP has met the emergency food needs of around 138,000 people. Activist Greta Thunberg takes on Madrid climate conference Young people took centre stage at the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid on Friday, as they took part in ""Young and Future Generations Day"". Young activists made statements and participated in roundtable discussions with decision makers on how to raise ambition, to empower youth to implement the Paris Agreement, and to foster intergenerational cooperation. The UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, stressed their role to raise awareness of this issue and encouraged them to continue speaking up for change. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg reportedly told the gathering that although people want everything to continue as it is because they are afraid of change, young voices would not be drowned out. ""Change is what we young people are bringing and that is why they want to silence us and that is just a proof that we are having an impact that our voices are being heard that they try so desperately to silence us"", she told reporters.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA251","SHAHEEN, HASSAN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND BOLSTER THE CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY","February 11, 2020 Tuesday","States News Service","The following information was released by New Hampshire Senator Margaret Wood Hassan: Today, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced the Clean Economy Act with Tom Carper (D-DE) and a number of other colleagues. The legislation will boost American competitiveness while putting the United States on a path to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world's leading scientists have warned that humanity must limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. According to the United Nations' annual Emissions Gap Report released last month, collective global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not yet substantial enough to reach that temperature goal. The Clean Economy Act heeds the call for bold climate action and at the same time promotes healthier frontline communities and fosters a growing economy that works for everyone. The Clean Economy Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use existing authorities to put our country on a pathway to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. Any plan developed by the EPA must achieve rapid reductions at minimal costs, prioritize public health and support a strong labor workforce. EPA is also required to build upon existing state, local and private climate programs and set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2025, 2030 and 2040. Other federal agencies would be required to do their part to help the nation meet the net-zero goal and help enhance America's global competitiveness through investments in research and development, innovation and equitable access to worker training. ""Americans are seeing the devastating effects of climate change each day. In New Hampshire, it's hurting our wildlife, including our moose population and fisheries, and it's influencing our fall foliage and maple production. Tackling this crisis requires swift and meaningful action, which is why I'm proud to introduce the Clean Economy Act with Senator Carper,"" said Senator Shaheen . ""By directing the EPA to use the tools it already has at its disposal to help create a clean energy economy and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, our nation can take an important step forward towards achieving climate goals, creating jobs and staying globally competitive."" ""The Clean Economy Act takes bold steps to address the existential threat posed by climate change by implementing a plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,"" Senator Hassan said . ""By drastically reducing our country's greenhouse gas emissions, we are prioritizing public health and safety while also fostering economic growth."" This net-zero legislation is supported collectively by major environmental groups, business groups and organized labor, including the United Steelworkers, the League of Conservation Voters and the American Lung Association. For full text of the bill, click here . For a summary of the legislation and full list of supporters, click here . Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation, which Senator Hassan cosponsored the International Climate Change Accountability Act - that would prevent the President from using funds to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has historically helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the President's anti-environment agenda, and has fought his continued efforts to invalidate scientific evidence of climate change. In December, Shaheen also led a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Hassan, in a letter to Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in support of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) and their commitment to global efforts to thwart climate change. That letter can be read here.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA254","EU proposes law to set 2050 net-zero emissions target","March 4, 2020 Wednesday 12:19 PM EST","UPI","The executive branch of the European Union unveiled a climate change law on Wednesday that would require the 27-member alliance attain a net-zero emissions status by 2050. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal would set the EU ""irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future."" ""It is the heart of the European Green Deal,"" she added. The law, which requires approval from all member states and European Parliament, would also set a new 2030 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and establish a new reduction ""trajectory"" for the period between 2030 and 2050. The commission also announced 12 weeks of public consultations in Europe ahead of the next United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland in November. Von der Leyen said the law would offer ""predictability and transparency for European industry and investors,"" gives ""direction to our green growth strategy"" and guarantees the transition will be ""gradual and fair."" The EU law followed an open letter on Tuesday from a dozen European nations that urged quicker action from the bloc to address climate change. It called on the commission to set goals for 2030 within three months and pressed the importance of having new goals in place by the start of the Scotland summit. Wednesday's proposal was met with criticism from some environmental activists. Swedish teen activist criticized the 2050 deadline as too distant and said the EU law lacks immediate and drastic measures to meet a quickly-shrinking ""carbon budget."" ""'Net-zero emissions by 2050' for the EU equals surrender,"" Greta, and 33 other youth activists, wrote in an open letter. ""It means giving up. We don't just need goals for just 2030 or 2050. We, above all, need them for 2020 and every following month and year to come.""

The Tracker will analyse in detail both proposed and updated 2030 targets from the 36 countries covered by the CAT, and keep a list of updated NDCs for all other countries. So far there is a limited list of updated NDCs. First out of the gate last year was one of the world's smallest and most-threatened nations, the Republic of the Marshall Islands from the Pacific, which submitted its updated target to the UNFCCC in 2018. It is definitely a progression on its previous target. In October, the Government of Chile published a detailed and updated NDC for public consultation, which the CAT has analysed for the tracker. The CAT's analysis shows that its unconditional 2030 target has improved by one rating to ""Insufficient"" from ""Highly Insufficient."" ""If Chile were to make its conditional target unconditional, depending on the assumptions, we could even rate it 2 degree C or 1.5 degree C compatible. Both of its targets are more ambitious, and a definite progression beyond what it submitted in 2016. This is very encouraging,"" said Niklas Hohne of CAT partner organisation NewClimate institute. The CAT has also included in its tracker a list of those governments who have indicated they will not update their 2030 target. This is despite the fact that they agreed to do so in Paris in 2015. So far, this list includes the US, Japan, Singapore and Australia. ""We have included a list of those governments who have indicated they will not update their 2030 Paris reduction targets next year, because they are violating an agreement they made in 2015 to update those targets to 'reflect [their] highest possible ambition' in 2020,"" said Bill Hare, CEO of CAT partner organisation Climate Analytics . ""They called for the IPCC to update them on the science, which it did in its 1.5 C Special Report and the science they've been given says it's nothing short of a climate emergency. There's been very few signals, especially from the major emitters of the G20, that their targets will be updated commensurate with this urgency. Japan and Australia have both signalled they have no intent to update their 2030 targets, yet in both countries emissions are rising."" Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6950448 MSTRUCK \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA256","Climate change is forcing one person from their home every two seconds, Oxfam says","December 5, 2019 Thursday 6:54 AM GMT","CNN Wire","(CNN) -- Climate-fueled disasters have forced about 20 million people a year to leave their homes in the past decade -- equivalent to one every two seconds -- according to a new report from Oxfam. This makes the climate the biggest driver of internal displacement for the period, with the world's poorer countries at the highest risk, despite their smaller contributions to global carbon pollution compared to richer nations. People are seven times more likely to be internally displaced by floods, cyclones and wildfires than volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and three times more likely than by conflict, according to the report released Monday, The issue is one of a raft of topics set to be discussed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 , which starts on Monday in Madrid. Oxfam is calling on the international community to do more to fund recovery programs for poorer countries affected by the climate emergency, which is set to intensify as extreme weather events are projected to increase in both severity and frequency. Low- and lower-middle income nations, such as India, are more than four times more likely to be affected by climate-fueled displacement than high-income countries like Spain and the US, according to the report. Small island developing states (SIDS), such as Cuba, Dominica and Tuvalu, are particularly badly affected, making up seven of the top 10 countries with the highest rates of displacement from extreme weather disasters between 2008 and 2018. People living in SIDs are 150 times more likely to be displaced by extreme weather disasters than those living in Europe, according to the report, which analyzed 2008-18 data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Increasing risk as climate crisis intensifies ""It's always the poorest, the most vulnerable, and women in particular, that are worst affected,"" Gore, who worked on the report, told CNN. ""This kind of displacement really tears at the social fabric of communities."" There is more acute risk in those countries where extreme weather and conflict combine, such as Somalia, said Gore. Sudden extreme weather events such as cyclones grab a lot of attention, but slow onset phenomena like rising sea levels also have an impact, he added. For example, floods affecting agricultural land in low lying coastal areas can leave it unusable for farming, pushing inhabitants to leave the area for good. Who should pay to combat the effects of climate change? Oxfam is calling on world leaders to reduce emissions as fast as possible. Developing countries are also set to push for support from developed countries through a financial mechanism to deal with loss and damage. First discussed at a climate summit in Warsaw in 2013, such a mechanism will involve richer countries financially helping poorer countries to deal with the impact of climate change. ""Nobody has been prepared to talk about money and so that's one of the critical issues that will be on the table in Madrid,"" said Gore. ""Ultimately somebody is going to have to pay the price for these impacts and at the moment that price is being paid by the poorest communities in the world."" And while current data shows lower risk in developed nations, projections suggest that is set to change. ""Rich countries are not immune either from the threat of displacement,"" said Gore. ""Climate change is not going to discriminate."" Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, told CNN that increasing numbers of internally displaced people can be attributed in part to a growing population living in high-risk areas. Displacement can also be a measure of success in some cases, he added, citing early warning systems that allow people to get out of danger before an extreme weather event hits, avoiding the major loss of life that has occurred in the past. Ward also emphasized that climate-fueled displacement is a security issue. ""Although it's hard to show that climate change is in itself creating political instability and conflict, the way in which the national security community describes climate change is as a threat multiplier,"" he said. ""When you get large populations displaced that's when you get instability and conflict."" TM & \£9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA257","International Chamber of Commerce: 3 Reasons Why Arbitration and ADR Should Play a Role in Climate Disputes","November 28, 2019 Thursday 8:40 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The International Chamber of Commerce issued the following news: ICC has published a new toolkit to streamline dispute resolution in relation to climate disputes. Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing our world today--causing a wide range of impacts affecting everyone, everywhere. We can only expect that the number of climate-related disputes will increase in the coming years. So what can individuals, companies and governments do to navigate the complex, myriad risks associated with this global phenomenon? The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has developed a toolkit to help (and prepare) users and practitioners with these specialised cases to streamline their dispute resolution needs. The practical resource, Resolving Climate Change-Related Disputes through Arbitration and ADR, launches today in Paris, at an event hosted by White &#38; Case. Here's why arbitration and ADR work for climate change-related disputes: 1. It's enforceable Did you know that arbitration benefits from worldwide coverage by the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, otherwise known as the New York Convention? This feature enables cross-border recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards, which is not always the case with litigation. Arbitration also offers the accessibility of an arbitral tribunal with specific expertise and the flexibility as to where an arbitration is conducted or heard. Moreover, arbitral tribunals can adopt realistic time-frames, engage expert knowledge, and, in certain circumstances, admit amicus curiae opinions, as well as to adapt processes with flexibility depending on the nature and scope of the dispute. 2. It's efficient Urgency, timeliness and avoidance of delay are critical when it comes to climate-related disputes, as some environmental impacts may have irreversible consequences if not dealt with at an early stage. Arbitration and ADR mechanisms are well suited for these types of disputes, as they typically do not take years to resolve--regardless of the number of parties and complexity of the case. Arbitrators and appointees under ICC Arbitration Rules, ICC Mediation Rules and ICC Expert Rules, are selected according to availability and as such, parties give much weight to time as a factor in the resolution of their dispute. The ICC International Court of Arbitration maintains fundamental procedural safeguards and due process considerations for all interested parties involved, parties who also benefit from a careful scrutiny process of the final award by the ICC Court. Further still, parties and arbitral tribunals have the possibility to adopt certain case management techniques to facilitate prompt resolution of climate change-related disputes and can agree to use Expedited Procedure Rules among other prompt solutions. 3. It's tailoured to your needs Arguably the single most important feature when arbitrating climate change-related disputes is the ability to ensure appropriate expertise is available to parties and tribunals when it comes to understanding the dispute and its specific resolution techniques. The ICC Rules of Arbitration make it possible for parties to have a decisive impact on the choice of their arbitrators, especially with regard to competence and skill. When it comes to experts, the ICC International Centre for ADR conducts a bespoke search in every case in order to identify individuals who fit the particular case criteria. And under the ICC Arbitration Rules and dispute resolution practice, there are several additional features in place--including the use of escalating dispute resolution clauses in order to settle and resolve the dispute before the commencement of an arbitration; emergency arbitration; interim and conservatory measures; and other time and cost management techniques--that may be used depending on the unique needs of your case. As the institutional representative of more than 45 million companies in over 100 countries, ICC has the experience, knowledge and global network to mobilise bold action at scale, whether through advocacy for policy frameworks that support the alignment of business operations or working to reach the additional goal of net-zero emissions. Intentionally launched ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ), this fit-for-purpose resource includes everything an arbitrator, user or even state official would need to effectively deal with intricacies of climate-related cases--from real-world examples and sample clauses for contracts to insights from internationally renowned institutions. Download your digital copy of our ICC Commission Report on Resolving Climate Change-Related Disputes through Arbitration and ADR today or browse the document through our dedicated ICC DRS app. A second global launch event is slated for 21 January 2020 in New York, United States.

""It would have been a big task had Aloka Sharma been in post from the beginning, rather than coming in late in the process. It's now vital he works very closely with the backing of the Prime Minister to both get other countries to commit to new pledges to tackle the climate crisis but also put the UK's own house in order and enact policies to accelerate UK decarbonisation. As Secretary of State of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Sharma will be well placed to oversee this. ""For developing countries this will require technological and financial support so they can leapfrog our dirty development path and increase their resilience to climate impacts. ""In order to be a credible host, the UK needs to rapidly step up efforts to reduce emissions at home, not just boast about its 2050 net zero target. The target is only worth anything if it drives short term decarbonisation and so far those plans are thin on the ground. ""The UK also needs to stop spending taxpayers' money to prop up the fossil fuel industry - which has done the most to fuel this climate fire.

The challenge seeks to map out more than a thousand youth-led grassroot solutions for climate change throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The regional youth engagement initiative aims to empower, connect and mobilize adolescents and young people in the Americas and the Caribbean and is coordinated by CONCAUSA, a joint program between the NGO America Solidaria, UNICEF and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). The 1,000 actions for change regional challenge was launched during the Local Conference of Youth (LCOY) of PreCOP 25, which precedes the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ), to be held in Chile in December 2019. ""We want to show what we, the youth of the continent, have to say about this crisis, and above all that we are acting and that our contribution is substantive,"" said Catalina Silva, an 18-year-old Chilean young climate activist who is already acting for solutions as one of the three regional Youth Ambassadors of CONCAUSA. Together with about 70 other young people from Costa Rica and other countries attending the LCOY, Catalina contributed to draft a youth declaration with key recommendations for #ClimateAction that will be presented to government officials and other stakeholders during the pre- COP 25 opening plenary event in Costa Rica. ""Climate change is not an opinion"", said Epsy Campbell Barr, Vice President of Costa Rica. ""It is factual data, scientifically proven. Each rising degree subtracts from our possibilities of permanence and survival on this planet, it increases poverty, inequity, migration, and sickness. Costa Rica is committed to create a wider platform for these solutions designed by youth to be amplified. We call upon other governments to join us. It is our responsibility to support their efforts, because they are the shining generation."" During the closure of the LCOY, the Vice President took note of the demands expressed by youth and stressed the vital role that governments must play to scale up solution-oriented and youth-driven climate actions. Based on EM-DAT Emergency Events Database, UNICEF estimates that over 63 million children in Latin America and the Caribbean have been affected by an extreme weather event or climate related disaster over the past 30 years. On average about 2.1 million Latin American and Caribbean children are affected every year. ""We all have seen and heard teen climate activists marching in the streets, but have we recognized the solutions they are crafting on the ground to prevent climate change?"" asked UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean Bernt Aasen. ""A green generation of youth is leading climate action because we, adults, have decided to ignore them for too long. Thirty years after the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, there is no better pledge for Governments in the region than building a greener and healthier planet for children today and tomorrow."" On the road to the next global climate conference, COP25 , UNICEF, which already supports mitigation and adaptation policies for climate change, urges governments and decision-makers from Latin America and Caribbean to accelerate commitments and support youth-led solutions through the following calls to action on climate change:  Climate policies must provide for urgent and ambitious mitigation and adaptation measures, aligned with the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and commitments to enhance climate resilience and reduce vulnerability.  Children, adolescents and young people must be considered a priority in climate policies at all levels, recognising their specific needs, vulnerabilities, rights and leadership. In particular, the most marginalised and vulnerable children should be prioritised.  Countries now have a critical opportunity to consider the rights of children and young people in their revised Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and in their long-term low emissions development strategies.  Climate policy-making must be informed by, and commit to, consultation of children, adolescents and young people at all stages, including planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.  Mitigation and adaptation policies should identify priorities and sector-based interventions that are most material to children's needs and rights, delivering maximum impact and social co-benefits for children.

Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-NJ-09), co-sponsor of the landmark Green New Deal, Friday offered his support for H.Res.743, a House resolution condemning the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. The resolution was introduced after the Trump administration initiated the formal withdrawal process to remove the United States from the landmark pact to address global climate change. ""Climate change is the existential threat to everything we hold dear. It puts our health, our economy, and our national security in peril. If we hope to leave our children and grandchildren with a better future, the United States must be a global leader fighting climate change,"" said Rep. Pascrell. ""Now is not the time for our nation to abdicate its leadership role on the world stage. And we cannot allow Donald Trump's cowardice and complicity to prevent us from doing our part. Trump's move again renders America an international pariah and the only country only earth not supporting the Paris Accords. Therefore, I proudly stand with over 150 of my House colleagues to signal our condemnation of Trump's inability to lead and our willingness to fulfill the commitments we made in the Paris Agreement."" The resolution's introduction coincides with the ongoing 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP25 . Trump sent no senior members of his administration to attend the conference, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation in support of the agreement - and continued global coordination in combating climate change. Rep. Pascrell's efforts to protect our environment and combat climate change stem from his mission to leave a better world for future generations.

Here's our full coverage. Slavery: Not a historical relic More than 40 million people worldwide are victims of modern slavery, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said on Monday, International Day for the Abolition of Slavery. Although modern slavery is not defined in law, it essentially refers to situations of exploitation where a person cannot exercise free will in terms of their labour, because of threats, violence, coercion, deception, or abuse of power. It covers practices such as forced labour, debt bondage, forced marriage and human trafficking. Global estimates reveal that some 40.3 million people are in modern slavery including 24.9 in forced labour and 15.4 million in forced marriages. And women and girls are disproportionately affected, accounting for 99 per cent of victims in the commercial sex industry. Moreover, for every 1,000 people in the world, 5.4 are victims of modern slavery, one-in-four of them children. AIDS agency worker raises the bar in 24-hour record-breaking challenge Sunday was World AIDS Day, and to mark that and raise awareness about child sexual abuse linked to HIV, one ironman has raised the bar, literally. Starting at midday on Sunday in Geneva and finishing 24 hours later, Peter Koopmans completed 1,500 pull-ups, 3,000 press-ups, 4,500 squat thrusts and a 15-mile run all with a 20lb (that about 10 kilos) weight vest on. That'll help to care for abused youngsters in South Africa, where reported cases of child abuse have increased by 400 per cent in the past nine years. Listen to what Mr. Koopman had to say in Daniel Johnson's interview with him: $48 billion and counting, the cost of Israeli occupation for Palestinians According to UN economists, the cost of Israeli occupation for the Palestinian people from 2000 to 2017 is nearly $48 billion in lost revenue. In a report to Member States in New York, the UN Trade and Development Agency (UNCTAD) warned that the Palestinian economy has been severely stunted, owing to its chronic fiscal and trade deficit and the fact that it's highly dependent on the Israeli economy. Of the $47.7 billion in lost earnings, more than $28 billion is interest charges accrued over the years. Another $6.6 billion is in so-called ""leaked"" Palestinian revenues to Israel, UNCTAD maintained. It cited restrictions on the free movement of the people and goods between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, control by Israel of all border crossing points and limits on Palestinians' free use of land and resources, as reasons for the huge losses. The study also highlighted economic models indicating that if the lost billions had been injected into the economy, they would have generated around two million jobs over the 18-year period. Sustainable development, sustainable debt: ""Inseparable"": UN deputy chief High debt and debt distress can ""easily undermine"" the development progress that the African countries have achieved, Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said on Monday at a conference on sustainability and debt in Dakar, Senegal. ""High debt creates uncertainty, deterring investment and innovation, and stalling economic growth and development"", the deputy UN chief said at the inaugural session of the discussion, co-organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Senegalese Government. She outlined areas of importance, which included strengthening countries' debt management capacity; combatting illicit financial flows; introducing innovative debt instruments and targeting debt relief. ""As the scale of the challenge is becoming clearer, the international community needs to step up"", she maintained. Pointing to the 1990s debt crisis, she stressed the need ""to ensure that history does not repeat itself"". ""We need strong political will from African countries and the commitment of international partners to address the structural issues that constrain sustainable development financing in Africa"", she spelled out. ""We are encouraging countries to adopt integrated national financing frameworks....[to] help align all financing policies and approaches from tax to investment, aid and debt with national priorities"", concluded the deputy UN chief. \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA265","COP 25: African Development Bank Urges African Nations to Persist With Climate Change Ambitions as Marathon Talks End in Madrid","December 17, 2019 Tuesday 8:41 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The African Development Bank issued the following news release: The African Development Bank has urged the continent's nations to stay the course on climate action, after a marathon session of talks at the twenty-fifth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 25 ) in Madrid. The conference was scheduled to run from 2 to 13 December, but only concluded business on Sunday, two days after the official programme ended. Meanwhile, back home, Africans were reminded of the all-too-real consequences if these talks fail to deliver results. Thousands of East Africans have been displaced in the wake of heavy rains that have battered the region since October, and more wet weather is expected due to an Indian Ocean Dipole attributed to the warming of the ocean. Such extreme weather events should galvanise Africans; their governments are spending 2% of GDP on climate related disasters, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. He encouraged the global community to remain steadfast in finding effective solutions to climate change. The annual negotiations are now in their 25th year. ""The global community, and in particular Africa has a lot to offer in terms of solutions; what is evidently lacking is the global political will to turn potential into wealth to serve humanity and the planet,"""" said Nyong, who led the Bank's delegation to the UN conference. At the conference, African delegates pushed for support for climate finance to build resilience against the impact of climate change and for special consideration for Africa around targets contained in the treaties under discussion. The discussions at COP 25 centred around the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to cut carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2 C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5 C. The conference ended with a declaration on the ""urgent need"" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement. The African Development Bank attended the conference to lend strategic support to its regional member countries in the negotiations. Nyong pointed out that Africa is committed; 51 of the 54 African countries have already ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement signed at the landmark COP21 in Paris. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set. Support for the Bank-funded Desert to Power project highlighted Africa's determination to strive for a climate-friendly world, especially for its local populations, said Nyong. Desert to Power is a $20 billion initiative to deploy solar energy solutions across the entire Sahel region, generating 10,000 MW to provide 250 million people with clean electricity. ""The African Development Bank stands ready as ever to assist its regional member countries to build resilience against climate change, as indicated by the Bank's decision to join the Alliance for Hydromet Development, announced at COP 25 . The Alliance will assist developing countries to build resilience against the impact of natural disasters caused by extreme weather,"" Nyong said. The Bank will also continue to drive initiatives to strengthen the ability of regional member countries to advocate robustly at global forums such as COP 25 , Nyong added. One example was the Bank's participation at the annual African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and support for the Africa Group of Negotiations (AGN). ""We look forward to engaging further with regional member countries and other parties to ensure that the continent's development agenda remains on track,"" Nyong added. Leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, attended the conference in Madrid.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA266","After Violent Clashes of 2019, Investors Reassess Chile's Prospects for Renewable Energy","Greentech Media","Newstex Blogs ","Jan 08, 2020( Greentech Media: HYPERLINK http://www.greentechmedia.com http://www.greentechmedia.com COP 25 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December after cost-of-living protests that started in the capital, Santiago, in October spread to other cities. Violent clashes with police left 29 dead. COP 25 was ultimately [1]held in Spain. Chile's unrest threatened to stymie foreign interest in clean power investments that had helped the country's renewables market become one of the hottest in Latin America, with a compound annual growth rate of 31.5 percent for non-hydro renewables from 2000 to 2018, according to GlobalData[2]. Chile's renewables market benefits from big energy demand from the country's mining sector as well as some of best solar resource on the planet. Chile's economy has been one of the better bets in Latin America in recent years. Dr. Arnoldus Mateo van den Hurk Mir, a Spain-based renewables and mining consultant with extensive knowledge of the Chilean market, said the market should recover from any impact from the unrest. The protests would 'only delay some investments,"" van den Hurk Mir said. ""Electrification and the relationship with green energy is booming in Chile.' Recent announcements would seem to bear this out. Last month, the Spanish renewables developer Acciona said it would build 84 megawatts of wind and 64 megawatts of solar in Chile this year, taking its Chilean generation portfolio up to 684 megawatts. 'Our commitment to continue investing in Chile remains intact,' said Acciona's director general of energy for South America, Jos Ignacio Escobar, ina press statement[3]. And, asreported in GTMlast month, struggling German turbine maker Enercon is counting on[4]a 607-megawatt Chilean wind farm, Horizonte, to help make up for weak sales in its home market. Return to 'relative tranquility' Peter Horn, CEO at the Chilean solar installer Heliplast, experienced Chile's recent troubles first-hand. 'Our office is next to Costanera Center [a commercial district in Santiago] and the metro was closed, so in the first days it was hard to get in and out of the office and clients couldn't make it,' he said. Nevertheless, Horn told GTM, business in October ended up being 'for better rather than for worse' and as of last month there was 'relative tranquility and normal sales.' Horn said he did not think overall investment in renewables would be significantly affected by the recent unrest, which has largely died down after the October resignation of eight cabinet members and the November announcement that a new constitution would be put to a referendum this April. However, 'investments in commercial and residential rooftop PV will drop, because they are not basic necessities,' Horn predicted. 'The country's image has deteriorated, and the most obvious effect will be higher interest rates."" In the meantime, Chile's administration is working to quell investor concerns. Andres Perez, head of international finance at Chile's Finance Ministry, toured North America and Asia last month, and the government rushed out videos of investors[5] voicing their confidence in the Chilean market. The videos included a testimonial from Ignacio Deschamps, group head of international banking and digital transformation at Scotiabank, which last July joined BBVA and Mizuho Bank in providing a $150 million revolving credit line for Enel Chile. On balance,Chile's foreign reputation for sound fiscal management has survived the biggest social upheaval in a generation largely intact,experts have said.Although economic activity shrank 5.4 percent month-on-month in October, market confidence has been recovering, according to reporting from Bloomberg[6]. Chile's renewables market in 2020 The apparent resilience of the Chilean economy bodes well for the continued development of renewables throughout 2020. The next 12 months should see permitting of the Horizonte wind farm, which developer Colb\'fan says[7] will be the biggest in Latin America and is set to begin construction in 2021[8]. Also due this year is the commissioning of the largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in Chile and Latin America, developed by Cerro Dominador with funding from EIG Global Energy Partners. Cerro Dominador connected[9] its plant to the grid on Jan. 6. The 100-megawatt plant is being promoted as the first in Latin America, ignoring the fact that mining company Minera El Tesoro inaugurated what was then considered the world's largest CSP project just 30 miles away in 2012[10]. Last month, Cerro Dominador's CEO, Fernando Gonzlez, told Chilean news channel Pauta that Chile's protests hadn't dimmed his company's growth ambitions. 'We have a long-term vision that has not been affected by the current situation,' he said[11]. 'We want to grow as quickly as we can.'

""This weekend, I am proud to travel to Madrid, Spain, as part of a Congressional Delegation to the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference . We will be there to represent the United States Congress and to send a clear message that we understand the existential threat that is the climate crisis. ""The climate crisis is the greatest test we have ever faced, but it is also an opportunity. ""Atmospheric carbon dioxide pollution concentrations are already well above the 350 ppm level that - not that long ago - was understood to be the cap we had to stay under. Several feet of additional sea level rise are already guaranteed, and several tipping points have already been passed. ""In the final analysis, we will be judged not by our colleagues or even our voters, but by our grandchildren. We owe them a climate that is as stable as the one we inherited from those who came before us. That will require massive, coordinated, international action, and that is our test. ""But the climate crisis is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity because the biggest source of carbon pollution is burning fossil fuel, which costs money. ""Lowering carbon pollution saves money. Every solar panel, every electric vehicle, every reinsulated home represents a financial investment that also provides a more stable climate for our children. As Amory Lovins says people don't want coal or oil. They want warm showers and cold beers. ""Every time we invest in projects to give us useful, clean energy with less purchased fuel input, we make ourselves wealthier and help our environment. That is our opportunity. ""In 1988, the United States ratified the Montreal Protocol, using market mechanisms to reduce ozone-destroying compounds. That was the direct result of leadership. Leadership from the Reagan and Bush administrations it should be noted. ""That idea was subsequently incorporated into the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to lower acid-rain forming compounds. In both cases, we proved that economic and environmental policy can work in harmony with one another to avert environmental disaster. ""Unfortunately, the United States has failed to bring that leadership to greenhouse gas emissions. Even worse, we have walked away from the international agreements that would do so. ""And while House Democrats joined together to pass H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, sending a clear message that just like the thousands of localities, cities and U.S. companies, we are still in on the Paris Agreement, Senate Republicans and the President have met this historic effort with inaction and a resounding silence. That is not leadership. It is cowardice. ""It is also dangerous. Half of all the carbon pollution we have ever emitted as a species has been released since 1988. ""Since the year we signed the Montreal Protocol. Since the year Bruce Springsteen played 'Chimes of Freedom' in front of a still-standing Berlin Wall. Since the year that James Hansen testified to the U.S. Senate that global warming was, in fact, already well-underway. ""But the greatness of the United States - and our greatest gift to the world - is our leadership. We are not perfect, but since World War II there has been no greater advocate for equality, for the rule of law and for international peace than the United States. ""We have the ability - no, we have the moral obligation - to lead in this moment as well. ""The times have found us, and we will not shirk from our responsibilities. That will be our message to our allies in Madrid, and that is our charge moving forward. ""House Democrats will continue leading For The People: to lower health costs and prescription drug prices; to raise wages by rebuilding the infrastructure of America in a green, resilient, transformative way; and to clean up corruption to make Washington work for you. ""With optimism, with patriotism, but with a fierce and unbending commitment to the urgency we face, we will lead. ""Thank you."" \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA270","A Key Climate Justice Question at COP25: What Role Should Carbon Markets Play in Meeting Paris Goals?","December 6, 2019 05:39 AM GMT","Inside Climate News","Climate justice advocates at the UN climate summit this week are focusing their frustration over global climate inaction into one highly technical debate: What role should carbon markets play in meeting the promise of the Paris climate accord? Carbon markets started as a way to offer polluters more flexibility as they try to meet their countries' emissions reduction targets and, in theory, lower the cost. But past international emissions trading systems have failed to reduce emissions significantly, and representatives of vulnerable and indigenous groups argue that their communities end up bearing the brunt of pollution under such systems, as industries seek to make emissions reductions where it is easiest and cheapest. Writing the rules for future carbon market mechanisms to fulfill the Paris commitments is at the top of the agenda for the delegates of nearly 200 nations gathered in Spain through Dec. 13 at the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ). But the task has proven so difficult that it remains the last unresolved portion of the Paris treaty rulebook. The controversy around this part of the Paris climate agreement, known as Article 6, is even more striking given the long history of international discussions over carbon markets, which nations have looked to as part of the climate solution ever since adopting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. But to opponents in the environmental justice and indigenous people's communities, that long experience has engendered mistrust. Sign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories. Your inbox. Every weekend. ""Over and over again, carbon markets have proven that they are not effective in reducing emissions,"" said Tere Almaguer, environmental justice organizer for PODER in San Francisco. Her group focuses on organizing Latino communities-including those who live near California refineries and feel that they bear the brunt of poor air quality from fossil fuel emissions. She says the state's carbon cap-and-trade system allows the oil companies to invest in far-flung carbon mitigation projects rather than cutting emissions at home, leaving the communities to continue suffering the consequences. Referring to industry investments in forest preservation projects in the developing world to earn credit for cutting emissions, Almaguer said: ""You're privatizing forests in our Mother Lands so you'll be able to pollute more in our communities."" PODER is part of the It Takes Roots alliance of some 200 indigenous and grassroots groups in the United States and Canada, which declared Thursday ""No Carbon Markets Day"" at the talks, staging protests and panel discussions to urge delegates to jettison emissions trading. A large coalition of businesses, including banks and oil companies, argued that the cost of climate action could be cut in half with the help of emissions trading. They say that could help nations set more ambitious emissions-reduction goals, as they will need to do if the world is to meet the goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), whose members include BP, Chevron and Shell, released a report this fall estimating that carbon markets have the potential to cut the cost of implementing the Paris accord by about $250 billion annually by 2030. About half of the nations' pledges under the Paris accord signal interest in using carbon market mechanisms. What Went Wrong with Carbon Trading? In theory, emissions trading gives nations a financial incentive to drive down emissions, because they'll get credits for their efforts-renewable energy projects, forestry conservation, and the like-that they can sell to other countries that are having trouble meeting their emissions targets. But in reality, international carbon markets established under the 1997 Kyoto accord have been plagued by mismanagement and outright corruption. European Union nations handed out too many free credits to their industries when they established the first and largest carbon market, the EU Emissions Trading System, in 2005. As a result, the price of polluting was too low to drive a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The failure was more dramatic in the other big carbon market established under the 1997 Kyoto accord-the Clean Development Mechanism, which channeled $138 billion into some 8,000 projects in developing countries. Those investments were meant to cut carbon emissions, but one study estimated that 85 percent of the projects would have happened with or without the CDM-meaning the value of the system was questionable at best. In one notorious case, the details of which became public because of litigation, Brazil's power giant Eletrobr\'e1s told the CDM Executive Board that its Amazon mega-hydroelectric dam projects needed CDM credit to attract investors, while telling investors the dams were fully viable on their own. The EU Emissions Trading System has stopped accepting credits from CDM projects in Brazil, China and India, and California's carbon market won't accept CDM credits at all. As a result, the value of CDM credits, which peaked at about $23 per ton in 2008, are now down to about 30 cents, according to the World Bank's latest review of the state of the world carbon markets. The World Bank report said there are 57 carbon tax or emissions trading initiatives underway in 2019, up about 10 percent over last year, mostly due to Canada's new carbon pricing policy. But only 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are covered by a carbon price, and less than 5 percent of those are currently priced at levels that are ""consistent with reaching the temperature goals of the Paris agreement,"" according to the World Bank. ""We've been on the front line for years working on mitigation and adaptation of climate change, and we have studied all the solutions coming out of these hallways of the UNFCCC,"" said Tom Goldtooth, from Indigenous Environmental Network, in an interview from Madrid. ""In the early years, we were concerned about carbon markets, and whether it was a real solution or not, but I think everyone was waiting to see. ""Now, we know they don't cut emissions,"" Goldtooth said. ""That's not what they're about. They are a trading agreement. We are banking on a solution that's going to save Mother Earth and the evidence is that this doesn't lead to them."" Transparency and 'Double Counting' But there have been some carbon market successes. California's cap-and-trade carbon pricing system, despite the criticisms, is ahead of its 2020 clean energy goals. For the first time since California started to track greenhouse gas emissions, the state power grid used more electricity from zero-emissions sources like solar and wind power than from fossil fuel sources. In the northeast United States, states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) have cut their carbon emissions from power generation by 47 percent-90 percent faster than the rest of the country, according to a study by the clean energy nonprofit Acadia Center. That's why some environmental advocates argue that Article 6 could be a crucial engine of emissions cuts under the Paris accord-if the design of the system is right. Some of the important issues are transparency and rules to prevent ""double counting""-that is, more than one nation taking credit for emissions reduction projects. Brazil has been one of the countries that has been pushing back against the double-counting restrictions as too limiting. In addition, Brazil Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said this week that his nation will view it as crucial for credits from the old CDM system to be carried forward in implementation of the Paris accord. ""We can't disregard efforts done in the past,"" he said. ""This is something very important for credibility."" The pressure to come to an agreement is great, especially with so much concern about nations' commitments being insufficient to stave off catastrophic climate impacts. Andres Couve, Chile's minister of science and technology, has called resolution of Article 6 the main objective of COP25 . An agreement would be a ""great triumph"" for the conference, said Couve, whose nation represents the presidency of the conference even though the conclave was moved to Spain due to social unrest in Chile. But Kelley Kizzier, associate vice president for international climate at the Environmental Defense Fund, argues no agreement on carbon markets would be better than a bad one. ""Countries must resist the urge to just tick the box on getting the Article 6 rules done - they need to get them done right,"" she wrote in a blog post on the eve of the talks. ""The integrity of the Paris agreement and countries' climate commitments hang in the balance."" \"

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA272","Principled Inaction in the Face of Climate Change Extremism","December 4, 2019 Wednesday","The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity","For the next two weeks, delegates from nearly 200 countries and 29,000 visitors will be convening in Madrid for a summit on climate change. The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ,  COP25 According to Guterres,  What is still lacking is political will. And yet, despite all this  lack of political will, some 70 countries have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050. Conspicuously\~absent\~from the proceedings, however, is the Trump Administration. No senior member of President Trump\' s administration is in attendance at COP25 . AMERICA FIRST ON CARBON EMISSIONS The main reason behind the administration\' s absence from the Madrid summit is that the key objective of the program is to negotiate the finer details of the Paris Climate Accord the agreement that President Trump has withdrawn us from in the name of American interests.  [T]o fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, the President\~announced\~in June 2017, voicing an interest in negotiating an  entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.  I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, he\~retorted, critically appraising that the Paris Accords:  [C]alls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America\' s existing and massive foreign aid payments.\~ So we\' re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we\' re already way ahead of anybody else.\~ Many of the other countries haven\' t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime. Earlier last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the\~administration sent\~an official notification of its plans to exit the Paris Agreement. This was the\~first step in the year-long process to leave the agreement that allegedly aims to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The full withdrawal is scheduled for November 4, 2020, a day after the next presidential election. The media, often enthusiastic contributors to climate catastrophizing, has presented the administration\' s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as an indication that the world\' s environmental health has somehow been derailed.  [F]or us to be the exception on this issue is holding the world back, \~NPR reports\~Andrew Light saying, a former climate official in the State Department who helped develop the Paris Agreement. But that\' s not remotely accurate. In positioning America first, the President is refusing to sacrifice the immediate economic needs of everyday Americans in the face of an inflated threat. The Paris Agreement would have Americans dole out millions of dollars to the so-called developing world countries like China and India who refuse to take accountability for their own catastrophic environmental policies. President Trump will not capitulate to this kind of climate bullying, especially if it\~compromises\~our global leadership as energy providers both traditional and renewable. CLIMATE EXTREMISM IN THE FACE OF THRIVING ECOLOGICAL GROWTH It\' s not just the technical negotiations over how climate policy will affect American industry; it\' s the facticity of climate catastrophe itself that the Trump administration has bravely called into question. Historical periods of warm global temperature, often higher than our current climate, were commonly referred to as  climate optima because of the higher temperature and their associated benefits to Earth\' s ecosystems. The terminology has fallen into disfavor, however, in recent years, due to a media and scientific blacklisting of any mention of benefits owing to higher temperature. But before climate science became politicized, these past warm periods were associated with a thriving, prospering planet, and human civilization benefited in tandem. The inconvenient facts, at least to the climate catastrophe crowd, is that the bulk of their predictions are errant speculations about what may or may not occur, 50 or 80 years in the future, based on climate models that substantially overestimate temperature rise. In reality, by nearly every metric, we see that humans are thriving in the changing ecosystem. The current changing climate has led to increasing food production, soil moisture, crop growth, and a\~ greening of the Earth. All the while\~droughts,\~forest fires,\~heatwaves\~and,\~temperature-related deaths\~have declined substantially. Yes, there is such a thing as the greenhouse effect. Yes, there has been some warming. Yes, some of the warming is likely man-made. Yes, some further man-made warming is to be expected. On all these matters, few would disagree; they are all self-evident. But no, past and future anthropogenic warming do not mean that catastrophe will follow, or that measures to prevent global warming are scientifically and economically justified. Only the radical worldview of environmental catastrophizing could ignore benefits being accrued from atmospheric changes while embracing harmful economic policies based on fallacious climate models. What the  crisis narrative is achieving, however, is extreme regulation and expropriation of profits from the energy sector. For leaders supporting the Paris agreement, the specter of catastrophic warming provides the moral justification for ever-higher taxation, ever-tighter regulation, ever-greater state interference, ever-larger slush funds for big-spending politicians, and ever-diminished individual freedom to use, acquire, and consume at will. President Trump is bravely taking a stance against environmental extremism.  What we won\' t do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters, President Trump said during a keynote to natural gas executives and employees at the\~Shale Insight conference in October of 2017. Pointing to the rising U.S. oil and gas production, and his efforts to deregulate the industry in the name of ending the  war on energy, President Trump applauded his audience:  With unmatched skill, grit and devotion, you\' re making America the greatest energy superpower in the history of the world. THE NON-PROBLEM OF MAN-MADE  THERMAGEDDON Imagine the enormous pressure on President Trump to keep the United States in the Paris climate accord. Worldwide indignation and scorn were heaped on him after his decision to withdraw from the agreement. But it was the correct and principled one to make. Thanks to near-total control of the news media by proponents of a pending Thermageddon, critical truths are poorly understood and even derided. The truth that there is no  consensus among climate scientists and that  consensus would not matter even if it existed. The truth is that global warming will be small, and largely beneficial ecological event, and preventing it would be orders of magnitude costlier than adapting to it. The truth that the correct policy is to have the courage to do nothing. Like it or not, the truth is the truth. Policy should, in the end, be based on objective reality, and not on the back of a lavishly-funded and elaborate international campaigns of crafty and lucrative falsehoods promoted by the political, financial, corporate, bureaucratic and media establishments. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA273","David Suzuki Foundation: Scientists Behind IPCC Report on Land and Climate Urge Action at COP25","December 4, 2019 Wednesday 7:20 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The David Suzuki Foundation issued the following news release: Scientists at the international climate summit in Madrid today spoke to the urgency of protecting nature systems as a tool for fighting climate change. The lead authors of the special report, Climate Change and Land, released earlier this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the way in which we grow, process and distribute food, and manage forests, is causing close to a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. As countries from around the world meet to decide on the how the remaining elements of the Paris Agreement will be implemented, a message of urgent action spurred on by the findings from reports like this can be heard throughout the meetings. The scientists gave a clear message that we must do all we can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, not only by shifting to 100 per cent clean energy, but also by protecting natural systems that absorb carbon pollution from the atmosphere. Protecting and restoring natural landscapes is a crucial way to absorb excess carbon dioxide and help meet climate goals. ""The message from the scientists today reinforces the pivotal moment already underway in Canada. Momentum is building for bold climate action - on the streets, in the courts and in city halls. This summit is an opportunity for the new federal government to respond to the strong desire of a growing majority of Canadians for climate action with strengthened laws and policies,"" David Suzuki Foundation CEO Stephen Cornish said. Land-use practices have implications for water supply, food security, desertification, drought, soil erosion and degradation and climate, according to the scientists. ""Climate breakdown from the buildup of heat-trapping carbon emissions -- including drought, fire, floods and extreme weather -- will mean severe risks to food security and human health around the world. We want our government in Canada to support stronger national targets and timelines to shrink carbon pollution. Unless serious immediate action is taken, our government will deprive young Canadians of the future they deserve,"" Cornish said. Research by the David Suzuki Foundation shows that protecting natural assets such as forests, wetlands and peatlands helps reduce the risks of climate disruption by sequestering carbon, and offers benefits like water filtration, erosion control, flood reduction and more.

Below are the Speaker's remarks: Speaker Pelosi. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your leadership. It's an honor to be with each and every one of you and all of you, because we're here at the heart of the matter - the vulnerable countries, vulnerable.Thank you, Madam Prime Minister, for your courage and taking on the leadership of all of this. Bringing your experience from the challenges you face to the reputation you enjoy, we're all blessed by your leadership.I am very honored to be here with a high-powered delegation from the U.S., from the U.S. Congress, and I'd like them all to stand so you can see our commitment to this climate. We have Senator Whitehouse from the United States Senate; Mr. Chairman Ra\'fal Grijalva; Madam Chair - where are we? Julia Brownley, Madam Chair, but all these - our Chairmen, Kathy Castor, Chair of our Select Committee on Climate Change; our Debbie Dingell of Michigan; Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon; Betty McCollum of Minnesota; Madam Chair of - No? Should I start all over?[Laughter]Madam Chair from Texas - Madam Chair, thank you - Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the [Science, Space and Technology] Committee; Frank Pallone, Chair of Energy and Commerce; Scott Peters of California, member of the - of that committee; Mike Levin, member of the Select Committee on Climate; Jared Huffman, member of the Select Committee, as well from California; Joe Neguse of Colorado; Mr. Casten from Illinois - Did I reach everyone here? All of them?We're very proud of them, because they have at the top of their agenda their priority to recognize the U.S. goal in saving this planet for future generations. This is a mission. This is a passion. This is a scientifically-based approach to all of our views. And we are here to say to all of you, on behalf of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States, we're still in it. We are still in it.[Applause]We are - it's an honor, Patrick, to be with you and to all of the distinguished guests who are here. Patricia - oh no, we lost Patricia - but Patricia has been to California. She's seen what our Governor Jerry Brown and, now, our current Governor Gavin Newsom are doing in this, but you made two examples across the country: mayors, governors, non-profits, for-profits, the private sector - everyone understands. But nobody understands it better than our children, than what is at stake and I'm so glad that we have a youth representative that will be here, because the future is yours and you have a responsibility to save it, as well as to urge us to help you do so.Here's how we see it: we see this as an existential threat. Mr. President, you were twelve, but I was at the Rio Conference, and we never would have suspected then, with all the ambition that we have - had then, that we would be where we are today, fighting this fight. We have not, we have not lived up to the challenge. They say the challenge that was generational, continues to be generational.We see it as a public health issue. Clean air, clean water for everyone, including the most vulnerable, of course, because the most vulnerable, whether it's other nation or a vulnerable community pay the biggest price. Clean air, clean water, public health.We see it as an economic issue, because this is a way for us to [advance] new green technologies, based on science and technology to take us into the future, while creating good-paying jobs, lifting everyone up.We see it as a national security issue, an issue where, as Madam Prime Minister mentioned, migration. An issue where so many things spring from the competition of resources, when we're talking about the encroachment of deserts, the rising sea level, the thermal management of the planet that is going astray, the - all of the - distinguished Secretary General mentioned that he had seen when he travels - the world this produces.And we have seen, Mr. President, when we were recently in the Northern Triangle of Central America, migration resulting from the fact that farmers can't farm because of drought, one thing or another. Everything in nature is connected and it becomes a national security issue, when the competition for resources, land and the rest. So, mitigation and resilience and all the rest of that, have to be so much a part of all of this and not - nowhere does it fall harder than the vulnerable nations.And, then we see it as a moral issue. When we were in Rio, they had a big religious service, every aspect of religion or no religion, but just belief in the future, and that was about our moral responsibility. If you believe, as some of us do, that this is God's creation, that we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. Being real sure, that if you're faith-based or lack thereof, that we all do believe we have a moral responsibility to future generations to pass on this planet in a better way, in the best possible way.So, that is the agenda that we bring, that and other - technology and science and the rest of that being the basis for how we can lead the challenge, but it is something very, very - how can I say this? - urgent to the people of the United States. They understand it. Our young people are leading the way, as they are in the rest of the country.I just want to say, next year, the G-7 will meet in San Francisco - no - in the United States. It will probably be in Washington. I'd like it to be in San Francisco, that's my home district. But, the reason I mention that is because in a meeting we had this year was in France - it was in Brest - we focused on the oceans and the challenge to the oceans. By 2050, if we don't do things differently, there can be as many tons of plastics in the oceans as there are tons of fish in the ocean. That's the urgency of addressing this urgently. And, I'm glad that this is a blue cup about the oceans, as well.And I just will say this, when we focused on the - they had the G-7 of the heads of state, and then we had the G-7 of the heads of parliament and in the heads of parliament meeting, in Brest, in France, under leadership of the Prime - the President of the National Assembly, we focused on climate and the oceans. Next year, when we have one in the United States, the title of our meeting for the heads of parliament is 'Addressing the Climate Crisis with Economic and Environmental Justice for All.' We see this as a big environmental justice issue, as well.I just want to quote His Holiness the Pope, as I close - did I say I was closing already? His Holiness, when he came to Congress and spoke to us a few years ago, he said, and he wrote in his encyclical, no doubt they've seen, 'The climate is a common good belonging to all and meant for all.'Together we can and must build a climate resilient - now, this is me, I just wanted to - a resilient world to defend that common good now and for generations to come. For health, for the economy, for security, national security and for honoring our responsibilities to future generations. That's why we have such a large, distinguished delegation, chairs of the committees working on this issue. We've had already 100 hearings already on this subject, on the subject of climate. We are preparing legislation, as we go forward.We are here to listen and learn from all of you, as to how we can do better.Thank you all very much for the opportunity. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA275","Shaheen, Hassan Introduce Legislation to Reduce Emissions and Bolster the Clean Energy Economy; Sen. Hassan, Margaret Wood - (D - NH) News Release","February 11, 2020","Congressional Documents and Publications","(Washington, DC) - Today, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) introduced the Clean Economy Act with Tom Carper (D-DE) and a number of other colleagues. The legislation will boost American competitiveness while putting the United States on a path to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world's leading scientists have warned that humanity must limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. According to the United Nations' annual Emissions Gap Report released last month, collective global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are not yet substantial enough to reach that temperature goal. The Clean Economy Act heeds the call for bold climate action and at the same time promotes healthier frontline communities and fosters a growing economy that works for everyone. The Clean Economy Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use existing authorities to put our country on a pathway to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. Any plan developed by the EPA must achieve rapid reductions at minimal costs, prioritize public health and support a strong labor workforce. EPA is also required to build upon existing state, local and private climate programs and set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2025, 2030 and 2040. Other federal agencies would be required to do their part to help the nation meet the net-zero goal and help enhance America's global competitiveness through investments in research and development, innovation and equitable access to worker training. ""Americans are seeing the devastating effects of climate change each day. In New Hampshire, it's hurting our wildlife, including our moose population and fisheries, and it's influencing our fall foliage and maple production. Tackling this crisis requires swift and meaningful action, which is why I'm proud to introduce the Clean Economy Act with Senator Carper,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""By directing the EPA to use the tools it already has at its disposal to help create a clean energy economy and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, our nation can take an important step forward towards achieving climate goals, creating jobs and staying globally competitive."" ""The Clean Economy Act takes bold steps to address the existential threat posed by climate change by implementing a plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,"" Senator Hassan said. ""By drastically reducing our country's greenhouse gas emissions, we are prioritizing public health and safety while also fostering economic growth."" This net-zero legislation is supported collectively by major environmental groups, business groups and organized labor, including the United Steelworkers, the League of Conservation Voters and the American Lung Association.

Senator Shaheen has led efforts in the Senate to combat climate change. Shaheen introduced bipartisan legislation, which Senator Hassan cosponsored - the International Climate Change Accountability Act - that would prevent the President from using funds to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Shaheen traveled to Paris to participate in high-level discussions at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference that led to the international Paris Climate Accord. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Shaheen has historically helped secure increased funding for several energy efficiency and renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy. Shaheen has also consistently spoken out in opposition to the President's anti-environment agenda, and has fought his continued efforts to invalidate scientific evidence of climate change. In December, Shaheen also led a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Hassan, in a letter to Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in support of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) and their commitment to global efforts to thwart climate change. That letter can be read here. Senator Hassan led a number of her colleagues, including Senator Shaheen, in introducing bipartisan legislation to support and expand programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Senator Hassan has also led bipartisan legislation to expand access to innovative clean energy storage technology and to help lower energy costs for families and reduce carbon emissions by reinstating and strengthening a tax credits for energy efficient home construction and upgrades.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA278","Pelosi Remarks at COP25 Climate Vulnerable Forum Action for Survival Event; Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) News Release","December 2, 2019","Congressional Documents and Publications","Madrid - Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered remarks at the Climate Vulnerable Forum press event held during the Congressional Delegation's visit to the United Nations COP25 in Madrid. Below are the Speaker's remarks: Speaker Pelosi. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your leadership. It's an honor to be with each and every one of you and all of you, because we're here at the heart of the matter - the vulnerable countries, vulnerable. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister, for your courage and taking on the leadership of all of this. Bringing your experience from the challenges you face to the reputation you enjoy, we're all blessed by your leadership. Madam Chair from Texas - Madam Chair, thank you - Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the [Science, Space and Technology] Committee; Frank Pallone, Chair of Energy and Commerce; Scott Peters of California, member of the - of that committee; Mike Levin, member of the Select Committee on Climate; Jared Huffman, member of the Select Committee, as well from California; Joe Neguse of Colorado; Mr. Casten from Illinois - Did I reach everyone here? All of them? We're very proud of them, because they have at the top of their agenda their priority to recognize the U.S. goal in saving this planet for future generations. This is a mission. This is a passion. This is a scientifically-based approach to all of our views. And we are here to say to all of you, on behalf of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States, we're still in it. We are still in it. We are - it's an honor, Patrick, to be with you and to all of the distinguished guests who are here. Patricia - oh no, we lost Patricia - but Patricia has been to California. She's seen what our Governor Jerry Brown and, now, our current Governor Gavin Newsom are doing in this, but you made two examples across the country: mayors, governors, non-profits, for-profits, the private sector - everyone understands. But nobody understands it better than our children, than what is at stake and I'm so glad that we have a youth representative that will be here, because the future is yours and you have a responsibility to save it, as well as to urge us to help you do so. Here's how we see it: we see this as an existential threat. Mr. President, you were twelve, but I was at the Rio Conference, and we never would have suspected then, with all the ambition that we have - had then, that we would be where we are today, fighting this fight. We have not, we have not lived up to the challenge. They say the challenge that was generational, continues to be generational. We see it as a public health issue. Clean air, clean water for everyone, including the most vulnerable, of course, because the most vulnerable, whether it's other nation or a vulnerable community pay the biggest price. Clean air, clean water, public health. We see it as an economic issue, because this is a way for us to [advance] new green technologies, based on science and technology to take us into the future, while creating good-paying jobs, lifting everyone up. And we have seen, Mr. President, when we were recently in the Northern Triangle of Central America, migration resulting from the fact that farmers can't farm because of drought, one thing or another. Everything in nature is connected and it becomes a national security issue, when the competition for resources, land and the rest. So, mitigation and resilience and all the rest of that, have to be so much a part of all of this and not - nowhere does it fall harder than the vulnerable nations. And, then we see it as a moral issue. When we were in Rio, they had a big religious service, every aspect of religion or no religion, but just belief in the future, and that was about our moral responsibility. If you believe, as some of us do, that this is God's creation, that we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. Being real sure, that if you're faith-based or lack thereof, that we all do believe we have a moral responsibility to future generations to pass on this planet in a better way, in the best possible way. So, that is the agenda that we bring, that and other - technology and science and the rest of that being the basis for how we can lead the challenge, but it is something very, very - how can I say this? - urgent to the people of the United States. They understand it. Our young people are leading the way, as they are in the rest of the country. I just want to say, next year, the G-7 will meet in San Francisco - no - in the United States. It will probably be in Washington. I'd like it to be in San Francisco, that's my home district. But, the reason I mention that is because in a meeting we had this year was in France - it was in Brest - we focused on the oceans and the challenge to the oceans. By 2050, if we don't do things differently, there can be as many tons of plastics in the oceans as there are tons of fish in the ocean. That's the urgency of addressing this urgently. And, I'm glad that this is a blue cup about the oceans, as well.

In its groundbreaking investigation, the CHR also found the relevant criminal intent may exist to hold companies accountable under civil and criminal laws, in light of certain circumstances involving obstruction, willful obfuscation and climate denial. The CHR has concluded that people affected by climate change and whose human rights have been dramatically harmed must have access to remedies and access to justice. Simply put, big polluters and other corporations have the responsibilities to protect human rights as we face the climate emergency. Keith Stewart, Senior Energy Strategist at Greenpeace Canada, said: ""This is a strong signal to industry that the era of impunity is ending for fossil fuel companies who, for decades, covered up what they knew about how their products were causing the climate crisis. Communities in Canada who have been ravaged by wildfires, floods, melting sea ice and rising seas, as well as cities like Toronto, Victoria and Vancouver who are exploring legal action against these companies should be paying attention to this development."" Greenpeace Canada is running a campaign advocating accountability for big carbon polluters in Toronto and across Canada. So far, thousands of people in Canada have signed up to support their municipal governments holding oil companies accountable for the costs of climate-related harms. Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director Yeb Sano said: ""We applaud the statement of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. This is a historic moment for people and the planet, and a landmark victory for climate justice. Today marks the beginning of the end to the fossil fuel industry's stranglehold over our political systems. For the first time ever, big polluting companies have been found responsible for human rights harms resulting from the climate crisis. A growing number of climate cases are now being heard or filed across the world--and with the conclusion of this investigation, we believe many more communities will take a stand against fossil fuel companies that are putting profit before people. The world is waking up to the fact that fossil fuel industry knowingly imperiled the safety and security of millions of people around the world for their own short term interests. It is an industry composed of the world's largest and richest companies who rake in profits, while the poorest and most vulnerable communities reel from super typhoons and droughts made worse by climate change, and suffer from loss of lives and livelihoods in a world degraded by the impacts. This is a vindication of the struggle of communities in the frontlines who are leading the movement to demand climate justice. We are calling on people all over the world to support the call for justice and hold governments and corporations accountable in order to accelerate a just transition to renewable energy and avert the worst impacts of climate change."" The CHR's announcement, given by Commissioner Roberto Cadiz, coincides with the start of the second week of the UN Climate negotiations, COP25.3 The energy for change visible on the streets has not translated so far into energy at the negotiating tables or into a reduction of the role that fossil fuel companies play in the political process. It is time for decision-makers to prioritise people over polluters."" Footnotes: (1) The announcement was made in a COP25 side event titled ""Addressing Access to Remedy and the Business and Human Rights Dimension of Climate Change"" organized by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

But we're also focused on the future. In March of 2020, under Speaker Pelosi's leadership and the united consensus of Democrats in Congress, we will release a climate action plan, a plan for the United States of America -through its congressional committees- to tackle the climate crisis: to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to begin to adapt in a greater way to the climate crisis and its impacts. This climate action plan will be an extraordinary opportunity to begin to really invest in the clean energy economy. In future years, we will see this transformation and opportunity in the energy sector, in the transportation sector, in agriculture for our farmers, in how we build buildings and where we build buildings, and in becoming more energy efficient. We intend to follow the science. And we intend to ensure that vulnerable communities across America -and across the globe- have every opportunity to participate in this clean energy economy and transformation. Together we will solve the climate crisis, and I'm honored to be a part of it, along with the outstanding members of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis."" Later, when asked about the Green New Deal by a member of the press, Chair Castor made the following remarks: ""We embrace the ambition of the Green New Deal. What is happening now in the U.S. Congress is the hard work that is necessary to develop the detailed policy proposals in the energy sector, how we decarbonize the energy sector. Same goes for the transportation sector, agriculture and energy efficiency. Now, when you develop detailed policy proposals, you're going another layer deeper. Then all of the legislative committees, over the coming months, will turn those policy proposals into concrete legislation. We hope to build bipartisan support for a number of them. And we must do this with a sense of urgency. All of the science points us in the direction that we do not have time to waste. So we do not intend to waste any time. The time for action is now."" Background: The U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis is charged with delivering ambitious climate policy recommendations to Congress, in order to achieve substantial and permanent reductions in pollution and other activities that contribute to the climate crisis. The select committee was authorized by House Resolution 6 on January 9, 2019, and will publish a set of public policy recommendations for congressional climate action by March 31, 2020.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA281","SCHNEIDER LEADS MORE THAN 120 DEMOCRATS IN CONDEMNING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S FORMAL WITHDRAWAL FROM PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT; Introduction coincides with 2019 Un....","December 5, 2019","Congressional Documents and Publications","Today, Congressman Brad Schneider (IL-10) introduced a resolution, joined by more than 120 original co-sponsors, condemning the Trump Administration's decision to withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. The resolution was introduced after the Trump Administration recently began the formal withdrawal process to remove the United States from the pact that seeks to limit the increase in global temperatures to less than two degrees Celsius. The resolution's introduction coincides with the ongoing 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP25 . President Trump sent no senior members of his Administration to attend the conference, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation in support of the agreement--and continued global coordination in combating climate change. ""Climate change is an immediate and existential threat to our national security, economy, and the future we leave to our children,"" said Schneider. ""This is a global problem that requires international solutions, and we are rapidly running out of time. At this crucial moment, the Trump Administration is ceding American leadership on climate and actively undermining critical efforts to curb emissions and transition to a clean energy economy. As countries around the world meet in Madrid, our resolution is intended to send a strong message that the U.S House of Representatives condemns the President's decision to abandon the climate agreement, and stands ready to fulfill the commitments that we made under the Paris Agreement."" Link to resolution text. VIDEO: Schneider speaks on the resolution on the U.S. House floor. Following President Trump's announcement in 2017 that he intended to withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Schneider wrote and introduced a similar resolution (H.Res 390 in the 115th Congress) disapproving of the decision and commending states, cities, and localities that have committed to upholding the emission reduction targets. The resolution was ultimately co-sponsored by 182 Members of Congress. Earlier this year, Schneider was also an original co-sponsor of the Climate Action Now Act (H.R. 9), which passed the House in May 2019. The bill would prohibit federal funds from being used to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and require the President to develop and update annually a plan for the United States to meet its nationally determined contribution under the agreement. Schneider was also an original co-sponsor of the 100% Clean Economy Act (H.R. 5221) that was introduced by more than 150 Democrats in November. This legislation would put the U.S. on a path to a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA282","Negotiations At The UN Climate Change Conference In Madrid End In Failure. Is There A Way To Turn That Failure Into Success?","JD Supra","Newstex Blogs ","Dec 23, 2019( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid ended in failure last Sunday.Despite enormous publicity and the presence of celebrities like Time Magazine Person of the Year Greta Thunberg, the negotiators left with little concrete achievement.Known as COP25 , the conference goal was to establish rules and commitments that would include concrete steps for nations to take in order to implement the 2015 Paris Climate Accord. The result was little more than a communiqu reiterating the 'urgent need' to cut greenhouse gases and a promise to help poor countries facing catastrophe.Part of the problem with the conference was the unstable foundation on which it was building.Despite the expansive rhetoric surrounding the Paris Climate Accords of 2015, the international community actually agreed then only on the goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21stCentury.In fact, each country was given the opportunity to shape its own program in fighting climate change.The signatories did not agree on how this should be done or by whom. Some countries, like the United States under the Obama Administration, pledged to do much to carry out the goals in the 2015 Paris Climate Accords.Others, like China, agreed only to keep increasing their carbon emissions until 2030 and then begin decreasing.Finally, countries like Russia refused to pledge to do much at all.All of this played out in Madrid last week.Neither of the two key issues before the Madrid delegates was resolved.The first was how to regulate carbon markets.The second was to assess liability for damage caused by rising temperatures. The Trump Administration, having decided to take the United States out of the Paris Accords, did not lead on either issue, and it was accused by many of being actually disruptive, especially with regard to the liability issue.China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide by more than double, refused to update its commitment to continue increasing emissions until 2030.Without real Chinese action, any worldwide progress will be limited and that 'progress' could even be negative if other countries fail to make up for China.Meanwhile, the industrialized countries refused a demand from the less developed countries (LDC's) to, in effect, subsidize the LDC's in their transition away from carbon based fuels.At the least, the LDC's said they either will not or cannot make substantial commitments until the wealthier countries lead the fight.As with current internal American political issues, the world situation is muddied by an excess of hyperbole and a deficit of specifics.That was expressed in the broad comment by Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).'This is the biggest disconnect between this process and what's going on in the real world that I've seen,' Mr. Meyer said.'You have the science crystal on where we need to go.You have the youth and others stepping up around the world in the streets pressing for action.It's like we're in a sealed vacuum chamber in here, and no one is perceiving what is happening out there - what the science says and what people are demanding.'Unfortunately for the demonstrators and Mr. Meyer, what the 'people' are demanding is not necessarily doable under present realities, at least not the way they often espouse.The push for all renewables by 2050 would be easier if NGOs like the UCS took the lead in developing concrete plans on how exactly to do that.The plans would need to include specifically stating where solar power installations and other green energy producers would be located, where the additional power lines that will be needed would be constructed, what elements would be needed to produce, store and transmit energy, where and how the waste from such a massive shift in power production would be disposed, etc.Without that level of specificity, international climate negotiators are being asked to structure their nations' futures around an energy world that might not even be feasible, and if feasible might be impossibly expensive or actually less helpful to the environment than the world we have right now.It is easy for those like the demonstrators and Ms. Thunberg to dismiss economic growth. It is not so easy for world leaders to tell their populations that over half of their nations' annual budgets will need to be used to fight climate change - in effect, ignoring practically all other societal needs in favor of pursuing this one goal.People do want to protect themselves from the predicted ravages of climate change.But no one wants to see their quality of life be reversed in doing so, and especially if the sacrifices that are needed to get there are unevenly distributed.The United Nations is the ultimate political organization.It remains incumbent on those working under its auspices to seek real change through what is politically possible, even with international commitment and goodwill pushing for the change in question.'The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis' stated UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.Perhaps, but perhaps what the world is telling us is that now is the time for governmental officials, NGO's like the UCS, and other concerned individuals to pivot from merely applying political pressure on behalf of an existential idea to actually starting the less glamorous work of mapping out exactly what a non-carbon world in 2050 would look like.Stating lofty goals is one thing.But achieving those goals will require a lot of elbow grease and sheer hard work.Doing that would be provide the world a far greater service than just meeting at conferences and trying to extract promises that often are unkept, or that fail to treat the problem uniformly and fairly for all who are being asked to contribute to the solution. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA283","COP25 - EIB AND IBERDROLA SIGN TWO FINANCING AGREEMENTS FOR EUR 690M FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IN BRAZIL AND NEW DIGITALISATION OF ELECTRICAL NETWORKS","December 5, 2019 Thursday","States News Service","The following information was released by the European Union: The EU bank will provide EUR 250m to finance 15 wind farms that the company will build in north-eastern Brazil This is the first agreement signed between the institution and Neoenergia, Iberdrola's Spanish subsidiary The EUR 440m earmarked for Iberdrola's distribution networks in Spain will help to reinforce this infrastructure and make it smarter to better meet the challenges of the energy transition At the Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) being held in Madrid, the EIB and Iberdrola today announced two new agreements to promote climate action by investing in renewable energy projects and electricity distribution networks. To do so, the Vice-President of the EU bank Emma Navarro and the President of Iberdrola Ignacio Galan agreed two loans for a total of EUR 690m. EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, head of climate action at the Bank and its operations in Spain and Latin America, remarked: ""We are delighted to be signing these agreements at the Madrid Climate Change Conference, because they are a great example of the EIB's efforts to support climate action inside and outside of Europe. To fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we need to mobilise resources on an unprecedented scale, and the EIB is seeking to lead the response to this challenge. We are the EU's climate bank, and that is why we have strengthened our climate ambition. We are working on mobilising up to EUR 1tn over the coming decade through projects that, like the ones we are supporting today, are going to help with the transition towards a low-carbon economy by promoting renewable energies."" Ignacio Galan expressed his satisfaction for sealing this deal during the Climate Change Conference. ""The byword for this COP is the need to start taking action, and that is what Iberdrola and the EIB are doing today: undertaking specific actions that will help to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C"" He also said that Iberdrola ""got a head-start with this transition 20 years ago, when we realised that the economy of the future had to be carbon-free. Since then, we have invested EUR 100bn in renewables, smart networks and efficient supply, becoming one of the world's largest utility companies."" The Iberdrola President also congratulated the EU bank on its decision to increase its climate ambition and to cease financing projects based on fossil fuels: ""We all have to be part of the solution. As leaders in sustainable financing, we believe that agreements such as the ones we are signing today are essential to turning climate change into an opportunity and leaving an inhabitable planet for future generations."" Of the EUR 690m total, EUR 250m will go to financing the construction of 15 wind farms to be developed in the country by Neoenergia, the Iberdrola subsidiary in Brazil. These new facilities will be located in three states in the north east: Paraba, Baha and Piau. Once operational, they will have a total installed power of 520 MW and produce an annual average of 2 300 GWh of clean energy. Commissioning these wind farms will help to reduce COa,, emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in the country's electricity generation. The investments in these new wind farms will be made over a five-year period and will enable the creation of 2 300 jobs. The EIB is granting this financing under the Latin America lending mandate 20142020, meaning that the agreement is covered by the EU budget guarantee. By supporting this project, the EU bank is helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. The EIB has been working in Latin America for some 30 years and one of the major priorities in the region is to promote climate action. Smart electricity networks in Spain The EU bank and Iberdrola have also joined forces to develop digitalisation of infrastructure essential to the decarbonisation of the economy: the electricity distribution networks. To do so, they have agreed a EUR 440m loan to finance new investments in Spain for infrastructure to help improve the reliability of the network and the quality of supply. These networks are key to the energy transition, as they enable the integration of more renewables, sustainable mobility, smart cities and decentralised consumption. Transforming the networks into smart infrastructure that is more reliable and more secure puts consumers at the centre of the business, giving them greater decision-making power and connectivity. The EIB and climate action The EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, with the goal of ensuring that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1bn by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021. The EIB is the world's largest issuer of green bonds and was the first organisation to make an issue on this market in 2007. In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes. Spain: EIB grants EUR 50m loan to Iberdrola and Caja Rural de Navarra to build new wind complex in Navarra Background information: Follow the EIB's activity at COP25 here Iberdrola, a reference in climate action Iberdrola is a global leader in the energy market, the leading supplier of wind power and one of the largest electricity companies by market capitalisation in the world. The group supplies energy to some 100 million people in dozens of countries, such as Spain, the UK (ScottishPower), the USA (AVANGRID), Brazil (Neoenergia), Mexico, Germany, Portugal, Italy and France. With a workforce of some 34 000 employees and assets exceeding EUR 113bn, it turned over EUR 35 075.9m and made a net profit of EUR 3.014m in 2018. Iberdrola is leading the energy transition towards a sustainable model through its investments in renewable energies, smart networks, large-scale energy storage and digital transformation to offer its clients cutting-edge products and services. With its commitment to clean energy, it is one of the companies with the lowest emissions and sets an international example with its contribution to climate action and sustainability. The company is the world's largest issuer of green bonds, with some EUR 10bn issued since 2014, and has agreed loans for around EUR 1.5bn, as well as credit lines subject to sustainability conditions for nearly EUR 9bn. \"

Below are the Speaker's remarks: Speaker Pelosi. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your leadership. It's an honor to be with each and every one of you and all of you, because we're here at the heart of the matter the vulnerable countries, vulnerable. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister, for your courage and taking on the leadership of all of this. Bringing your experience from the challenges you face to the reputation you enjoy, we're all blessed by your leadership. [Laughter] Madam Chair from Texas Madam Chair, thank you Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the [Science, Space and Technology] Committee; Frank Pallone, Chair of Energy and Commerce; Scott Peters of California, member of the of that committee; Mike Levin, member of the Select Committee on Climate; Jared Huffman, member of the Select Committee, as well from California; Joe Neguse of Colorado; Mr. Casten from Illinois Did I reach everyone here? All of them? We're very proud of them, because they have at the top of their agenda their priority to recognize the U.S. goal in saving this planet for future generations. This is a mission. This is a passion. This is a scientifically-based approach to all of our views. And we are here to say to all of you, on behalf of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States, we're still in it. We are still in it. [Applause] We are it's an honor, Patrick, to be with you and to all of the distinguished guests who are here. Patricia oh no, we lost Patricia but Patricia has been to California. She's seen what our Governor Jerry Brown and, now, our current Governor Gavin Newsom are doing in this, but you made two examples across the country: mayors, governors, non-profits, for-profits, the private sector everyone understands. But nobody understands it better than our children, than what is at stake and I'm so glad that we have a youth representative that will be here, because the future is yours and you have a responsibility to save it, as well as to urge us to help you do so. Here's how we see it: we see this as an existential threat. Mr. President, you were twelve, but I was at the Rio Conference, and we never would have suspected then, with all the ambition that we have had then, that we would be where we are today, fighting this fight. We have not, we have not lived up to the challenge. They say the challenge that was generational, continues to be generational. We see it as a public health issue. Clean air, clean water for everyone, including the most vulnerable, of course, because the most vulnerable, whether it's other nation or a vulnerable community pay the biggest price. Clean air, clean water, public health. We see it as an economic issue, because this is a way for us to [advance] new green technologies, based on science and technology to take us into the future, while creating good-paying jobs, lifting everyone up. And we have seen, Mr. President, when we were recently in the Northern Triangle of Central America, migration resulting from the fact that farmers can't farm because of drought, one thing or another. Everything in nature is connected and it becomes a national security issue, when the competition for resources, land and the rest. So, mitigation and resilience and all the rest of that, have to be so much a part of all of this and not nowhere does it fall harder than the vulnerable nations. And, then we see it as a moral issue. When we were in Rio, they had a big religious service, every aspect of religion or no religion, but just belief in the future, and that was about our moral responsibility. If you believe, as some of us do, that this is God's creation, that we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. Being real sure, that if you're faith-based or lack thereof, that we all do believe we have a moral responsibility to future generations to pass on this planet in a better way, in the best possible way. So, that is the agenda that we bring, that and other technology and science and the rest of that being the basis for how we can lead the challenge, but it is something very, very how can I say this? urgent to the people of the United States. They understand it. Our young people are leading the way, as they are in the rest of the country. I just want to say, next year, the G-7 will meet in San Francisco no in the United States. It will probably be in Washington. I'd like it to be in San Francisco, that's my home district. But, the reason I mention that is because in a meeting we had this year was in France it was in Brest we focused on the oceans and the challenge to the oceans. By 2050, if we don't do things differently, there can be as many tons of plastics in the oceans as there are tons of fish in the ocean. That's the urgency of addressing this urgently. And, I'm glad that this is a blue cup about the oceans, as well. And I just will say this, when we focused on the they had the G-7 of the heads of state, and then we had the G-7 of the heads of parliament and in the heads of parliament meeting, in Brest, in France, under leadership of the Prime the President of the National Assembly, we focused on climate and the oceans. Next year, when we have one in the United States, the title of our meeting for the heads of parliament is 'Addressing the Climate Crisis with Economic and Environmental Justice for All.' We see this as a big environmental justice issue, as well. I just want to quote His Holiness the Pope, as I close did I say I was closing already? His Holiness, when he came to Congress and spoke to us a few years ago, he said, and he wrote in his encyclical, no doubt they've seen, 'The climate is a common good belonging to all and meant for all.' Together we can and must build a climate resilient now, this is me, I just wanted to a resilient world to defend that common good now and for generations to come. For health, for the economy, for security, national security and for honoring our responsibilities to future generations. That's why we have such a large, distinguished delegation, chairs of the committees working on this issue. We've had already 100 hearings already on this subject, on the subject of climate. We are preparing legislation, as we go forward. We are here to listen and learn from all of you, as to how we can do better. Thank you all very much for the opportunity. # # # \"

In 2018, Atlantica avoided the emission of approximately 5 million tons of CO21. With close to 1.5 GW of solar and wind assets in operation and approximately 90% of its revenues coming from low carbon footprint assets2, Atlantica was rated by Sustainalytics in December 2018 on its Environment, Social and Governance factors as the top company within renewables, second within the broader utilities sector and in the top 3% in the global ratings universe.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA289","CLIMATE FINANCING BEING UNDERMINED BY RICH NATIONS, NGOS CHARGE","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","IPS - Inter Press Service","The successful battle against climate change - which has triggered a rash of natural disasters, including floods, droughts and rising sea levels- will be predicated largely on the availability of financing. The World Bank last year pledged $200 billion to finance the fight against climate change, between 2021 and 2025. In October, the US offered $1.21 billion to support Blue Economy-an offer described as a proverbial drop in the world's besieged oceans. But Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is aiming high. Last week, at the Conference of Parties ( COP25 ) climate change conference in Madrid, he said: ""We should ensure that at least $100 billion dollars a year, is available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation taking into account their legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery."" Guterres said there was a need to replenish the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to meet the commitment to mobilize the estimated $100 billion per year for climate action. But at the GCF Pledging Conference in Paris last October, rich nations pledged only $9.8 billion to the Fund leaving a yawning gap. But not surprisingly, climate financing was one of the key issues at the two week long COP25 meeting which concludes December 13. A coalition of over 150 non-governmental organizations ( NGOs) and climate change activists has called on developed countries ""to stop using bullying tactics to block funding for climate disasters"". ""But developed countries - those most responsible for the climate crisis - including the UK, US, EU, Australia and Japan, have spent years blocking concrete progress to create funding and debt relief for countries in the global South most affected by rising global temperatures"", said the coalition in its letter. Tim Jones, Head of Policy, Jubilee Debt Campaign and a signatory to the letter, told IPS that a new fund has to be agreed; otherwise countries suffering from the impacts of climate change will be pushed into taking on ever higher unjust debts. ""There are multiple sources of finance from taxes on financial transactions to international air travel. All developing countries hit be disasters should get moratoriums on debt payments so vital funds stay in the country for rebuilding in the immediate aftermath,"" he pointed out. Furthermore, said Jones, funds should stop being wasted on expensive private schemes such as climate insurance, which lead to public money being wasted on private sector profit. For example, he said, one climate insurance scheme in the Caribbean has received $293 million in premium payments and grants from donors since it began in 2007 but has paid out just $131 million in claims. In contrast, $105 million from the scheme has gone to private insurance companies as profit, he added. HYPERLINK https://jubileedebt.org.uk/report/dont-owe-shouldnt-pay-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-debt-in-vulnerable-countries ""Without finance to help countries cope with climate-induced loss and damage, the most vulnerable parts of the world will sink deeper into debt and poverty every time they are hit by climate disasters they did not cause."" The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), which is being reviewed at COP25 , was established in 2013 to support vulnerable countries already experiencing extreme and slow onset climate disasters, such as flooding, droughts and rising sea levels. Six years on, the WIM has failed in its main purpose - to propose concrete, rights-based financing solutions for communities being hit by climate disasters, the letter adds. Cameron Diver, Deputy Director-General, the Pacific Community (SPC), who is at the COP25 in Madrid, told IPS sea-level rise is already underway. ""We have seen its effects in the islands of the Blue Pacific continent, as we have in countries and communities around the globe. If we truly want to limit the impact on our populations, what we need, to paraphrase Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the opening of COP 25 , is ambition in mitigation, ambition in adaptation and ambition in finance"". He said ambition in mitigation is to ensure that ""we limit levels of greenhouse gas emissions to levels compatible with the Paris Agreement and that contribute to the transformative approach necessary for our economies and societies to make the low carbon transition."" Without enhanced mitigation actions, global warming will continue, the climate emergency will become ever more dire and our communities will suffer the consequences, he warned. ""This must be accompanied in equal measure by increased ambition in adaptation, so that we accompany the most vulnerable countries and communities in their efforts to adapt to a changing environment and, for coastal communities, to increased salinization of soils and groundwater, to ocean acidification and coral bleaching that destroys coastal ecosystems and livelihoods, to an ocean that encroaches on sometimes already limited land masses,"" he noted. Without adaptation and mitigation working hand in hand, we will not get the full benefit of concentrated climate action to stem sea-level rise and its effects. ""And the achieve all of this, we need ambition in finance"", said Diver. ""We need to unlock and increase existing international and national climate funds to transform promises on the paper into outcomes in the field and we need public and private finance to accompany the low carbon transition, invest in the green and blue economies, divest investment portfolios of non-Paris Agreement compatible assets and provide the level of funding required to meet global climate ambition,"" he argued. Harjeet Singh, ActionAid's global lead on climate change, told IPS: ""Concrete financing solutions are urgently needed to repair the devastation already being caused by climate change and to prepare for an uncertain future."" ""Our analysis shows that ending state subsidies for fossil fuels and a progressive tax on the oil and gas industry would raise the billions needed to adapt to and repair the harmful impacts of global warming. These solutions put the onus on those responsible for the climate crisis and protect the rights of those most at risk,"" he added. ActionAid's report, Market solution to help climate victims fail human rights test, looks at the various financing options that help survivors of climate disasters and protect their human rights. HYPERLINK https://actionaid.org/publications/2019/market-solutions-help-climate-victims-fail-human-rights-test https://actionaid.org/publications/2019/market-solutions-help-climate-victims-fail-human-rights-test The report examined the current options for market, state and 'innovative' funding mechanisms available to cover the soaring costs of loss and damage related to rising global temperatures, reviewing their effectiveness against key human rights principles. Singh said most market solutions put the financial burden back on developing countries, who are least responsible for causing the climate crisis. These mechanisms also fail against transparency and accountability measures and do not involve the people most at risk in decision making to protect their rights. The analysis identified clear winners: \'c2\'b7 Progressive taxes such as a Climate Damages Tax on oil, gas and coal extraction and the Financial Transaction Tax, a small levy to raise revenue from the trading of financial instruments. \'c2\'b7 Shifting state subsidies away from fossil fuels and towards addressing the impacts of climate change and funding a 'Just Transition' to a low-carbon global economy. On the GCF, he said: ""We expect rich countries to at least double their previous commitments to the Green Climate Fund, recognising that this remains inadequate to address the full scale of the crisis. ""To effectively tackle the climate crisis, we need to see a massive shift in financial flows, far greater than countries have pledged to the fund so far. Helping the world's most marginalised people in developing countries tackle climate impacts requires grant-based public finance, not loans or private investments.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA290","Environmental Defense Fund: COP 25 - Countries Don't Need to Wait for the UN to Boost Climate Ambition Through Carbon Markets","December 15, 2019 Sunday 7:00 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The Environmental Defense Fund issued the following news release:    - Statement from Nathaniel Keohane, EDF Senior Vice President for Climate    After a fortnight marked by rancor and disappointment but little progress, countries left the UN climate talks in Madrid having failed to reach agreement on major issues including guidance for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which relates to international cooperation among countries through carbon markets. Importantly, the lack of a decision does not prevent countries from cooperating through markets or international trading, or from using market-based policies to meet their national targets. Indeed, the Paris Agreement itself acknowledges that countries may use international emission transfers to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In the closing plenary, several countries acknowledged their intention to continue with international cooperation through carbon markets, even in the absence of agreement at COP 25 . Carbon markets provide a critical tool for countries to enhance ambition: Economic analysis by EDF shows that carbon markets could achieve nearly double the emissions reductions that countries have committed to so far under the Paris agreement, at no extra cost. "" COP 25 ""But after negotiators failed a second year in a row to agree on guidance for markets, it's time to move on. Countries that are serious about using carbon markets to increase ambition should move forward to set their own strong rules for high-integrity international emissions trading. Such a coalition of carbon markets could pave the way for faster, deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. There's no need to wait for the UN--and no time to waste. ""The spotlight now shifts to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which will cap emissions from international flights beginning in 2021 via the first carbon market for a major global sector (known as CORSIA). As with any market, getting the rules right will be critical to success. In March, ICAO's Technical Advisory Board will make final recommendations to the ICAO Council on which offset programs should be eligible for use by airlines to meet their obligations under CORSIA. With the COP having failed to allow CDM credits to be used for the Paris Agreement--or for any other compliance purpose--ICAO should follow suit.""  Nathaniel Keohane, Senior Vice President, Climate COP 25 :  Multilateralism: ""Some may claim that the inability of countries to reach consensus on all rules for carbon markets under the Paris Agreement constitutes a failure of multilateralism. That view is wrong. The overwhelming majority of countries in Madrid were ready to move forward on a strong set of rules for accounting for market transactions with integrity. That those same countries refused to bend to Brazil's demands for a double-counting loophole and massive use of CDM tons is a success of multilateralism and a bright spot of COP 25 .""  Methane: ""The world needs urgently to slow the rate of warming, and one of the quickest, most cost-effective opportunities to do so is reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production. That makes oil and gas methane a prime candidate for countries to include in their updated Nationally Determined Contributions, as one means of ramping up ambition in the lead-up to next year's COP.""  Creating more resilient oceans and fisheries: ""Dubbed the 'Blue COP', Madrid highlighted the need for the ocean to be part of the solution set for climate change. Fisheries around the world are already seeing the impacts of a warming planet, which will only worsen if we fail to adapt. While every country will see changes to their fisheries, the impacts will be disproportionately felt in equatorial regions. With swift action, climate-responsive fisheries management can help nearly every country be better off by the end of the century compared to business-as-usual.""  EU Green Deal: ""With the European Green Deal, European Commission President von der Leyen is demonstrating EU leadership on climate ambition, both through the commitment to climate neutrality by 2050 and by proposing to increase the EU's Paris Agreement target to a 55% reduction below 1990 by 2030. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) will continue to be the EU's cornerstone policy for delivering on this ambition. We look forward to seeing how these commitments will be implemented as EU law. With the impacts of climate change becoming more apparent by the day, it is critical that other countries come forward to increase their ambition in advance of COP 26 in Glasgow next year.""

All of them? ""We're very proud of them, because they have at the top of their agenda their priority to recognize the U.S. goal in saving this planet for future generations. This is a mission. This is a passion. This is a scientifically-based approach to all of our views. And we are here to say to all of you, on behalf of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States, we're still in it. We are still in it. ""[Applause] ""We are - it's an honor, Patrick, to be with you and to all of the distinguished guests who are here. Patricia - oh no, we lost Patricia - but Patricia has been to California. She's seen what our Governor Jerry Brown and, now, our current Governor Gavin Newsom are doing in this, but you made two examples across the country: mayors, governors, non-profits, for-profits, the private sector - everyone understands. ""But nobody understands it better than our children, than what is at stake and I'm so glad that we have a youth representative that will be here, because the future is yours and you have a responsibility to save it, as well as to urge us to help you do so. ""Here's how we see it: we see this as an existential threat. Mr. President, you were twelve, but I was at the Rio Conference, and we never would have suspected then, with all the ambition that we have - had then, that we would be where we are today, fighting this fight. We have not, we have not lived up to the challenge. They say the challenge that was generational, continues to be generational. ""We see it as a public health issue. Clean air, clean water for everyone, including the most vulnerable, of course, because the most vulnerable, whether it's other nation or a vulnerable community pay the biggest price. Clean air, clean water, public health. ""We see it as an economic issue, because this is a way for us to [advance] new green technologies, based on science and technology to take us into the future, while creating good-paying jobs, lifting everyone up. ""And we have seen, Mr. President, when we were recently in the Northern Triangle of Central America, migration resulting from the fact that farmers can't farm because of drought, one thing or another. Everything in nature is connected and it becomes a national security issue, when the competition for resources, land and the rest. So, mitigation and resilience and all the rest of that, have to be so much a part of all of this and not - nowhere does it fall harder than the vulnerable nations. ""And, then we see it as a moral issue. When we were in Rio, they had a big religious service, every aspect of religion or no religion, but just belief in the future, and that was about our moral responsibility. If you believe, as some of us do, that this is God's creation, that we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. Being real sure, that if you're faith-based or lack thereof, that we all do believe we have a moral responsibility to future generations to pass on this planet in a better way, in the best possible way. ""So, that is the agenda that we bring, that and other - technology and science and the rest of that being the basis for how we can lead the challenge, but it is something very, very - how can I say this? - urgent to the people of the United States. They understand it. Our young people are leading the way, as they are in the rest of the country. ""I just want to say, next year, the G-7 will meet in San Francisco - no - in the United States. It will probably be in Washington. I'd like it to be in San Francisco, that's my home district. But, the reason I mention that is because in a meeting we had this year was in France - it was in Brest - we focused on the oceans and the challenge to the oceans. By 2050, if we don't do things differently, there can be as many tons of plastics in the oceans as there are tons of fish in the ocean. That's the urgency of addressing this urgently. And, I'm glad that this is a blue cup about the oceans, as well. ""And I just will say this, when we focused on the - they had the G-7 of the heads of state, and then we had the G-7 of the heads of parliament and in the heads of parliament meeting, in Brest, in France, under leadership of the Prime - the President of the National Assembly, we focused on climate and the oceans. Next year, when we have one in the United States, the title of our meeting for the heads of parliament is 'Addressing the Climate Crisis with Economic and Environmental Justice for All.' We see this as a big environmental justice issue, as well. ""I just want to quote His Holiness the Pope, as I close - did I say I was closing already? His Holiness, when he came to Congress and spoke to us a few years ago, he said, and he wrote in his encyclical, no doubt they've seen, 'The climate is a common good belonging to all and meant for all.' ""Together we can and must build a climate resilient - now, this is me, I just wanted to - a resilient world to defend that common good now and for generations to come. For health, for the economy, for security, national security and for honoring our responsibilities to future generations. That's why we have such a large, distinguished delegation, chairs of the committees working on this issue. We've had already 100 hearings already on this subject, on the subject of climate. We are preparing legislation, as we go forward. ""We are here to listen and learn from all of you, as to how we can do better. ""Thank you all very much for the opportunity.""

""It's important to recognise the global appetite for energy is growing, with more than 1.1 billion people lacking access to electricity. Substituting LNG for more emissions-intensive fuels allows importing countries to satisfy growing demand while reducing emissions,"" said APPEA Chief Executive Andrew McConville. ""Australia's LNG projects will deliver decades of economic growth, jobs and exports as well as strong regional and global environmental benefits. ""The latest government figures show Australia's LNG exports have the potential to lower emissions in importing countries by around 159 million tonnes by displacing coal consumption in those countries."" This estimate equates to nearly 30 per cent of Australia's total annual emissions and is more than the entire emissions from the Australian transport and waste sectors combined. ""Climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution, delivered through a national approach,"" Mr McConville said. ""Changes in the energy mix that result in the greater use of cleaner fuels such as natural gas and renewables is an important way to meet growing demand without increasing global emissions.""

Failing to address the worsening crisis of climate change will wreak damages on all Americans for centuries into the future. When you first signaled your intent to withdraw the United States from this comprehensive agreement, you indicated that you would ""immediately work with Democrats to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal."" We have yet to see any action to honor that commitment. As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs. There is an international race to develop advanced energy technologies. Instead of capitalizing on this economic opportunity, this action to no longer participate in the Paris Climate Agreement places U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage and effectively offshores American jobs to China and other countries, Moreover, the blow dealt to our national security by surrendering technological prowess to other countries is matched only by the damage caused by abdicating our international commitments made under the Paris Climate Agreement. The business community recognizes the missed opportunities resulting from your decision and understand the negative consequences associated with losing access to international clean energy markets. More than 2,200 American businesses and investors are committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement, and many American companies have urged you to remain committed to the Agreement such as Google, ConocoPhillips, National Grid, Levi Strauss and Co., Morgan Stanley and Unilever. 1 2 American citizens want you to take strong action on climate change, with roughly 67% of the country agreeing it is the responsibility of the federal government to address the climate crisis, and 64% disapproving of your climate change policies? Three out of four registered voters (77%) believe the United States should participate in the Paris Climate Agreement. This sentiment is also echoed by state and local governments. Since May 3 1, 2017, more than 400 United States mayors have adopted the Paris Agreement goals for their cities and 24 United States governors have formed a bipartisan coalition to realize the Paris Agreement goals at the State level. Furthermore, our national security experts frequently conclude that climate change is disrupting military readiness and exacerbating conflicts.6 As the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference is underway in Madrid, Spain this week, we urge you to consider the impact of this decision on the livelihood of Americans, the American economy and our national security as it will undoubtedly have long-lasting adverse effects on our way of life and America's position in the world.

Thunberg spoke at press conference at the port in Lisbon after she arrived. ""We need to work together to make sure that we secure future living conditions for humankind and that we fight not only [for] ourselves but for our children and for our grandchildren and for every single living being on earth,"" the 16-year-old Swedish activist told reporters. ""We will go to COP25 in Madrid and we will continue the fight there to make sure that within those walls, the voices of the people are being heard."" The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention to Combat Climate Change has been scheduled to convene from Dec. 2 through Dec. 13 in Madrid, Spain, for its 25th session dubbed COP25 . After a few days in Lisbon, Thunberg will head to Spain for the conference. Thunberg started her journey on Nov. 13 from the United States on a solar-powered catamaran to avoid contributing to carbon emissions. Earlier in the month, Chile withdrew from hosting the COP25 resulting in a bit of trouble for Thunberg who was already en route to Chile when she learned that she would have to turn around and cross the Atlantic Ocean. The Madrid meeting is the last COP25 conference before 2020 when all countries in the Paris Agreement are required to take some action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of economic development. The historic agreement signed by 195 countries was reached in 2015 to curb global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century and became international law three years ago. President , who says it disadvantages the United States to benefit other countries, formally began the process to withdraw from the landmark accord last month. \"

The Secretariats, both beneficiaries of the European Union's ACP's Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+), grant agreed to jointly organize a Pre- COP25 technical meeting to come up with position papers for submission to guide Africa in the negotiations during COP25 sessions. This Pre-COP regional consultative meeting will be used to develop a regional policy position paper for EAC Partner States and COMESA Member States. The position paper will be submitted to the Africa Group of Negotiators (AGN) to guide negotiations during the Twenty-fifth conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also known as COP25 sessions set for December 2019 in Madrid, Spain. Both the EAC and COMESA have an observer status to the UNFCCC processes and plan to participate in the forthcoming COP25 sessions to showcase the milestones, achievements and lessons learnt from the implementation of their climate change programmes in the region. ""This consultative meeting is important because it will ensure that the interests of African countries are adequately and fairly reflected in the ongoing climate change negotiations,"" COMESA Climate Change Advisor Dr Maclay Kanyangarara said. The regional consultative meeting will bring together negotiators and policy makers including National Climate Change Focal Points for UNFCCC and Ministries responsible for EAC affairs and representatives from COMESA countries. According to experts, it is important that African countries engage effectively in intergovernmental climate change negotiations, decision-making processes and eventual implementation of the decisions taken. The two blocs are cognizant that Regional Economic Communities have a critical role to play in supporting solutions to trans-boundary issues related to a changing climate. During the meeting in Rwanda, issues of regional importance will be identified with a clear road map of how to mainstream them into regional programmes and national implementation processes and opportunities for the Regional Economic Communities to deliver on the Paris Agreement. Most of the EAC and COMESA Member States are fully engaged in the on-going discussions and negotiations to find a lasting and sustainable solution to the challenge of climate change.

The user-generated content (UGC) campaign will once again harness captivating photos and storytelling from global photographers and advocates who bring a compelling, personal lens to the issue. This year's #EyeOnClimate campaign focuses on climate solutions from nature, inspired by two recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Reports that revealed how we must change our relationship with nature to solve the climate crisis. Solutions featured in the campaign showcase how protecting and restoring habitats -- from forests to mangroves to coral reefs -- support healthy ecosystems, communities, and climate action. Salesforce is joining this year's campaign, which will also be amplified by the voices of National Geographic photographers on social media and to their 124 million Instagram followers on @natgeo. ""The recent UN Climate Action Summit showcased new commitments and solutions, but we know they are not enough,"" said Rajesh Mirchandani, Chief Communications Officer at the UN Foundation. ""We need greater action from all parts of the world and all sectors, and we hope #EyeOnClimate can spotlight more of the kind of solutions we need to advocate for and scale up."" Research shows that climate solutions receive far less coverage in the media than the causes and consequences. Arecent study by Public Citizenfound that U.S. news media mentioned climate solutions or mitigation just 13% of the time when discussing climate change. #EyeOnClimate addresses this gap by encouraging photographers and people everywhere to share their climate solutions on Instagram with the hashtag #EyeOnClimate. In 2018, the campaign inspired over 700 images featuring climate solutions to be shared online. Previous #EyeOnClimate campaigns have won a Shorty Award forBest Use of Hashtagand PR News Social Media Award forBest Instagram PR Campaign.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA303","Climate Change: What Is In Store For Sri Lanka? \u8211  OpEd","December 6, 2019 Friday","Eurasia Review","By Dr Palitha Kohona The annual Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP25 ) began in Madrid on December 2, largely unnoticed in Sri Lanka which is just settling down after a bruising presidential election. But given the critical importance of climate change to this beautiful island with its miles of unspoilt beaches, populated low lands, breathtaking tea covered mountains, and weather dependent agriculture, it should have received more attention. Sri Lanka became party to the Paris Accord of 2016, an agreement within theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC), dealing withgreenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation,adaptation, andfinance, on September 21, 2016. COP25 was moved to Madrid after original host Chile, beset by ongoing and widespread social disorder, requested in late October for it to be moved elsewhere. Some 50 world leaders were expected to attend COP25 , although a notable absentee was U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, who, in 2017 announced his country's withdrawal from the 2016 Paris Accord. The leaders of Russia, China, Brazil and India were also missing from Madrid. The Paris Accord which involved a mix of compromises was largely the work of a handful of world leaders, including President Obama and president Xi Jinping. Writing on the subject at the time, I expressed my concern that while a great effort was made by all negotiating parties to accommodate the USA as much as possible, given the U.S. reluctance to become party to the Kyoto Protocol, it would be a forlorn hope to expect the world's second biggest emitter of green house gasses to remain faithful to its own commitments. Similarly, I doubted whether the goals of the Accord to increase the ability of parties to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and make ""finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development"" would be realised. The speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will be present in Madrid, leading a congressional delegation. Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist and the initiator of the school strikes for climate in September 2019, which were attended by over four million people, will be there too. Speaking at the opening of COP25 , an emotionless, almost dull, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres somberly noted that ""By the end of the coming decade we will be on one of two paths, one of which is sleepwalking past the point of no return,"" He also asked ""Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?"" The other pathway, Guterres said, was to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050"". ""There are calls from young people to do more, much more. They know we need to get on the right path today, not tomorrow, and COP25 offers us an opportunity."" Ever since the UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 in Rio and was followed up with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the world has heard similar dire warnings from a succession of Secretaries-General and the scientific community. While some countries have heeded these forecasts of gloom and doom and begun to take necessary action, the countries mainly responsible historically for the current state of affairs have not chosen to proactively adopt the mitigation measures so desperately required. Climate change is becoming the most important global environmental challenge, with implications for food production, water supply, health, energy security, coastal settlements, forest ecosystems, coastal economies, etc. Addressing climate change requires a good scientific understanding as well as coordinated action at national and global levels. Unless global action is taken in a coordinated manner, humanity may be doomed to suffer seriously from what we ourselves have caused to the climate in our headlong and uninformed rush towards development. The required global reduction of carbon emissions has more than doubled from 3.3 percent 10 years ago to seven percent now, while the world was ""still waiting for transformative movement from most G20 nations"" responsible for three-quarters of carbon emissions. Some progress has occurred but not enough to ensure global sustainability. Hoesung Lee, the chair for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has said ""immediate reductions [of carbon emission] have powerful benefits for all sectors of society"". Sri Lanka needs to take climate change extremely seriously and the policy platform of the newly elected President, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, has recognised this factor. His platform, if faithfully implemented, will place Sri Lanka at the forefront of environmentally responsible countries. There are clear signs that the country is already a victim of something unusual happening to the climate. The regular and familiar weather patterns of the past do not seem to occur any more. Droughts devastate crops more regularly with reservoirs drying up visibly while heavy and unseasonal rainfall has also become a major threat, causing floods, landslides and deaths. Climate related deaths, which were not a common experience for this country, also appear to have increased. Over 21% of the population is still engaged in agriculture, and this is not a happy situation to be in. Although the cricket season starts in October and lasts till March in the Western Province, largely because it used to be the dry season, heavy rains and floods have become a disruptive feature of this period. Climate change is expected to cause other challenges to the island. It is expected that the warming of the ocean will cause fish stocks to migrate further away from the equator in search of lower temperatures. With over 145,000 thousand people dependent on fisheries, this may result is widespread unemployment. Exacerbating poverty levels Furthermore, with tourism being identified by the newly elected Government as a 10 billion Dollar industry for the near future, sea level rise will have a devastating impact. The millions of Dollars currently being invested in coastal resorts exploiting the country's fabled golden beaches may turn out to be a mistake. The tourism industry needs to take account of the possible effects of climate change and focus on the other attractions, of which the country is blessed with abundance. It is not likely that whatever measures that Sri Lanka will take alone will have a major impact globally on the growing threat of climate change. But if one were to follow the adage that every bit helps, then Sri Lanka has an important role to play. It has bravely taken a lead role in the past in global fora on different issues. Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to contribute to initiatives undertaken by the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to put pressure on the big emitters to mend their ways. Sri Lanka has and could play an important role within its own neighbourhood. Regional neighbours such as the Maldives and Bangladesh are at the forefront of activism designed to put pressure of the big emitters. Both countries are staring at the possibility of going underwater, fully or partially, in the not too distant future due to sea level rise. Both large neighbours, India and Pakistan, are severely water stressed. Bhutan and Nepal are likely to be victims of glacier melt. TheSAARC Convention on Cooperation on the Environment was signed during the Sixteenth Summit. The Convention has been ratified by all Member States and entered into force with effect from 23 October 2013 and this could be further enhanced. Sri Lanka would also be well advised to take note of growing NGO demands, especially in Europe, to restrict imports from countries which do not comply with the Paris Accords. While these demands may be in their infancy now, the barely camouflaged measures could actually become protectionist or political. The possibility remains. Abandoning the commitments made in Paris to curtail fossil fuel use and reverting to coal and oil based power generation might prove to be extremely short sighted. We know that species extinction is occurring at an unprecedented pace, including in the seas and oceans. Global warming is contributing substantially to this phenomenon. Species adaptation to changing weather and climate factors is threatening the livelihood of millions who depend on the oceans and seas for their living. Fish swim away from familiar habitats to areas where the temperature is more conducive to their existence. Attempts to arrest global warming have received storms of verbal support but not much by way of practical action, particularly from the major emitters of green house gasses. Some in positions of power have even challenged the overwhelming scientific view in order to cultivate uninformed electoral support. In Sri Lanka, the population needs to be better informed by the authorities and adaptation mechanisms introduced. At COP 25 in Madrid, we need to encourage thinking that would balance economic consolidation and advancement and the conservation of the environment for our children. Our future must not be left to the whims of those who thrive on selfish ignorance.

The centerpiece of the Green Deal is European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's road map for how the bloc will increase its pledge to the Paris Agreement. And at a summit today and tomorrow, the E.U. is expected to cement its promise to become carbon neutral by 2050. Dutch official and European Commission Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans has spent the week shuttling between Madrid -- where he met with counterparts from countries like China, Brazil and New Zealand on issues related to Paris implementation -- and Brussels for the Green Deal launch. He's back in Spain today for the end of the conference and to present Europe's post-2020 climate agenda to delegates assembled here. Timmermans told reporters Monday that he was in search of ""as many global partners as I can to move in the right direction."" ""Everybody subscribed to the Paris Agreement, but now the necessity is to translate that into concrete action,"" he said. ""And we as the E.U. want to lead by example, but since we're only about 9% of the global emissions, it's only really important if we can convince our global partners to move in the same direction."" The E.U. has paid particular attention to China and India. Next year, the Paris Agreement will ask countries to consider strengthening their commitments, and neither China nor India has signaled it will do that. That's potentially destabilizing. If two of the world's largest emitters decline to ""ratchet up"" their Paris targets, it could shake belief in both the deal and the objective of keeping warming to less damaging levels. Last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report showed the window to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will close around 2030, when the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) offered next year likely will expire. China long has been seen as on track to outperform its 2015 commitment to peak emissions by 2030. But its economy is slowing, and coal-fired generation has rebounded -- dimming hopes that the world's largest emitter might tighten its target. The United States under President Obama was credited with having created the geopolitical conditions for NDCs -- Obama unveiled the U.S. pledge in a joint rollout with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014, one year before the agreement of the Paris deal. European leaders are trying to play the same role since U.S. climate politics changed under President Trump. Days after the Trump administration took formal steps to withdraw the U.S. from the deal in November, French President Emmanuel Macron signed a joint declaration with Xi during a summit -- calling the deal ""irreversible."" Also in November, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and offered him ?1 billion ($1.11 billion) for green urban transit. The E.U. is hosting China for a conference in Leipzig, Germany, in September. While Chinese prime ministers have attended past E.U.-China summits, Xi himself is expected to make the trip next year. The summit is when the E.U. aims to reach an agreement with China on a new commitment to Paris. In Paris, the E.U. promised to cut emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2030. Yesterday's Green Deal shows the compact mulling a new target of between 50% and 55%, with nine countries, including France and Germany, pressing for a 55% NDC to be finalized quickly. The von der Leyen plan sets a timeline of June. But climate advocates say the bloc should consider 65%. And they fear that rolling out the NDC in the summer or later will give member countries little time to discuss and approve it, and provide less time for the E.U. to reach out to the likes of India and China with a strong new target of its own in hand. Goksen Sahin of Climate Action Network Europe said member states should consider holding extra summits to move the 2030 target more quickly -- as they did this year to grapple with Brexit. But Timmermans defended the commission's plan, saying it would clear the European Parliament more quickly if there was adequate stakeholder consultation before it moved. He expressed optimism about prospects for a joint agreement on increased Paris ambition with China. ""Chinese leadership has consistently shown its awareness of the necessity to tackle the issue of global emissions, so I do believe there is a good basis for an agreement to be reached during the summit in September,"" said Timmermans. He added that a joint agreement with China would ""show collective leadership"" that might convince other players to come to Glasgow, Scotland, next December with revised NDCs of their own. Laurence Tubiana, a French official and key architect of the Paris deal, traveled to China with Macron last month. ""I saw the attachment of the Chinese to multilateralism and to make the Paris Agreement really implemented,"" she told reporters in Madrid this week. ""China's role both politically and economically, as an investor, as a political power, is absolutely crucial for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. And for raising ambition."" She compared China with the U.S., where ""you have the federal government ignoring that, ignoring science."" ""China is not ignoring science,"" she said. \"

Ko Barrett, a deputy assistant administrator at NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, acknowledged ""the formal negotiations were widely seen as disappointing"" but said the final statement released Sunday ""did emphasize some really interesting things."" Barrett spoke yesterday to NOAA's Science Advisory Board about her experience last week at the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP 25 . She also is a vice chair of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and co-author of the panel's September report warning about warming oceans and melting ice sheets. ""Having been to COPs for 20 years, this is the COP where I saw the strongest focus on science and public participation,"" Barrett said. Barrett praised the three-page statement agreed to by the international parties in Madrid even as many people, including U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, assailed the conference. ""There was a clear recognition of non-party actors,"" Barrett said. ""By my reading, about 10 of 35 paragraphs [in the final statement] were focused on or included mention of non-party actors."" The statement acknowledges ""the important role of non-party stakeholders in contributing to progress"" in reducing emissions and non-party groups ""that announced voluntary initiatives and coalitions"" in Madrid. Those include nonprofit organizations and subnational groups such as cities and states. Barrett also noted that several paragraphs in the final statement ""emphasize the role of science"" and recognize the IPCC. ""I think it's quite interesting to see the way ocean issues, the cryosphere and, broadly, science issues are now the centerpiece of the entire COP experience,"" Barrett said. The final statement expresses gratitude to the IPCC ""and the scientific community"" for their reports this year on climate change, ""which reflect the best available science."" Many officials and observers criticized the Madrid session, which ended with the U.S. and other major polluters blocking a statement that would have encouraged nations to step up their commitment to reduce emissions beyond the vows made in Paris in 2015 (Climatewire, Dec. 16). Guterres, the secretary-general, wrote on Twitter: ""I am disappointed in the results of COP25 . The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up."" \"

COP25 wants to start a new stage in climate action, being organised under the aegis of the Presidency of the Republic of Chile with the logistic support of the Kingdom of Spain, over December 2-13, 2019.At the COP25 there will be discussed at least two major files: carbon market and non-market-based approaches (Article 6 of the Paris Agreement), as well as adjustments to climate change.The main message of COP25 is that all the states of the world must collectively make efforts to increase ambitions in taking concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adjust to the effects of climate change.""It is very important to state here that we are making all efforts in this respect at European level. We are here to finalize the package of rules for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. With this, we will enter a completely new era, that of implementation, when we are going to really make things happen,"" said the Minister of Environment, Water and Forests.The European Parliament in end-November adopted an emergency resolution on climate change and the environment, while the Committee for Environment insisted all through November that the European Union should commit, at the COP25 Conference, to reach the zero carbon dioxide target by 2050, while also increasing its ambitions regarding the reduction of greenhouse emissions by 2030.""Romania reached its reduction targets for 2020, while the targets for 2030 represent not only a challenge, but also an opportunity for an intelligent development of the national economy. We will work together with our colleagues in the government to identify the best solutions for each sector of our economy. We will involve all the actors, all the relevant public institutions, the business environment, the financial-banking environment, the academic environment and the civil society, in making all efforts that we all should be making,"" underscored Alexe.The Minister also showed that his first priority after taking over as Minister of Environment, Waters and Forests is represented by the forests, which are one of the most important carbon reservoirs still existing in Romania. Moreover, he said he is determinate to put into practice such climate actions that have the highest potential in growing the national economy, while ensuring environment integrity and protecting citizens exposed to climate risks. \"

This will contribute to the Paris Agreement's implementation and to stronger action by countries. However, given the climate emergency and public expectations, France regrets that governments did not go far enough in their commitments. Throughout the negotiations, France played an active role in calling for ambition and accepting no backsliding on our commitments, in order to mobilize all the parties again in the run-up to 2020, which is set to be essential. (...) What has happened for the Paris Agreement since COP21 in 2015? Following its adoption in December 2015 (COP21) and accelerated entry into force in November 2016 (COP22), the United Nations countries have been meeting to establish precise rules for its implementation. These were virtually all finalized at COP24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. The aim of COP25 It also provided an opportunity to take stock of national and international efforts to combat climate change. If we want to achieve the main goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to keep the global temperature rise well below 2C by the end of the century, we must do more and faster. Current efforts, although positive, are grossly inadequate to alleviate the climate crisis, because even in the event of all countries fully implementing all the pledges announced in 2015 (Nationally Determined Contributions), this collective effort would put the planet on a global warming trajectory of more than 3C by the end of the century. At the forthcoming COP26 in Glasgow in November 2020, every country will have to increase its climate ambitions, and we will also have to ensure that the Paris Agreement is actually implemented, by translating each country's pledges into ambitious public climate policies conducted through national action plans./. \"

On December 16, police dispersed a protest camp near the city of Kazan, dragging people by their arms and legs. At least 16 people were fined or received 7 days detention for disobeying police orders and taking part in a ""mass simultaneous presence of movement in public spaces."" The protesters were attempting to delay construction of a waste incineration plant until the contractors make the project documents public, conduct an independent public environmental impact assessment, and hold public hearings as required by law. Instead, authorities sent the Special Police Forces (OMON). The next day, in Saint Petersburg, authorities detained a Greenpeace Russia staffer, Rashid Alimov, for standing in a solo picket to protest Russia's import of German nuclear waste. He stood next to 11 empty barrels bearing a nuclear hazard sign that read ""Happy New Year"" and was holding a placard that read ""Russia is not a nuclear dump."" He is now awaiting trial on squatting charges. On December 20, a court in Moscow sentenced youth climate activist Arshak Makichyan to six days in jail for an unauthorized peaceful protest in October. Since mid-March, Makichyan had been holding solo pickets weekly in Moscow's center as part of the ""Fridays for the Future"" strike. Earlier in December, Makichyan spoke at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid with Greta Thunberg, whose example inspired his protest. These three incidents are emblematic of the variety, scope, and urgency of the rising number of environmental protests in Russia throughout 2019. Protesters are voicing alarm at what they see as an environmental emergency from expansion or construction of new landfills and incineration plants, toxic waste management, nuclear waste imports, pollution from industrial production, natural resource extraction, forest fires, and many other pressing environmental issues. Throughout the year, many other peaceful protesters were arrested, beaten by private security guards or police, and fined, and many faced criminal charges. But Russian activists appear determined to protect their right under article 42 of Russia's constitution to a ""favorable environment"" despite no indication of a holiday miracle for those arrested in December. \"

The letter comes as the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference takes place in Madrid this week. The senators wrote, As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs. The letter also emphasized the national security implications related to the presidents withdrawal, underscoring the damage done to the United States reputation by reneging on an international commitment. The senators letter further illustrates the outcry from Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Google.

New asset classes have been added to the methodology and new tools are available for the growing number of financial companies who want to use the PCAF methodology. Participating institutions in the Netherlands represent Euros2 trillion of assets under management, many of whom already publicly disclose the associated carbon footprint. The Dutch group pioneered the development of a methodology to assess the carbon emissions of financial institution's loans and investments. This groundbreaking approach has been the catalyst for a global movement of institutions who assess their emissions with a view, ultimately, to align their impact with the Paris Climate Goals. Triodos Bank's Spanish Managing Director, Mikel Garcia, and FMO Jorim Schraven, Director of Impact and ESG at Dutch development bank, FMO, presented the report, Accounting CHG emissions and taking action: harmonized approach for the financial sector in the Netherlands, to Marcel Beukeboom, Climate Emissary of the Dutch government during the climate summit in Madrid. Align portfolio with Paris climate agreement PCAF chair Piet Sprengers (ASN Bank): ""PCAF plays an important role in allowing the financial sector to make the transition to a positive, low carbon future. By making their CO2 emissions transparent, financial companies are taking a very important step to ultimately align their portfolio with the Paris Climate Agreement. Today's report shows that PCAF provides a simple and powerful way to start measuring and reporting on their climate impact. We call on the financial sector to start assessing the emissions of their loans and investments, to reduce their finance of fossil assets and actively support the transition to a low carbon economy of the future."" Rabobank Wiebe Draijer, chairman of the Managing Board of Rabobank, about the report: 'We welcome this report as a further development of the measurement of the carbon footprint of banks' balance sheets. To meet the Dutch Climate Agreement and the Paris goals it is required that our clients and society at large halve the emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 level. PCAF can help to make the challenge visible and to monitor progress. ' In the report, Rabobank describes an initial exploration of the credit portfolio of its local banks. The results are further improved with in collaboration with RIVM and CBS. Global movement PCAF started in the Netherlands in 2015, when ASN Bank took this initiative during the climate summit in Paris. Eleven Dutch financial institutions joined this first effort of its kind by the financial industry, for the financial industry. PCAF has now become a worldwide standard. To date, 57 financial institutions from around the world have joined and committed to measure and report on their CO2 emissions. They represent $3.5 trillion in total assets. The ambition of PCAF is to grow this number to 100 institutions worldwide within three years. In the future, the group believes that measuring and disclosing CO2 impact should become common practice across the entire financial sector. Science based targets An important next step in the development of PCAF is to use insights from assessing greenhouse gas emissions to set science-based targets. These targets will help ensure financial institutions play their part in keeping the global increase in temperature within safe levels. Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-6958093 MSTRUCK \"

Published 29 January 2020 From: British High Commission Dhaka and DFID Bangladesh Experts reflected on the process and outcomes of COP25 , the journey to COP26, and opportunities for the UK and Bangladesh to raise global ambition to reduce the emissions gap. On 27 January, the British High Commission in Bangladesh invited government, academic and civil society representation to the High Commissioner's residence to convey the UK's ambition for this year's UN climate change conference (COP26) and its growing collaboration with Bangladesh for advancing the climate agenda towards COP26 and beyond. British High Commissioner HE Robert Chatterton Dickson opened the discussion by reflecting on the global outcomes of COP25 and setting out the UK ambition for COP26. The High Commisssioner said ""Climate change is the defining issue of our time. The UK and Bangladesh can form a great partnership to lead global efforts to tackle it. Our combined expertise and leadership mean we can work together to raise the world's ambition before and during COP26, seeking global commitment on adapting to climate impacts and building resilience for the future."" Mr Ziaul Hasan ndc, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Focal Point for Bangladesh, delivered the keynote speech.

The panellists reflected on the process and outcomes of COP25 , the journey to COP26, and opportunities for the UK and Bangladesh to raise global ambition to reduce the emissions gap. DFID Country Representative Judith Herbertson, delivered the closing remarks on UK-Bangladesh cooperation beyond COP26. She said that DFID is planning a new programme to support adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change as well as environmental management in Bangladesh. The DFID Country Reepresentative said ""Our vision is that through our partnership and our programming, we can show what can be done to clean up growth and build resilience across the country; and share this expertise with other countries."" The UK, in partnership with Italy, will host COP26 this year in November in Glasgow. More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the conference, including heads of state and government; experts; and campaigners. Delegates will be discussing ambitious ways in which the world can lower emissions to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees of warming. While the UK is gearing up for the presidency of COP26, Bangladesh is advancing its preparation to lead the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Locally-Led Adaptation Action Track of the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA). And leading up to COP26, the UK intends to build a stronger partnership with countries like Bangladesh; a vulnerable country but increasingly resilient to climate impacts. As the leading voice against climate impacts, Bangladesh can play a more significant role in the global climate change discourse through COP26. The UK is already a key partner to Bangladesh on disaster management and resilience building. Since 2008, UK and Bangladesh jointly helped over 27 million people gain access to early warning systems for floods and cyclones, and provided emergency assistance and recovery support after disasters to more than 900,000 people.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA318","Climate Crisis is Aggravating Human Rights Violations Caused by the Fossil Fuel Industry, Alerts 350.org Report","February 8, 2020 Saturday 8:10 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","The 350.org issued the following news release: The global climate crisis, mainly generated by the biggest fossil fuel corporations in the world, is seriously aggravating the already extensive and heavy set of human rights violations caused by this same industry, warns a report released this Friday, February 7th, by 350.org. Oil, gas and coal companies are directly or indirectly responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses committed by corporations around the world in the last three decades, as shown by the 10 cases mentioned in the publication. Considering just a few major cases of violations, the fossil fuel industry was directly responsible for about 45,000 premature deaths caused by health issues, the dump of more than 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into rivers and the opening of almost 2.5 million acres of previously inaccessible indigenous homeland to land speculation, colonisation and deforestation. The violations have been committed by both local companies and industry giants like Chevron-Texaco and Shell. In some cases included in the report, companies have acted in tandem with governments or private security groups in an illegal or non-transparent manner. With the aggravation of the climate crisis, the negative environmental and social impacts of the actions of fossil fuel companies in several of these cases - and similar ones - are getting worse. ""The pollution and contamination often caused by fossil fuel industry activities mainly affect the poorest populations, as well as the climate crisis. Vulnerable communities are being doubly exposed to losses or scarcity of land, fish stocks and water, for example. Even in the face of the clearest scientific evidence that burning fossil fuels is literally setting the planet on fire, this sector continues to invest in the same old model and often misinforms society about the climate crisis and its causes. In doing so, companies are actively disregarding the right of entire populations to a healthy environment, sufficient and quality food, and a political and social scenario of stability,"" said Aaron Packard, manager of the Climate Defenders program at 350.org. Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions, not just in terms of climate risks, but also due to rapidly shrinking democratic spaces in countries like Hong Kong, Philippines, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia, presenting increasing challenges in ensuring environmental and social safeguards. As per a recent study, The Philippines replaced Brazil as the most murderous country in the world for people defending their land and environment. The 350.org report highlights the need for local and national governments to act to protect climate defenders, such as community leaders who are at the forefront of mobilizations for the rights of affected families. Many of them are targets of threats, aggression, torture or murder. Norly Grace Mercado, 350.org's Asia Director said, ""In the Philippines, local activist Gloria Capitan was killed for her opposition to a coal project polluting her community and endangering their lives and livelihoods. Together with her community, they also opposed a proposed power plant funded by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Standard Chartered and Mizuho Bank. Anti-coal activists in Gloria's community in Bataan still face harassment, intimidation and attacks for demanding genuine consultation about the power plant expansion demolishing their houses."" 350.org's Digital Campaigner Chuck Baclagon said, ""Sadly, the story of Gloria is only one of the many stories of environmental defenders, who every day risk their lives, limb and liberty to stand against companies that threaten not only their local ecosystems but also their means to live their lives with dignity. Many of them are aware of the rising risks of going against huge corporate interests, yet believing that although all people die eventually, it is better to do so while fighting for the good of their community and the planet that we call home."" Included in the report is the ""Carbon Majors Inquiry"", undertaken by the Commission on Human Rights in the Philippines after being petitioned by climate activists and civil society organizations. During the United Nations Climate Change conference , COP 25 in Madrid last December, the Commission announced that it found these Carbon Majors to be legally and morally liable for climate damages, and implored states to fulfill their duty under human rights law and establish regulatory measures to hold them accountable. The report also talks about the Rampal Coal Power Plant - a joint venture of the Bangladesh-India Friendship Group and set to be constructed on a UNESCO designated site. This project is emblematic of the human rights abuses that are associated with the construction of fossil fuel power plants. Since the power plant plans were proposed in 2010, there have been mass mobilisations in opposition, to which the government has responded through suppression of freedom of expression, speech and assembly. Sharif Jamil of NCSS, BAPA and Waterkeepers Bangladesh and a staunch activist said, ""Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world with a dense population. It is therefore extremely important for the global climate defenders to pay serious attention to Bangladesh and its ongoing massive expansion of coal based power production by putting pressure on global investors to extend their cooperation to its sustainable development and renewable energy sector."" Community leaders and Human Rights experts from various countries are meeting in Curitiba, Brazil, from February 5-8 for the Climate Defenders Gathering, a space to exchange experiences and build a global network of solidarity. The launch of the report is one of the highlights of this event, which is organized by 350.org. [Category: Energy] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7012804 MSTRUCK \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA319","SOCIAL SUMMIT DEMANDS STRONGER COMMITMENTS IN CLIMATE TALKS","December 9, 2019 Monday","IPS - Inter Press Service","As the COP25 In the debates in the week-long Social Summit for Climate Action, which began Dec. 7 parallel to the Dec. 2-13 United Nations 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) on climate change taking place in Madrid, skepticism has been expressed with respect to the results to come out of the official meeting. ""Nothing good is going to come out of it for Central America, only proposals that are going to make it more vulnerable. The damage is going to become more serious,"" Carolina Amaya, representative of the Salvadoran Ecological Unit, told IPS, pointing out that the region is one of the most exposed to the climate crisis, facing persistent droughts, intense storms, rising sea levels and climate migrants. The social summit is taking place at the public Complutense University, in the west of the Spanish capital, about 15 km from the IFEMA fairgrounds which are hosting COP25 after Chile pulled out on Oct. 30 from holding the event due to massive anti-government protests and social unrest. The alternative activities, which also end on Friday Dec. 13, include a varied menu of issues, such as free trade and its socioenvironmental impacts, oil drilling in indigenous territories, the protection of forests, and opposition to trading reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which cause global warming. They are also discussing the monetisation of environmental services, increased funding for the most vulnerable nations, climate justice and attacks against land rights activists. The Madrid Social Summit is also holding sessions in Santiago de Chile, under the same slogan, ""Beyond COP25 : People for Climate"", although there are fewer representatives of organised civil society than at previous COPs because of the last minute change of venue. Civil society groups are also organising activities at their green pavilion within the official COP25 COP25 is the third consecutive COP held in Europe, this time under the motto ""Time to act"". The deliberations, which enter the crucial phase of the adoption of agreements Tuesday Dec. 10, are focusing on financing national climate policies, rules for emission reduction markets, and the preparation of the update of emissions reductions and funding of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, designed to assist regions particularly affected by climate change. COP25 is the climate summit that directly precedes the 2020 entrance into effect of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, adopted in the French capital in 2015, which left key areas to be hashed out at the current conference, such as the controversial emissions market. In their statement to the COP, the organisations criticise the economic model based on the extraction of natural resources and mass consumption, blaming it for the climate crisis, and complaining about the lack of results in the UNFCCC meetings. ""The scientific diagnosis is clear regarding the seriousness and urgency of the moment. Economic growth happens at the expense of the most vulnerable people,"" says the statement, which defends climate justice ""as the backbone of the social fights of our time"" and ""the broadest umbrella that exists to protect all the diversity of struggles for another possible world."" At the social summit, the first ""Latin American Climate Manifesto was presented on Monday Dec. 9, which lashes out at carbon credit trading, the role of corporations in climate change and the increase in production of hydrocarbons, while expressing support for the growth of agroecology, the defence of human rights and the demand for climate justice. In addition, indigenous peoples are holding their own meeting, the ""indigenous Minga"", with the message ""Traditional knowledge at the service of humanity in the face of climate change."" They are demanding respect for their rights, participation in the negotiations and recognition of their role as guardians of ecosystems such as forests. ""We are here to raise our voices and offer our contribution to fight"" against the climate emergency, Jozileia Kaingang, a chief of the Kaingang people and a representative of the non-governmental Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, told IPS. Brazilian indigenous groups are in conflict with the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro because of its attempts to undermine their rights and encourage the commercial exploitation of their territories. In fact, the Brazilian government delegation does not include a single indigenous member - unprecedented in the recent history of the COPs. Faced with this dispute and the critical situation of the Amazon jungle, Brazil's indigenous people have sent representatives to Madrid to speak out and seek solidarity. The murder of two leaders of the Guajajara people in northeastern Brazil on Saturday Dec. 7 shook the indigenous delegation. Two murders had already occurred in that native community in the last two months. In 2017, the States Parties to the UNFCCC adopted at COP23 the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform for the exchange of experiences and best practices, thereby ensuring the participation of these groups in the negotiations of the convention. The Platform's facilitative working group, composed of delegates from seven States Parties and seven indigenous peoples, is currently developing its plan for the period 2020-2021. Martin Vilela, a representative of the Bolivian Platform for Climate Change umbrella group of local organisations, questioned the effectiveness of the climate summits. ""The agreements are only paper. Emissions continue to rise and countries' voluntary targets are insufficient. The countries have to be more ambitious if they really want to avoid major disasters,"" he told IPS. The Agreement sets mandatory emission reduction targets for industrialised countries and voluntary targets for developing countries in the South. ""The countries need to know that we're monitoring them. We, the organisations, must prepare ourselves to demand better action,"" said Amaya from El Salvador. For her part, Brazil's Kaingang argued that the climate struggle would only be effective if it includes indigenous peoples. COP26 will be hosted by Glasgow, Scotland in November 2020, after pre-conference meetings in Germany and Italy. This article was supported by the COP25 Latin American Journalistic Coverage Programme.

The EU bank and the public promotional bank of the Brazilian State Minas Gerais, Banco De Desenvolvimento De Minas Gerais (BDMG), have signed a memorandum of understanding to reinforce the cooperation between the two institutions. This new agreement signed with BDMG aims at sharing experiences and best practices in areas and sectors of common interest, thus fostering financial cooperation in Brazil between the two institutions. The EIB will support BDMG in its goal to promote sustainable economic and social development in the State of Minas Gerais by facilitating investments in both the public and private sectors. In October this year, the two entities joined forces to support climate action projects in Brazil. Thanks to agreement, the EIB facilitated EUR 100 m to boost climate investments in this Brazilian State, contributing to an increased production of renewable and clean energy while securing energy supply. Part of this EIB financing is going to be dedicated to supporting energy efficiency projects, especially in public buildings, street lighting, and industrial facilities. At the signing ceremony, EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro responsible for EIB operations in Latin America and the Bank's climate action, said: ""This Memorandum of Understanding shows the EIB commitment to promote our climate change ambition in Latin America. Cooperation with promotional banks is of key importance as it allows the EIB to draw on their valuable experience and know-how in the region. Thanks to this strengthened partnership with BDMG, we will mobilise the financial resources needed to further support the development of sustainable and inclusive projects in Brazil."" BDMG President Sergio Gusmao Suchodolski said: ""BDMG and the EIB are both committed to foster investments aimed at mitigating climate change, in line with the 2030 United Nations Agenda. The EIB expertise will contribute to strengthen our business model, enhancing BDMG's role as a major driver of sustainable development in Brazil, especially in the state of Minas Gerais."" The EIB, a key player in Latin America The EU is the main development partner of the Latin America region, its number one investor and its second-largest trading partner. As the EU bank, the EIB supports the EU's relationship with Latin America by financing projects that contribute to the EU's external policy objectives: the development of economic, environmental and social infrastructure; private sector development; and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Climate change mitigation and adaptation is the EIB's main priority in the region, where projects supported by the EU bank focus on the environment, and especially on boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable public transport schemes. Climate change adaptation-related projects involve upgrading existing infrastructure to be more resilient in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather patterns, preparing it for direct and indirect impacts. In 2018, the EIB stepped up its contribution to sustainable development and climate action in Latin America, providing EUR 640m to finance 15 operations: that is the highest number of EIB operations structured in one year in the region. The EIB and climate crisis The EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming to under 2 C and limit temperature rises to 1.5 C to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, to ensure that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1 trillion by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021. In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.

U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the convention, known as COP25 , will take place in the Spanish capital Dec. 2-13. Madrid offered to hold the event Thursday, one day after Chilean President said the capital of Santiago could no longer host. He also canceled plans to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit scheduled for December. ""We understand perfectly the importance of APEC and [the climate change conference] for Chile and the world, but we have based our decision on common sense,"" he said in a statement. ""A president needs to put its people above everything else."" Chile has been the site of weeks of protests, initially in opposition to planned transportation price hikes. The demonstrations have involved into a national movement for a variety of issues. In some cases, the protests have turned violent, killing at least 20 people. On Tuesday, Pinera replaced key members of his Cabinet, saying it was to enhance dialogue with the citizens and create greater national unity. Friday's announcement that COP25 would be held in Madrid resulted in a bit of trouble for climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who planned to attend the event. She was already en route to Chile and learned she'll have to turn around and cross the Atlantic Ocean. The 16-year-old refuses to travel by plane because of the emissions, and instead travels by boat, train or electric car. She used a sailboat earlier this year to travel from Europe to North America to participate in the Global Climate Strike and what was expected to be the COP25 in Chile. She tweeted a call for assistance to get her back across the ocean to Madrid. ""As # COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I'll need some help. It turns out I've traveled half around the world, the wrong way:) Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November...

Sir David said that public opinion regarding the fight against climate change, especially among young people, has changed a lot.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA324","Governments Must Tackle Climate Damages and Gender Injustice, Says CARE on UN Climate Conference","November 29, 2019 Friday 8:50 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","CARE International issued the following news release: Amidst wildfires, prolonged droughts, cyclones and rising social injustice, CARE calls on all governments and stakeholders at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP25 , to ramp up their national climate plans (NDCs) by 2020 and to increase resilience, particularly for women and girls suffering from the climate crisis. COP25 is following last year's adoption of the Paris Agreement Rulebook at COP24, and the September UN Climate Action Summit which was largely a missed opportunity by many governments to ramp up climate action. The conference in Madrid must start to fill the gap in ambitious commitments and advance on specific areas of concern at this pivotal time in global climate policy and action. On Climate ambition: ""At the UN climate conference, governments, particularly from rich and powerful countries, must stop ignoring the climate emergency and commit to delivering more ambitious national climate plans in 2020. Our house is burning and this fire must be extinguished. Leaders thwarting action will be remembered in history for their destruction and must not be allowed to obstruct the conference, and climate action overall. We know the solutions we need, and together, the rest of the world has the power to make them happen."" Inge Vianen, Global Leader of CARE's Climate Change and Resilience Platform On loss and damage and finance: ""From Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas, the burden of the climate crisis falls disproportionately on the poorest and most vulnerable, particularly women and girls. At COP25 , rich countries must shift the scales of justice towards those most impacted by the climate emergency and chart the way towards generating an additional USD 50 billion by 2022 to address loss and damage."" Sven Harmeling, CARE's Global Policy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience On Gender: ""There is no longer any question: climate justice, social justice and gender justice are inseparable realities that will indelibly shape our world, and the future of our species. If women are not adequately represented at the table and their solutions are not promoted, climate action will fail. With the adoption of an ambitious UNFCCC Gender Action Framework with a comprehensive 5-year Gender Action Plan at its core, COP25 can set a landmark for gender-just climate action.""

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA325","Climate change needs ""action, not ambition""","January 2020","Global Investor","With growing pressure on investors to actively contribute towards climate change, there is a great deal of pressure placed on passive investing, according to experts at Aviva Investors media briefing on January 21. ""Passive investing fundamentally supports existing business models in which passive indices are algorithms of the past. If you are a passive investor, you are not going to be able to adapt your business models as you have an index that you cannot change. So if one is concerned about climate change, you are going to come under pressure as passive investing is an awkward position to defend,"" said David Cummings, chief investment officer (CIO) of equities at Aviva Investors. With The 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) set to take place in Glasgow in November, carbon markets and climate financing, as well as debating the role of banks and financing the climate transition are hot topics up for discussion Aviva Investor's experts stated. Mirza Baig, global head of governance, Aviva Investors, added: ""We're in conversations with the corporate side and with other investors on this issue. We are now at a stage where we need action, not ambition."" Whilst climate change and ESG are important topics from a morality point of view, Aviva stated that evidently, they still want to commercialise and differentiate on the topic. Discussing the firm's view on green bonds, Colin Purdie CIO of Credit at Aviva Investors explained that the firm was happy to support markets if they saw evidence of incremental benefits from the issuance of a bond. ""If we see companies doing something with those proceeds, that they would not otherwise have done, and that has an environmental benefit, then we will support that market. What we are trying to ensure, is that companies don't issue green bonds because they want to be seen doing something that is positive towards the environment or some form of 'greenwashing'."" Cummings added that there will also be increased pressure to remain authentic and that people will pick up on greenwashing. Analysts from Vistra Group said in their report on January 13, that the private equity industry is facing numerous conflicting pressures, notably, a greater emphasis being placed on ESG investing, as respondents believed that Millennials and Generation Z investors will be more responsible in their investment decisions. Global Investor discusses whether securities lending collateral is relevant to the ESG question for investors in\~green funds. \"

Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, issued the following news release: Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) joined Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and a group of Democratic Senators in a letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to reconsider his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. In their letter, the Senators sound the alarm on the crisis of climate change and the damage that will be inflicted on Americans for future generations unless immediate action is taken. The Senators warned the President against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue, and admonished him for failing to honor his commitment to work with Democrats to renegotiate the Paris Climate Accord or to craft a new deal. The letter comes as the 25th United Nations Climate Change conference takes place in Madrid this week. The Senators wrote, ""As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs."" The letter also emphasized the national security implications related to the President's withdrawal, underscoring the damage done to the United States' reputation by reneging on an international commitment. The Senators' letter further illustrates the outcry from Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Google. The Senators conclude their letter by reminding the President of the overwhelming number of Americans who believe the United States should participate in the Paris Climate Agreement - three out of every four registered voters - or 77 percent.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA328","PELOSI -- Transcript of Bicameral Congressional Delegation Press Conference at COP25 Madrid","December 2, 2019","Congressional Documents and Publications","December 2, 2019 Contact: Speaker's Press Office, 202-226-7616 Transcript of Bicameral Congressional Delegation Press Conference at COP25 Madrid Madrid - Speaker Nancy Pelosi is leading a bicameral Congressional Delegation to Madrid, Spain for the 2019 United Nations Framework on Climate Change. The bicameral delegation held a press conference to discuss the United States' commitment to addressing the climate crisis. Below is a full transcript: Speaker Pelosi. Good afternoon everyone. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, indeed the Congress of the United States, I thank the Spanish government for its leadership in combatting the climate crisis. As Prime Minister - President Sanchez has said, 'We must build a global economy that is prosperous, fair and ecological and socially just,' and we completely agree. I also want to commend the government of Chile, President Carolina-Schmidt of the - of COP25 , for Chile's leadership in putting together this conference of the - of parties of 25. It is - it is pretty exciting for us to be here. For some it is the COP meeting. For me - I - my first one was - Earth - called Earth Summit in 1992, in Rio, Brazil, and we had certain goals then. Clearly, we have not met them. We will meet the goals of this COP25 . COP25 has that blue ocean priority as part of it. It's a privilege to lead this very distinguished Congressional Delegation, from the House and the Senate to continue this crucial conversation. By coming here, we want to say to everyone: we're still in. The United States is still in. I'm honored that we're joined by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, whom we we'll be hearing from; Chairman Frank Pallone, of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Chair Eddie Bernice Johnson, of Science, Space and Technology - did I say she's from Texas; Chair Raul Grijalva of Arizona, Chair of the Natural Resources Committee; Chair Kathy Castor of Florida, Chair of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. A very distinguished delegation that also includes Betty McCollum, Chair of the Appropriation Subcommittee on Natural Resources and Interior, and also members of the Select Committee on Climate, which Kathy Castor chairs and you'll hear more about. So we have members of that Committee, including not only the senior Chairpersons, but also members of our Freshman class. So among the members that are with us: Representative Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, Representative Julia Brownley of California, Representative Jared Huffman of California, Representative Scott Peters of California - [Laughter] Did I tell you I was from California? [Laughter] - Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, Representative Mike Levin of California, Representative Sean Casten of Illinois and Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado. Joe Neguse, Sean Casten and Mike Levin are all members of our very distinguished Freshman class. Our delegation is here to send a message that Congress's commitment to taking action on the climate crisis is ironclad. We must act, because the climate crisis for us is a matter of public health, clean air, clean water for children's survival; our economy, advancing green, global - green technologies, which will lift everyone up as we address income disparity in the world; national security, combating extreme weather events and resource competition that drive migration; and others - our values of justice and equality; and our moral responsibility, if you believe, as do I, that this planet is God's creation, and we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of it. But if you don't share that belief, we all agree that we have a moral responsibility to our children to pass on this planet in a very responsible way. You all know about the latest U.N. Emissions Gap Report. I won't go into it now unless you ask about it, but I do want to say it says, 'Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deeper and deeper cuts in emissions.' And we intend to do that. So my colleagues will talk about some of the actions we have taken in Congress, what we have learned on this - on this visit. And I'll just close by saying - I mentioned the conferences that I was in at Brest for the G7 Heads of Parliament. I will be hosting that in Washington next year, and our theme is: 'Address the Climate Crisis with Economic and Environmental Justice for All.' Meeting the needs of the vulnerable states, the vulnerable people, the indigenous people. What President Sanchez talked about this morning: inclusion and ambition and the rest. What the Secretary General spoke about: a vision that we all share. Again, coming from the Congress of the United States: we're still in. With that, I want to yield to the distinguished Member of the United States Senate, Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Senator Whitehouse. Good morning. It is a great honor for me to be here with so many powerful House Chairmen, like Chairman Pallone and Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Johnson, Chairman Castor. And, it's a particularly great matter of pride to be on a delegation lead by Speaker Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi's presence here at this COP is not only significant here at this COP is, not only significant in its own right, but it also signals the broad consensus of the United States of America in favor of climate action. At the state level, at the city level, across the public and in a great deal of corporate America, we are indeed still in. Unfortunately, we are still having to fight our way through a bit of a blockade by the fossil fuel industry. You may hear statements from the fossil fuel industry about what their hopes and expectations are for climate action. My first-hand experience is that the statements from their lips do not match the expenditure of their funds, still dedicated to maintaining a significant political apparatus of denial and obstruction. But that will not prevail. And the America that you know - the America of leadership, the America of progress, the America of confidence, the America of clean and green energy, people like President Obama and Secretary Kerry's work at the original Paris COP is something we should all reflect on while we're here today - that America will be back. And, as Speaker Pelosi said, yes, we are still in. Speaker Pelosi. Thank you very much, Senator Whitehouse, and now, I'm pleased to yield to the distinguished Chair of our Select Committee on Climate, Kathy Castor of Florida. Chairwoman Castor. Well, good afternoon. Buenas tardes. This COP - the Conference of Parties Number 25 - is also labeled the 'COP of Action' and this delegation is here from the United States to say that we are committed to Climate Action Now. All across the United States of America, cities, states, business, academic institutions are lowering their greenhouse gas emissions and taking climate action and this year, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation including the Climate Action Now Act that says that the United States of America will remain committed to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. But, we're also focused on the future, and in March of 2020, under Speaker Pelosi's leadership and the united consensus of Democrats in the Congress, we will release a Climate Action Plan. A plan for the United States of America, through its congressional committees, to tackle the climate crisis, to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and to begin to adapt in a greater way to the climate crisis and it's impacts. This Climate Action Plan will be an extraordinary opportunity to begin to really invest in the clean energy economy and we will see in future years, this transformation in opportunity in the energy sector; in the transportation sector; in agriculture, for our farmers; in how we build buildings, where we build buildings and becoming more energy efficient. We intend to follow the science. We intend to ensure that vulnerable communities all across America and across the globe have every opportunity to participate in this clean energy economy and transformation. Together, we will solve the climate crisis, together, and I'm honored to be a part of it along with the outstanding members on the Select Committee on Climate Crisis. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Speaker Pelosi. Thank you, Madam Chair. Now, it is my pleasure to yield to the distinguished Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. In the Congress, they say if water touches it, wind blows on it, if it's about health, it's about Wall Street, whatever it is, it's in his committee. Chairman Pallone. Thank you, Madam Speaker. Speaker Pelosi. Chairman Pallone of New Jersey. Chairman Pallone. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I just want to stress what the Speaker Pelosi said is: that 'we're still in,' and, she mentioned that Congress is committed to take action. States are committed to take action. Cities are committed to take action. And, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, which I chair, and we have several members from our committee that are here with us today, we've already done a number of things and we plan on doing more. So, as Kathy Castor said, we passed H.R. 9, which is the legislation in the House that says that we do not want to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and we still want to be in. But, in addition to that, we've already laid out and passed some initiatives. We passed a number of energy efficiency bills out of the Committee; things like giving grants back to the states so they can take efficiency action, which, again, empowers the states to do more and the towns to do more on the local level. We also have a bill called the Lift America Act, which is - deals with infrastructure needs like grid modernization; and a pipeline safety bill that deals with leaky pipelines and methane pollution; and we set out a goal in our Committee in July of what we call '100 by 50', which means that we are determined to draft legislation for the issues on climate action that are within our Committee, so that we can reach a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Now, what did I learn today"" I learned that the Secretary General, when we met with him, has a similar goal. He talked about the European Union meeting that goal of 2050, and using that example for the United States and other major countries. So, I felt very empowered today, when I came here to hear from others about what we can do and I believe that we are moving forward with that commitment in Congress and elsewhere. So, I want, again, I want to thank the Speaker for bringing us here. I think we've given out the message that we're still in, Madam Speaker. Speaker Pelosi. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And now, we'll hear from Texas, the Chair of the [Science, Space and Technology] Committee, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas. Madam Chair. Chairwoman Johnson. Thank you very much and good afternoon. I'm delighted to have the experience of being here and seeing the thousands of people who stand together and want to look after the planet. I am delighted to say that I am a part of that group and I have not just started at this conference. Being Chair of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, we have already addressed a number of issues, and we will continue. We're using sound science and we've also had the experience of many catastrophes throughout our nation, that have forced to give attention to. I'm also a senior member of Transportation and Infrastructure, where I have really focused on resilience, even where we have the technology under the jurisdiction of my Committee that predicts weather, and it has obviously saved many lives by the information. We have not saved as much materials, as - by the infrastructure, housing, whatever you - because we have not really addressed it very seriously. But, it's encouraging to see that people throughout this planet have come here and to share ideas and get ideas and look at the exhibits to see what's new, see what we can utilize for the future to create a green planet and a lot of green jobs. I'm dismayed when I hear that to clean the planet and to give attention to the environment causes us to lose jobs. We have not found that in our research. So, I hope that we will all continue to speak out, speak loudly, help to educate, because this is every aspect of our life that we are talking about. We are talking about our health and environment, for all living creatures, whether it's on land, water or air. So, I'm delighted to be here, to have this experience, and my work will continue. Thank you. Speaker Pelosi. Thank you, Madam Chair. And now, to our distinguished gentleman from Arizona, the Chair of the Natural Resources Committee, Congressman, Mr. Chairman Raul Grijalva. Chairman Grijalva. Thank you, Madam Speaker and I'm glad to have been part of this delegation. I appreciate the opportunity. There was a comment made at the panel this morning dealing with vulnerable nations and communities and the comment was, 'Do we delay and pay or plan and prosper?' And I thought thematically that that was a critical comment. Vulnerability is a reality, as is the urgency to do something immediately about climate change and quit wasting time. Legislatively, our Natural Resources Committee will be moving forward with legislative packages to deal with the critical issue of climate change, provide adaptation and mitigation to that issue. In the Unites States, our public lands and coastal issues are 25 - 23 percent of the problem and they can be 23 percent of the solution. And, we need to incorporate the issue of vulnerability. We have to incorporate the issue of human rights. We have to incorporate the issues of the necessity for clean air, clean water, public health protections and there shouldn't be climate discrimination - there shouldn't be a misery index, where some people get to suffer more as a consequence of not every body doing their full part to deal with the issue of climate change. I look forward to it. The United States need to be, and is, committed in the form of the people that are here today, and millions of others. The vast majority of the American people support urgent action on climate change. That's the issue that we're following. That's the opinion that we need to have. And, I'm certainly glad that I'm here today to learn, listen, and at the same time, to be renewed for what happens next. What happens next is to deal with the issue of climate change with a great degree of urgency. Speaker Pelosi. Thank you Mr. Chair. As you can see from all the presentations - and you'll hear from some of our other Members during the question - the Q and A - we came here to say: we're still in it. But the fact is also, being in it means we're hear to listen and to learn, to recognize the challenges for the most vulnerable, including, as I mentioned earlier, the indigenous people. We heard from the scientists this morning - the scientific presentation - the challenge - the words that he used were the challenge of the climate crisis, the reality of taking action. And so, as we take action, we want to do so inclusively and working together to think entrepreneurially and in fresh new ways. Again listening and learning from each other.  And so with that I would like to, with the spirit of opportunity, opportunity, opportunity, give some of you the opportunity to ask a question. First, Jeannette Neumann of Bloomberg. Let me just tell you that one of the privileges of being the Speaker is when you get a difficult question, you assign it to somebody else. [Laughter] Q: Well I hope this isn't a difficult question. If I may, a question on U.S. politics, Speaker Pelosi. During the recess week, what did Democratic lawmakers from swing districts hear from their constituents regarding the impeachment proceedings? Speaker Pelosi. Well I appreciate your question. If you have another one, you may want to ask it, because we aren't here to talk about impeachment or the President of the United States. We're here to talk about - I have a rule of CODELs. When we travel abroad we don't talk about the President in a negative way, and we save that for home. But nonetheless, we're here to talk positively about our agenda to save the planet for future generations. And we in our Congress are doing many more things other than reviewing the possibility of impeaching a president. Our colleagues have talked about some of the initiatives. Right now we're talking about a Mexico-U.S.-Canada trade agreement. We're talking about lowering the cost of prescription drugs. We're talking about expanding and strengthening the Voting Rights Act. We're talking about an array of legislative - many of them within the committees of jurisdiction of our chairmen who are here. But that is only one - we are legislating. We are litigating. We are investigating. But - let's - we're focusing today on legislating. Thank you. Now we are going to hear from Rafael Canas of EFE. Oh, I skipped one. Q: Hello, I am Rafael Canas from the Spanish Newswire EFE. In his opening remarks this morning, President - Spanish Acting President Pedro Sanchez said that only a bunch of fanatics deny the evidence of global warming and the climate emergency. Would you apply this category of fanatic to someone in your country"" Could be politicians or corporate chiefs. Thank you. Speaker Pelosi. Well I think you're just going to have to ask President Sanchez who he was referring to in that comment. [Laughter] Does anyone want to comment on any of that"" No? Congresswoman Brownley. We don't talk about it. [Laughter] It is - one thing - I would say three words that describe how we address this: science, science and science - and maybe four, science again. So let's - if we can stick with the science, I think we can come up with some sane solutions to it all. Isla Binnie from Reuters? Don't hesitate at all to chime in my friends. Q: Thank you, yes. I wanted to ask if given the strong advocacy from some Democratic - many Democratic presidential candidates for a Green New Deal, what it is about that plan that's stopping you from embracing the idea"" Then, whether you could back any of the climate proposals from candidates like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and if overall you think a Green New Deal is necessary"" Thank you very much. Speaker Pelosi. Well as I said earlier, I was at the Earth Summit in 1992, so I've been working on this issue for a very, very long time. And when I was Speaker the first time, I established the Select Committee on Climate Crisis. We passed, under the leadership of our House -- Congressional Democrats, but also signed by President Bush - the greatest energy bill in the history of our country, the equivalent of taking millions of cars off the road, reducing emission standards by - emissions by raising the standards. So the idea of a very comprehensive strategy on this is very important to all of us. I salute the enthusiasm that it has engendered, but I do think that the idea of working together is very, very important. And I think there are many aspects of the Green New Deal that we have all been advocating for a long time. We do want, though, to have our friends in labor at the table - friends in the labor movement that is, at the table, and we want to have the private sector at the table and the rest, so that we can really produce results to reduce the emissions, because this is a generational and existential threat to humanity. So I salute what they are doing, but in terms of how we go forward - that's what Congresswoman Castor's Select Committee on Climate is doing and then will recommend to the legislative committees for legislative actions and perhaps many of those aspects. Now in terms of the two presidential candidates, I don't know what particular things - I don't follow every thing that they - you know - I don't know everything that they're referencing exactly. So I can't really say whether I support it, but it probably is something within the realm of what we've all been advocating for a long time. I'm going to defer to Congresswoman - the others, but before the Chairperson is up, I want to see if any of my colleagues have something to add on that. Congresswoman Castor. Well, I'll start by saying we embrace the ambition of the Green New Deal. What is happening now in the United States Congress is the hard work that is necessary to develop the policy proposal - the detailed policy proposals in the energy sector - how we decarbonize the energy sector, same for the transportation sector, agriculture, energy efficiency. Now, when you develop detailed policy proposals, you're going another layer deeper. Then, all of the legislative committees, over the coming months, will turn those policy proposals into concrete legislation. And isn't it - isn't it refreshing to have presidential candidates in the United States of America debating the fine points of climate action"" It's inspiring, and we intend to meet the challenge. Congressman Casten. Sean Casten, I'm a new freshman member. I spent 20 years in the energy industry before I got into this new line of work. I would submit to you that giving access to energy has been our greatest single success as a species and the hardest problem we've ever tackled. We would not sustain the population and the standard of living we all have in this room, without figuring out how to do that. Figuring out how to maintain that access to energy in a zero carbon way is an order of magnitude harder. And what has happened with the youth activism, what's happened with the discussion across the political spectrum about people saying this problem is so urgent that we cannot afford to get bogged down in the complexity - I accept the first part of that. We have to deal with the urgency, but it's a really hard and complicated problem. And I'm delighted we're talking about it, but it's going to be complicated, and it's going to take all of our collective work. Chairman Pallone. If I could, Nancy. I don't think there is anything inconsistent with what we're trying to achieve and the Green New Deal. If you listen - you know - to what the Green New Deal says - you know - it talks about 2030. It primarily talks about 2030 and the power sector. You mentioned a presidential candidate. I remember when Bernie Sanders, for example, talked about the Green New Deal and said, 'Well 2030 for the power sector, 2050 for everything else beyond the power sector.' And it's also consistent with what the Secretary General said today. He said that - he used the European Union, and he said that they're trying to achieve 45 percent in reduction of greenhouse gasses by the end of the next decade, 2030. But he said, 'We want - it'll take us till 2050 to get to carbon neutral,' which is the same thing as our 100 by '50 in the Energy and Commerce Committee's proposal. So none of this is inconsistent, and we have to dispel this notion that we're not incorporating the Green New Deal and a lot of the ideas that - of the people who are so enthusiastic about it. And I don't think you should in any way think that anything we're saying is inconsistent. I really don't. Speaker Pelosi. But I also just want to add that one of the things that - one of the many things that we have in common is this is - we're not about incrementalism. This is about being transformative, and that's what this conference is about as well. Being transformative in those solutions that we advance, because time is taking its toll on the planet. So we thank them for the enthusiasm and other enthusiasms that are out there as well - that have been out there for a long time and growing very impatient and rightfully so. Mr. Daniel Dombey please, from the Financial Times. Q: Speaker, if I could just tempt you just a little bit to talk about an international issue - Speaker Pelosi. Is this Daniel Dombey? Q: This is indeed Daniel Dombey. President Trump - Speaker Pelosi. I thought so. [Laughter] Q: I'm very glad you're so on the ball. President Trump announced today tariffs on Argentinian and Brazilian aluminum and steel. This is obviously an international issue. It's a trade issue. It's not just a domestic politics issue. Wondering if you have any thoughts about that in terms of trade tensions more generally and international cooperation? Speaker Pelosi. That's news to me. I did not realize President Trump had done that, so I don't know the context or the purpose of why he is doing that. But I do think that when were talking about trade, we have to talk about it in a way that - for example, China is a big issue for all of us on trade, and I think that - that the way we counter some of the violations of our own trade relationships - the violations of our trade relationship with China is to do so in a multilateral way. I don't know why the President did what he did this morning or what the justification was. Do any of you know? [Crosstalk] Members. No. Speaker Pelosi. You're breaking news for us here, but let's just say that globalization has its challenges. We all need to recognize how much leverage we would have if we worked together in meeting the challenges of those who do abuse our trade relationships, and I'll just have to see what his basis is for what he did. As I said earlier though, we are hoping to come near a conclusion on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. We still have some issues that relate to enforcement, because if you don't have enforcement, you just have a nice conversation and a list of nice things. But you do not have a fair deal for workers in any of the countries, and that's what we want, not just a good deal for American workers, but for all workers, so that everyone can thrive that has an impact on our economies, on migration, on so many - and international relations - and again puts a better face on globalization, which is inevitable as we know. Thank you all very much. I again want to thank Spain for its hospitality, Chile for being the intellectual resource in all this, as well as the United Nations, as we commented, the Secretary General. He showed a great vision for the future in terms of climate. He showed a great knowledge of the challenges we face and the need for action now. And he showed strategic thinking about how to get it all done. And again, we can't do it without working together - seeing the opportunity that is there for everyone. My colleagues, does anyone want to say anything? Members. We're still in. We're here. Speaker Pelosi. We're still in. Thank you all. \"

PIK Director Johan Rockstrom and colleagues from Future Earth and the Earth League today presented the ""10 New Insights in Climate Science"" report to UNFCCC's Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa at the meeting in the Spanish capital Madrid. ""The key insight from the latest climate science is that the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to 1.5 C is a planetary boundary we pass at our own peril, putting future generations at risk,"" says Johan Rockstrom, PIK director, co-chair of Future Earth and the Earth League and co-author of the report. ""Earth observations show that big systems with known tipping points are already now, at 1 C warming, on the move toward potentially irreversible change, such as accelerated melting of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, drying of rainforests, and thawing of Arctic permafrost,"" continues Prof Rockstrom. ""A planetary boundary we pass at our own peril"" 10 new insights into climate risks and solutions Despite increasing drivers of reduced emissions, such as growth in green energy, institutions divesting from fossil fuels, and some countries phasing out coal power, the fossil industry is still growing and global leaders aren't yet committing to the necessary emissions cuts. We are not on track to reach the Paris Agreement. 2. Climate change is faster and stronger than expected The pace of contemporary rise in greenhouse gas concentrations is unprecedented in climate history over the past 66 million years, and methane concentrations are now at a record high of 257 percent of pre-industrial levels. Observations show signs of continuing warming. A global temperature rise to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels could be reached already in the year 2030, instead of 2040 as is the mean projection of IPCC. Sea-level rise is accelerating and is now three times higher than the average for the 20th century. Relatively stable components of the earth system also show signs of accelerated degradation, such as Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which if destabilized, could lead to severe, abrupt ice loss from ice-sheet margins and would thereby critically accelerate sea-level rise. 3. Climate change leaves no mountain summit behind 4. Forests are under threat, with global consequences The world's forests are a major carbon dioxide sink, absorbing about a third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Yet human-driven forest fires have been reducing these sinks, and climate change globally amplifies wild forest fires. Increases in fires are observed in Western U.S. and Alaska, Canada, Russia, and Australia as a result of prolonged drought. Huge emissions have been observed from land changes in western Ethiopia and western tropical Africa. Loss of forests affects both the local and global climate. Fighting deforestation and encouraging reforestation, along with sustainable forest management and other natural climate solutions, are important and cost-effective options for reduced net emissions. 5. Weather extremes - a ""new normal"" in 2019 Climate change is forcing us to reconsider the notion of an extreme event. What was once considered unlikely or rare -- both in terms of the intensity and frequency -- is becoming part of a ""new normal."" Record-breaking extreme weather and climate events have continued to dominate the headlines in 2019, with the impact of such events going beyond mere record setting and environmental damage: the material and human costs are especially high. Increasingly, societies will have to adapt to compound events, which can amplify the risk of severe impacts significantly, and cascading events, which do not leave enough time for societies to recover before the next event happens. Persistent rainfall extremes and heatwaves, unusual weather patterns due to a changing jet stream in the northern hemisphere, as well as warmer and higher seas will all affect regions across the world in different ways. Ambitious mitigation can curb risks if we stay at 1.5 C warming, but regionally, dangerous levels will be reached. 6. Biodiversity - threatened guardian of earth's resilience Biodiversity on land, coral reefs, and fish populations will see losses between 14 and 99 percent at 1 to 2 C warming. At the same time, biodiversity is a key feature of stable ecosystems, providing - among many other services to humanity - carbon stocks and sinks and thereby guarding the earth system's resilience against the disruption from anthropogenic carbon emissions. Therefore, it is urgent to put a halt to ecosystem degradation. 7. Climate change threatens food security and the health of hundreds of millions Undernutrition will be the greatest health risk of climate change with declining agricultural productivity, particularly in drylands in Africa and high mountain regions of Asia and South America. In addition, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide will reduce the nutritional quality of most cereal crops. Climate change is already affecting food production by reducing agricultural yields, especially in the tropics, and will increase loss and damage throughout the food system. Global fish stocks are set to further decline with climate change, and is an additional pressure on already declining stocks of fish and shellfish, important sources of human dietary protein and nutrients. 8. Most vulnerable and poor hardest hit by climate change Failure to address and adapt to climate change will have disastrous consequences for hundreds of millions of people, mainly the very poorest, and will hinder development in developing countries. While all of us will be affected by climate change, the poor are more vulnerable to drought, flooding, high temperatures, and other natural disasters with low capacity to adapt. As the frequency of natural and climatic hazards increases, escaping poverty will be particularly difficult, even with progress on the SDGs. 9. Equity and equality pivotal to successful climate change mitigation and adaptation Social justice is an important factor for societal resilience in the face of climate change, vital for both local and global cooperation to facilitate mitigation and adaptation. High inequality has been identified as a contributing factor when resource depletion has driven civilizations to collapse in the past, and threatens the ability of our current civilization to survive climate change and other environmental changes. The success of climate policy also depends on social acceptance, with justice, fairness, and the equitable distribution of costs important for public support of policy and avoiding nationalist sentiments. 10. Time may have come for social tipping points on climate action Public opinion polls indicate that an increasing number of citizens in various countries are seriously concerned about climate change, and recent massive civil protests are getting close to the thresholds where we could expect ""tipping"" of some socio-economic systems. However, policy measures need to accompany behavioral change -- and deep and long-term transformations driven by a great diversity of actors are needed to meet the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. UN Sustainable Development Goals are threatened by climate change ""The more we learn about the changing climate, the more we understand the severity of the threats we face"", says Amy Luers, Executive Director of Future Earth. ""The pace and scale of climate changes underway threaten our ability to achieve many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We must prioritize immediate action: climate mitigation, particularly among the biggest emitters, and adaptation, particularly among the most vulnerable."" Future Earth is governed by the International Science Council (ISC), Belmont Forum of funding agencies, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations University (UNU), the World Meteorological Organization, and the Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA332","Griffith University Experts Wrap Up Key Climate Conference","December 20, 2019 Friday 7:15 AM  EST","Targeted News Service","Griffith University issued the following news: A team of Griffith delegates including climate, business and social scientists recently presented their findings and liaised with world leaders and organisations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Convention of Parties 25th meeting ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain. The contingent included Dr Johanna Nalau, ARC DECRA Fellow from the Cities Research Institute; Dr Rob Hales (Griffith Business School and Griffith Centre for Sustainable Enterprise); Dr Samid Suliman (School of Humanities, Language and Social Science and Griffith Centre for Social and Cultural Research); Dr Tim Cadman (Institute for Ethics, Governance and Law); and Virginie Young (who is assisting Griffith research projects). This is their joint report on the conference outcomes. Right Here, Right Now? Greta Thunberg's plenary address at COP25 and the 350 youth activists who stormed the COP25 If the status quo were to prevail and governments failed to ramp up ambition in order to limit global heating to less than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, then the world would be on track for a world that is 3.2 degrees warmer. At the outset of COP25 , the mood was one of hope for a positive conclusion to the contentious negotiations over the elements of the Paris Agreement Rule Book that were held over from COP24 in Katowice, Poland. If countries could agree on the rules of the agreement, then ambitious targets were more likely. But what transpired was not what Greta, the scientists or concerned citizens wanted. Several countries - including Australia - failed to heed the call for greater ambition and action, casting doubt on the potential of multilateral cooperation on this pressing global issue. Market failure? As reported in mainstream media, a global carbon market was not established as negotiations failed to produce agreement on the details of Article 6 in the Paris Rule Book. The role of earth systems (and biodiversity) in sequestering carbon from the atmosphere were not included in the rules around Article 6. It was important that the role of existing earth biodiverse systems be considered in Article 6. Not including existing biodiverse earth systems puts these systems at high risk as population grows, economies try to keep growing, and climate change devastates the very earth systems that help reduce global heating. Few people at COP25 understood the gravity of not including biodiversity in Article 6. There was also no agreement on Loss and Damage mechanisms, and the negotiations dragged on so late that most of the vulnerable country representatives had to leave for home while some of the rich countries held behind-the-door discussions between themselves on Article 6. This speaks volumes about the absence of procedural justice in the process, a fact that most developing countries are very vocal about given that the UNFCCC is supposed to be based on consensus and equal participation. Griffith contribution During the COP25 , Griffith academics actively contributed to the process by providing advice to Parties (governments) and non-Parties (such as non-governmental organisations) on what to include in the negotiating text. Dr Tim Cadman held briefings with both Developing Country Parties and civil society groups on the governance arrangements necessary to ensure the social and ecological integrity of the mechanisms proposed under Article 6. Dr Johanna Nalau participated in the Nairobi Work Program (NWP) Focal Point Forum on 6th December as an expert and rapporteur on the role that innovation, technology and capacity building play in closing the knowledge gaps on climate adaptation. This year's NWP focused on oceans and coasts, and gave the opportunity for in-depth discussions between scientists, NGOs, government negotiators and the private sector in how to advance a more robust evidence-base for climate adaptation. The outcomes of the NWP Forum will be distributed via an expert report and will be a focus of further discussions in Bonn, June 2020, at the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). Griffith University is a partner to NWP, and this partnership enables our scientists to directly engage with the UNFCCC processes on climate adaptation. Dr Nalau also facilitated and led sessions at the Resilience Lab, which is a new UNFCCC inter-agency initiative in fostering discussions around foresight and the role of frontier technologies in driving and scaling up innovation that can enable faster change and contribute to both climate adaptation and development outcomes on the ground. The sessions focused on eight pathways ( HYPERLINK http://www.resiliencefrontiers.org www.resiliencefrontiers.org Amid this line-up, Dr Rob Hales shared his insights on the role that transformative finance can contribute positively in how we scale up climate action. Dr Samid Suliman was also an active participant also in many discussions at the Resilience Lab, specifically in the pathway on transboundary management. Going forward, Dr Nalau will continue to facilitate this engagement with the UNFCCC Secretariat as part of her on-going DECRA project that looks at the range of global climate adaptation principles and their usefulness for climate adaptation policy and decision-making. Dr Nalau also moderated an event on Women in Science and Leadership at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Pavilion where the panel of IPCC Scientists gathered to discuss some of the challenges and opportunities that women often face in developing careers in science and participating in global assessments. Dr Rob Hales also participated in the panel and discussed the unconscious biases that often prevent women from succeeding in organisations. The panelists engaged in a vibrant discussion on personal experiences of forging a career in this space, and the event provided an opportunity for frank and honest discussions around career development and leadership journeys. Success amid failure While the negotiators failed to reach agreement on key issues, good news from other parts of the COP reminds us that there is a lot of important work being done outside the negotiation sessions. A major announcement at COP25 was the EU's Green Deal which is an ambitious plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 with the 5% of GDP being invested into industry, agriculture and innovation each year. An important lesson for Australia is that no new taxes will be made to fund the investments. Also, carbon taxes on high emissions imported goods and services is part of the plan. This is a great example of what is possible, and all countries should take heed. The Green Deal has the support of Jeffery Sachs, a UN economic advisor and harsh critic of countries that lack ambition to tackle climate change. The Green Deal and China's plan to implement an emission trading scheme in 2020 means that carbon markets are expanding despite the failure of Article 6 at COP25 . Greta Thunberg - Right Here, Right Now Earlier this year, pop culture and the global youth climate movement collided when legendary DJ Fat Boy Slim mixed Greta Thunberg's speech at the 2019 UN Climate Summit into his classic dance track Right Here, Right Now during a live gig. Greta's remixed refrain summed up the mood at COP25 : the world must act right here and right now to listen to the science, to mobilise extant strategies to reduce emissions, and bring about systemic change to reduce climate risks and harms for the most vulnerable. While COP25 failed to deliver decisive global collective action to limit global heating to under 1.5 degrees, it is clear that COP26 in Glasgow will be critical. If ambitious national targets and strategies are not set then it will be nigh impossible to achieve the 1.5 degree goal set out in the Paris Agreement. There is an important role for academic researchers leading up to next year's negotiations. This role is to develop and disseminate new knowledge to inform new strategies to inform and inspire climate action by all countries (including Australia). Building on their work in Madrid, Griffith researchers are ready to play their part in this effort leading up to COP26 in Glasgow and beyond.

President Donald Trump mocked Thunberg in a tweet Monday night. Tribune News Service Buy Photos By Alexa D\'edaz Los Angeles Times WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to mock 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg after her fiery speech blasting world leaders for their inaction at the United Nations Climate Action Summit. The president shared a video of Thunberg delivering a blunt and emotional speech alongside other youth environmental activists who castigated officials for not doing enough to prevent a catastrophic heating of the planet. ""People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,"" Thunberg said as tears filled her eyes and her voice shook with frustration. ""How dare you."" ""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"" Trump tweeted sarcastically in response. Thunberg, whose appearance at the summit came after a worldwide strike largely inspired by her activism, has become a high-profile figure in the youth-led fight against climate change since she protested Swedish parliament over a lack of climate action and crossed the Atlantic to the U.S. on a zero-emissions sailboat to attend the U.N. meeting. The tweet followed Trump's brief and unexpected 15-minute appearance Monday at the daylong climate summit, where leaders from more than 60 countries presented plans to step up emissions reductions. He did not speak but listened to remarks from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Summit organizers had hoped the summit would help build momentum to pressure national leaders indifferent to climate change, including those from the United States, Brazil and Australia - world powers who were noticeably absent from the summit stage. Thunberg's speech comes amid a weeklong youth-led campaign surrounding the U.N. summit in New York that will be capped by another global strike on Friday. ""You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you,"" Thunberg said in her speech Monday, ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words."" She added: ""If you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this."" Like what you're reading? Support independent, award-winning college journalism on this site. Donate here. \"

The delegation will also include other officials from the Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. On November 4, 2019, the United States deposited with the United Nations its notification of withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Per the terms of the Paris Agreement, the United States will remain party to the Agreement until November 4, 2020. The United States will continue to participate in ongoing climate change negotiations and meetings-such as COP25 -to ensure a level playing field that protects U.S. interests. The United States is a world leader in protecting the environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while growing its economy. U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent from 2005-2017, even as our economy grew over 19 percent. This success is due largely to the development and deployment of innovative energy technologies, including nuclear, shale gas, transformational coal technologies, renewables, battery storage, and enhancing energy efficiency. Further, the United States works with global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters. The United States will continue to research, innovate, and grow the economy while reducing emissions and extending a helping hand to friends and partners around the globe.

The negotiations - COP25 - marked the longest in history. Yet despite progress on many agenda items - including gender; oceans; land; loss and damages; adaptation; and response measures - governments failed to match the ambitions of business and other stakeholders regarding the operationalisation of ""Article 6"" of the Paris Agreement, a crucial missing element of the so-called ""Paris Rulebook"" agreed at COP24 in Katowice, Poland a year ago. Majda Dabaghi, ICC's Director of Inclusive and Green Growth said: ""We are deeply disappointed that despite tremendous efforts, negotiators were unable to reach consensus on international market cooperation - vital to enhanced ambition and reaching the net zero emissions target of the Paris Agreement."" Finalising the Paris Rulebook and enhancing ambition had been the focus of the COP25 climate conference. As UNFCCC Focal Point for Business and Industry, ICC was in Madrid to mobilise business engagement in the climate process, advocating for enhanced ambition and robust Article 6 mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and to avoid double counting and most importantly, that uphold environmental integrity. Despite lack of decision on Article 6, many governments were able to commit to cooperative approaches through their own respective partnerships that adhere to the key principles of the Paris Agreement. During the conference, 84 countries in total signed up to the Climate Ambition Alliance ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/climate-ambition-alliance-nations-renew-their-push-to-upscale-action-by-2020-and-achieve-net-zero%5d https://unfccc.int/news/climate-ambition-alliance-nations-renew-their-push-to-upscale-action-by-2020-and-achieve-net-zero%5d ,), signaling intention to enhance climate ambition. In addition, non-government actors - including 786 businesses and 16 investors, and the 2,100 signatories to the Chambers Climate Coalition - all committed to reaching net zero emissions by no later than 2050. ICC Secretary General, John W.H. Denton AO said: ""Today's result is extremely disappointing, but we are nevertheless encouraged by the commitments of many governments to raise ambition and ensure advances are made. This includes progress on market mechanisms. There is much work left to do to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and ICC will put its full support behind mobilising its network of 45 million businesses to make climate action everyone's business in the lead up to COP26 and support the uptake of ICC's Sustainable Finance Principles."" ICC Chair Paul Polman called for stakeholders to ""dial up the heat"" to ensure government ambition aligns with that of business and others. Describing the result as frustrating on social media, Mr Polman said: ""We cannot stop"". COP26 will take place in Glasgow in November 2020, led by COP26 President Claire O'Neill. Ahead of COP26, countries will be expected to submit their nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to ensure that we are on track to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The actor who played Han Solo and Indiana Jones was a big draw to the U.S. Climate Action Center yesterday, where he supported the America's Pledge report on state, city and private-sector action to combat climate change. The applause was almost on par with those that greeted former Vice President Al Gore when he spoke from the same stage the night before. ""Like many of you here today, I have felt despair for the state of the world. For our future,"" said Ford. He didn't mention President Trump by name, only his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. ""What we need now is the courage to act,"" said the star, who spent his early days in Hollywood hijacking Nazi planes and blowing up Death Stars. ""In 2017, my country's federal government demonstrated a lack of courage, threatening to pull out of the Paris Agreement,"" Ford said. ""And if we don't elect new leadership, they're going to continue to do that."" The Trump administration formally began the Paris withdrawal process last month, and the U.S. will stand virtually alone outside the deal on the day after next year's presidential election. But that might be short-lived. All Democrats currently running for president favor returning to the pact. Countries gathered in the Spanish capital of Madrid this week have generally avoided talking about Trump or the withdrawal. The focus instead has been on the last few pieces of the Paris rulebook -- especially rules that will govern how carbon trading might happen under the 2015 climate deal. ""I'm very much aware of what the federal administration is doing in the United States,"" said Frans Timmermans, the Dutch official charged with delivering the European Union's Green Deal, at a press conference Monday afternoon. ""I'm also very much aware of what the states are doing, the cities are doing, what large parts of the American economy is doing. And there is almost a consensus that this is an issue that needs to be tackled and can only be tackled on a global level."" Participants sometimes offered veiled references to Trump. Timmermans said he had ""very little patience with climate deniers,"" while Laurence Tubiana, a former French official and key architect of the Paris Agreement, raised Trump's pending withdrawal when answering a Chinese journalist's question about China's role in Paris implementation. ""We are all really shocked by the decision of the U.S. president. Shock is really the word,"" said Tubiana, who is now director of the European Climate Foundation. ""You look at the global situation, you look even at the U.S. situation, and you have the federal government ignoring that, ignoring science. China is not ignoring science."" U.S. presence The Trump administration did not send any political appointees to the Conference of the Parties, or COP, this year. Instead, the U.S. is officially represented by a small cadre of diplomats and technical experts, including career diplomat Marcia Bernicat, who will speak on behalf of the U.S. during today's high-level session. Bernicat told reporters yesterday that the U.S. would attend the COP next year in Glasgow, Scotland, even though it will be an observer to the Paris Agreement and not a party. That non-party status could prove expensive to U.S. industries that do business in the European Union. The new president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has signaled that the coming Green Deal for Europe could include border adjustments or taxes on carbon-intensive products entering the E.U. from countries that lack similar climate safeguards. Asked about the possible future introduction of carbon tariffs, Timmermans told reporters Monday that they were a possibility. ""I hope then there will be no need for such a measure, but if it is necessary, we will not hesitate to take it,"" he said. The State Department permitted reporters to quote Bernicat saying that policy ""would be of great concern to us."" The U.S. delegation here is actively engaged in shaping Paris Agreement rules despite the coming withdrawal. For example, it's arguing for transparency and good accounting as part of Article 6, the section of the climate pact that deals with global carbon markets. ""The rules set in the Paris Agreement guidance will impact U.S. companies operating internationally,"" a senior U.S. official told reporters yesterday. But Mohamed Nasr, top environment official in Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the head of the African Group of Negotiators at the COP, said the world shouldn't hang its hopes on America returning to the agreement. ""This is not a new process,"" he said. ""If you looked at the history of the engagement of some countries, then you would understand that it's history repeating itself."" He pointed to the U.S. refusal to join the Kyoto Protocol after Gore helped negotiate it in the 1990s. ""We cannot just build hopes based on something that is not under our control. We should build a system that allows everybody to be a part of and with the participation of everyone,"" Nasr said. \"

As the most vulnerable continue to suffer from the climate emergency's impacts, such as ongoing heat waves in Europe and record-breaking cyclones in Africa and Asia, government officials leave Bonn with moderate progress in negotiation on various issues. However, they now must urgently confront the wide gap between current commitments to climate action and the harsh reality of an accelerating climate crisis. Sven Harmeling, CARE's Global Policy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience: ""In the wake of the UN Climate Action Summit and COP25 , outcries sound from the public demanding climate justice amidst fears of catastrophe and a climate apartheid future. While more than 20 countries announced in Bonn to improve their national climate plans, now, more than ever, the big emitters must follow their lead. We continue to reiterate the same message to decision makers: heed our warning before it's too late. Government leaders must now step up and provide the emergency action required instead of making empty promises."" Discussions on supporting efforts to address loss and damage, particularly in developing countries, have progressed in Bonn in preparation for a revision of the UN support scheme for vulnerable countries by COP25 (December, Chile). However, developed countries continue to resist demands by poor countries to substantially scale-up finance to address climate impacts, of which they have been the primary perpetrators. CARE urges developed countries to turn to a more constructive mode in preparation for COP25 and side with the most vulnerable. CARE also welcomes moderate progress on agricultural issues, and calls on leaders to maintain the momentum to fight climate change and gender equality through the adoption of a new gender action plan at COP25 . Obed Koringo, CARE's representative to the climate summit preparatory meeting: ""After the Bonn session, we call on countries to champion necessary responses to the demands by the UN Secretary General for the upcoming UN Climate Action Summit. Heated debate about the IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 C is unacceptable. Ongoing dispute on the irrefutable impacts of climate change must end now. In the coming months, we must see significant, urgent national action to halve emissions globally by 2030, and we need at least a doubling of the financial pledges made by developed countries to the Green Climate Fund.""

Speakers called for a united front to tackle the challenges of climate change in Africa. In the opening statement for Africa Day on Tuesday, Yasmin Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environmental Affairs, on behalf of the African Union, said: ""We have, and will continue to engage and to seek landing grounds on the outstanding issues. But we must flag our concern at the apparent reluctance by our interlocutors to engage on issues of priority to developing countries, as evidenced by the large number of such issues which have simply been pushed from session to session without any progress."" Africa contributes the least to global warming emissions yet is the continent most vulnerable to climate change, as witnessed by devastating natural disasters recently. Africa Day has been held at the conference every year since COP 17 in 2011 to rally support for the continent's cause. ""The climate disaster issues confronting the continent demand a predictable and unified response,"" said UN ASG Mohamed Beavogui, Director General of African Risk Capacity, an agency of the African Union that helps governments respond to natural disasters. ""Africa needs to move towards market-based innovative financing models to achieve a strong, united, resilient and globally influential continent. The future of Africa depends on solidarity."" Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said the ECA would support African countries to revise their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to attract private sector investments in clean energy. ""The lack of concerted and meaningful global ambition and action to tackle climate change poses an existential threat to African populations,"" Songwe said. The Paris Agreement is the guiding force of current climate negotiations. It calls on nations to curb temperature increases at 2 C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain rises within 1.5 C. The next step is to implement NDCs, which set out national targets under the Paris Agreement. While African countries outlined bold aspirations to build climate resilient and low-carbon economies in their NDCs, the continent's position is that it should not be treated the same as developed nations as its carbon emissions constitute a fraction of the world's big economies. ""The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) remains committed to partnering with other institutions in providing the requisite support to AU member states in reviewing and updating their NDCs,"" said Estherine Fotabong, Director of Programmes at AUDA-NEPAD. Barbara Creecy, South Africa's Environment Minister and current chair of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, said the Africa Day event should come up with new ideas to enhance the implementation of NDCs in Africa. Africa is already responding positively to the challenge of climate change, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, citing huge investment interest in renewables at the Bank's Africa Investment Forum in Johannesburg. ""Clearly, we are a continent that has what it takes to create the Africa that we want to see happen. I believe what has been the missing link is the ability to brand right and to act on the market signals,"" Nyong said. ""We continue to present Africa as a vulnerable case and not as a business case with opportunities. In fact, where we have attempted the latter, the results have been spot-on."" Chief Fortune Charumbira, Vice President of the Pan-African Parliament, said robust climate legislation was key. ""The world's response to the challenge has shown that legislation is imperative to cement efforts employed by various stakeholders; from the Paris Agreement to Nationally Determined Contributions,"" he said. Amb. Josefa Sacko, Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture at the African Union Commission, said climate change affected sectors key to Africa's socio-economic development, such as agriculture, livestock and fisheries, energy, biodiversity and tourism. She called on African countries to take stock of the Paris Agreement, and its implementation around finance capacity building and technology.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA339","Danielle Endres Some people are paying attention to climate change","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","The Salt Lake Tribune","I recently returned to Salt Lake City from Madrid, where I was an observer at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\' s (UNFCCC) 25th Conference of Parties, also known as COP25 . Yet, as I witnessed a surge of youth-led activism in response to the COP25 negotiations in Madrid, I was alarmed and disheartened to see so little news coverage of the COP25 back home. Yes, there were a few stories that came across my feed, including from The Salt Lake Tribune, but given what I was hearing and observing at the COP, I would have expected to see much more coverage of the negotiations, the alarming scientific evidence presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the pressing need for the largest emitters, including the U.S., to take swift and decisive measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions if we have any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. The UN\' s Emissions Gap Report tells us that we are nowhere near being on track to limit warming. Indeed, the report shows that global emissions continue to rise, that status quo commitments under the Paris Agreement would lead to a 3.2 degree warming, and that to meet the 1.5 degree target requires a 7.6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions every year for the next decade. I am reminded of the old adage,  If you are not outraged, you are not paying attention. One thing that became very clear while I was in Madrid is that there are people paying attention. In addition to the climate march in Madrid that drew an estimated 500,000 people calling for real government action on climate change, nearly every day inside the hallways of the COP25 convention activists, air protectors, and concerned youth staged events that called attention to the impending impacts of the continued climate crisis. Greta Thunberg, recently named Time Magazine\' s person of the year, implored government leaders to radically reduce our emissions. Indigenous people called for an end to CO2 colonialism. Young people demanded that we take action to protect future generations. We cannot ignore these voices, and we cannot ignore the climate emergency. Despite the best efforts of cities, states, and other sub-national government\' s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (including Salt Lake City\' s commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2030), addressing the climate emergency requires national and international efforts. It requires working within the UNFCC framework to strengthen the Paris Agreement, and calling on the largest emitters to act with urgency and resolve. Danielle Endres is a professor at the University of Utah, specializing in science and environmental communication research, who advocates for action on climate change, air pollution, and energy democracy in her free time. \"

Opinions on how well Europeans view their nations, which are some of history's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, are addressing climate change range from highs in HYPERLINK Finland to lows in \~ HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/hungary Hungary and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/poland Poland , according to the data. The survey finds high agreement overall and among generations that the effects of climate change are real, but substantial variability exists when respondents are asked if they thought their own national governments were addressing the issue. Nordic countries perceived their governments to be doing particularly well, according to Best Countries data. Over 80% of respondents from Finland say their government is working to address the effects of climate change. HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/denmark Denmark , \~ HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/sweden Sweden and \~ HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/norway Norway also receive high marks, with Sweden coming in the lowest at 65%.

India and HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/china China are among the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gas, and environmental groups accused them of stalling on commitments at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , in December. If countries with big economies such as India and China can't commit to meaningful goals soon, scientists fear that the world won't be able to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018 said that the world has 12 years to significantly change its ways to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Sweden, the homeland of 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, is a leader in the climate movement, says Christine Ingebritsen, the chairperson of the European studies program at the University of Washington. And although the countries may seem cozy with one another, ""they are definitely competitive,"" she says. ""It's the hottest issue, with no pun intended."" ""They all believe in the same things, but they have different ways of getting there, in part because they're different political economies,"" says Ingebritsen, the author of ""Scandinavia in World Politics."" Denmark and Finland have lofty climate goals, according to Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe. Denmark last year HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-01-07/denmarks-aggressive-new-climate-law-blazes-path-for-developed-countries adopted a law to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030 , which is stronger than the European Union's overall target of a 40% reduction by 2030. ""That's extremely ambitious,"" Trio says. Finland wants to be carbon neutral by 2035. Trio says this aim is more of a stretch than Denmark's goal. Experts say that these kinds of commitments could increase the chances other big polluters, like China, take action on their emissions. Still, the European Union is likely to miss its own 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target, according to a European Environment Agency HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-12-04/report-eu-likely-to-miss-greenhouse-gas-reduction-target report published last month. The group of 28 member states will miss its 40% reduction target by roughly 10%, it found. The group's climate progress has slowed in areas like greenhouse gas reductions, industrial emission decreases, lessening waste generation, increasing energy efficiency as well as renewable energy. But support for more action is there. According to a 2019 HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/clima/citizens/support_en survey by the European Commission, 93% of Europeans see climate change as a serious problem. Given the high acknowledgment of climate change as an issue, ""the fact that governments aren't yet ready to achieve the targets ... is not a good sign,"" Trio says. [ SEE: HYPERLINK https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/best-international-influence Countries with the Most International Influence ] Fewer than 45% of Best Countries survey respondents in Poland and Italy thought their governments were adequately addressing the effects of climate change. Coal powers about 80% of Poland's electricity. The Polish government is reluctant to act on climate goals because of its link to fossil fuels, Trio says. Last month, 27 members of the European Union agreed to a ""European Green Deal,"" which would require countries to reach carbon neutrality in 2050, but Poland opposed the plan. ""Poland will be reaching climate neutrality at its own pace,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu/eu-leaves-poland-out-of-2050-climate-deal-after-standoff-idUSKBN1YG01I told reporters at the time.

To not take part in the agreement is ""not a smart position from the Polish government,"" Trio says. Italy, on the other hand, is one of the only major European countries to lack a national plan for climate adaptation, despite facing rising sea levels and sinking land.

"COP25","USA","COP25_USA341","MADRID: What's at stake for COP25","December 2, 2019 Monday","ClimateWire","The United Nations' climate talks kick off today in Madrid under something of a cloud. Two global organizations released dire warnings last week that greenhouse gases are rising with no end in sight. In spite of that, the world's largest historic emitter, the United States, is leaving the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether a climate pact that relies on voluntary national commitments -- as the deal of nearly 200 countries reached outside Paris in 2015 is designed to do -- can deliver the needed results. The next moment of truth comes next year in Glasgow, when countries are asked to strengthen the pledges -- known in Paris parlance as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs. If enough countries step forward to increase their commitment in a way that begins to close the gap on the Paris goal of keeping warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, that will boost confidence in the agreement, experts say. If not, faith in the deal will falter. ""Next year really is a critical test for what countries are prepared to do to put the world on a trajectory to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" said David Waskow, director of the international climate program at the World Resources Institute. Madrid ""in many respects can be seen as a marker on that path, as a steppingstone to what needs to be achieved next year,"" he added. Here's what's at stake for the next two weeks in Madrid. The rules for carbon trading Last year's round of U.N. climate talks in Katowice, Poland, closed negotiations on most aspects of how the pact will operate -- a set of procedures known as the Paris rulebook. But talks stumbled on one issue -- how international carbon trading markets should operate to make emission reductions less expensive under the deal without undermining their integrity. This year's talks will center on two issues: whether carbon credits can be counted effectively toward two countries' NDCs at the same time and whether projects undertaken before 2020 can be counted toward Paris -- which effectively begins next year. Brazil took the lead last year in insisting that countries that, like it, produce carbon offsets should be allowed to sell those to foreign buyers while still counting those reductions toward their own NDCs. The South American giant also wants projects it undertook under the Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM, of the Kyoto Protocol to retain their value under Paris even though the protocol will effectively end this year. The Chilean presidency of this year's conference of the parties, or COP, wants to make progress toward resolving the issues. But environmentalists warned of the risk of agreeing to a set of rules that creates loopholes that would allow corporations and companies to claim reductions they're not making. ""Obviously, having bad rules in place could be disastrous in terms of environmental integrity by allowing a lot of non-additional transactions into the market and letting countries off the hook to do as much as they need to do to meet their Paris commitments,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Meyer noted that if negotiators don't finish work on what is known as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, countries may go ahead and link their trading on an ad hoc basis. ""It would be sort of a Wild West scenario where it's left up to each country or group of countries how they're going to proceed,"" he said. This is the last major thing the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will ever negotiate after a quarter-century of wrangling over responsibility and finance, commas and clauses. When Article 6 closes, attention turns to Paris implementation. Ambition This September's U.N. leader summit in New York City failed to produce a quorum of countries promising new NDCs next year in time for Glasgow. Sixty-eight countries have signaled that they plan to strengthen their commitments by then -- including 33 small island states and 20 African countries. But they collectively account for about 8% of the world's emissions. The United States is unlikely to have an NDC at all after next year, and big emitters like China, India and the European Union have not made commitments. ""Obviously, the climate summit was disappointing in terms of commitments from the [Group of 20 countries],"" said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. ""One of the great uncertainties is will they, in the coming months, come forward with a more ambitious NDC."" Ahead of Paris, the Obama administration worked with China to secure that country's first firm pledge to stop growing emissions by 2030. Climate advocates hope China will promise an earlier peak by next year, but the U.S. retreat and a slowing of Chinese economic growth have thrown that optimism into doubt. The E.U. could play the same role next year the U.S. did under President Obama, reaching out to both China and India to help deliver action. But the E.U. has yet to make firm plans to ratchet up its own 2030 commitment to Paris. ""What we desperately need is Europe to fairly quickly come forward with the political capacity to have the kinds of conversations with China so that we'll achieve what President Obama achieved six years ago,"" Steer said. The stakes are high. ""If after our first run through the ratchet mechanism we can't get significantly closer to our temperature goals, then I think it's an alarm for the entire world to think about whether we're setting ourselves up for success,"" said Elan Strait, director of U.S. climate campaigns for the World Wildlife Fund. ""I think it's a big deal."" Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage Madrid also will play host to renewed debate over how people harmed or displaced by climate change should be compensated. Six years ago, in Warsaw, the UNFCCC launched a mechanism to begin looking at this issue, known as loss and damage. There wasn't a guarantee of additional finance to pay those who are dispossessed by more frequent hurricanes or driven from their homes by rising seas. But now that the Paris rulebook is almost complete, vulnerable countries want to turn the world's attention to the plight of those who will be adversely affected by climate change that is no longer avoidable. The developed world, as a whole, committed in Paris to deliver at least $100 billion a year for adaptation and mitigation beginning next year, and parties in Madrid will take stock of progress toward that goal. But small islands, nations in the developing world and others want assurances that there will be additional help for those facing irreversible damages from warming. That issue is known as loss and damage, and vulnerable countries see it as separate from adaptation and mitigation and deserving of distinct, additional finance. ""The U.S. position has been that addressing loss and damage is a form of adaptation and therefore covered by adaptation,"" said Strait, who was part of the U.S. State Department negotiating team in Paris. ""I don't think that was a position that was shared by the rest of the world."" U.S. out The U.S. will send a skeleton crew of diplomats and technical experts to Madrid to participate in the Article 6 discussions and other business. No political appointees are expected to attend (Climatewire, Nov. 25). Observers say the shrinking U.S. presence tracks with Washington's plans to leave Paris on Nov. 4 of next year -- one day after the U.S. elections. Keith Krach, the State Department undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, isn't expected to make the trip. But he told reporters at a briefing earlier this month that the world still saw the U.S. as a leader on climate change. ""I think the best form of leadership is leadership by example,"" he said, touting U.S. greenhouse gas reductions since 2005. Most analyses show U.S. emissions rebounding somewhat in 2018. ""We lead the world in terms of developing technology for efficiency and implementing it,"" Krach continued. While the Trump administration is not expected to send political appointees to the talks, House and Senate Democrats will attend for the first time since the Paris summit four years ago. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is leading the delegation, which also includes Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), and 12 other House members. They will hold a press appearance at the Madrid conference venue this afternoon, where they're expected to condemn President Trump's plans to withdraw from the accord. \"
"COP25","USA","COP25_USA342","INTERNATIONAL: What it means to have a year without climate diplomacy","April 7, 2020 Tuesday","ClimateWire","The two most important locations for international climate diplomacy -- this year and last -- have both been turned into field hospitals. In Glasgow, it's the giant Scottish Event Campus that's now lined with beds. Until last week that venue was set to host the United Nations annual climate talks in November; the new coronavirus has forced a delay of the conference, known as COP 26, until 2021. In Madrid, it's the airport-sized IFEMA fairground that now looks more like a scene from 1918 Spanish flu than the site of last year's COP 25 , which drew over 26,000 people with a carnival-like atmosphere that included Harrison Ford and Greta Thunberg. Just like everyone else, climate diplomats have replaced physical gatherings with online video meetings. But, as you've probably discovered firsthand, working from home is not the same. There are more distractions. Things move more slowly, even by the slow standards of climate diplomacy. And, as it turns out, human touch counts. Preliminary climate meetings such as the one initially scheduled in Bonn in June -- now postponed to October -- are essential for technocrats to start drafting agreements ahead of the year-end COP. In climate diplomacy, individual personalities really do make a difference. Unlike smaller gatherings such as the G-20, the talks that go into COP meetings focus on charismatic, talented diplomats from smaller countries. Representatives from the Marshall Islands or Costa Rica can turn the tables. Friendships forged over many years of negotiations have sometimes allowed opposing nations to find middle ground. Physical meeting spaces matter, too. The end of a lease for the venue of climate talks has sometimes been a more compelling argument for countries to sign deals than elaborate scientific research or political reasoning. Veteran diplomats have fond memories of how the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was signed while construction workers tore down walls in preparation for a runway show set for the following day. COP 25 in Madrid went nearly two days into overtime, so hopes had run high for a quick agreement at COP 26 because Elton John had been set to play that same arena in Glasgow a few days later. At first sight, of course, postponing COP 26 looks like bad news for the climate. Countries had been expected to submit more ambitious goals for the first time since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. Teenagers that mobilized millions in climate marches across the world last year would weigh heavily on talks that have traditionally been led by experienced bureaucrats. Newly formed citizen assemblies would give the wider population a chance to shape the debate. Some worry that the sense of urgency and the momentum building for many months around climate action will now disappear as the world deals with the worst public-health crisis in more than a generation. That's a real risk. But it's also true that the failure of COP25 in Madrid last December has not really been a debacle for the global climate movement. In subsequent months, large forces in the private sector such as BP and BlackRock Inc. made huge green pledges. Even billionaires at Davos turned climate change into the top issue this year. The debate over global climate action remains very much alive in the middle of this pandemic, as demonstrated by the dozens of essays published by academics and think tanks over the past few weeks calling for a green coronavirus recovery. ""The response to the COVID-19 pandemic is showing that the nations of the world can come together to tackle global challenges, and that the policy landscape can shift quickly when there is sufficient political will,"" said Alden Meyer, president at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He's seen what worldwide cooperation looks like from the inside, having witnessed every U.N. climate negotiation since Kyoto. BlackRock manages $7 trillion in assets, and its chairman, Larry Fink, shook the finance establishment in January when he called for a ""fundamental reshaping of finance."" Fink warned that climate change will have a profound impact on the global economic system. Last month he used his first letter to shareholders after the pandemic was declared to strengthen that point. ""The pandemic we're experiencing now highlights the fragility of the globalized world and the value of sustainable portfolios,"" Fink wrote. ""When we emerge from this crisis, and investors rebalance portfolios, we have an opportunity to accelerate into a more sustainable world."" By the time the next big U.N. climate conference finally arrives in Glasgow, after the field hospital is gone, perhaps we'll be able to see signs of that acceleration. -- Laura Millan Lombrana, Bloomberg \"

HYPERLINK https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&utm_medium=ingest Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Almost a year ago, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered an impassioned speech at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland. Her remarks HYPERLINK https://www.insider.com/greta-thunberg-activists-climate-change-who-are-they-2019-9 caught the attention Villase\'f1or had just visited family in northern California, and the trip coincided with the deadliest blaze in the state's history: the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed at least 85 people. She'd stayed in a town about two hours away from the flames, and said the smoke caused her asthma to flare up.\~ ""I was sick,"" Villase\'f1or told Business Insider, adding that she donned a face mask and placed wet towels in the crevices of windows and doors at her family's home. ""So I started to really research wildfires and I saw the connection between them and climate change.""\~ When she came across a video of Thunberg's COP24 speech, Villase\'f1or said, she decided that she could help prevent a future climate-related disaster by joining Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement. The initiative encourages students to skip school to demand action on climate change from their governments, and it has swelled to encompass thousands of student activists like Villase\'f1or.\~ She now sits outside the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan on Fridays. Each time, Villase\'f1or brings a sign that reads ""COP24 Failed Us,"" a reference to the fact that global emissions have continued to rise since that conference in December 2018. This week marked the one-year anniversary of her strike; she goes rain or shine and even sat outside the UN during a polar vertex.\~\~ ""When Greta started striking, it gave permission to other students all around the world to go on protest as well,"" Villase\'f1or said. ""She speaks with such authenticity that it really resonates with other young people."" EuropaNewswire/Gado/Getty Images But joining Thunberg's movement also comes with challenges: namely, criticism from adults. Villase\'f1or said she has been harassed on social media and even received death threats from climate-change deniers. But that hasn't stopped her from protesting.\~ Fridays at the United Nations\~ In December 2018, Villase\'f1or told her parents that she planned to skip seventh grade every Friday to go on strike.\~ ""I had never gone to a protest before. I'd never been involved in any organizational space,"" she said. ""At first it was like, is this really going to make a difference?"" Sarah Blesener/The Washington Post/Getty Images Her parents gave their consent, she said, but her friends were confused. ""At first when I started striking, they didn't really understand why it was important or why I was doing it,"" she said. ""It was my job to educate them."" By February, Villase\'f1or told the Washington Post that she was HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-a-7th-graders-strike-against-climate-change-exploded-into-a-movement/2019/02/15/e20868e2-2fb4-11e9-86ab-5d02109aeb01_story.html transferring to a private school Teen climate strikers have catapulted to fame Villase\'f1or is the first to admit that her life isn't that of a normal teenager. She has been photographed with Leonardo DiCaprio and she stood on stage next to Jane Fonda at Glamour's 2019 Women of the Year Awards. On Wednesday, she gave a speech in front of Mark Ruffalo and former Vice President Al Gore at the TED World Theatre in New York City. Over the next few days, she'll be at COP25 in Madrid. Thunberg will be in Spain, too - she arrived in Lisbon via sailboat on Tuesday, since she refuses to fly because of airplanes' high greenhouse-gas emissions. Dian Lofton (TED) ""I do look at my own habits,"" she said. ""But the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions come from 100 companies all around the world."" For both of these young activists, and others like them, attracting international attention has been a key part of their strategy. But it has also landed the teens in stressful situations.\~ In September, HYPERLINK https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/politics/trump-greta-thunberg-climate-change-trnd/index.html President Donald Trump mocked Thunberg on Twitter after she shed tears during a speech at the UN General Assembly. Thunberg also \~ HYPERLINK https://www.insider.com/greta-thunberg-sister-suffering-abuse-climate-change-campaign-2019-10 said her sister , Beata, has experienced ""systematic bullying, hatred, and harassment"" online.\~ Villase\'f1or said she has been a topic of conversation on the right-wing news site Breitbart, where she received death threats in the comments section. The threats were so disturbing, she said, that Breitbart temporarily disabled its comments and purged some of the posts. But more vitriolic remarks sprung up after, Villase\'f1or added.\~ After receiving those threats, she said she felt the need to surround herself with more adults at protests. ""We make sure there are peacekeepers and marshals - people who can really watch the surroundings,"" she said. But overall, Villase\'f1or added, the criticism motivates her.\~\~ ""Whenever I see a climate denier or a troll, I find it a good sign,"" she said. ""It just shows how threatened they are."" Villase\'f1or said she is motivated by anger\~ Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Villase\'f1or founded a group called Earth Uprising for young climate activists, and said the teens generally coordinate their efforts through social channels like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Slack. Facebook, she noted, is less common. ""I mean, what's Facebook?"" she said teasingly. ""I don't really use that one that much."" Villase\'f1or said she and her fellow activists communicated a lot about their excitement surrounding Thunberg's visit to New York in September. ""We were just ecstatic,"" she said. ""It was amazing that she was coming here because she had inspired us in the first place to go out and take action."" But ecstasy is in rare supply during her protests and strikes. Instead, Villase\'f1or said, she's motivated by anger, grief, and frustration.\~\~ ""Behind every protest there is a layer of anger,"" she said. ""In the future, school won't matter anymore because we'll be too busy running from the next wildfire or hurricane.""
